SATIVUS
TECH CORP. (formerly SEEDO CORP.) (the Company , Our or We was formed on January 16, 2015,
under the laws of the State of Delaware. Prior to July 2020, we were involved in producing a plant growing device managed and controlled
by an artificial intelligent algorithm, allowing consumers to grow their own herbs and vegetables effortlessly from seed to plant, while
providing optimal conditions to assure premium quality produce year-round. However, due to financial and operational difficulties and
during 2020, we ceased these operations and on July 19, 2020, the Company formed a new wholly-owned subsidiary in Israel, Hachevra Legiduley
Pkaot Beisrael Ltd. (the New Subsidiary ), to develop a fully automated and remotely managed system for growing saffron
and other vegetables. On November 5, 2020, the New Subsidiary changed its name to Saffron-Tech Ltd. (or Saffron Tech ).
As of the date of this report, and following various financings in Saffron Tech, the Company owns 54 of Saffron Tech. 

The
Company, through Saffron Tech, is focusing on its in-house research and development of agriculture technology products, among others,
in the fields of exotic plants and mushrooms. Saffron Tech plans to roll out its proof of concept in the coming months. This technology
is designed to provide turnkey automated growing containers for high-quality, high-yield saffron all year round. The Company is
in advanced stages of developing and testing a fully automated and remotely managed system for growing high-quality, high-yield saffron
anywhere and anytime. 

Saffron
is used in many industries, such as the food industry, particularly by famous chefs and Michelin starred restaurants, the natural cosmetics
industry and the food supplements industry and as a dye in the textile industry. Medicinal claims as an anti-depressant, antioxidant,
and antiseptic are constantly increasing. 

The
global saffron market size was valued at 1 Billion in 2019 and is anticipated to attain a revenue based CAGR of 7.3 from
2020 to 2027. The market is expected to grow over the next few years on account of demand from the pharmaceutical sector, particularly
in countries with rapid population expansion. 

Saffron
Tech is focusing on its in-house research and development of agriculture technology products. Saffron Tech developed a growth protocol
and supporting technology, allowing indoor Saffron cultivation, producing high-quality, high-yield saffron multiple times a year. 

In
April 2022, Saffron Tech announced its new state-of-the-art indoor research and development center is operational. From April 2022, through
to December 2022, Saffron Tech successfully completed three Saffron cultivation cycles using vertical farming technology, while traditional
agriculture only produces one harvest of saffron per year. 

On
December 9, 2021, we implemented a 1-for-10 consolidation, or reverse split, of our issued and outstanding common shares. Except where
otherwise indicated, all share and per share data in this 10-K have been retroactively restated to reflect the reverse stock split. 

On

appointment of Tal Wilk-Glazer as the CEO of Saffron Tech. Wilk-Glazer joins Saffron-Tech after finishing her job at Salesforce as Salesforce s
Industries Eastern Europe, Africa and Israel regional director.

the Golan Heights, in Norther Israel. The plantation is being managed in conjunction with the Shamir Research Institute, which operates
under the auspices of the Haifa University, Israel.

On
August 30, 2022, Saffron Tech, announced its intention to raise up to 5 million New Israeli Shekels NIS (approximately
 1.5 million) at a pre-money valuation of NIS 32.5 million (approximately 10 million) through the Israeli crowdfunding platform 
Pipelbiz 2022 Crowd Funding Round ). Assuming the maximum amount is raised, the Company will own approximately 61 of the
Saffron Tech. The 2022 Crowd Funding Round was closed on December 1, 2022, having raised 3.8 million NIS (approximately 1.3 million).
Fund raising expenses accumulated to 152 and the net amount raised through Pipelbiz was 1.15 million. Saffron Tech also raised 1.15
million NIS (approximately 328 thousand) through the issuance of SAFEs. The SAFEs are convertible at a 20 discount to the current crowd
funding round. Sativus Tech s interest in Saffron Tech now totals 67.5 post-raise. All SAFEs were converted before December 31,
2022. Saffron Tech continued to raise funds through Pipelbiz under the same pre-money valuation during December 2022 through to January
2023, via another crowd funding round 2023 Crowd Funding Round which closed on February 5, 2023, having raised another
1.1 million NIS (approximately 314 thousand). 

On
March 1, 2023, Saffron Tech entered into an investment agreement with Korean-based company, Dreamtech Co Ltd Dreamtech ), a
leading provider and manufacturer of tech components for innovative products including advanced mobile and medical devices. Under this
new agreement, Dreamtech will fund an initial investment of 1 million followed by an additional 1 million upon a successful cultivation
of saffron in Korea. Saffron Tech aims to be the first company to create a large-scale production of saffron using vertical farming technology
to meet the growing demand of the spice for use in beauty, wellness, and pharmaceutical applications. The Company s interest in
Saffron Tech now totals 54 post-raise.

by law and such right to indemnification will continue as to a person who has ceased to be a director or officer of the Company and will
inure to the benefit of his or her heirs, executors and Consultants; provided, however, that, except for proceedings to enforce rights
to indemnification, the Company will not be obligated to indemnify any director or officer in connection with a proceeding (or part thereof)
initiated by such person unless such proceeding (or part thereof) was authorized by the Board of Directors. The right to indemnification

Penny
Stock Regulation 

Our
shares must comply with the Penny Stock Reform Act of 1990, which may potentially decrease our shareholders ability to easily
transfer their shares. Broker-dealer practices in connection with transactions in penny stocks are regulated. Penny stocks
generally are equity securities with a price of less than 5.00. The penny stock rules require a broker-dealer, prior to a transaction
in a penny stock not otherwise exempt from the rules, to deliver a standardized risk disclosure document that provides information about
penny stocks and the risks in the penny stock market. The broker-dealer also must provide the customer with current bid and offer quotations
for the penny stock, the compensation of the broker-dealer and its salesperson in the transaction, and monthly account statements showing
the market value of each penny stock held in the customer s account. In addition, the penny stock rules generally require that
prior to a transaction in a penny stock, the broker-dealer make a special written determination that the penny stock is a suitable investment
for the purchaser and receive the purchaser s written agreement to the transaction. These disclosure requirements may have the
effect of reducing the level of trading activity in the secondary market for a stock that must comply with the penny stock rules. Since
our shares must comply with such penny stock rules, our shareholders will in all likelihood find it more difficult to sell their securities.

Executive
Overview 

SATIVUS
TECH CORP. (formerly SEEDO CORP.) (the Company , Our or We was formed on January 16, 2015,
under the laws of the State of Delaware. Prior to July 2020, we were involved in producing a plant growing device managed and controlled
by an artificial intelligence algorithm, allowing consumers to grow their own herbs and vegetables effortlessly from seed to plant, while
providing optimal conditions to assure premium quality produce year-round. However, due to financial and operational difficulties in
2020, we ceased these operations and on July 19, 2020, the Company formed a new wholly-owned subsidiary in Israel, Hachevra Legiduley
Pkaot Beisrael Ltd. (the New Subsidiary ), to develop a fully automated and remotely managed system for growing saffron
and other vegetables. On November 5, 2020, the New Subsidiary changed its name to Saffron-Tech Ltd. (or Saffron Tech ).
As of the date of this report, and following various financings in Saffron Tech, the Company owns 54 of Saffron Tech. 

The
Company, through Saffron Tech, is focusing on its in-house research and development of agriculture cultivation protocol and
technology products, among others, in the fields of exotic plants and mushrooms. Saffron Tech plans to roll out commercial
cultivation pilot site in the coming year. This technology is designed to provide automated indoor cultivation farm for
high-quality, high-yield saffron all year round. The Company developed a Saffron indoor cultivation protocol allowing 4
cultivation cycles a year, and a R D center. 

6 

It
is also environmentally friendly, using economic levels of water, space, and fertilizer. The sealed environment eliminates the need for
harmful pesticides and herbicides, producing a clean and safe product that is easy to control from anywhere. The Company s solution
is easily scalable. 

Saffron
is used in many industries, such as the food industry, particularly by famous chefs and Michelin starred restaurants, the natural cosmetics
industry, the food supplements industry, and as a dye in the textile industry. Medicinal claims as an anti-depressant, antioxidant, and
antiseptic are constantly increasing. 

The
global saffron market size was valued at 1 Billion in 2019 and is anticipated to attain a revenue based CAGR of 7.3 from
2020 to 2027. The market is expected to grow over the next few years on account of demand from the pharmaceutical sector. 

Saffron
Tech is focusing on its in-house research and development of agriculture technology products. Saffron Tech developed a growth protocol
and supporting technology, allowing indoor Saffron cultivation, producing high-quality, high-yield saffron multiple times a year.

at its initial location in Ganot, Israel. The Company s mission with this new facility, located at Mavki im, Israel, is to
complete the cultivation protocol, and prove it s ability to produce 4 flowering cycles a year. Traditional agriculture only produces
one harvest of saffron per year through a labor-intensive process. 

On
December 9, 2021, FINRA gave final approval for the Company s 1-for-10 consolidation, or reverse split, of our issued and outstanding

 1.5 million) at a pre-money valuation of NIS 32.5 million (approximately 10 million) through the Israeli crowdfunding platform

Liquidity
and Capital Resources 

Overview 

Since inception on January 16, 2015, the Company had a cumulative deficit
as of December 31, 2022, of 22,604 thousand and we have a working capital deficit of 2,569 thousand as of December 31, 2022. Our future
growth is dependent upon achieving further purchase orders and execution, management of operating expenses and ability of the Company
to obtain the necessary financing to fund future obligations, and upon profitable operations. Those factors raise substantial doubt about
the Company s ability to continue as a going concern. The ability to continue as a going concern is dependent upon the Company obtaining
the necessary financing to meet its obligations and repay its liabilities arising from normal business operations when they become due. 

Historically,
we have financed our cash flow and operations from the initial contribution of our majority shareholder and by raising equity, convertible
loans and warrants. As of December 31, 2022, our cash balance was 810 thousand. 

During November and December 2020 and January 2021, the Company continued
to raise funds to support its operations and received 955 thousand from third party investors and issued convertible promissory notes
in respect thereof Promissory Notes ). The Promissory Notes bear no interest, are convertible into Shares based on a fixed
conversion price of 1.00 per share and mature between 12 and 24 months from the issuance date. As of December 31, 2022, Promissory Notes
in the amount of 830,000 have been converted into shares and amount of 100,000 were repaid to the investors.

Critical
Accounting Policies 

Our
discussion and analysis of the financial condition and results of operations are based upon the Company s financial statements,
which have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States GAAP ). The preparation
of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues
and expenses, and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. We believe that the estimates, assumptions and judgments involved
in the accounting policies described below have the greatest potential impact on our financial statements, so we consider these to be
our critical accounting policies. Because of the uncertainty inherent in these matters, actual results could differ from the estimates
we use in applying the critical accounting policies. Certain of these critical accounting policies are fair value of convertible loans,
and the calculation of share-based compensation and going concern. 

Within
the context of these critical accounting policies, we are not currently aware of any reasonably likely events or circumstances that would
result in materially different amounts being reported.

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING
FIRM 

To the Board of Directors and Stockholders of
Sativus Tech Corp. 

Opinion on the Financial Statements 

We have audited the accompanying the balance sheets
of Sativus Tech Corp. the Company as of December 31, 2022 and the related statements of operations, changes in stockholders 
deficit and cash flows, for the year then ended, and the related notes and schedules (collectively referred to as the financial
statements ). In our opinion, the financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company
as of December 31, 2022, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for the year ended December 31, 2022, in conformity with
generally accepted accounting principles in the United States of America. 

Basis for Opinion 

These financial statements are the responsibility
of the Company s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company s financial statements based on our audits. We
are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) PCAOB and are
required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and
regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. 

We conducted our audits in accordance with the
standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial
statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. The company is not required to have, nor were we engaged
to perform, an audit of its internal control over financial reporting. As part of our audits, we are required to obtain an understanding
of internal control over financial reporting but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Company s internal
control over financial reporting. Accordingly, we express no such opinion. 

Our audits included performing procedures to assess
the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond
to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements.
Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating
the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion. 

Going Concern 

The accompanying financial statements have been
prepared to assume that the Company will continue as a going concern. As discussed in Note 1 to the financial statements, as of December
31, 2022, The Company suffered losses from operations in all years since inception, has a negative working capital and further losses
are anticipated in the development of its business. These and other factors raise substantial doubt about the Company s ability
to continue as a going concern. Management s plan regarding these matters is also described in Note 1 to the financial statements.
The financial statements do not include any adjustments that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty. This matter is also described
in the Critical Audit Matters section of our report. 

F- 2 

Critical Audit Matters 

The critical audit matters communicated below
are matters arising from the current period audit of the financial statements that were communicated or required to be communicated to
the audit committee and that: (1) relate to accounts or disclosures that are material to the financial statements and (2) involved our
especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion
on the financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matters below, providing separate opinions
on the critical audit matters or on the accounts or disclosures to which they relate. 

Going concern- refer to note 1 of the financial
statements 

Critical audit matter description 

The Company raised substantial doubt about the
entity s ability to continue as a going concern for a reasonable period of time. The financial statements for the years under audit have
been prepared to assume that the Company will continue as a going concern, which contemplates the realization of assets and satisfaction
of liabilities in the normal course of business. See the explanatory paragraph of the opinion paragraph. 

How the Critical Audit Matter was addressed in
our Audit 

The primary procedures we performed to address
this critical audit matter included the following: (i) We evaluate whether there is substantial doubt about the entity s ability to continue
as a going concern for a reasonable period of time. (ii) We obtained information about management s plans that are intended to mitigate
the effect of such conditions or events and assess the likelihood that such plans can be effectively implemented. (iii) We added an explanatory
paragraph to the audit report. 

Evaluation of convertible debt with an embedded
derivative liability and detachable warrants 

Critical audit matter description 

As discussed in Notes 2 and 3 to the financial
statements, upon initial recognition of Convertible loans, Convertible Notes, similar instruments issued with or without detachable warrants,
the Company considers whether the embedded feature within the convertible instruments should be separated from the host instrument and
the manner of its presentation and future measurement and weather warrants granted by the Company to lenders through convertible bridge
loans and stock warrants transactions should be classified as a component of permanent equity or as derivative liabilities. The Company
utilized a Monte Carlo model to value the derivative bifurcated liabilities, which estimates the fair value of the liabilities based upon
certain assumptions utilizing a probability-weighted analysis of certain future events. Other inputs into the model include volatility,
closing stock prices at various valuation points, and conversion prices as determined by the applicable agreements. 

We identified the fair value of the derivative
liability as a critical audit matter, as (i) the assumptions utilized in the model to value the derivative liability required judgment,
and the model is inherently complex. (ii) the accounting for derivative liabilities is complex (iii) the magnitude of the liabilities
and losses recognized in the estimation process. 

How the Critical Audit Matter was addressed in our Audit 

The primary procedures we performed to address
this critical audit matter involved the assistance of our valuation specialist and included the following: (i) we reviewed the qualifications
of the valuation specialist utilized by the Company (ii) we audited the underlying inputs utilized by the valuation specialist in the
model (iii) we evaluated the reasonableness of management s assumptions included in the model (iv) we reviewed the underlying source
documents to determine the proper accounting of the transactions (v) we tested the accuracy of those underlying calculations.

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING
FIRM 

TO THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS AND STOCKHOLDERS OF 

SATIVUS TECH CORP. 

Opinion on the Financial Statements 

We have audited the accompanying balance sheet
of Sativus Tech Corp. (the Company as of December 31, 2021 and the related statements of operations and comprehensive loss,
changes in stockholders deficit and cash flows for the year in the period ended December 31, 2021, and the related notes (collectively
referred to as the financial statements ). In our opinion, the financial statements present fairly, in all material respects,
the financial position of the Company as of December 31, 2021, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for the year in the
period ended December 31, 2021, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. 

Going Concern 

The accompanying financial statements have been
prepared assuming that the Company will continue as a going concern. As discussed in Note 1B to the financial statements, the Company
has not yet generated material revenues from its operations to fund its activities and is therefore dependent upon external sources for
financing its operations. As of December 31, 2021, the Company has incurred accumulated deficit of 21,118 thousands and negative operating
cash flows. These factor among others, as discussed in Note 1B to the financial statements raise substantial doubt about the Company s
ability to continue as a going concern. Management s plans concerning these matters are also described in Note 1B to the financial
statements. The financial statements do not include any adjustments that might result from the outcome of these uncertainties.
This matter is also described in the Critical Audit Matters section of our report.

These financial statements are the responsibility
of the Company s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company s financial statements based on our
audit. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB) and are
required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and
regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. 

We conducted our audit in accordance with the
standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial
statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. The Company is not required to have, nor were we engaged
to perform, an audit of its internal control over financial reporting. As part of our audit, we are required to obtain an understanding
of internal control over financial reporting but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Company s
internal control over financial reporting. Accordingly, we express no such opinion. 

Our audit included performing procedures to assess
the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond
to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements.
Our audit also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating
the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.

Evaluation of convertible debt with an embedded
derivative liability and detachable warrants 

Description of the Matter 

As discussed in Notes 2 and 3 to the financial
statements, upon initial recognition of Convertible loans, Convertible Notes and similar instruments issued with or without detachable
warrants, the Company considers whether the embedded feature within the convertible instruments should be separated from the host instrument
and the manner of its presentation and future measurement and weather warrants granted by the Company to lenders through convertible bridge
loans and stock warrants transactions should be classified as a component of permanent equity or as derivative liabilities. The Company
utilized a Monte Carlo model to value the derivative bifurcated liabilities, which estimates the fair value of the liabilities based upon
certain assumptions utilizing a probability weighted analysis of certain future events. Other inputs into the model include, volatility,
closing stock prices at various valuation points, and conversion prices as determined by the applicable agreements. 

We identified the fair value of the derivative
liability as a critical audit matter, as (i) the assumptions utilized in the model to value the derivative liability required judgement,
and the model is inherently complex. (ii) the accounting for derivative liabilities is complex (iii) the magnitude of the liabilities
and losses recognized in the estimation process. 

How We Addressed the Matter in Our Audit 

The primary procedures we performed to address
this critical audit matter involved the assistance of our valuation specialist and included the following: (i) we reviewed the qualifications
of the valuation specialist utilized by the Company (ii) we audited the underlying inputs utilized by the valuation specialist in the
model (iii) we evaluated the reasonableness of management s assumptions included in the model (iv) we reviewed the underlying source
documents to determine the proper accounting of the transactions (v) we tested the accuracy of those underlying calculations.

and 15d-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (Exchange Act) as of December 31, 2022. Disclosure controls and procedures are
designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in reports filed or submitted under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed,
summarized and reported within the time periods specified, and that such information is accumulated and communicated to management, including
the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. 

During evaluation of disclosure controls and procedures
as of December 31, 2022, conducted as part of our annual audit and preparation of our annual financial statements, management conducted
an evaluation of the effectiveness of the design and operations of our disclosure controls and procedures and concluded that our disclosure
controls and procedures were not effective. 

Management s Report on Internal Control
over Financial Reporting 

Management is responsible for the preparation
and fair presentation of the financial statements included in this annual report. The financial statements have been prepared in conformity
with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America and reflect management s judgment and estimates concerning
effects of events and transactions that are accounted for or disclosed. 

Management is also responsible for establishing
and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting. Our internal control over financial reporting includes those policies
and procedures that pertain to our ability to record, process, summarize and report reliable data. Management recognizes that there are
inherent limitations in the effectiveness of any internal control over financial reporting, including the possibility of human error and
the circumvention or overriding of internal control. Accordingly, even effective internal control over financial reporting can provide
only reasonable assurance with respect to financial statement presentation. Further, because of changes in conditions, the effectiveness
of internal control over financial reporting may vary over time. 

In order to ensure that our internal control over
financial reporting is effective, management regularly assesses controls and did so most recently for its financial reporting as of December
31, 2022. 

A material weakness is a deficiency, or a combination
of deficiencies, in internal control over financial reporting such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement
of the Company s annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis. 

11 

The material weaknesses identified are described
below. 

Procedures for Control Evaluation. 
Management has not established with appropriate rigor the procedures for evaluating internal controls over financial reporting. Due to
limited resources and lack of segregation of duties, documentation of the limited control structure has not been accomplished. 

Lack of Audit Committee. To date,
the Company has not established an Audit Committee. It is management s view that such a committee, including a financial expert,
is an utmost important entity level control over the financial reporting process. 

Insufficient Documentation of Review Procedures
 We employ policies and procedures for reconciliation of the financial statements and note disclosures. 

Insufficient Information Technology Procedures. 
Management has not established methodical and consistent data back-up procedures to ensure loss of data will not occur. 

As a result of the management evaluation of company
internal control over financial reporting described above, the Company s management has concluded that, as of December 31, 2022,
the Company s internal control over financial reporting was not based on the criteria in Internal Control Integrated Framework
issued by COSO. 

This Annual Report does not include an attestation
report of our independent registered public accounting firm regarding internal control over financial reporting. We were not required
to have, nor have we, engaged our independent registered public accounting firm to perform an audit of internal control over financial
reporting pursuant to the rules of the Securities and Exchange Commission that permit us to provide only management s report in
this Annual Report. 

Changes in Internal Control Over Financial
Reporting 

As of the end of the period covered by this report,
there have been no changes in internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rule 13a-15(f) of the Exchange Act) during the
year ended December 31, 2022, that materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, the Company s internal control
over financial reporting.

Tal Wilk-Glazer ,
49, became CEO of Sativus Tech s subsidiary, Saffron Tech, in December 2021. In that short amount of time, she successfully established
the company s first operating R D facility in southern Israel. On April 4, 2022, the Company announced the appointment of Mrs.
Tal Wilk-Glazer to its Board of Directors and as CEO of the Company. 

Board of Directors 

The minimum number of directors we are authorized
to have is one, and although we anticipate appointing additional directors in the near future, as of the date hereof we have one director.
Directors on our Board of Directors are elected for one-year terms and serve until the next annual security holders meeting or
until their death, resignation, retirement, removal, disqualification, or until a successor has been elected and qualified. All officers
are appointed annually by the Board of Directors and serve at the discretion of the Board. Currently, directors receive no compensation
for their services on our Board. During the next year we intend to strengthen our Board of Directors by expanding it and recruiting world
class Key Members. 

13 

Committees of the Board 

All proceedings of the board of directors for
the fiscal year ended December 31, 2022, were conducted by resolutions consented to in writing by our board of directors and filed with
the minutes of the proceedings of our board of directors. Our company currently does not have nominating, compensation or audit committees
or committees performing similar functions nor does our company have a written nominating, compensation or audit committee charter. Our
board of directors does not believe that it is necessary to have such committees because it believes that the functions of such committees
can be adequately performed by the board of directors. 

The Company does not have any defined policy or
procedure requirements for shareholders to submit recommendations or nominations for directors. The Company s board of directors
believes that, given the stage of our development, a specific nominating policy would be premature and of little assistance until our
business operations develop to a more advanced level. The Company does not currently have any specific or minimum criteria for the election
of nominees to the board of directors and we do not have any specific process or procedure for evaluating such nominees. The board of
directors will assess all candidates, whether submitted by management or shareholders, and make recommendations for election or appointment. 

A shareholder who wishes to communicate with the
Company s board of directors may do so by directing a written request addressed to any of our directors at the address appearing
on the first page of this registration statement. 

Audit Committee Financial Expert 

We do not have a standing audit committee. Our
directors perform the functions usually designated to an audit committee. Our board of directors has determined that we do not have a
board member that qualifies as an audit committee financial expert as defined in Item 407(d)(5) of Regulation S-K, nor do
we have a board member that qualifies as independent as the term is used in Item 7(d)(3)(iv)(B) of Schedule 14A under the
Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, and as defined by Rule 4200(a)(14) of the NASD Rules. 

We believe that our board of directors is capable
of analyzing and evaluating our financial statements and understanding internal controls and procedures for financial reporting. Our board
of directors does not believe that it is necessary to have an audit committee because management believes that the functions of an audit
committees can be adequately performed by the board of directors. In addition, we believe that retaining an independent director who would
qualify as an audit committee financial expert would be overly costly and burdensome and is not warranted in our circumstances
given the stage of our development and the fact that we have not generated positive cash flow to date. 

As we generate revenue in the future, we intend
to form a standing audit committee and identify and appoint a financial expert to serve on our audit committee. 

Code of Ethics 

The Company has adopted a Code of Ethics for Senior
Financial Officers that is applicable to our principal executive officer, principal financial officer, principal accounting officer or
controller, or persons performing similar functions. 

Indemnification 

Under our Articles of Incorporation and Bylaws
of the corporation, we may indemnify an officer or director who is made a party to any proceeding, including a law suit, because of his
position, if he acted in good faith and in a manner he reasonably believed to be in our best interest. We may advance expenses incurred
in defending a proceeding. To the extent that the officer or director is successful on the merits in a proceeding as to which he is to
be indemnified, we must indemnify him against all expenses incurred, including attorney s fees. With respect to a derivative action,
indemnity may be made only for expenses actually and reasonably incurred in defending the proceeding, and if the officer or director is
judged liable, only by a court order. The indemnification is intended to be to the fullest extent permitted by the laws of the State of
Delaware. 

Regarding indemnification for liabilities arising
under the Securities Act of 1933, which may be permitted to directors or officers under Delaware law, we have been advised that, in the
opinion of the Securities and Exchange Commission, indemnification is against public policy, as expressed in the Act and is, therefore,
unenforceable. 

14 

Family Relationships 

No family relationship exists between any director,
executive officer, or any person contemplated to become such. 

Director Independence 

We currently do not have any independent directors
serving on our board of directors. 

Possible Potential Conflicts 

The OTCBB where our stock is quoted does not currently
have any director independence requirements. 

No member of the Board of Directors will be required
by us to work on a full-time basis. Accordingly, certain conflicts of interest may arise between us and our director(s) in that they may
have other business interests in the future to which they devote their attention, and they may be expected to continue to do so although
Directors time must also be devoted to our business. As a result, conflicts of interest may arise that can be resolved only through
their exercise of such judgment as is consistent with each officer s understanding of his/her fiduciary duties to us. 

Currently we have two, and will seek to add additional
officer(s) and/or director(s) as and when the proper personnel are located and terms of employment are mutually negotiated and agreed,
and we have sufficient capital resources and cash flow to make such offers. 

We cannot provide assurances that our efforts
to eliminate the potential impact of conflicts of interest will be effective. 

Involvement in Certain Legal Proceedings 

None of our directors or executive officers has,
during the past ten years: 

has had any bankruptcy petition filed by or against any business of which he was a general partner or executive officer, either at the time of the bankruptcy or within two years prior to that time; 

been convicted in a criminal proceeding or been subject to a pending criminal proceeding (excluding traffic violations and other minor offences); 

been subject to any order, judgment, or decree, not subsequently reversed, suspended or vacated, of any court of competent jurisdiction, permanently or temporarily enjoining, barring, suspending or otherwise limiting his involvement in any type of business, securities, futures, commodities or banking activities; 

been found by a court of competent jurisdiction (in a civil action), the Securities and Exchange Commission or the Commodity Futures Trading Commission to have violated a federal or state securities or commodities law, and the judgment has not been reversed, suspended, or vacated; 

been subject or a party to or any other disclosable event required by Item 401(f) of Regulation S-K.
