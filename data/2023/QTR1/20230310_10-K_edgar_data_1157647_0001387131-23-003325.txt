market areas include all of Hampden County and Hampshire County in western Massachusetts and Hartford and Tolland Counties in
northern Connecticut. The Bank operates twenty-five banking offices in Agawam, Chicopee, Feeding Hills, East Longmeadow, Holyoke,

at www.westfieldbank.com. 

The
markets served by our branches are primarily suburban markets located in western Massachusetts and in northern Connecticut. Westfield,
Massachusetts, is located near the intersection of U.S. Interstates 90 (the Massachusetts Turnpike) and 91. Our middle market
and commercial real estate lending team is located in Springfield, the Pioneer Valley s primary urban market. The Pioneer
Valley of western Massachusetts encompasses the sixth largest metropolitan area in New England. The Springfield Metropolitan area
covers a relatively diverse area ranging from densely populated urban areas, such as Springfield, to outlying rural areas. Our
Financial Services Center in West Hartford serves as our Connecticut hub, housing employees across all commercial and retail lines
of business. Our markets fall within New England s Knowledge Corridor, an interstate partnership of regional economic development,
planning, business, tourism and educational institutions that work together to advance the region s economic progress. 

A
diversified mix of industry groups are concentrated in western Massachusetts and northern Connecticut, including manufacturing,
health care, higher education, wholesale and retail trade and service. The economies of our primary markets have benefited from
the presence of large employers such as Baystate Medical Center, Big Y World Class Markets, Center for Human Development, Holyoke
Medical Center, MassMutual Financial Group, Mercy Medical Center/Trinity Health of New England, Mestek, Inc., MGM Springfield,
Verizon and Westover Air Reserve Base in Massachusetts, and Aetna, Inc., Air National Guard, Collins Aerospace, Connecticut Children s
Medical Center, Hartford Financial Services Group, Hartford Hospital, Kaman Aerospace Corporation, Lego Systems Inc., Stanadyne
LLC, Talcott Resolution Life Insurance Company and Travelers Indemnity Company in Connecticut. Other employment and economic activity
is provided by financial institutions, colleges and universities, hospitals, and a variety of wholesale and retail trade business.
Our Hampden County market also enjoys a strong tourism business with attractions such as the Eastern States Exposition, which
operates The Big E, the largest fair in the northeast, the Basketball Hall of Fame, MGM Springfield and Six Flags New England. 

Competition. 

The
Bank faces significant competition to attract and retain customers within existing and neighboring geographic markets. This competition
stems from national and larger regional banks, numerous local savings banks, commercial banks, cooperative banks and credit unions
which have a large presence in the region. Competition for loans, deposits and cash management services, and investment advisory
assets also comes from other businesses that provide financial services, including consumer finance companies, mortgage brokers
and lenders, private lenders, insurance companies, securities brokerage firms, institutional mutual funds, registered investment
advisors, non-bank electronic payment and funding channels, internet-based banks and other financial intermediaries. 

We
expect competition to increase in the future as a result of legislative, regulatory and technological changes and the continuing
trend of consolidation in the financial services industry. Technological advances, for example, have lowered the barriers to market
entry, allowed banks and other lenders to expand their geographic reach by providing services over the internet and made it possible
for non-depository institutions to offer products and services that traditionally have been provided by banks. Changes in federal
laws permit affiliation among banks, securities firms and insurance companies, which promotes a competitive environment in the
financial services industry. 

5 

At
June 30, 2022, which is the most recent date for which data is available from the FDIC, we held approximately 13.7 of the deposits
in Hampden County, which was the second largest market share out of the 16 banks and thrifts with offices in Hampden County. 

Human
Capital. 

Diversity,
Equity and Inclusion 

We
understand that our human capital is the most valuable asset we have and we are committed to fostering, cultivating and preserving
a culture of diversity, equity and inclusion. The Company strives to create an intentionally inclusive, diverse and thriving workplace
where each person feels valued, respected and understood as well as a respectful, productive environment where everyone is encouraged
to achieve their full potential. At December 31, 2022, our employees were representative of our commitment to recruit, develop,
and retain diverse individuals, wherein approximately 66 of our employees were women and 18 of our employees were ethnic minorities,
veterans or persons with disabilities. We remain focused on bolstering our workforce through inclusive hiring and retention practices,
which we feel reflects and better serves our communities. 

Talent
Management 

We
have been successful in attracting, developing and retaining qualified and competent staff. The Company believes that it has had
and continues to have good employee relations. Our talent management strategy ensures we leverage the talent needed, not just
for today, but also for our future. Our employees are the foundation of our success and are responsible for upholding our guiding
principles of integrity, trust, empathy, collaboration, strong work ethic, loyalty, inclusion and a professional and positive
attitude. 

As
of December 31, 2022, the Bank employed 337 total employees, with 289 employed full-time and 48 employed part-time. Employee retention
helps the Company operate efficiently and effectively. 

There
are many factors that contribute to the success of the Company. We actively encourage and support the growth and development of our
employees. Whenever practical, Management generally seeks to fill positions by promotion and transfer opportunities from within the
organization. Career development is advanced through ongoing mentoring and professional development programs, as well as internally
and externally developed training programs. In 2021, a customized Corporate Leadership Development Program was established for the
Company. During 2022, fifty employees were nominated to participate in the program and successfully completed the program. In
addition, the Company offers educational reimbursement programs to employees enrolled in pre-approved degree or certification
programs at accredited institutions that teach skills or knowledge relevant to the financial services industry. Each year, we also
attract rising juniors and seniors from colleges and universities across our footprint who have the opportunity to be assigned an
internship within the Company and have the potential to be hired upon graduation. 

Employee
Compensation and Benefits 

Management
promotes its core values through prioritizing concern for employees well-being, supporting employees career goals,
offering competitive wages, and providing valuable fringe benefits. The Company maintains a comprehensive employee benefit program
providing, among other benefits, group medical, dental and vision insurance, life insurance and disability insurance, a 401(k)
Safe Harbor Plan, an employee stock ownership plan ESOP ), short-term and long-term incentive programs, paid time off
including vacation days, personal days and paid holidays. 

Workplace
Health and Safety 

The
safety, health and wellness of our employees is considered a top priority. On an ongoing basis, the Company promotes the health
and wellness of its employees and strives to keep the employee portion of health care premiums competitive with local competition.
We communicate to our employees on a monthly basis through email and the Company s intranet, sharing articles and best practices
on mental, emotional and physical well-being, health savings account and flexible spending account use, resources to find cheaper
prescriptions and other related topics. Our employees also have access to a platform that gives them access to interactive activities
for wellness classes, stress management, mindfulness, healthy eating and health plan literacy. All employees are working in person;
however, when they experience signs or symptoms of a possible COVID-19 illness, they have been asked not to come to work and test
for COVID-19 as necessary. We follow the Center for Disease Control guidance as to when employees may return to in-person work.

Lending
Activities. 

General .
 The Company s loan portfolio totaled 2.0 billion, or 78.0 of total assets, at December 31, 2022, compared to 1.9
billion, or 73.5 of total assets, at December 31, 2021. The Company lends to individuals, business entities, non-profit organizations
and professional practices. The Company s primary lending focus is on the development of high quality commercial relationships
achieved through active business development efforts, long-term relationships with established commercial developers, community
involvement, and focused marketing strategies. Loans made to businesses, non-profits, and professional practices may include commercial
mortgage loans, construction and land development loans, commercial and industrial loans, including lines of credit and letters
of credit. Loans made to individuals may include conventional residential mortgage loans, home equity loans and lines, residential
construction loans on owner-occupied primary and secondary residences, and secured and unsecured personal loans and lines of credit.
The Company manages its loan portfolio to avoid concentration by industry, relationship size, and source of repayment to lessen
its credit risk exposure. 

Interest
rates on loans may be fixed or variable and variable rate loans may have fixed initial periods before periodic rate adjustments
begin. Individual rates offered are dependent on the associated degree of credit risk, term, underwriting and servicing costs,
loan amount, and the extent of other banking relationships maintained with the borrower, and may be subject to interest rate floors.
Rates are also subject to competitive pressures, the current interest rate environment, availability of funds, and government
regulations. 

The
Company employs a seasoned commercial lending staff, with commercial lenders supporting the Company s loan growth strategy.
The Company contracts with an external loan review company to review the internal credit ratings assigned to loans in the commercial
loan portfolio on a pre-determined schedule, based on the type, size, rating, and overall risk of the loan. During the course
of their review, the third party examines a sample of loans, including new loans, existing relationships over certain dollar amounts
and classified assets. The Company s internal residential origination and underwriting staff originate residential loans
and are responsible for compliance with residential lending regulations, consumer protection and internal policy guidelines. The
Company s internal compliance department monitors the residential loan origination activity for regulatory compliance. 

The
Executive Committee of the Company s Board of Directors (the Board approves loan relationships exceeding
certain prescribed dollar limits as outlined in the Company s lending policy. 

At
December 31, 2022, our general regulatory limit on loans to one borrower was 39.7 million. Our largest lending exposure was a
 32.2 million commercial lending relationship, of which 21.1 million was outstanding at December 31, 2022. The relationship is
primarily secured by business assets and commercial real estate located in Agawam, Massachusetts. At December 31, 2022, this relationship
was performing in accordance with its original terms. 

Commercial
Real Estate Loans and Commercial and Industrial Loans . 

At
December 31, 2022, commercial real estate loans totaled 1.1 billion, or 53.8 of total loans, compared to 980.0 million, or
52.6 of total loans, at December 31, 2021. 

The
Company originates commercial real estate loans throughout its market area for the purpose of acquiring, developing, and refinancing
commercial real estate where the property is the primary collateral securing the loan. These loans are typically secured by a
variety of commercial and industrial property types, including one-to-four and multi-family apartment buildings, office, industrial,
or mixed-use facilities, or other commercial properties, and are generally guaranteed by the principals of the borrower. Commercial
real estate loans generally have repayment periods of approximately fifteen to thirty years. Variable interest rate loans in the
commercial real estate loan portfolio have a variety of adjustment terms and underlying interest rate indices, and are generally
fixed for an initial period before periodic rate adjustments begin. 

7 

Commercial
construction loans may include the development of residential housing and condominium projects, the development of commercial
and industrial use property, and loans for the purchase and improvement of raw land. These loans are secured in whole or in part
by underlying real estate collateral and are generally guaranteed by the principals of the borrowers. Construction lenders work
to cultivate long-term relationships with established developers. The Company limits the amount of financing provided to any single
developer for the construction of properties built on a speculative basis. Funds for construction projects are disbursed as pre-specified
stages of construction are completed. Regular site inspections are performed, prior to advancing additional funds, at each construction
phase, either by experienced construction lenders on staff or by independent outside inspection companies. Commercial construction
loans generally are variable rate loans and lines with interest rates that are periodically adjusted and generally have terms
of one to three years. At December 31, 2022 and December 31, 2021, there was 91.7 million and 83.2 million, respectively, in
commercial construction loans included within commercial real estate loans. 

At
December 31, 2022, our total commercial and industrial loan portfolio totaled 219.8 million, or 11.0 of our total loans, with
commercial and industrial loans totaling 217.6 million, or 10.9 of total loans, and Paycheck Protection Program PPP loans totaling 2.2 million, or 0.1 of total loans. At December 31, 2021, our total commercial and industrial loan portfolio
was 226.6 million, or 12.2 of total loans, with commercial and industrial loans totaling 201.3 million, or 10.8 of total loans,
and PPP loans totaling 25.3 million, or 1.4 of total loans. Commercial and industrial loans include seasonal revolving lines
of credit, working capital loans, equipment financing and term loans. Commercial and industrial credits may be unsecured loans
and lines to financially strong borrowers, loans secured in whole or in part by real estate unrelated to the principal purpose
of the loan or secured by inventories, equipment, or receivables, and are generally guaranteed by the principals of the borrower.
Variable rate loans and lines in this portfolio have interest rates that are periodically adjusted, with loans generally having
fixed initial periods. Commercial and industrial loans have average repayment periods of one to seven years. Our commercial and
industrial loan portfolio does not have any significant loan concentration by type of property or borrower. 

The
largest concentration of commercial loans to an industry was to hotels and accommodation, which comprised approximately 6.9 of
the commercial loan portfolio as of December 31, 2022. At December 31, 2022, our largest commercial and industrial loan relationship
was 32.2 million to a hardware merchant wholesaler. The loan relationship is secured by business assets and real estate. At December
31, 2022, this relationship was performing according to its original terms. 

As
a Preferred Lender with the Small Business Administration SBA ), the Company offered PPP loans through the March
27, 2020 2.2 trillion fiscal stimulus bill known as the Coronavirus Aid, Relief and Economic Security Act (the CARES Act launched by the U.S. Department of Treasury Treasury and the SBA. An eligible business was able to apply for a
PPP loan up to the lesser of: (1) 2.5 times its average monthly payroll costs, or (2) 10.0 million. PPP loans have:
(a) an interest rate of 1.0 , (b) a two-year loan term to maturity, subsequently extended to a five-year loan term maturity for
loans granted on or after June 5, 2020 and (c) principal and interest payments deferred from six months to ten months from the
date of disbursement. The SBA will guarantee 100 of the PPP loans made to eligible borrowers. The entire principal amount of
the borrower s PPP loan, including any accrued interest, is eligible to be reduced by the loan forgiveness amount under
the PPP so long as employee and compensation levels of the business are maintained and 60 of the loan proceeds are used for payroll
expenses, with the remaining 40 of the loan proceeds used for other qualifying expenses. PPP loans totaled 2.3 million, or 0.1 
of total loans, at December 31, 2022. 

Letters
of credit are conditional commitments issued by the Company to guarantee the financial obligation or performance of a customer
to a third party. The credit risk involved in issuing letters of credit is essentially the same as that involved in extending
loan facilities to customers. If the letter of credit is drawn upon, a loan is created for the customer, generally a commercial
loan, with the same criteria associated with similar commercial loans. 

8 

The
Company participates with other banks in the financing of certain commercial projects. Participating loans with other institutions
provide banks the opportunity to retain customer relationships and reduce credit risk exposure among each participating bank,
while providing customers with larger credit facilities than the individual bank might be willing or able to offer independently.
In some cases, the Company may act as the lead lender, originating and servicing the loans, but participating out a portion of
the funding to other banks. In other cases, the Company may participate in loans originated by other institutions. In each case,
the participating bank funds a percentage of the loan commitment and takes on the related pro-rata risk. In each case in which
the Company participates in a loan, the rights and obligations of each participating bank are divided proportionately among the
participating banks in an amount equal to their share of ownership and with equal priority among all banks. The Company performs
an independent credit analysis of each commitment and a review of the participating institution prior to participation in the
loan, and an annual review of the borrower thereafter. Loans originated by other banks in which the Company is a participating
institution are carried in the loan portfolio at the Company s pro-rata share of ownership. Loans originated by other banks
in which the Company is a participating institution amounted to 132.6 million at December 31, 2022 and 121.7 million at December
31, 2021. The Company was servicing commercial loans originated by the Company and participated out to various other institutions
totaling 70.5 million and 63.2 million at December 31, 2022 and December 31, 2021, respectively. 

Residential
Real Estate Loans. 

At
December 31, 2022 and December 31, 2021, the residential real estate loan portfolio totaled 589.5 million, or 29.6 of total
loans, and 552.3 million, or 29.6 , of total loans, respectively. The Company originates and funds residential real estate loans,
including first mortgages, home equity loans, and home equity lines, secured by one-to-four family residential properties primarily
located in western Massachusetts and northern Connecticut. The Company processes and underwrites all of its originations internally
through its Residential Loan Center located in Westfield, MA. 

These
residential properties may serve as the borrower s primary residence, or as vacation homes or investment properties. First
mortgages may be underwritten in amounts up to 97 of the lesser of the appraised value or purchase price of the property for
owner-occupied homes, 90 for second homes and 85 for investment properties. Private mortgage insurance is required on all loans
with a loan-to-value ratio greater than 80 . We do not grant subprime loans. In addition, financing is provided for the construction
of owner-occupied primary and secondary residences. Residential mortgage loans may have terms of up to 30 years at either fixed
or adjustable rates of interest. Fixed and adjustable rate residential mortgage loans are generally originated using secondary
market underwriting and documentation standards. Home equity loans and lines are secured by first or second mortgages on one-to-four
family owner-occupied properties. Equity loans and lines are underwritten by a maximum combined loan-to-value of 85 of the appraised
value of the property. Underwriting approval is dependent on review of the borrower s ability to repay and credit history
in accordance with Westfield Bank s policy. The overall health of the economy, including unemployment rates and housing
pricing, will have an effect on the credit quality in this segment. 

Depending
on the current interest rate environment, management may elect to sell those fixed and adjustable rate residential mortgage loans
which are eligible for sale in the secondary market, or hold some or all of this residential loan production for the Company s
portfolio. The Company may retain or sell the servicing when selling the loans. The Company is an approved seller and servicer
with Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac and the FHLB. In order to reduce interest rate risk, during the twelve months ended December 31,
2022 and December 31, 2021, the Company sold 277,000 and 59.7 million of fixed rate, low coupon residential real estate loans
to the secondary market, respectively. At December 31, 2022 and December 31, 2021, the Company serviced 79.3 million and 88.2
million, respectively, in residential loans sold to the secondary market. The servicing rights will likely continue to be retained
on all loans sold over the life of the loan. The largest owner-occupied residential real estate loan was 1.9 million and was
performing according to its original terms as of December 31, 2022. 

Home
Equity Loans. 

At
December 31, 2022 and December 31, 2021, home equity loans totaled 105.6 million, or 5.3 of total loans, and 99.8 million,
or 5.4 of total loans, respectively. The Company originates home equity revolving loans and lines of credit for one-to-four family
residential properties with maximum original loan-to-value ratios generally up to 85 . Home equity lines generally have interest
rates that adjust monthly based on changes in the Wall Street Journal Prime Rate, although minimum rates may be applicable. Some
home equity line rates may be fixed for a period of time and then adjusted monthly thereafter. The payment schedule for home equity
lines require interest only payments for the first ten years of the lines. Generally at the end of ten years, the line may be
frozen to future advances, and principal plus interest payments are collected over a fifteen-year amortization schedule. 

9 

Consumer
Loans. 

At
December 31, 2022 and December 31, 2021, consumer loans totaled 5.0 million, or 0.3 , of total loans and 4.3 million, or 0.2 ,
of total loans, respectively. Consumer loans are generally originated at higher interest rates than residential and commercial
real estate loans, but they also generally tend to have a higher credit risk than residential real estate loans because they are
usually unsecured or secured by rapidly depreciable assets. Management, however, believes that offering consumer loan products
helps to expand and create stronger ties to our existing customer base by increasing the number of customer relationships and
providing cross-marketing opportunities. We offer a variety of consumer loans to retail customers in the communities we serve.
Examples of our consumer loans include automobile loans, spa and pool loans, collateral loans and personal lines of credit tied
to deposit accounts to provide overdraft protection.

Asset
Quality . 

Maintaining
a high level of asset quality continues to be one of the Company s key objectives. Credit Administration reports directly
to the Chief Credit Officer and is responsible for the completion of independent credit analyses for all loans above a specific
threshold. 

The
Company s policy requires that management continuously monitor the status of the loan portfolio and report to the Board
of Directors on a monthly basis. These reports include information on concentration levels, delinquent loans, nonaccrual loans,
criticized loans and foreclosed real estate, as well as our actions and plans to cure the nonaccrual status of the loans and to
dispose of the foreclosed property. 

The
Company contracts with an external loan review company to review the internal risk ratings assigned to loans in the commercial
loan portfolio on a pre-determined schedule, based on the type, size, rating, and overall risk of the loan. During the course
of their review, the third party examines a sample of loans, including new loans, existing relationships over certain dollar amounts
and classified assets. The findings are reported to the Chief Credit Officer and the full report is then presented to the Audit
Committee. 

Potential
Problem Loans. 

The
Company performs an internal analysis of the loan portfolio in order to identify and quantify loans with higher than normal risk.
Loans having a higher risk profile are assigned a risk rating corresponding to the level of weakness identified in the loan. 

All
loans risk rated Special Mention (5) , Substandard (6) , Doubtful (7) and Loss
(8) are listed on the Company s criticized report and are reviewed by management not less than on a quarterly basis
to assess the level of risk and to ensure that appropriate actions are being taken to minimize potential loss exposure. Loans
identified as containing a loss are partially charged-off or fully charged-off. In addition, the Company closely monitors the
classified loans for signs of deterioration to mitigate the growth in nonaccrual loans, including performing additional due diligence,
updating valuations and requiring additional financial reporting from the borrower. At December 31, 2022, criticized loans, inclusive
of adversely classified loans (defined as Substandard, Doubtful or Loss ),
totaled 64.0 million, or 3.2 of total loans, compared to 82.6 million, or 4.4 of total loans, at December 31, 2021. 

The
Company s adversely classified loans totaled 42.3 million, or 2.1 of total loans, at December 31, 2022 and 31.1 million,
or 1.7 , of total loans, at December 31, 2021. Adversely classified loans that were performing but possessed potential weaknesses
and, as a result, could ultimately become nonperforming loans totaled 36.6 million, or 1.8 of total loans, at December 31, 2022
and 26.4 million, or 1.4 of total loans, at December 31, 2021. The remaining balance of adversely classified loans were nonaccrual
loans totaling 5.7 million, or 0.3 of total loans, at December 31, 2022 and 4.7 million, or 0.3 of total loans, at December
31, 2021. 

Total
impaired loans totaled 18.4 million, or 0.9 of total loans, at December 31, 2022 and 20.5 million, or 1.1 of total loans,
at December 31, 2021. Total accruing impaired loans totaled 12.7 million and 15.5 million at December 31, 2022 and December
31, 2021, respectively, while nonaccrual impaired loans totaled 5.7 million and 5.0 million as of December 31, 2022 and December
31, 2021, respectively. 

In
management s opinion, all impaired loan balances at December 31, 2022 and 2021, were supported by expected future cash flows
or, for those collateral dependent loans, the net realizable value of the underlying collateral. Based on management s assessment
at December 31, 2022 and December 31, 2021, no impaired loans required a specific reserve. Management closely monitors these relationships
for collateral or credit deterioration. 

At
December 31, 2022, 2021, 2020, nonaccrual loans totaled 5.7 million, or 0.29 of total loans, 5.0 million, or 0.27 of total
loans, and 7.8 million, and 0.41 of total loans, respectively. If all nonaccrual loans had been performing in accordance with
their terms, we would have earned additional interest income of 257,000, 262,000 and 275,000 for the years ended December 31,
2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively. 

At
December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020, the Company carried no other real estate owned OREO balances.

Allowance
for Loan Losses . 

The
allowance for loan losses is an estimate of probable credit risk inherent in the loan portfolio as of the specified balance sheet
dates. The Company maintains the allowance at a level that it deems adequate to absorb all reasonably anticipated probable losses
from specifically known and other credit risks associated with the portfolio. The adoption of the Current Expected Credit Loss CECL allowance methodology became effective for the Company as of January 1, 2023. Upon implementation, the Company
elected to leverage a CECL compliant Discounted Cash Flow DCF model to calculate projected potential loan losses. 

The
Company maintains an allowance for loan losses to absorb losses inherent in the loan portfolio based on ongoing quarterly assessments
of the estimated losses. Our methodology for assessing the appropriateness of the allowance consists of a review of the components,
which includes a general allowance for non-impaired loans. 

The
specific valuation allowance incorporates the results of measuring impairment for specifically identified non-homogenous problem
loans and, as applicable, troubled debt restructurings TDRs ). A loan is recognized as impaired when it is probable
that principal and/or interest are not collectible in accordance with the loan s contractual terms. Impairment is measured
on a loan-by-loan basis for commercial real estate and commercial and industrial loans by either the present value of expected
future cash flows discounted at the loan s effective interest rate or the fair value of the collateral if the loan is collateral
dependent. An allowance is established when the discounted cash flows (or collateral value) of the impaired loan is lower than
the carrying value of that loan. Once an impairment has been determined, the Company recognizes the charge-off. 

The
general allowance is calculated by applying loss factors to outstanding loans by loan type, excluding loans determined to be impaired.
As part of this analysis, each quarter we prepare an allowance for loan losses worksheet which categorizes the loan portfolio
by risk characteristics such as loan type and loan grade. The general allowance is inherently subjective as it requires material
estimates that may be susceptible to significant change. There are a number of factors that are considered when evaluating the
appropriate level of the allowance. These factors include current economic and business conditions that affect our key lending
areas, collateral values, loan volumes and concentrations, credit quality trends such as nonperforming loans, delinquency and
loan losses, and specific industry concentrations within the portfolio segments that may impact the collectability of the loan
portfolio. In 2020, the Bank added a new qualitative factor category to the allowance calculation Economic Impact
of COVID-19 based upon an analysis of the loan portfolio that included identifying borrowers sensitive to the shutdown.
During the year ended December 31, 2021, the qualitative adjustment factors related to the COVID-19 pandemic and the uncertainty
in the economic environment were reduced as Management continued to assess the exposure of the Company s loan portfolio
to the COVID-19 pandemic related factors, economic trends and their potential effect on asset quality. For information on our
methodology for assessing the appropriateness of the allowance for loan losses please see Footnote 1 Summary
of Significant Accounting Policies of our notes to consolidated financial statements. 

The
allowance for loan losses is established through a provision for loan losses, which is a direct charge to earnings. Loan losses
are charged against the allowance when management believes that the collectability of the loan principal is unlikely. Recoveries
on loans previously charged-off are credited to the allowance for loan losses. 

In
making its assessment on the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses, management considers several quantitative and qualitative
factors that could have an effect on the credit quality of the portfolio. Management closely monitors the credit quality of individual
delinquent and nonperforming relationships, the levels of impaired and adversely classified loans, net charge-offs, the growth
and composition of the loan portfolio, expansion in geographic market area, and any material changes in underwriting criteria,
and the strength of the local and national economy, among other factors. 

The
level of delinquent and nonperforming assets is largely a function of economic conditions and the overall banking environment
and the individual business circumstances of borrowers. Despite prudent loan underwriting, adverse changes within the Company s
market area, or deterioration in local, regional or national economic conditions, could negatively impact management s estimate
of probable credit losses. 

14 

Management
continues to closely monitor the necessary allowance levels, including specific reserves. The allowance for loan losses to total
loans ratio was 1.00 at December 31, 2022 compared to 1.06 at December 31, 2021. The allowance for loan losses to total loans
ratio, excluding PPP loans, was 1.00 and 1.08 , at December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. The allowance for loan losses to
nonperforming loans ratio was 350.0 and 398.6 , at December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. 

Based
on the foregoing, as well as management s judgment as to the existing credit risks inherent in the loan portfolio, management
believes that the Company s allowance for loan losses is adequate to absorb probable losses from specifically known and
other probable credit risks associated with the portfolio as of December 31, 2022. 

For
the years ended December 31, 2022 and December 31, 2021, the Company recorded a provision for loan losses of 700,000, compared
to a credit for loan losses of 925,000 to the allowance for loan losses based on our evaluation of the items discussed above.
The credit for loan losses during the year ended December 31, 2021 was primarily due to a reduction of qualitative adjustment
factors that had previously been increased in the allowance for credit losses related to the COVID-19 pandemic and the uncertainty
in the economic environment. We believe that the allowance for loan losses adequately reflects the level of incurred losses in
the current loan portfolio as of December 31, 2022.

Loans
Acquired with Deteriorated Credit Quality . 

Loans
acquired in a transfer, including business combinations, where there is evidence of credit deterioration since origination and
it is probable at the date of acquisition the Company will not collect all contractually required principal and interest payments,
are accounted for under accounting guidance for purchased credit-impaired loans. This guidance provides that the excess of the
cash flows initially expected to be collected over the fair value of the loans at the acquisition date (i.e., the accretable yield)
is accreted into interest income over the estimated remaining life of the loans, provided that the timing and amount of future
cash flows is reasonably estimated. The difference between the contractually required payments and the cash flows expected to
be collected at acquisition is referred to as the non-accretable difference. Subsequent to acquisition, probable decreases in
expected cash flows are recognized through a provision for loan losses, resulting in an increase to the allowance for loan losses.
If the Company has probable and significant increases in cash flows expected to be collected, the Company will first reverse any
previously established allowance for loan losses and then increase interest income as a prospective yield adjustment. At December
31, 2022 and 2021, the Company had 5.2 million and 6.9 million in purchased credit- impaired loans.

Investment
Activities. 

The
Board of Directors reviews and approves our investment policy on an annual basis. The Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial
Officer, as authorized by the Board of Directors, implement this policy based on the established guidelines within the written
policy. The Company s internal investment policy sets limits as a percentage of the total portfolio, identifies acceptable
and unacceptable investment practices, and denotes approved security dealers. The effect of changes in interest rates, market
values, timing of principal payments and credit risk are considered when purchasing securities. 

The
Company s investment portfolio activities are an integral part of the overall asset liability management program of the
Company. The investment function provides readily available funds to support loan growth, as well as to meet withdrawals and maturities
of deposits, and attempts to provide maximum return consistent with liquidity constraints and general prudence, including diversification
and safety of investments. 

The
securities in which the Company may invest are limited by regulation. Federally-chartered savings banks have authority to invest
in various types of assets, including U.S. Treasury obligations, securities of various government-sponsored enterprises, mortgage-backed
securities, certain certificates of deposit of insured financial institutions, repurchase agreements, overnight and short-term
loans to other banks, corporate debt instruments and marketable equity securities. 

As
of the balance sheet dates reflected in this annual report, held-to-maturity securities are carried at amortized cost and available-for-sale
securities are carried at fair value. On a quarterly basis, we review debt securities with a decline in fair value below the amortized
cost of the investment to determine whether the decline in fair value is temporary or other-than-temporary OTTI ).
In estimating OTTI losses for debt securities, impairment is required to be recognized if (1) we intend to sell the security;
(2) it is more likely than not that we will be required to sell the security before recovery of its amortized cost
basis; or (3) for debt securities, the present value of expected cash flows is not sufficient to recover the entire amortized
cost basis. For all impaired debt securities that we intend to sell, or more likely than not will be required to sell, the full
amount of the other-than-temporary impairment is recognized through earnings. For all other impaired debt securities, credit-related
other-than-temporary impairment is recognized through earnings, while non-credit-related other-than-temporary impairment is recognized
in other comprehensive income/loss, net of applicable taxes. Marketable equity securities are measured at fair value with changes
in fair value reported on the Company s income statement as a component of non-interest income, regardless of whether such
gains and losses are realized. 

Management
reports investment transactions, portfolio allocation, effective duration, market value at risk and projected cash flows to the
Board on a periodic basis. The Board also approves the Company s ongoing investment strategy. 

Restricted
Equity Securities . 

At
December 31, 2022 and 2021, the Company held 2.9 million and 2.2 million, respectively, of FHLB stock. This stock is classified
as a restricted investment and carried at cost which management believes approximates the fair value. The investment must be held
as a condition of membership in the FHLB and as a condition for the Bank to borrow from the FHLB. The Company periodically evaluates
its investment in FHLB stock for impairment based on, among other factors, the capital adequacy of the FHLB and its overall financial
condition. 

At
December 31, 2022 and 2021, the Company held 423,000 of Atlantic Community Bankers Bank stock. The stock is restricted and carried
in other assets at cost. The stock is evaluated for impairment based on an estimate of the ultimate recovery to the par value.
No impairment losses have been recorded through December 31, 2022.

Securities
Portfolio Maturities . 

The
composition and maturities of the debt securities portfolio and the mortgage-backed securities portfolio at December 31, 2022
are summarized in the following table. Maturities are based on the final contractual payment dates, and do not reflect the impact
of prepayments or redemptions that may occur. Weighted average yield is calculated using the amortized cost and yield to maturity
of securities divided by the total amortized cost of the segment, and does not adjust for tax-equivalent basis for any tax-exempt
obligations.

Deposits. 

Deposits
have traditionally been the principal source of the Company s funds. The Company offers commercial checking, small business,
nonprofit and municipal checking, money market and sweep accounts, as well as certificates of deposit and specialty products including
escrow management accounts, Interest on Lawyers Trust Accounts, and Interest on Real Estate Brokers Trust Accounts. A broad selection
of competitive retail deposit products are also offered, including interest-bearing and noninterest-bearing checking, money market
and savings accounts, as well as certificates of deposit and individual retirement accounts, with terms on time deposits ranging
from three months to sixty months. As a member of the FDIC, the Bank s depositors are provided deposit protection up to
the maximum FDIC insurance coverage limits. 

Management
determines the interest rates offered on deposit accounts based on current and expected economic conditions, competition, and
the Bank s liquidity needs, volatility of existing deposits, asset/liability position and overall objectives regarding the
growth and retention of relationships. We may also utilize brokered deposits, both term and overnight, from a number of available
sources, as part of our asset liability management strategy and as an alternative to borrowed funds to support asset growth in
excess of internally generated deposits. Brokered deposits along with borrowed funds may be referred to as wholesale funding.
There were no brokered deposits on the balance sheet at December 31, 2022 and December 31, 2021. 

Core
deposits (defined as regular accounts, money market accounts, interest-bearing and noninterest-bearing demand accounts) represented
81.5 of total deposits on December 31, 2022 and 82.2 on December 31, 2021. At December 31, 2022 and December 31, 2021, time
deposits with remaining terms to maturity of less than one year amounted to 288.7 million and 363.3 million, respectively. See

Other
Sources of Funds. 

As
discussed above, deposit gathering has been the Company s principal source of funds. Asset growth in excess of deposits
may be funded through cash flows from our loan and investment portfolios, or the following sources: 

Borrowings. 

Total
borrowing capacity includes borrowing arrangements at the FHLB, the Federal Reserve Bank of Boston FRB ), and borrowing
arrangements with correspondent banks. 

The
Company is a member of the FHLB and uses borrowings as an additional source of funding to finance the Company s lending
and investing activities and to provide liquidity for daily operations. FHLB advances also provide more pricing and option alternatives
for particular asset/liability needs. The FHLB provides a central credit facility primarily for member institutions. As an FHLB
member, the Company is required to own capital stock of the FHLB, calculated periodically based primarily on its level of borrowings
from the FHLB. FHLB borrowings are secured by certain securities from the Company s investment portfolio not otherwise pledged
as well as certain residential real estate and commercial real estate loans. Advances are made under several different credit
programs with different lending standards, interest rates and range of maturities. This relationship is an integral component
of the Company s asset-liability management program. At December 31, 2022, the Bank had 407.4 million in additional borrowing
capacity from the FHLB. 

The
Company also has an overnight Ideal Way line of credit with the FHLB for 9.5 million. Interest on this line of credit is payable
at a rate determined and reset by the FHLB on a daily basis. The outstanding principal is due daily but the portion not repaid
will be automatically renewed. There were no advances outstanding under this line at December 31, 2022 and December 31, 2021,
respectively. 

The
Company has an available line of credit of 4.4 million with the FRB Discount Window at an interest rate determined and reset
on a daily basis. Borrowings from the FRB Discount Window are secured by certain securities from the Company s investment
portfolio not otherwise pledged. At December 31, 2022 and December 31, 2021, there were no advances outstanding under this line. 

The
Company also has pre-established, non-collateralized overnight borrowing arrangements with large national and regional correspondent
banks to provide additional overnight and short-term borrowing capacity for the Company. The Company has 65.0 million in available
lines of credit with correspondent banks at interest rates determined and reset on a daily basis. At December 31, 2022 and December
31, 2021, we had no advances outstanding under these lines. 

20 

Long-term
debt consists of FHLB advances with an original maturity of one year or more. At December 31, 2022, we had 1.2 million in long-term
debt with the FHLB, compared to 2.7 million in long-term debt with the FHLB at December 31, 2021. 

Subordinated
Debt. 

On
April 20, 2021, the Company completed an offering of 20 million in aggregate principal amount of its 4.875 fixed-to-floating
rate subordinated notes (the Notes to certain qualified institutional buyers in a private placement transaction.
The Company intends to use the net proceeds of the offering for general corporate purposes, including organic growth and repurchase
of the Company s common shares. 

Unless
earlier redeemed, the Notes mature on May 1, 2031. The Notes will bear interest from the initial issue date to, but excluding,
May 1, 2026, or the earlier redemption date, at a fixed rate of 4.875 per annum, payable quarterly in arrears on May 1, August
1, November 1 and February 1 of each year, beginning August 1, 2021, and (ii) from and including May 1, 2026, but excluding the
maturity date or earlier redemption date, equal to the benchmark rate, which is the 90-day average secured overnight financing
rate, plus 412 basis points, determined on the determination date of the applicable interest period, payable quarterly in arrears
on May 1, August 1, November 1 and February 1 of each year. The Company may also redeem the Notes, in whole or in part, on or
after May 1, 2026, and at any time upon the occurrence of certain events, subject in each case to the approval of the Board of
Governors of the Federal Reserve System (the Federal Reserve ). The Notes were designed to qualify as Tier 2 capital
under the Federal Reserve s capital adequacy regulations.

closely related to banking as to be a proper incident thereto, as well as any activity that is either (i) financial
in nature or incidental to such financial activity (as determined by the FRB in consultation with the Secretary of the Treasury)
or (ii) complementary to a financial activity, and that does not pose a substantial risk to the safety and soundness of depository
institutions or the financial system generally (as determined solely by the FRB). Activities that are financial in nature include,
among others, securities underwriting and dealing, insurance underwriting and making merchant banking investments. 

Mergers
and Acquisitions. 

The
HOLA, the federal Bank Merger Act and other federal and state statutes regulate direct and indirect acquisitions of savings associations
by savings and loan holding companies or other savings associations. The HOLA requires the prior approval of the FRB for the direct
or indirect acquisition of more than 5 of the voting shares of a savings association or its parent holding company and for a
company, other than a savings and loan holding company, to acquire control of a savings association or a savings
and loan holding company. A company can be deemed to control a savings association or a savings and loan holding
company by owning or controlling, directly or indirectly, more than 25 of the voting shares, but even below that threshold, a
company can be found to have control through other controlling influences. Under the Change in Bank Control Act,
no person, including a company, may acquire, directly or indirectly, control of an insured depository institution without providing
60 days prior notice and receiving a non-objection from the appropriate federal banking agency. 

22 

Under
the Bank Merger Act, the prior approval of the OCC is required for a federal savings association to merge with another insured
depository institution, where the resulting institution is a federal savings association, or to purchase the assets or assume
the deposits of another insured depository institution. In reviewing applications seeking approval of merger and acquisition transactions,
the federal bank regulatory agencies must consider, among other things, the competitive effect and public benefits of the transactions,
the capital position of the combined organization, performance records under the Community Reinvestment Act of 1977 (see the section
captioned Community Reinvestment Act of 1977 included elsewhere in this section) and the effectiveness of the subject
organizations in combating money laundering. 

Source
of Strength Doctrine. 

FRB
policy requires savings and loan holding companies to act as a source of financial and managerial strength to their subsidiary
savings associations. Section 616 of the Dodd-Frank Act codified the requirement that holding companies act as a source of financial
strength to their insured depository institution subsidiaries. As a result, Western New England Bancorp is expected to commit
resources to support the Bank, including at times when Western New England Bancorp may not be in a financial position to provide
such resources. Any capital loans by a savings and loan holding company to any of its subsidiary savings associations are subordinate
in right of payment to deposits and to certain other indebtedness of such subsidiary savings associations. In the event of a savings
and loan holding company s bankruptcy, any commitment by the savings and loan holding company to a federal banking agency
to maintain the capital of a subsidiary insured depository institution will be assumed by the bankruptcy trustee and entitled
to priority of payment. 

Dividends. 

The
principal source of Western New England Bancorp s liquidity is dividends from the Bank. The OCC imposes various restrictions
and requirements on the Bank s ability to make capital distributions, including cash dividends. The OCC s prior approval
is required if the total of all distributions, including the proposed distribution, declared by a federal savings association
in any calendar year would exceed an amount equal to the Bank s net income for the year-to-date plus the Bank s retained
net income for the previous two years, or that would cause the Bank to be less than well capitalized. In addition, section 10(f)
of the HOLA requires a subsidiary savings association of a savings and loan holding company, such as the Bank, to file a notice
with the Federal Reserve prior to declaring certain types of dividends. 

Western
New England Bancorp and the Bank are also subject to other regulatory policies and requirements relating to the payment of dividends,
including requirements to maintain adequate capital above regulatory minimums. The appropriate federal banking agency is authorized
to determine, under certain circumstances relating to the financial condition of a savings and loan holding company or a savings
association, that the payment of dividends would be an unsafe or unsound practice and to prohibit payment thereof. The federal
banking agencies have indicated that paying dividends that deplete an insured depository institution s capital base to an
inadequate level would be an unsafe and unsound banking practice and that banking organizations should generally pay dividends
only out of current operating earnings. 

Capital
Adequacy. 

In
July 2013, the FRB, the OCC and the FDIC approved final rules (the Capital Rules that established a new capital
framework for U.S. banking organizations. The Capital Rules generally implement the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision s
December 2010 final capital framework referred to as Basel III for strengthening international capital standards.
In addition, the Capital Rules implement certain provisions of the Dodd-Frank Act. Pursuant to the Dodd-Frank Act, Western New
England Bancorp, as a savings and loan holding company, is subject to the Capital Rules. 

The
Capital Rules substantially revised the risk-based capital requirements applicable to holding companies and their depository institution
subsidiaries as compared to prior U.S. general risk-based capital rules. The Capital Rules revised the definitions and the components
of regulatory capital and impacted the calculation of the numerator in banking institutions regulatory capital ratios.
The Capital Rules became effective on January 1, 2015, subject to phase-in periods for certain components and other provisions. 

23 

The
Capital Rules: (i) require a capital measure called Common Equity Tier 1 CET1 and related regulatory
capital ratio of CET1 to risk-weighted assets; (ii) specify that Tier 1 capital consists of CET1 and Additional Tier 1
capital instruments meeting certain revised requirements; (iii) mandate that most deductions/adjustments to regulatory
capital measures be made to CET1 and not to the other components of capital; and (iv) expand the scope of the deductions from
and adjustments to capital as compared to existing regulations. Under the Capital Rules, for most banking organizations, including
Western New England Bancorp, the most common form of Additional Tier 1 capital is non-cumulative perpetual preferred stock and
the most common forms of Tier 2 capital are subordinated notes and a portion of the allocation for loan and lease losses, in each
case, subject to the Capital Rules specific requirements. 

Pursuant
to the Capital Rules, the minimum capital ratios are: 

4.5 
 CET1 to risk-weighted assets; 

6.0 
 Tier 1 capital (that is, CET1 plus Additional Tier 1 capital) to risk-weighted assets; 

8.0 
 Total capital (that is, Tier 1 capital plus Tier 2 capital) to risk-weighted assets;
 and 

4.0 
 Tier 1 capital to average consolidated assets as reported on consolidated financial statements
 (known as the leverage ratio ). 

The
Capital Rules also require a capital conservation buffer, composed entirely of CET1, on top of these minimum risk-weighted
asset ratios. The capital conservation buffer is designed to absorb losses during periods of economic stress. Banking institutions
with a ratio of CET1 to risk-weighted assets above the minimum but below the capital conservation buffer will face constraints
on dividends, equity and other capital instrument repurchases and compensation based on the amount of the shortfall. The additional
capital conservation buffer must be 2.5 of CET1, effectively resulting in minimum ratios inclusive of the capital conservation
buffer of (i) CET1 to risk-weighted assets of at least 7 , (ii) Tier 1 capital to risk-weighted assets of at least 8.5 , and (iii)
Total capital to risk-weighted assets of at least 10.5 . 

The
Capital Rules provide for a number of deductions from and adjustments to CET1, which have been simplified for non-advanced approaches
institutions since the time the Capital Rules were initially finalized. 

In
addition, under the current general risk-based capital rules, the effects of accumulated other comprehensive income or loss AOCI items included in shareholders equity (for example, marks-to-market of securities held in the available-for-sale portfolio)
under generally accepted accounting principles in the United States of America GAAP are reversed for the purposes
of determining regulatory capital ratios. Under the Capital Rules, the effects of certain AOCI items are not excluded; however,
banking organizations not using advanced approaches, were permitted to make a one-time permanent election to continue to exclude
these items in January 2015. The Company and the Bank made this election. 

The
risk-weighting categories in the Capital Rules are standardized and include a risk-sensitive number of categories, depending on
the nature of the assets, generally ranging from 0 for U.S. government and agency securities, to 600 for certain equity exposures,
and resulting in higher risk weights for a variety of assets. The implementation of the Capital Rules did not have a material
impact on the Company s or the Bank s consolidated capital levels. 

The
Bank is subject to the Capital Rules as well. The Company and the Bank are each in compliance with the targeted capital ratios
under the Capital Rules at December 31, 2022. 

In
September 2019, the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, the Federal Reserve Board and the FDIC adopted a final rule that
is intended to further simplify the Capital Rules for depository institutions and their holding companies that have less than
 10 billion in total consolidated assets, such as us, if such institutions meet certain qualifying criteria. This final rule became
effective on January 1, 2020. Under this final rule, if we meet the qualifying criteria, including having a leverage ratio (equal
to tier 1 capital divided by average total consolidated assets) of greater than 9 percent, we will be eligible to opt into the
community bank leverage ratio framework. If we opt into this framework, we will be considered to have satisfied the generally
applicable risk-based and leverage capital requirements in the Capital Rules (as modified pursuant to the simplification rule)
and will be considered to have met the well-capitalized ratio requirements for PCA (as defined below) purposes. The Company and
the Bank evaluated the simplified Capital Rules to determine our adoption status for the applicable filings periods beginning
in 2020 and decided not to opt in to the community bank leverage ratio framework. 

24 

Prompt
Corrective Action. 

Pursuant
to Section 38 of the Federal Deposit Insurance Act FDIA ), federal banking agencies are required to take prompt
corrective action PCA should an insured depository institutions fail to meet certain capital adequacy standards.
At each successive lower capital category, an insured depository institution is subject to more restrictions and prohibitions,
including restrictions on growth, restrictions on interest rates paid on deposits, restrictions or prohibitions on payment of
dividends and restrictions on the acceptance of brokered deposits. Furthermore, if an insured depository institution is classified
in one of the undercapitalized categories, it is required to submit a capital restoration plan to the appropriate federal banking
agency, and the holding company must guarantee the performance of that plan. Based upon its capital levels, a bank that is classified
as well-capitalized, adequately capitalized, or undercapitalized may be treated as though it were in the next lower capital category
if the appropriate federal banking agency, after notice and opportunity for hearing, determines that an unsafe or unsound condition,
or an unsafe or unsound practice, warrants such treatment. 

For
purposes of PCA, to be: (i) well-capitalized, an insured depository institution must have a total risk based capital ratio of
at least 10 , a Tier 1 risk based capital ratio of at least 8 , a CET1 risk based capital ratio of at least 6.5 , and a Tier 1
leverage ratio of at least 5 ; (ii) adequately capitalized, an insured depository institution must have a total risk based capital
ratio of at least 8 , a Tier 1 risk based capital ratio of at least 6 , a CET1 risk based capital ratio of at least 4.5 , and
a Tier 1 leverage ratio of at least 4 ; (iii) undercapitalized, an insured depository institution would have a total risk based
capital ratio of less than 8 , a Tier 1 risk based capital ratio of less than 6 , a CET1 risk based capital ratio of less than
4.5 , and a Tier 1 leverage ratio of less than 4 ; (iv) significantly undercapitalized, an insured depository institution would
have a total risk based capital ratio of less than 6 , a Tier 1 risk based capital ratio of less than 4 , a CET1 risk based capital
ratio of less than 3 , and a Tier 1 leverage ratio of less than 3 .; and (v) critically undercapitalized, an insured depository
institution would have a ratio of tangible equity to total assets that is less than or equal to 2 . As of December 31, 2022, the
most recent notification from the OCC categorized the Bank as well-capitalized under the PCA framework. 

Business
Activities. 

The
Bank derives its lending and investment powers from the HOLA and its implementing regulations promulgated by the OCC. Those laws
and regulations limit the Bank s authority to invest in certain types of assets and to make certain types of loans. Permissible
investments include, but are not limited to, mortgage loans secured by residential and commercial real estate, commercial and
consumer loans, certain types of debt securities, and certain other assets. The Bank may also establish service corporations that
may engage in activities not otherwise permissible for the Bank, including certain real estate equity investments and securities
and insurance brokerage. 

Loans
to One Borrower. 

Generally,
a federal savings bank may not make a loan or extend credit to a single borrower or related group of borrowers in excess of 15 
of unimpaired capital and surplus. An additional amount may be loaned, equal to 10 of unimpaired capital and surplus, if
the loan is secured by readily marketable collateral, which generally does not include real estate. As of December 31,
2022, we were in compliance with these limitations on loans to one borrower. 

Concentrated
Commercial Real Estate Lending Regulations. 

The
federal banking agencies, including the OCC, have promulgated guidance governing financial institutions with concentrations in
commercial real estate lending. The guidance provides that a bank has a concentration in commercial real estate lending if (i)
total reported loans for construction, land development, and other land represent 100 or more of total capital or (ii) total
reported loans secured by multifamily and nonfarm nonresidential properties (excluding loans secured by owner-occupied properties)
and loans for construction, land development, and other land represent 300 or more of total capital and the bank s commercial
real estate loan portfolio has increased 50 or more during the prior 36 months. 

25 

If
a concentration is present, management must employ heightened risk management practices that address the following key elements:
board and management oversight and strategic planning, portfolio management, development of underwriting standards, risk assessment
and monitoring through market analysis and stress testing, and maintenance of increased capital levels as needed to support the
level of commercial real estate lending. On December 18, 2015, the federal banking agencies jointly issued a Statement on
Prudent Risk Management for Commercial Real Estate Lending reminding banks of the need to engage in risk management practices
for commercial real estate lending. 

Qualified
Thrift Lender Test. 

Under
federal law, as a federal savings association, the Bank must comply with the qualified thrift lender test (the QTL test ).
Under the QTL test, the Bank is required to maintain at least 65 of its portfolio assets in certain qualified
thrift investments in at least nine months of the most recent twelve-month period. Portfolio assets means,
in general, the Bank s total assets less the sum of: 

specified
 liquid assets up to 20 of total assets; 

goodwill
 and other intangible assets; and 

value
 of property used to conduct the Bank s business. 

Qualified
thrift investments include certain assets that are includable without limit, such as residential and manufactured housing
loans, home equity loans, education loans, small business loans, credit card loans, mortgage backed securities, Federal Home Loan
Bank stock and certain U.S. government obligations. In addition, certain assets are includable as qualified thrift investments 
in an amount up to 20 of portfolio assets, including certain consumer loans and loans in credit-needy areas. 

The
Bank may also satisfy the QTL test by qualifying as a domestic building and loan association as defined in the Internal
Revenue Code. Failure by the Bank to maintain its status as a QTL would result in restrictions on activities, including restrictions
on branching and the payment of dividends. If the Bank were unable to correct that failure within a specified period of time,
it must either continue to operate under those restrictions on its activities or convert to a national bank charter. The Bank
met the QTL test in each of the prior 12 months and, therefore, is a qualified thrift lender. 

The
Community Reinvestment Act. 

The
Community Reinvestment Act of 1977 (the CRA and the regulations issued thereunder are intended to encourage banks
to help meet the credit needs of their entire assessment area, including low and moderate income neighborhoods, consistent with
the safe and sound operations of such banks. The CRA requires the OCC to evaluate the record of each financial institution in
meeting such credit needs. The CRA evaluation is also considered by the bank regulatory agencies in evaluating approvals for mergers,
acquisitions, and applications to open, relocate or close a branch or facility. Failure to adequately meet the criteria within
CRA guidelines could impose additional requirements and limitations on the Bank. Additionally, the Bank must publicly disclose
the ability to request the Bank s CRA Performance Evaluation and other various related documents. The Bank received a rating
of Outstanding on its most recent Community Reinvestment Act examination. 

Consumer
Protection and CFPB Supervision. 

The
Dodd-Frank Act centralized responsibility for consumer financial protection by creating the CFPB, an independent federal agency
responsible for implementing, enforcing, and examining compliance with federal consumer financial laws. As Western New England
Bancorp has less than 10 billion in total consolidated assets, the OCC continues to exercise primary examination authority over
the Bank with regard to compliance with federal consumer financial laws and regulations. Under the Dodd-Frank Act, state attorneys
general are empowered to enforce rules issued by the CFPB. 

The
Company and the Bank are subject to a number of federal and state laws designed to protect borrowers and promote fair lending.
These laws include, among others, the Equal Credit Opportunity Act, the Fair Credit Reporting Act, the Truth in Lending Act, the
Home Mortgage Disclosure Act, the Real Estate Settlement Procedures Act, various state law counterparts, and the Consumer Financial
Protection Act of 2010. 

26 

Transactions
with Affiliates and Loans to Insiders. 

Under
federal law, transactions between insured depository institutions and their affiliates are governed by Sections 23A and 23B of
the Federal Reserve Act FRA ), and the FRB s implementing Regulation W. In a holding company context, at a
minimum, the parent holding company of a bank or savings association, and any companies which are controlled by such parent holding
company, are affiliates of the bank or savings association. Generally, sections 23A and 23B are intended to protect
insured depository institutions from losses arising from transactions with non-insured affiliates, by limiting the extent to which
a depository institution or its subsidiaries may engage in covered transactions with any one affiliate and with all affiliates
of the depository institution in the aggregate, and by requiring that such transactions be on terms that are consistent with safe
and sound banking practices. 

Section
22(h) of the FRA restricts loans to directors, executive officers, and principal stockholders Insiders ). Under
Section 22(h), loans to Insiders and their related interests may not exceed, together with all other outstanding loans to such
persons and affiliated entities, the insured depository institution s total capital and surplus. Loans to Insiders above
specified amounts must receive the prior approval of the Board. Further, under Section 22(h), loans to insiders must be made on
terms substantially the same as offered in comparable transactions to other persons, except that such Insiders may receive preferential
loans made under a benefit or compensation program that is widely available to the bank s employees and does not give preference
to the insider over the employees. Section 22(g) of the FRA places additional limitations on loans to executive officers. 

Enforcement. 

The
OCC has primary enforcement responsibility over federal savings associations, including the Bank. This enforcement authority includes,
among other things, the ability to assess civil money penalties, to issue cease and desist orders and to remove directors and
officers. In general, these enforcement actions may be initiated in response to unsafe or unsound practices, and any violation
of laws and regulations. 

Standards
for Safety and Soundness. 

The
Bank is subject to certain standards designed to maintain the safety and soundness of individual insured depository institutions
and the banking system. The OCC has prescribed safety and soundness guidelines relating to (i) internal controls, information
systems and internal audit systems; (ii) loan documentation; (iii) credit underwriting; (iv) interest rate exposure; (v) asset
growth, concentration, and quality; (vi) earnings; and (vii) compensation and benefit standards for officers, directors, employees
and principal shareholders. A savings association not meeting one or more of the safety and soundness guidelines may be required
to file a compliance plan with the OCC. 

Under
the FDIA, the FDIC may terminate deposit insurance upon a finding that the institution has engaged in unsafe and unsound practices,
is in an unsafe or unsound condition to continue operations, or has violated any applicable law, regulation, rule, order or condition
imposed by the FDIC. Management is not aware of any practice, condition or violation that might lead to the termination of the
Bank s deposit insurance. 

Federal
Deposit Insurance. 

The
FDIC s deposit insurance limit is 250,000 per depositor, per insured bank, for each account ownership category. The deposits
of the Bank are insured up to applicable limits by the DIF of the FDIC. The Bank is subject to deposit insurance assessments to
maintain the DIF. The FDIC uses a risk-based assessment system that imposes insurance premiums based upon a risk matrix that takes
into account an insured depository institution s capital level and supervisory rating, commonly known as the CAMELS 
rating. The risk matrix utilizes different risk categories which are distinguished by capital levels and supervisory ratings.
As a result of the Dodd-Frank Act, the base for insurance assessments is now consolidated average assets less average tangible
equity. Assessment rates are calculated using formulas that take into account the risk of the institution being assessed. 

27 

Depositor Preference. 

The
FDIA provides that, in the event of the liquidation or other resolution of an insured depository institution, the
claims of depositors of the institution, including the claims of the FDIC as subrogee of insured depositors, and certain claims
for administrative expenses of the FDIC as a receiver, will have priority over other general unsecured claims against the institution.
If an insured depository institution fails, insured and uninsured depositors, along with the FDIC, will have priority in payment
ahead of unsecured, non-deposit creditors, including the parent bank holding company, with respect to any extensions of credit
they have made to such insured depository institution. 

Federal
Home Loan Bank System. 

The
Bank is a member of the FHLB, which is one of the regional Federal Home Loan Banks comprising the Federal Home Loan Bank System.
Each Federal Home Loan Bank serves as a central credit facility primarily for its member institutions. The Bank, as a member of
the FHLB, is required to acquire and hold shares of capital stock in the FHLB. Required percentages of stock ownership are subject
to change by the FHLB, and the Bank was in compliance with this requirement with an investment in FHLB capital stock at December
31, 2022. If there are any developments that cause the value of our stock investment in the FHLB to become impaired, we
would be required to write down the value of our investment, which could affect our net income and shareholders equity. 

Reserve
Requirements. 

FRB
regulations authorize the Federal Reserve Board to require insured depository institutions to maintain non-interest earning reserves
against their transaction accounts (primary interest-bearing and regular checking accounts). The Bank s required reserves
can be in the form of vault cash. If vault cash does not fully satisfy the required reserves, they may be satisfied in the form
of a balance maintained with the Federal Reserve Bank of Boston. Currently, there is no reserve requirement because the Federal
Reserve Board reduced the reserve requirement to zero percent. 

Financial
Privacy and Data Security. 

Western
New England Bancorp is subject to federal laws, including the Gramm-Leach Bliley Act, and certain state laws containing consumer
privacy protection provisions. These provisions limit the ability of banks and other financial institutions to disclose non-public
information about consumers to affiliated and non-affiliated third parties and limit the reuse of certain consumer information
received from non-affiliated institutions. These provision require notice of privacy policies to consumers and, in some circumstances,
allow consumers to prevent disclosure of certain personal information to affiliates or non-affiliated third parties by means of
 opt out or opt in authorizations. 

The
Gramm-Leach Bliley Act requires that financial institutions implement comprehensive written information security programs that
include administrative, technical, and physical safeguards to protect consumer information. Further, pursuant to interpretive
guidance issued under the Gramm-Leach Bliley Act and certain state laws, financial institutions are required to notify customers
of security breaches that result in unauthorized access to their nonpublic personal information. 

Preventing
Suspicious Activity. 

Under
Title III of the USA PATRIOT Act Patriot Act ), all financial institutions are required to take certain measures
to identify their customers, prevent money laundering, monitor customer transactions and report suspicious activity to U.S. law
enforcement agencies. Financial institutions also are required to respond to requests for information from federal banking agencies
and law enforcement agencies. Information sharing among financial institutions for the above purposes is encouraged by an exemption
granted to complying financial institutions from the privacy provisions of Gramm-Leach Bliley Act and other privacy laws. Financial
institutions are required to have anti-money laundering programs in place, which include, among other things, performing risk
assessments and customer due diligence. The primary federal banking agencies and the Secretary of the Treasury have adopted regulations
to implement several of these provisions. The Bank must also comply with the Customer Due Diligence Rule, which clarifies and
strengthens the existing obligations for identifying new and existing customers and explicitly includes risk-based procedures for
conducting ongoing customer due diligence. Financial institutions also are required to establish internal anti-money laundering
programs. The effectiveness of institutions in combating money laundering activities is a factor to be considered in any application
submitted by an insured depository institution under the Bank Merger Act. Western New England Bancorp and the Bank have in place
a Bank Secrecy Act and Patriot Act compliance program and engage in limited transactions with foreign financial institutions or
foreign persons. 

28 

The
Fair Credit Reporting Act s Red Flags Rule requires financial institutions with covered accounts (e.g. consumer bank accounts
and loans) to develop, implement, and administer an identity theft prevention program. This program must include reasonable policies
and procedures to detect suspicious patterns or practices that indicate the possibility of identity theft, such an inconsistencies
in personal information or changes in account activity. 

Office
of Foreign Assets Control Regulation. 

The
U.S. has imposed economic sanctions that affect transactions with designated foreign countries, nationals and others. These are
typically known as the OFAC rules based on their administration by the Office of Foreign Assets Control, which is
an office within the U.S. Department of Treasury (the OFAC ). The OFAC-administered sanctions targeting countries
take many different forms. Generally, the sanctions contain one or more of the following elements: (i) restrictions on trade
with or investment in a sanctioned country, including prohibitions against direct or indirect imports from and exports to a sanctioned
country and prohibitions on U.S. persons engaging in financial transactions relating to making investments in, or
providing investment-related advice or assistance to, a sanctioned country; and (ii) a blocking of assets in which the government
or specially designated nationals of the sanctioned country have an interest, by prohibiting transfers of property subject to
U.S. jurisdiction (including property in the possession or control of U.S. persons). Blocked assets (e.g., property and bank deposits)
cannot be paid out, withdrawn, set off or transferred in any manner without an OFAC license. Failure to comply with these sanctions
could have legal and reputational consequences. 

Home
Mortgage Disclosure Act HMDA ). 

On
October 15, 2015, pursuant to section 1094 of the Dodd-Frank Act, the CFPB issued amended rules in regards to the collection,
reporting and disclosure of certain residential mortgage transactions under the Home Mortgage Disclosure Act (the HMDA Rules ).
The Dodd-Frank Act mandated additional loan data collection points in addition to authorizing the CFPB to require other data collection
points under implementing Regulation C. Most of the provisions of the HMDA Rule went into effect on January 1, 2018 and apply
to data collected in 2018 and reporting in 2019 and later years. The HMDA Rule adopts a uniform loan volume threshold for all
financial institutions, modifies the types of transactions that are subject to collection and reporting, expands the loan data
information being collected and reported, and modifies procedures for annual submission and annual public disclosures. 

UDAP
and UDAAP. 

Banking
regulatory agencies have increasingly used a general consumer protection statute to address unethical or otherwise
 bad business practices that may not necessarily fall directly under the purview of a specific banking or consumer
finance law. The law of choice for enforcement against such business practices has been Section 5 of the Federal Trade Commission
Act, referred to as the FTC Act, which is the primary federal law that prohibits unfair or deceptive acts or practices, referred
to as UDAP, and unfair methods of competition in or affecting commerce. Unjustified consumer injury is the principal
focus of the FTC Act. Prior to the Dodd-Frank Act, there was little formal guidance to provide insight to the parameters for compliance
with UDAP laws and regulations. However, UDAP laws and regulations have been expanded under the Dodd-Frank Act to apply to unfair,
deceptive or abusive acts or practices, referred to as UDAAP, which have been delegated to the CFPB for rule-making. The
federal banking agencies have the authority to enforce such rules and regulations. 

Incentive
Compensation. 

The
Dodd-Frank Act requires publicly traded companies to give stockholders a non-binding vote on executive compensation at their first
annual meeting taking place six months after the date of enactment and at least every three years thereafter and on golden
parachute payments in connection with approvals of mergers and acquisitions. The legislation also authorized the SEC to
promulgate rules that would allow stockholders to nominate their own candidates using a company s proxy materials. The Dodd-Frank
Act requires the federal banking agencies and the SEC to establish joint regulations or guidelines prohibiting incentive-based
payment arrangements at specified regulated entities with at least 1 billion in total consolidated assets that encourage inappropriate
risks by providing an executive officer, employee, director or principal shareholder with excessive compensation, fees, or benefits
that could lead to material financial loss to the entity. The federal banking agencies and the SEC most recently proposed such
regulations in 2016, but the regulations have not yet been finalized. If the regulations are adopted in the form initially proposed,
they will restrict the manner in which executive compensation is structured. 

29 

The
Dodd-Frank Act also gives the SEC authority to prohibit broker discretionary voting on elections of directors, executive compensation
matters and any other significant matter. At the 2012 and 2017 Annual Meeting of Shareholders, Western New England Bancorp s
shareholders voted on a non-binding, advisory basis to hold a non-binding, advisory vote on the compensation of named executive
officers of Western New England Bancorp annually. In light of the results, the Western New England Bancorp Board of Directors
determined to hold the vote annually. 

Future
Legislative and Regulatory Initiatives. 

Various
legislative and regulatory initiatives are introduced by Congress, state legislatures and different financial regulatory agencies.
Such initiatives may include proposals to expand or contract the powers of bank holding companies, savings and loan holding companies
and/or depository institutions. Proposed legislation and regulatory initiatives could change banking statutes and the operating
environment of Western New England Bancorp in substantial and unpredictable ways. If enacted, such legislation could increase
or decrease the cost of doing business, limit or expand permissible activities or affect the competitive balance among banks,
savings associations, credit unions, and other financial institutions. Western New England Bancorp cannot predict whether any
such legislation will be enacted, and, if enacted, the effect that it or any implementing regulations would have on the financial
condition or results of operations of Western New England Bancorp. Other legislation may be introduced in Congress, which would
further regulate, deregulate or restructure the financial services industry, including proposals to substantially reform the financial
regulatory framework. It is not possible to predict whether any such proposals will be enacted into law or, if enacted, the effect
which they may have on our business and earnings.

ITEM
 1A. RISK
 FACTORS 

An
investment in the Company s common stock is subject to a variety of risks and uncertainties including, without limitation,
those set forth below, any of which could cause the Company s actual results to vary materially from recent results, or from the
other forward looking statements that the Company may make from time to time in news releases, annual reports and other written
or oral communications. The material risks and uncertainties that management believes may affect the Company are described below.
These risks and uncertainties are not listed in any particular order of priority and are not necessarily the only ones facing
the Company. Additional risks and uncertainties that management is not aware of or focused on or that management currently deems
immaterial may also impair the Company s business, financial condition and results of operations. 

This
annual report on Form 10-K is qualified in its entirety by these risk factors. If any of the following risks actually occur, the Company s
business, financial condition and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected. If this were to happen, the value
of the Company s common stock could decline significantly, and stockholders could lose some or all of their investment. 

 Risks
Related to our Business and Industry 

Our
Business and Results of Operations May be Adversely Affected by the Financial Markets, Fiscal, Monetary, and Regulatory Policies and
Economic Conditions. These Factors Could Have a Material Adverse Effect on Our Earnings, Net Interest Margin, Rate of Growth, Financial
Condition and Stock Price. The economy in the United States and globally has experienced volatility in recent years and may continue
to do so for the foreseeable future, particularly as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. There can be no assurance that economic conditions
will not worsen. Our business may be affected by unfavorable or uncertain economic conditions such as the level and volatility of interest
rates, availability and market conditions of financing, business activity or investor or business confidence, unexpected changes in gross
domestic product, economic growth or its sustainability, inflation, supply chain disruptions, consumer spending, employment levels, labor
shortages, wage inflation, federal government shutdowns, developments related to the U.S. federal debt ceiling, energy prices, home prices,
commercial property values, bankruptcies, fluctuations or other significant changes in both debt and equity capital markets and currencies,
liquidity of financial markets and the availability and cost of capital and credit, natural disasters, epidemics and pandemics (including
COVID-19), terrorist attacks, acts of war or a combination of these or other factors. 

Market
fluctuations may impact our margin requirements and affect our business liquidity. Also, any sudden or prolonged market downturn, as
a result of the above factors or otherwise, could result in a decline in net interest income and noninterest income and adversely affect
our results of operations and financial condition, including asset quality, capital and liquidity levels. 

In
particular, the Company may face the following risks in connection with the economic or market environment: 

The
 Company s and the Bank s ability to borrow from other financial institutions
 or to access the debt of equity capital markets on favorable terms or at all could be adversely
 affected by further disruptions in the capital markets or other events, including actions
 by ratings agencies and deteriorating investor expectations. 

The
 Company faces increased regulation of the banking and financial services industry. Compliance
 with such regulation may increase its costs and limit its ability to pursue business opportunities. 

Lowered
 consumer and business confidence levels that could result in declines in credit usage, adverse
 changes in payment patterns and increases in loan delinquencies and default rates, which
 management expects would adversely impact the Bank s charge-offs and provision for
 loan losses. 

Market
 developments may adversely affect the Bank s securities portfolio by causing other-than-temporary-impairments,
 prompting write-downs and securities losses. 

Competition
 in banking and financial services industry could intensify as a result of the increase consolidation
 of financial services companies in connection with current market conditions or otherwise. 

The
 Company s ability to assess the creditworthiness of its customers may be impaired if
 the models and approaches the Company uses to select, manage, and underwrite its customers
 become less predictive of future behaviors. 

The
 Company could suffer decreases in demand for loans or other financial products and services
 or decreased deposits or other investments in accounts with the Company. 

The
 value of loans and other assets or collateral securing loans may decrease. 

31 

As
economic conditions relating to the COVID-19 pandemic have improved, the Federal Reserve has shifted its focus to limiting inflationary
and other potentially adverse effects of the extensive pandemic-related government stimulus, which signals the potential for a continued
period of economic uncertainty even though the pandemic has subsided. In addition, there are continuing concerns related to, among other
things, the level of U.S. government debt and fiscal actions that may be taken to address that debt, a potential resurgence of economic
and political tensions with China and the Russian invasion of Ukraine, all of which may have a destabilizing effect on financial markets
and economic activity. Economic pressure on consumers and overall economic uncertainty may result in changes in consumer and business
spending, borrowing and saving habits. These economic conditions and/or other negative developments in the domestic or international
credit markets or economies may significantly affect the markets in which we do business, the value of our loans and investments, and
our ongoing operations, costs and profitability. Declines in real estate values and sales volumes and high unemployment or underemployment
may also result in higher than expected loan delinquencies, increases in our levels of nonperforming and classified assets and a decline
in demand for our products and services. These negative events may cause us to incur losses and may adversely affect our capital, liquidity
and financial condition. 

The
Continuing COVID-19 Pandemic Could Adversely Affect Our Businesses and Our Customers, Counterparties, Employees, and Third-Party Service
Providers. The pandemic has adversely affected, and may continue to adversely affect, our customers and other businesses in our
market area, as well as counterparties and third party vendors. Although many health and safety restrictions have been lifted and vaccine
distribution has increased, certain adverse consequences of the pandemic continue to impact the macroeconomic environment and may continue
to persist. The growth in economic activity and demand for goods and services, alongside labor shortages and supply chain complications
and/or disruptions, has also contributed to rising inflationary pressures. The final outcome and/or potential duration of the economic
disruption that resulted from the onset and subsequent recovery from COVID-19 remains uncertain at this time as the financial markets
continue to be impacted. Our business and operations have not been materially impacted by COVID-19 as of December 31, 2022. However,
the ongoing pandemic could cause us to experience higher credit losses in our lending portfolio, impairment of our goodwill and other
financial assets, reduced demand for our products and services and other negative impacts on our financial position, results of operations
and prospects. Sustained adverse effects may also prevent us from satisfying our minimum regulatory capital ratios and other supervisory
requirements or result in downgrades in our credit ratings. As a result, the full extent of the resulting adverse impacts on our business,
financial condition, liquidity and results of operations remains inestimable at this time, and will depend on a number of evolving factors
and future developments beyond our control and that we are unable to predict. 

Interest
Rate Volatility Could Adversely Affect Our Results of Operations and Financial Condition. We cannot predict or control changes
in interest rates. Interest rates are highly sensitive to many factors that are beyond the Company s control, including monetary
policy of the federal government, inflation and deflation, volatility of domestic and global financial markets, volatility of credit
markets, and competition. In response to the economic conditions resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic, the Federal Reserve Board's target
Fed Funds Rate was reduced to nearly 0 in March 2020. However, in a series of actions to combat rising inflation that began in March
2022, the Federal Reserve Board raised the Fed Funds Rate to 4.50 - 4.75 as of February 1, 2023. Changes in monetary policy, including
changes in interest rates, influence not only the interest we receive on loans and securities and the interest we pay on deposits and
borrowings, but such changes could affect our ability to originate loans and obtain deposits, the fair value of financial assets and
liabilities, and the average duration of our assets. 

32 

The
Company s earnings and cash flows are largely dependent upon its net interest income, meaning the difference between interest income
earned on interest-earning assets and interest expense paid on interest-bearing liabilities. Net interest income is the most significant
component of our net income, accounting for approximately 85.5 of total revenues in 2022. Changes in market interest rates, in the shape
of the yield curve or in spreads between different market interest rates can have a material effect on our net interest margin. The rates
on some interest-earning assets, such as loans and investments, and interest-bearing liabilities, such as deposits and borrowings, adjust
concurrently with, or within a brief period after, changes in market interest rates, while others adjust only periodically or not at
all during their terms. Thus, changes in market interest rates might, for example, result in an increase in the interest paid on interest-bearing
liabilities that is not accompanied by a corresponding increase in the interest earned on interest-earning assets, or the increase in
interest earned might be at a slower pace, or in a smaller amount, than the increase in interest paid, reducing our net interest income
and/or net interest margin. In addition, we rely on lower-cost, core deposits as our primary source of funding and changes in interest
rates could increase our cost of funding, reduce our net interest margin and/or create liquidity challenges We have policies and procedures
designed to manage the risks associated with changes in interest rates and actively manage these risks through hedging and other risk
mitigation strategies. However, if our assumptions are wrong or overall economic conditions are significantly different than anticipated,
our hedging and other risk mitigation strategies may be ineffective and may adversely impact our financial condition and results of operations. 

 Our
Loan Portfolio Includes Loans with a Higher Risk of Loss. The Company originates commercial and industrial loans, commercial
real estate loans, consumer loans, and residential mortgage loans primarily within its market area. The lending strategy focuses on residential
real estate lending as well as servicing commercial customers, including increased emphasis on commercial and industrial lending and
commercial deposit relationships. Commercial and industrial loans, commercial real estate loans, and consumer loans may expose a lender
to greater credit risk than loans secured by residential real estate because the collateral securing these loans may not be sold as easily
as residential real estate. In addition, commercial real estate and commercial and industrial loans may also involve relatively large
loan balances to individual borrowers or groups of borrowers. 

 These
loans also have greater credit risk than residential real estate for the following reasons: 

Commercial
 Real Estate Loans. Repayment is dependent on income being generated in amounts sufficient
 to cover operating expenses and debt service. 

Commercial
 and Industrial Loans. Repayment is generally dependent upon the successful operation
 of the borrower's business. 

Consumer
 Loans. Consumer loans are collateralized, if at all, with assets that may not provide
 an adequate source of payment of the loan due to depreciation, damage or loss. 

Any
downturn in the real estate market or local economy could adversely affect the value of the properties securing the loans or revenues
from the borrowers businesses thereby increasing the risk of nonperforming loans. 

The
Company s Allowance for Loan Losses May Not be Adequate to Cover Loan Losses, Which Could Have a Material Adverse Effect on the
Company s Business, Financial Condition and Results of Operations. A significant source of risk for the Company arises
from the possibility that losses will be sustained because borrowers, guarantors and related parties may fail to perform in accordance
with the terms of their loan agreements. Most loans originated by the Bank are secured, but some loans are unsecured based upon management s
evaluation of the creditworthiness of the borrowers. With respect to secured loans, the collateral securing the repayment of these loans
principally includes a wide variety of real estate, and to a lesser extent personal property, either of which may be insufficient to
cover the obligations owed under such loans. 

Collateral
values and the financial performance of borrowers may be adversely affected by changes in prevailing economic, environmental and other
conditions, including declines in the value of real estate, changes in interest rates and debt service levels, changes in oil and gas
prices, changes in monetary and fiscal policies of the federal government, widespread disease, terrorist activity, environmental contamination
and other external events, which are beyond the control of the Company. In addition, collateral appraisals that are out of date or that
do not meet industry recognized standards might create the impression that a loan is adequately collateralized when in fact it is not.
Although the Company may acquire any real estate or other assets that secure defaulted loans through foreclosures or other similar remedies,
the amounts owed under the defaulted loans may exceed the value of the assets acquired. 

33 

The
Company maintains an allowance for loan losses, which is established through a provision for loan losses charged to earnings, that represents
management s estimate of probable losses inherent within the existing portfolio of loans. The determination of the appropriate
level of the allowance for loan losses inherently involves a high degree of subjectivity and requires the Company to make significant
estimates of current credit risks and trends, all of which may undergo material changes. In addition, bank regulatory agencies periodically
review the Company s allowance for loan losses and may require an increase in the provision for loan losses or the recognition
of further loan charge-offs, based on judgments that differ from those of the Company s management. While the Company strives to
carefully monitor credit quality and to identify loans that may become nonperforming, it may not be able to identify deteriorating loans
before they become nonperforming assets, or be able to limit losses on those loans that have been identified to be nonperforming. On
January 1, 2023, FASB-announced changes to accounting standards that impact the way banking organizations estimate their allowance for
loan losses became effective for the Company. These changes or any others to accounting rules governing credit impairment estimates and
recognition may increase the level of the allowance for loan losses. Any increases in the allowance for loan losses subsequent to adoption
will result in a decrease in net income and, depending upon the magnitude of the changes, could have a material adverse effect on the
Company s financial condition and results of operations. 

Increases
in the Company's Nonperforming Assets Could Adversely Affect the Company's Results of Operations and Financial Condition in the Future.
 Nonperforming assets adversely affect net income in various ways. While the Company pays interest expense to fund nonperforming
assets, no interest income is recorded on nonaccrual loans or other real estate owned, thereby adversely affecting income and returns
on assets and equity. In addition, loan administration and workout costs increase, resulting in additional reductions of earnings. When
taking collateral in foreclosures and similar proceedings, the Company is required to carry the property or loan at its then-estimated
fair market value less estimated cost to sell, which, when compared to the carrying value of the loan, may result in a loss. These nonperforming
loans and other real estate owned also increase the Company's risk profile and the capital that regulators believe is appropriate in
light of such risks, and have an impact on the Company's FDIC risk based deposit insurance premium rate. The resolution of nonperforming
assets requires significant time commitments from management and staff. The Company may experience further increases in nonperforming
loans in the future, and nonperforming assets may result in further costs and losses in the future, either of which could have a material
adverse effect on the Company's financial condition and results of operations. 

The
Company's Use of Appraisals in Deciding Whether to Make a Loan Does Not Ensure the Value of the Collateral. In considering whether
to make a loan secured by real property or other business assets, the Company generally requires an internal evaluation or independent
appraisal of the asset. However, these assessment methods are only an estimate of the value of the collateral at the time the assessment
is made, and involve a large degree of estimates and assumptions and an error in fact or judgment could adversely affect the reliability
of the valuation. Changes in those estimates resulting from continuing change in the economic environment and events occurring after
the initial assessment may cause the value of the assets to decrease in future periods. As future events and their effects cannot be
determined with precision, actual values could differ significantly from these estimates. As a result of any of these factors, the value
of collateral backing a loan may be less than estimated at the time of assessment, and if a default occurs the Company may not recover
the outstanding balance of the loan. 

The
Company s Investments are Subject to Interest Rate Risks, Credit Risk and Liquidity Risk and Declines in Value in its Investments
May Require the Company to Record OTTI Charges That Could Have a Material Adverse Effect on the Company s Results of Operations
and Financial Condition. There are inherent risks associated with the Company s investment activities, many of which are
beyond the Company s control. These risks include the impact from changes in interest rates, weakness in real estate, municipalities,
government-sponsored enterprises, or other industries, the impact of changes in income tax rates on the value of tax-exempt securities,
adverse changes in regional or national economic conditions, and general turbulence in domestic and foreign financial markets, among
other things. These conditions could adversely impact the fair market value and/or the ultimate collectability of the Company s
investments. In addition to fair market value impairment, carrying values may be adversely impacted due to a fundamental deterioration
of the individual municipality, government agency, or corporation whose debt obligations the Company owns or of the individual company
or fund in which the Company has invested. 

If
an investment s value is deemed other than temporarily impaired, then the Company is required to write down the carrying value
of the investment which may involve a charge to earnings. The determination of the level of OTTI involves a high degree of judgment and
requires the Company to make significant estimates of current market risks and future trends, all of which may undergo material changes.
Any OTTI charges, depending upon the magnitude of the charges, could have a material adverse effect on the Company s financial
condition and results of operations. 

34 

The
Company is Subject to Environmental Risks Associated with Real Estate Held as Collateral or Occupied. When a borrower defaults
on a loan secured by real property, the Company may purchase the property in foreclosure or accept a deed to the property surrendered
by the borrower. The Company may also take over the management of commercial properties whose owners have defaulted on loans. The Company
also occupies owned and leased premises where branches and other bank facilities are located. While the Company's lending, foreclosure
and facilities policies and guidelines are intended to exclude properties with an unreasonable risk of contamination, hazardous substances
could exist on some of the properties that the Company may own, acquire, manage or occupy. Environmental laws could force the Company
to clean up the properties at the Company's expense. The Company may also be held liable to a governmental entity or to third parties
for property damage, personal injury, investigation and clean-up costs incurred by these parties in connection with environmental contamination,
or may be required to investigate or clean up hazardous or toxic substances, or chemical releases at a property. The cost associated
with investigation or remediation activities could be substantial and could increase the Company s operating expenses. It may cost
much more to clean a property than the property is worth and it may be difficult or impossible to sell contaminated properties. The Company
could also be liable for pollution generated by a borrower s operations if the Company takes a role in managing those operations
after a default. In addition, as the owner or former owner of a contaminated site, we may be subject to common law claims by third parties
based on damages and costs resulting from environmental contamination emanating from the property. 

Climate
Change or Government Action and Societal Responses to Climate Change Could Adversely Affect Our Results of Operations. Climate
change can increase the likelihood of the occurrence and severity of natural disasters and can also result in longer-term shifts in climate
patterns such as extreme heat, sea level rise and more frequent and prolonged drought. Such significant climate change effects may negatively
impact the Company s geographic markets, disrupting the operations of the Company, our customers or third parties on which we rely.
Damages to real estate underlying mortgage loans or real estate collateral and declines in economic conditions in geographic markets
in which the Company s customers operate may impact our customers ability to repay loans or maintain deposits due to climate
change effects, which could increase our delinquency rates and average credit loss. 

Moreover,
as the effects of climate change continue to create a level of concern for the state of the global environment, companies are facing
increasing scrutiny from customers, regulators, investors and other stakeholders related to their environmental, social and governance ESG practices and disclosure. New government regulations could result in more stringent forms of ESG oversight and reporting
and diligence and disclosure requirements. Increased ESG related compliance costs, in turn, could result in increases to our overall
operational costs. Failure to adapt to or comply with regulatory requirements or investor or stakeholder expectations and standards,
including with respect to the Company s involvement in certain industries or projects associated with causing or exacerbating climate
change, may negatively affect the Company s reputation and commercial relationships, which could adversely affect our business. 

Competition
in Our Primary Market Area May Reduce Our Ability to Attract and Retain Deposits and Originate Loans. We operate in a competitive
market for both attracting deposits, which is our primary source of funds, and originating loans. Historically, our most direct competition
for deposits has come from savings and commercial banks. Our competition for loans comes principally from commercial banks, savings institutions,
mortgage banking firms, credit unions, finance companies, mutual funds, insurance companies and brokerage and investment banking firms.
We also face additional competition from internet-based institutions, brokerage firms and insurance companies. Competition for loan originations
and deposits may limit our future growth and earnings prospects. 

Deposit
Outflows May Increase Reliance on Borrowings and Brokered Deposits as Sources of Funds. The Company has traditionally funded
asset growth principally through deposits and borrowings. As a general matter, deposits are typically a lower cost source of funds than
external wholesale funding (brokered deposits and borrowed funds), because interest rates paid for deposits are typically less than interest
rates charged for wholesale funding. If, as a result of competitive pressures, market interest rates, alternative investment opportunities
that present more attractive returns to customers, general economic conditions or other events, the balance of the Company s deposits
decreases relative to the Company s overall banking operations, the Company may have to rely more heavily on wholesale or other
sources of external funding, or may have to increase deposit rates to maintain deposit levels in the future. Any such increased reliance
on wholesale funding, or increases in funding rates in general could have a negative impact on the Company s net interest income
and, consequently, on its results of operations and financial condition. 

35 

The
Company, as Part of its Strategic Plans, Periodically Considers Potential Acquisitions. The Risks Presented by Acquisitions Could Adversely
Affect Our Financial Condition and Results of Operations . Any acquisitions will be accompanied by the risks commonly encountered
in acquisitions including, among other things: our ability to realize anticipated cost savings and avoid unanticipated costs relating
to the merger, the difficulty of integrating operations and personnel, the potential disruption of our or the acquired company s
ongoing business, the inability of our management to maximize our financial and strategic position, the inability to maintain uniform
standards, controls, procedures and policies, and the impairment of relationships with the acquired company s employees and customers
as a result of changes in ownership and management. These risks may prevent us from fully realizing the anticipated benefits of an acquisition
or cause the realization of such benefits to take longer than expected. 

The
Company Relies on Third-Party Service Providers. The Company relies on independent firms to provide critical services necessary
to conducting its business. These services include, but are not limited to: electronic funds delivery networks; check clearing houses;
electronic banking services; investment advisory, management and custodial services; correspondent banking services; information security
assessments and technology support services; and loan underwriting and review services. The occurrence of any failures or interruptions
of the independent firms systems or in their delivery of services, or failure to perform in accordance with contracted service
level agreements, for any number of reasons could also impact the Company's ability to conduct business and process transactions and
result in loss of customer business and damage to the Company's reputation, any of which may have a material adverse effect on the Company s
business, financial condition and results of operation. 

The
Company Relies on Dividends from the Bank for Substantially All of its Revenue. The Company is a separate and distinct legal
entity from the Bank. It receives substantially all of its revenue from dividends paid by the Bank. These dividends are the
principal source of funds used to pay dividends on the Company s common stock and interest and principal on the
Company s subordinated debt. Various federal and state laws and regulations limit the amount of dividends that the Bank may
pay to the Company. If the Bank, due to its capital position, inadequate net income levels, or otherwise, is unable to pay dividends
to the Company, then the Company will be unable to service debt, pay obligations or pay dividends on the Company s common
stock. The OCC also has the authority to use its enforcement powers to prohibit the Bank from paying dividends if, in its opinion,
the payment of dividends would constitute an unsafe or unsound practice. The Bank s inability to pay dividends could have a
material adverse effect on the Company s business, financial condition, results of operations and the market price of the
Company s common stock. 

The
Carrying Value of the Company s Goodwill Could Become Impaired. In accordance with GAAP, the Company does not amortize
goodwill and instead, at least annually, evaluates whether the carrying value of goodwill has become impaired. Impairment of goodwill
may occur when the estimated fair value of the Company is less than its recorded book value (i.e., the net book value of its recorded
assets and liabilities). This may occur, for example, when the estimated fair value of the Company declines due to changes in the assumptions
and inputs used in management s estimate of fair value. A determination that goodwill has become impaired results in an immediate
write-down of goodwill to its determined value with a resulting charge to operations. Any write down of goodwill will result in a decrease
in net income and, depending upon the magnitude of the charge, could have a material adverse effect on the Company s financial
condition and results of operations. 

Risks
Related to Legal, Governmental and Regulatory Changes 

If
Dividends Are Not Paid on Our Investment in the FHLB, or if Our Investment is Classified as Other-Than-Temporarily Impaired, Our Earnings
and/or Shareholders Equity Could Decrease. As a member of the FHLB, the Company is required to own a minimum required
amount of FHLB capital stock, calculated periodically based primarily on its level of borrowings from the FHLB. This stock is classified
as a restricted investment and carried at cost, which management believes approximates fair value of the FHLB stock. If negative events
or deterioration in the FHLB financial condition or capital levels occurs, the Company's investment in FHLB capital stock may become
other-than-temporarily impaired to some degree. There can be no assurance that FHLB stock dividends will be declared in the future. If
either of these were to occur, the Company s results of operations and financial condition may be adversely affected. 

Concentration
in Commercial Real Estate Lending is Subject to Heightened Risk Management and Regulatory Review. If a concentration in commercial
real estate lending is present, as measured under government banking regulations, management must employ heightened risk management practices
that address the following key elements: board and management oversight and strategic planning, portfolio management, development of
underwriting standards, risk assessment and monitoring through market analysis and stress testing, and maintenance of increased capital
levels as needed to support the level of commercial real estate lending. If a concentration is determined to exist, the Company may incur
additional operating expenses in order to comply with additional risk management practices and increased capital requirements which could
have a material adverse effect on the Company s financial condition and results of operations. 

36 

Replacement
of the London Interbank Offered Rate Could Adversely Affect Our Business, Financial Condition, and Results of Operations .
 In 2017, the United Kingdom s Financial Conduct Authority FCA ), which regulates the London Interbank Offered
Rate LIBOR ), announced that the FCA intends to stop persuading or compelling banks to submit the rates required to calculate
LIBOR after 2021. This announcement indicates that the continuation of LIBOR on the current basis cannot and will not be guaranteed after
2021. The U.S. bank regulators issued a Statement on LIBOR Transition on November 30, 2020 and subsequent guidance encouraging
banks to transition away from U.S. Dollar (USD) LIBOR by December 31, 2021 at the latest for new contracts. LIBOR is currently anticipated
to be fully phased out by June 30, 2023. The Alternative Reference Rates Committee ARRC has proposed that the Secured
Overnight Financing Rate SOFR is the rate that represents best practice as the alternative to LIBOR for use in derivatives
and other financial contracts that are currently indexed to LIBOR. ARRC has proposed a paced market transition plan to SOFR from LIBOR
and organizations are currently working on industry wide and company specific transition plans as it relates to derivatives and cash
markets exposed to LIBOR . Management is monitoring ARRC publications
for best practices as the Company transitions legacy LIBOR loans by the June 30, 2023 deadline. The Company adopted SOFR as its
preferred benchmark as an alternative to LIBOR for use in new and legacy contracts beginning on January 1, 2022. 

We
have certain loans, derivative contracts, and other financial instruments with attributes that are either directly or indirectly dependent
on LIBOR. The transition from LIBOR, or any changes or reforms to the determination or supervision of LIBOR, could
have an adverse impact on the market for or value of any LIBOR-linked securities, loans, and other financial obligations or extensions
of credit held by or due to us, could create considerable costs and additional risk and could have an adverse impact on our overall financial
condition or results of operations. Since proposed alternative rates are calculated differently, payments under contracts referencing
new rates will differ from those referencing LIBOR. The transition will change our market risk profiles, requiring changes to risk
and pricing models, valuation tools, product design and hedging strategies. Furthermore, failure to adequately manage this transition
process with our customers could adversely impact our reputation. Although we are currently unable to assess what the ultimate impact
of the transition from LIBOR will be, failure to adequately manage the transition could have a material adverse effect on our
business, financial condition and results of operations. 

Sources
of External Funding Could Become Restricted and Impact the Company s Liquidity. The Company s external wholesale
funding sources include borrowing capacity at the FHLB, capacity in the brokered deposit markets, other borrowing arrangements with correspondent
banks, as well as accessing the public markets through offerings of the Company s stock or issuance of debt. If, as a result of
general economic conditions or other events, these sources of external funding become restricted or are eliminated, the Company may not
be able to raise adequate funds or may incur substantially higher funding costs or operating restrictions in order to raise the necessary
funds to support the Company's operations and growth. Any such increase in funding costs or restrictions could have a negative impact
on the Company s net interest income and, consequently, on its results of operations and financial condition. 

We
Operate In a Highly-Regulated Environment That is Subject to Extensive Government Supervision and Regulation, Which May Interfere With
Our Ability to Conduct Business and May Adversely Impact the Results of our Operations. Banking regulations are primarily intended
to protect depositors funds, federal deposit insurance funds and the banking system as a whole, not the interests of stockholders.
These regulations affect the Company s lending practices, capital structure, investment practices, dividend policy and growth,
among other things. The Company is subject to extensive federal and state supervision and regulation that govern nearly all aspects of
our operations and can have a material impact on our business. Federal banking agencies have significant discretion regarding the supervision,
regulation and enforcement of banking laws and regulations. 

Financial
laws, regulations and policies are subject to amendment by Congress, state legislatures and federal and state regulatory agencies. Changes
to statutes, regulations or policies, including changes in the interpretation of regulations or policies, could materially impact our
business. These changes could also impose additional costs on us and limit the types of products and services that we may offer our customers.
Compliance with laws and regulations can be difficult and costly, and the failure to comply with any law, regulation or policy could
result in sanctions by financial regulatory agencies, including civil monetary penalties, private lawsuits, or reputational damage, any
of which could adversely affect our business, financial condition, or results of operations. While we have policies and procedures designed
to prevent such violations, there can be no assurance that violations will not occur. See the section titled, Supervision and
Regulation in ITEM 1. Business. 

37 

Since the 2008 global financial crisis, financial
institutions have been subject to increased scrutiny from Congress, state legislatures and federal and state financial regulatory agencies.
Changes to the legal and regulatory framework have significantly altered the laws and regulations under which we operate. Compliance with
these changes and any additional or amended laws, regulations and regulatory policies may reduce our ability to effectively compete in
attracting and retaining customers. The passage and continued implementation of the Dodd-Frank Act, among other laws and regulations,
has increased our costs of doing business and resulted in decreased revenues and net income. We cannot provide assurance that future changes
in laws, regulations and policies will not adversely affect our business. 

State and Federal Regulatory Agencies Periodically
Conduct Examinations of Our Business, Including for Compliance With Laws and Regulations, and Our Failure to Comply With Any Supervisory
Actions to Which We Are or Become Subject as a Result of Such Examinations May Adversely Affect Our Business. Federal and state
regulatory agencies periodically conduct examinations of our business, including our compliance with applicable laws and regulations.
If, as a result of an examination, an agency were to determine that the financial, capital resources, asset quality, earnings prospects,
management, liquidity, or other aspects of any of our operations had become unsatisfactory, or violates any law or regulation, such agency
may take certain remedial or enforcement actions it deems appropriate to correct any deficiency. Remedial or enforcement actions include
the power to enjoin unsafe or unsound practices, to require affirmative actions to correct any conditions resulting from
any violation or practice, to issue an administrative order that can be judicially enforced against a bank, to direct an increase in the
bank s capital, to restrict the bank s growth, to assess civil monetary penalties against a bank s officers or directors,
and to remove officers and directors. In the event that the FDIC concludes that, among other things, our financial conditions cannot be
corrected or that there is an imminent risk of loss to our depositors, it may terminate our deposit insurance. The OCC, as the supervisory
and regulatory authority for federal savings associations, has similar enforcement powers with respect to our business. The CFPB also
has authority to take enforcement actions, including cease-and-desist orders or civil monetary penalties, if it finds that we offer consumer
financial products and services in violation of federal consumer financial protection laws. 

If we were unable to comply with future regulatory
directives, or if we were unable to comply with the terms of any future supervisory requirements to which we may become subject, then
we could become subject to a variety of supervisory actions and orders, including cease and desist orders, prompt corrective actions,
memoranda of understanding, and other regulatory enforcement actions. Such supervisory actions could, among other things, impose greater
restrictions on our business, as well as our ability to develop any new business. We could also be required to raise additional capital,
or dispose of certain assets and liabilities within a prescribed time period, or both. Failure to implement remedial measures as required
by financial regulatory agencies could result in additional orders or penalties from federal and state regulators, which could trigger
one or more of the remedial actions described above. The terms of any supervisory action and associated consequences with any failure
to comply with any supervisory action could have a material negative effect on our business, operating flexibility and overall financial
condition. 

The Company s Capital Levels Could Fall
Below Regulatory Minimums. The Company and the Bank are subject to the capital adequacy guidelines of the FRB and the OCC, respectively.
Failure to meet applicable minimum capital ratio requirements (including the capital conservation buffer imposed by Basel
III) may subject the Company and/or the Bank to various enforcement actions and restrictions. If the Company s capital levels decline,
or if regulatory requirements increase, and the Company is unable to raise additional capital to offset that decline or meet the increased
requirements, then its capital ratios may fall below regulatory capital adequacy levels. The Company s capital ratios could decline
due to it experiencing rapid asset growth, or due to other factors, such as, by way of example only, possible future net operating losses,
impairment charges against tangible or intangible assets, or adjustments to retained earnings due to changes in accounting rules. 

The Company's failure to remain adequately-capitalized 
for bank regulatory purposes could affect customer confidence, restrict the Company's ability to grow (both assets and branching activity),
increase the Company's costs of funds and FDIC insurance costs, prohibit the Company's ability to pay dividends on common shares, and
its ability to make acquisitions, and have a negative impact on the Company's business, results of operation and financial conditions,
generally. If the Bank ceases to be a well-capitalized institution for bank regulatory purposes, its ability to accept brokered
deposits and the interest rates that it pays may be restricted. 

38 

Changes
in Tax Policies at Both the Federal and State Levels Could Impact the Company's Financial Condition and Results of Operations. The
Company s financial performance is impacted by federal and state tax laws. Enactment of new legislation, or changes in the interpretation
of existing law, may have a material effect on the Company s financial condition and results of operations. A deferred tax asset
is created by the tax effect of the differences between an asset s book value and its tax basis. The deferred tax asset is measured
using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which the temporary differences are expected to be recovered
or settled. Accordingly, a reduction in enacted tax rates may result in a decrease in current tax expense and a decrease to the Company s
deferred tax asset, with an offsetting charge to current tax expense. The alternative would occur with an increase to enacted tax rates.
In addition, certain tax strategies taken in the past derive their tax benefit from the current enacted tax rates. Accordingly, a change
in enacted tax rates may result in a decrease/increase to anticipated benefit of the Company s previous transactions which in turn,
could have a material effect on the Company's financial condition and results of operations. 

Risks
Related to Cybersecurity and Data Privacy 

We
Face Cybersecurity Risks and Risks Associated With Security Breaches Which Have the Potential to Disrupt Our Operations, Cause Material
Harm to Our Financial Condition, Result in Misappropriation of Assets, Compromise Confidential Information and/or Damage Our Business
Relationships and Can Provide No Assurance That the Steps We and Our Service Providers Take in Response to These Risks Will Be Effective.
 We depend upon data processing, communication and information exchange on a variety of computing platforms and networks and over
the internet. In addition, we rely on the services of a variety of vendors to meet our data processing and communication needs. 
We face cybersecurity risks and risks associated with security breaches or disruptions such as those through cyber-attacks or cyber intrusions
over the internet, malware, computer viruses, attachments to emails, social engineering and phishing schemes or persons inside our organization.
The risk of a security breach or disruption, particularly through cyber-attacks or cyber intrusions, including by computer hackers, nation-state
affiliated actors, and cyber terrorists, has generally increased as the number, intensity and sophistication of attempted attacks and
intrusions from around the world have increased. These incidents may result in disruption of our operations, material harm to our financial
condition, cash flows and the market price of our common stock, misappropriation of assets, compromise or corruption of confidential
information collected in the course of conducting our business, liability for stolen information or assets, increased cybersecurity protection
and insurance costs, regulatory enforcement, litigation and damage to our stakeholder relationships. These risks require continuous and
likely increasing attention and other resources from us to, among other actions, identify and quantify these risks, upgrade and expand
our technologies, systems and processes to adequately address them and provide periodic training for our employees to assist them in
detecting phishing, malware and other schemes. Such attention diverts time and other resources from other activities and there is no
assurance that our efforts will be effective. 

In
the normal course of business, we collect and retain certain personal information provided by our customers, employees and vendors. We
also rely extensively on computer systems to process transactions and manage our business. We can provide no assurance that the data
security measures designed to protect confidential information on our systems established by us will be able to prevent unauthorized
access to this personal information. There can be no assurance that our efforts to maintain the security and integrity of the information
we and our service providers collect and our and their computer systems will be effective or that attempted security breaches or disruptions
would not be successful or damaging. Even the most well protected information, networks, systems and facilities remain potentially
vulnerable because the techniques used in such attempted security breaches evolve and generally are not recognized until launched against
a target, and in some cases are designed not be detected and, in fact, may not be detected. Accordingly, we may be unable to anticipate
these techniques or to implement adequate security barriers or other preventative measures, and thus it is impossible for us to entirely
mitigate this risk. 

We
Continually Encounter Technological Change and The Failure to Understand and Adapt to These Changes Could Hurt Our Business. The
financial services industry is undergoing rapid technological change with frequent introductions of new technology-driven products and
services and technological advances are likely to intensify competition. The effective use of technology increases efficiency and enables
financial institutions to better serve customers and to reduce costs. Our future success depends, in part, upon our ability to address
the needs of our customers by using technology to provide products and services that will satisfy customer demands, as well as to create
additional efficiencies in our operations. Many of our competitors have substantially greater resources to invest in technological improvements.
We may not be able to effectively implement new technology-driven products and services or be successful in marketing these products
and services to customers. Failure to successfully keep pace with technological changes affecting the financial services industry could
have a material adverse impact on our business and, in turn, our financial condition and results of operations. 

39 

General Risk Factors 

Changes in the Local Economy May Affect our
Future Growth Possibilities. The Company s success depends principally on the general economic conditions of the primary
market areas in which the Company operates. The local economic conditions in these regions have a significant impact on the demand for
the Company s products and services, as well as the ability of the Company s customers to repay loans, the value of the collateral
securing loans and the stability of the Company s deposit funding sources. The Company s market area is principally located
in Hampden and Hampshire Counties, Massachusetts and Hartford and Tolland Counties in northern Connecticut. The local economy may affect
future growth possibilities. The Company s future growth opportunities depend on the growth and stability of our regional economy
and the ability to expand in our market area. 

Natural Disasters, Acts of Terrorism, Public Health Issues and Other External Events Could Harm Our Business. Natural
disasters can disrupt our operations, result in damage to our properties, reduce or destroy the value of the collateral for our loans
and negatively affect the economies in which we operate, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and
financial condition. The emergence of widespread health emergencies or pandemics, such as the spread of COVID-19, has and may again lead
to regional quarantines, business shutdowns, labor shortages, disruptions to supply chains, and overall economic instability. Events
such as these may become more common in the future and could cause significant damage such as disruptions to power and communication
services, impacting the stability of our facilities and result in additional expenses, impairing the ability of our borrowers to repay
outstanding loans or reducing the value of collateral securing the repayment of our loans, which could result in the loss of revenue
and/or cause us to incur additional expenses. A significant natural disaster, such as a tornado, hurricane, earthquake, fire or flood,
could have a material adverse impact on our ability to conduct business, and our insurance coverage may be insufficient to compensate
for losses that may occur. Acts of terrorism, war, civil unrest, violence or human error could cause disruptions to our business or the
economy as a whole. While we have established and regularly test disaster recovery procedures, the occurrence of any such event could
have a material adverse effect on our business, operations and financial condition. 

The Company May Not be Able to Attract, Retain
or Develop Key Personnel. The Company s success depends, in large part, on its ability to attract, retain and develop key
personnel. Competition for the best people in most activities engaged in by the Company can be intense, and the Company may not be able
to hire or retain the key personnel that it depends upon for success. The unexpected loss of key personnel or the inability to identify
and develop individuals for planned succession to key senior positions within management, or on the Board, could have a material adverse
impact on the Company s business because of the loss of their skills, knowledge of the Company s market, years of industry
or business experience and the difficulty of promptly finding qualified replacements. 

Controls and Procedures Could Fail, or Be Circumvented
by Theft, Fraud or Robbery. Management regularly reviews and updates the Company s internal controls over financial reporting,
corporate governance policies, compensation policies, Code of Business Conduct and Ethics and security controls to prevent and detect
theft, fraud or robbery from both internal and external sources. Any system of controls, however well designed and operated, is based
in part on certain assumptions and can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurances that the objectives of the system are met. Any
failure or circumvention of the Company s internal controls and procedures, or failure to comply with regulations related to controls
and procedures, or a physical theft or robbery, whether by employees, management, directors, or external elements, or any illegal activity
conducted by a Bank customer, could result in loss of assets, regulatory actions against the Company, financial loss, damage the Company s
reputation, cause a loss of customer business, and expose the Company to civil litigation and possible financial liability, any of which
could have a material adverse effect on the Company s business, results of operations and financial condition. 

40 

Damage to the Company s Reputation Could
Affect the Company s Profitability and Shareholders' Value. The Company is dependent on its reputation within its market
area, as a trusted and responsible financial company, for all aspects of its business with customers,
employees, vendors, third-party service providers, and others, with whom the Company conducts business or potential future business. Any
negative publicity or public complaints, whether real or perceived, disseminated by word of mouth, by the general media, by electronic
or social networking means, or by other methods, regarding, among other things, the Company s current or potential business practices
or activities, cyber-security issues, regulatory compliance, an inability to meet obligations, employees, management or directors 
ethical standards or actions, or about the banking industry in general, could harm the Company s reputation. Any damage to the Company s
reputation could affect its ability to retain and develop the business relationships necessary to conduct business which in turn could
negatively impact the Company s profitability and shareholders value. 

The Company is Exposed to Legal Claims and Litigation.
 The Company is subject to legal challenges under a variety of circumstances in the course of its normal business practices in
regards to laws and regulations, duties, customer expectations of service levels, in addition to potentially illegal activity (at a federal
or state level) conducted by any of our customers, use of technology and patents, operational practices and those of contracted third-party
service providers and vendors, and stockholder matters, among others. Regardless of the scope or the merits of any claims by potential
or actual litigants, the Company may have to engage in litigation that could be expensive, time-consuming, disruptive to the Company's
operations, and distracting to management. Whether claims or legal action are founded or unfounded, if such claims and legal actions are
not resolved in a manner favorable to the Company, they may result in significant financial liability, damage the Company s reputation,
subject the Company to additional regulatory scrutiny and restrictions, and/or adversely affect the market perception of our products
and services, as well as impact customer demand for those products and services. Any financial liability or reputation damage could have
a material adverse effect on the Company's business, which in turn, could have a material adverse effect on the Company's financial condition
and results of operations. 

The Company s Insurance Coverage May Not
be Adequate to Prevent Additional Liabilities or Expenses. The Company maintains insurance policies that provide coverage for
various risks at levels the Company deems adequate to provide reasonable coverage for losses. The coverage applies to incidents and events
which may impact such areas as: loss of bank facilities; accidental injury or death of employees; injuries sustained on bank premises;
cyber and technology attacks or breaches; loss of customer nonpublic personal information; processing of fraudulent transactions; robberies,
embezzlement and theft; improper processing of negotiable items or electronic transactions; improper loan underwriting and perfection
of collateral, among others. These policies will provide varying degrees of coverage for losses under specific circumstances, and in most
cases after related deductible amounts are paid by the Company. However, there is no guarantee that the circumstance of an incident will
meet the criteria for insurance coverage under a specific policy, and despite the insurance policies in place the Company may experience
a loss incident or event which could have a material adverse effect on the Company s business, reputation, financial condition and
results of operations. 

The Trading Volume in the Company s Common
Stock is Less Than That of Larger Companies. Although the Company s common stock is listed for trading on the NASDAQ, the
trading volume in the Company s common stock is substantially less than that of larger companies.
Given the lower trading volume of the Company s common stock, significant purchases or sales of the Company s common stock,
or the expectation of such purchases or sales, could cause significant volatility in the price for the Company s common stock. 

The Market Price of the Company s Common
Stock May Fluctuate Significantly, and This May Make it Difficult for You to Resell Shares of Common Stock Owned by You at Times or at
Prices You Find Attractive. The price of the Company s common stock on the NASDAQ constantly changes. The Company expects
that the market price of its common stock will continue to fluctuate, and the Company cannot give you any assurances regarding any trends
in the market prices for its common stock. 

41 

The
Company s stock price may fluctuate significantly as a result of a variety of factors, many of which are beyond its control. These
factors include, but are not limited to, the Company s: 

past
 and future dividend practice; 

financial
 condition, performance, creditworthiness and prospects; 

quarterly
 variations in the Company s operating results or the quality of the Company s
 assets; 

operating
 results that vary from the expectations of management, securities analysts and investors; 

c hanges
 in expectations as to the Company s future financial performance; 

announcements
 of innovations, new products, strategic developments, significant contracts, acquisitions
 and other material events by the Company or its competitors; 

the
 operating and securities price performance of other companies
 that investors believe are comparable to the Company 

future
 sales of the Company s equity or equity-related securities; 

the
 credit, mortgage and housing markets, the markets for securities relating to mortgages or
 housing, and developments with respect to financial institutions generally; 

catastrophic
 events, including natural disasters, and public health crises; and 

instability
 in global financial markets and global economies and general market conditions, such as interest
 or foreign exchange rates, stock, commodity or real estate valuations or volatility, budget
 deficits or sovereign debt level concerns and other geopolitical, regulatory or judicial
 events . 

In
addition, the banking industry may be more affected than other industries by certain economic, credit, regulatory or information security
issues. Although the Company itself may or may not be directly impacted by such issues, the Company s stock price may vary due
to the influence, both real and perceived, of these issues, among others, on the banking industry in general. Investment in the Company's
stock is not insured against loss by the FDIC, or any other public or private entity. As a result, and for the other reasons described
in this Risk Factors section and elsewhere in this report, if you acquire our common
stock, you may lose some or all of your investment. 

Shareholder
Dilution Could Occur if Additional Stock is Issued in the Future. If the Company s Board of Directors should determine
in the future that there is a need to obtain additional capital through the issuance of additional shares of the Company s common
stock or securities convertible into shares of common stock, such issuances could result in dilution to existing stockholders 
ownership interest. Similarly, if the Board of Directors decides to grant additional stock awards or options for the purchase of shares
of common stock, the issuance of such additional stock awards and/or the issuance of additional shares upon the exercise of such options
would expose stockholders to dilution. 

The
Company's Financial Condition and Results of Operation Rely in Part on Management Estimates and Assumptions. In preparing the
financial statements in conformity with GAAP, management is required to exercise judgment in determining many of the methodologies, estimates
and assumptions to be utilized. These estimates and assumptions affect the reported values of assets and liabilities at the balance sheet
date and income and expenses for the years then ended. Changes in those estimates resulting from continuing change in the economic environment
and other factors will be reflected in the financial statements and results of operations in future periods. As future events and their
effects cannot be determined with precision, actual results could differ significantly from these estimates and be adversely affected
should the assumptions and estimates used be incorrect, or change over time due to changes in circumstances.

Market
Information. 

The
Company s common stock is currently listed on NASDAQ under the trading symbol WNEB. As of December 31, 2022,
there were 22,216,789 shares of the Company s common stock outstanding by approximately 1,973 shareholders, as obtained
through our transfer agent. Such number of shareholders does not reflect the number of persons or entities holding stock in nominee
name through banks, brokerage firms and other nominees. 

Dividend
Policy. 

The
Company maintains a dividend reinvestment and direct stock purchase plan (the DRSPP ). The DRSPP enables stockholders,
at their discretion, to continue to elect to reinvest cash dividends paid on their shares of the Company s common stock
by purchasing additional shares of common stock from the Company at a purchase price equal to fair market value. Under the DRSPP,
stockholders and new investors also have the opportunity to purchase shares of the Company s common stock without brokerage fees,
subject to monthly minimums and maximums. 

Although
the Company has historically paid quarterly dividends on its common stock, the Company s ability to pay such dividends depends
on a number of factors, including restrictions under federal laws and regulations on the Company s ability to pay dividends,
and as a result, there can be no assurance that dividends will be paid in the future. 

Recent
Sales of Unregistered Securities. 

There
were no sales by the Company of unregistered securities during the year ended December 31, 2022.

 DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS. 

The
following discussion should be read in conjunction with the Company s Consolidated Financial Statements and notes thereto,
each appearing elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Management s discussion focuses on 2022 results compared to 2021.
For a discussion of 2021 results compared to 2020, refer to Part II, Item 7 of our Annual Report filed on Form 10-K, which was filed
with the SEC on March 11, 2022. 

Overview. 

We
strive to remain a leader in meeting the financial service needs of the local community and to provide quality service to the
individuals and businesses in the market areas that we have served since 1853. Historically, we have been a community-oriented
provider of traditional banking products and services to business organizations and individuals, including products such as residential
and commercial real estate loans, consumer loans and a variety of deposit products. We meet the needs of our local community through
a community-based and service-oriented approach to banking. 

We
have adopted a growth-oriented strategy that continues to focus on increasing commercial lending and residential lending. Our
strategy also calls for increasing deposit relationships, specifically core deposits, and broadening our product lines and services.
We believe that this business strategy is best for our long-term success and viability, and complements our existing commitment
to high quality customer service. 

In
connection with our overall growth strategy, we seek to: 

Grow
 the Company s commercial loan portfolio and related commercial deposits by targeting
 businesses in our primary market area of Hampden County and Hampshire County in western
 Massachusetts and Hartford and Tolland Counties in northern Connecticut to increase the
 net interest margin and loan income; 

Supplement
 the commercial portfolio by growing the residential real estate portfolio to diversify
 the loan portfolio and deepen customer relationships; 

Focus
 on expanding our retail banking deposit franchise and increase the number of households
 served within our designated market area; 

Invest
 in people, systems and technology to grow revenue, improve efficiency and enhance the
 overall customer experience; 

Grow
 revenues, increase tangible book value, continue to pay competitive dividends to shareholders
 and utilize the Company s stock repurchase plan to leverage our capital and enhance
 franchise value; and 

Consider
 growth through acquisitions. We may pursue expansion opportunities in existing or adjacent
 strategic locations with companies that add complementary products to our existing business
 and at terms that add value to our existing shareholders. 

You
should read the following financial results for the year ended December 31, 2022 in the context of this strategy. 

For
the twelve months ended December 31, 2022, net income was 25.9 million, or 1.18 diluted earnings per share, compared to net
income of 23.7 million, or 1.02 diluted earnings per share, for the twelve months ended December 31, 2021. The results for the
twelve months ended December 31, 2022 showed increases in net interest income and non-interest income, which were both partially
offset by increases in the provision for loan losses and non-interest expense. 

49 

During
the twelve months ended December 31, 2022, net interest income increased 6.0 million, or 8.3 , to 79.2 million, compared to
 73.2 million for the twelve months ended December 31, 2021. The increase in net interest income was due to an increase in interest
and dividend income of 6.1 million, or 7.6 , partially offset by an increase in interest expense of 24,000, or 0.4 . For the
twelve months ended December 31, 2022, the Company generated net interest income growth of 8.3 , overcoming a 6.0 million, or
89.2 , decrease in PPP income as the PPP program comes to a close. Excluding PPP income of 728,000 and 6.8 million for the twelve
months ended December 31, 2022 and the twelve months ended December 31, 2021, respectively, net interest income increased 12.1
million, or 18.2 for the same period. 

For
the twelve months ended December 31, 2022, the provision for loan losses was 700,000, compared to a credit for loan losses of
 925,000 for the twelve months ended December 31, 2021. The Company recorded net charge-offs of 556,000 for the twelve months
ended December 31, 2022, as compared to net charge-offs of 445,000 for the twelve months ended December 31, 2021. 

General. 

Our
consolidated results of operations depend primarily on net interest and dividend income. Net interest and dividend income is the
difference between the interest income earned on interest-earning assets and the interest paid on interest-bearing liabilities.
Interest-earning assets consist primarily of commercial real estate loans, commercial and industrial loans, residential real estate
loans and securities. Interest-bearing liabilities consist primarily of certificates of deposit and money market accounts, demand
deposit accounts and savings account deposits and borrowings from the FHLB. The consolidated results of operations also depend
on the provision for loan losses, non-interest income, and non-interest expense. Non-interest income includes service fees and
charges, income on bank-owned life insurance, gains on sales of mortgages, gains on non-marketable equity investments and gains
(losses) on securities. Non-interest expense includes salaries and employee benefits, occupancy expenses, data processing, advertising
expense, FDIC insurance assessment, professional fees and other general and administrative expenses. 

Loan
Modifications/Troubled Debt Restructurings . 

The
Company implemented a modification deferral program under the CARES Act, which allowed residential, commercial and consumer borrowers
who were adversely affected by the COVID-19 pandemic, to defer loan payments for a set period of time. As of December 31, 2022,
the Company had no modified loans remaining under the CARES Act. 

Allowance
for Loan Losses. 

In
determining the allowance for loan losses, the Company considers quantitative loss factors and a number of qualitative factors,
such as underwriting policies, current economic conditions, delinquency statistics, the adequacy of the underlying collateral
and the financial strength of the borrower. The long-term consequences of the COVID-19 pandemic could cause us to experience higher
credit losses in our lending portfolio, reduce demand for our products and services and other negative impacts on our financial
position, results of operations and prospects. As of December 31, 2022, the Company s delinquency and nonperforming assets
have not been materially impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic, and therefore, have not resulted in material credit losses within
the lending portfolio. 

Critical
Accounting Policies. 

Our
accounting policies are disclosed in Note 1 to our consolidated financial statements. Given our current business strategy and
asset/liability structure, the more critical policy is the allowance for loan losses and provision for loan losses. In addition
to the informational disclosure in the notes to the consolidated financial statements, our policy on this accounting policy is
described in detail in the applicable sections of Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition
and Results of Operations. Senior management has discussed the development and selection of this accounting policy
and the related disclosures with the Audit Committee of our Board of Directors. 

50 

The
process of evaluating the loan portfolio, classifying loans and determining the allowance and provision is described in detail
in Part I under Business Lending Activities - Allowance for Loan Losses. This evaluation is inherently
subjective as it requires material estimates that may be susceptible to significant change. Our methodology for assessing the
allocation of the allowance consists of two key components, which are a specific allowance for impaired loans and a general allowance
for the remainder of the portfolio. Measurement of impairment can be based on present value of expected future cash flows discounted
at the loan s effective interest rate, the loan s observable market price or the fair value of the collateral, if
the loan is collateral dependent. The allocation of the allowance is also reviewed by management based upon our evaluation of
then-existing economic and business conditions affecting our key lending areas and other conditions, such as new loan products,
credit quality trends (including trends in nonperforming loans expected to result from existing conditions), collateral values,
loan volumes and concentrations, specific industry conditions within portfolio segments that existed as of the balance sheet date
and the impact that such conditions were believed to have had on the collectability of the loan portfolio. 

Although
management believes it has established and maintained the allowance for loan losses at adequate levels, if management s
assumptions and judgments prove to be incorrect due to continued deterioration in economic, real estate and other conditions,
and the allowance for loan losses is not adequate to absorb inherent losses, our earnings and capital could be significantly and
adversely affected. There were no changes to the Company s allowance for loan losses methodology during the year ended December
31, 2022. 

Analysis
of Net Interest Income. 

The
Company s earnings are largely dependent on its net interest income, which is the difference between interest earned on
loans and investments and the cost of funding (primarily deposits and borrowings). Net interest income expressed as a percentage
of average interest-earning assets is referred to as net interest margin. For more information regarding the Company s use
of Non-GAAP financial measures see Explanation of Use of Non-GAAP Financial Measurements.

Average
Balance Sheet. 

The following
table sets forth information relating to the Company for the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020. The average yields
and costs are derived by dividing interest income or interest expense by the average balance of interest-earning assets or interest-bearing
liabilities, respectively, for the periods shown. Average balances are derived from average daily balances. The yields include
fees which are considered adjustments to yields. Loan interest and yield data does not include any accrued interest from non-accruing
loans.

Explanation
of Use of Non-GAAP Financial Measurements. 

We
believe that it is common practice in the banking industry to present interest income and related yield information on tax-exempt
loans and securities on a tax-equivalent basis and that such information is useful to investors because it facilitates comparisons
among financial institutions. However, the adjustment of interest income and yields on tax-exempt loans and securities to a tax-equivalent
amount is considered a non-GAAP financial measure. A reconciliation from GAAP to non-GAAP is provided below.

Comparison
of Financial Condition at December 31, 2022 and December 31, 2021. 

At
December 31, 2022, total assets were 2.6 billion, an increase of 14.7 million, or 0.6 , from December 31, 2021. The balance
sheet composition and changes since December 31, 2021 are discussed below. 

Cash
and Cash Equivalents. 

Cash
and cash equivalents is comprised of cash on hand and amounts due from banks, interest-earning deposits in other financial institutions
and federal funds sold. Cash and cash equivalents totaled 30.3 million, or 1.2 of total assets, at December 31, 2022 and 103.5
million, or 4.1 of total assets, at December 31, 2021. Balances in cash and cash equivalents will fluctuate due primarily to
the timing of net deposit flows, borrowing and loan inflows and outflows, investment purchases and maturities, calls and sales
proceeds, and the immediate liquidity needs of the Company. The decrease in cash and cash equivalents at December 31, 2022 is
primarily due to the Company utilizing cash on hand to fund loan growth during the year ended December 31, 2022. 

Investments. 

At
December 31, 2022, the Company s available-for-sale securities portfolio decreased 47.4 million, or 24.4 , from 194.4
million at December 31, 2021 to 147.0 million at December 31, 2022. The held-to-maturity securities portfolio, recorded at amortized
cost, increased 7.9 million, or 3.6 , from 222.3 million at December 31, 2021 to 230.2 million at December 31, 2022. The marketable
equity securities portfolio decreased 5.7 million, or 47.6 , from 11.9 million at December 31, 2021 to 6.2 million at December
31, 2022. The decreases were due to principal pay downs and redemptions, as well as an increase in unrealized loss on securities
available-for-sale. The primary objective of the investment portfolio is to provide liquidity and maximize income while preserving
the safety of principal. 

The
Bank is required to purchase FHLB stock at par value in association with advances from the FHLB. The stock is classified as a
restricted investment and carried at cost which management believes approximates fair value. The Company s investment in
FHLB capital stock amounted to 2.9 million and 2.2 million at December 31, 2022 and December 31, 2021, respectively. 

At
December 31, 2022 and 2021, the Company held 423,000 of Atlantic Community Bankers Bank stock. The stock is restricted and carried
in other assets at cost. The stock is evaluated for impairment based on an estimate of the ultimate recovery to the par value. 

Loans. 

At
December 31, 2022, total loans were 2.0 billion, an increase of 126.7 million, or 6.8 , from December 31, 2021. Excluding PPP
loans, total loans increased 149.7 million, or 8.1 , driven by an increase in commercial real estate loans of 89.4 million,
or 9.1 , an increase in total commercial and industrial loans of 16.2 million, or 8.1 , an increase in residential real estate
loans, which include home equity loans, of 43.0 million, or 6.6 , and a decrease in PPP loans of 23.1 million, or 91.0 , from
December 31, 2021. During the twelve months ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, the Company sold 277,000 and 59.7 million, respectively,
of fixed rate, low coupon residential real estate loans to the secondary market. As of December 31, 2022, the Company serviced
 79.3 million in loans sold to the secondary market, compared to 88.2 million at December 31, 2021. Servicing rights will likely
continue to be retained on all loans written and sold to the secondary market. 

Bank-Owned
Life Insurance BOLI ). 

The
Company indirectly utilizes the earnings on BOLI to offset the cost of the Company s benefit plans. The cash surrender value
of BOLI was 74.6 million and 72.9 million at December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. 

Deposits. 

At
December 31, 2022, total deposits were 2.2 billion, a decrease of 27.5 million, or 1.2 , from December 31, 2021, primarily due
to a decrease in core deposits of 37.1 million, or 2.0 . Core deposits, which the Company defines as all deposits except time
deposits, decreased from 1.9 billion, or 82.2 of total deposits, at December 31, 2021, to 1.8 billion, or 81.5 of total deposits,
at December 31, 2022. Non-interest-bearing deposits increased 4.2 million, or 0.7 , to 645.5 million, interest-bearing checking
accounts increased 3.0 million, or 2.1 , to 148.7 million, savings accounts increased 4.8 million, or 2.2 , to 222.4 million,
and money market accounts decreased 49.3 million, or 5.8 , to 801.1 million. Time deposits increased 9.7 million, or 2.4 ,
from 402.0 million at December 31, 2021 to 411.7 million at December 31, 2022. 

56 

Borrowed
Funds. 

At
December 31, 2022, total borrowings increased 39.9 million, or 178.9 , from 22.3 million at December 31, 2021, to 62.2 million.
Short-term borrowings and long-term debt increased 39.9 million to 42.5 million and subordinated debt outstanding totaled 19.7
million at December 31, 2022 and 19.6 million at December 31, 2021. 

Shareholders 
Equity. 

At
December 31, 2022, shareholders equity was 228.1 million, or 8.9 of total assets, compared to 223.7 million, or 8.8 
of total assets, at December 31, 2021. The increase in shareholders equity reflects net income of 25.9 million, partially
offset by 6.4 million for the repurchase of the Company s common stock, the payment of regular cash dividends of 5.3 million
and an increase in accumulated other comprehensive loss of 12.7 million. Total shares outstanding as of December 31, 2022 were
22,216,789. 

The
Company s book value per share was 10.27 at December 31, 2022 compared to 9.87 at December 31, 2021, while tangible book
value per share, a non-GAAP financial measure, increased 0.40, or 4.3 , from 9.21 at December 31, 2021 to 9.61 at December
31, 2022. Reflected in the book value and tangible book value changes during the year ended December 31, 2022 are the Federal
Reserve s 425 basis points interest rate increases, which resulted in significant changes in unrealized gains and losses
on investment securities. Such unrealized gains and losses are generally due to changes in interest rates and represent the difference,
net of applicable income tax effect, between the estimated fair value and amortized cost of investment securities classified as
available-for-sale. The Company had no other-than-temporary impairment charges in its investment portfolio in 2022 or 2021. Tangible
book value is a Non-GAAP measure. For more information regarding the Company s use of Non-GAAP financial measures see Explanation
of Use of Non-GAAP Financial Measurements. As of December 31, 2022, the Company s and the Bank s regulatory
capital ratios continued to exceed the levels required to be considered well-capitalized under federal banking regulations. 

Pension
Plan. 

On
October 31, 2022, the Board of Director s previously approved termination of the Westfield Bank Defined Benefit Pension
Plan DB Plan became effective, subject to regulatory approvals. Once the Company has received regulatory approval
to terminate the DB Plan, which is expected in the first quarter of 2023, the Company will make an additional cash contribution
during the second quarter of 2023, if necessary, in order to fully fund the DB Plan on a plan termination basis, followed by the
purchase of annuity contracts to transfer its remaining liabilities under the DB Plan, for those participants who do not opt for
a one-time lump sum payment. The actual amount of this cash contribution, if any, will depend upon the nature and timing of participant
settlements, as well as prevailing market conditions. At December 31, 2022, the Company reversed 7.3 million in net unrealized
losses recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income attributed to both the DB plan curtailment resulting from the termination
of the DB Plan as well as changes in discount rates. In addition, the Company recorded a gain on curtailment of 2.8 million through
non-interest income. The improvement in book value and tangible book value for the three months ended December 31, 2022 were primarily
related to the termination of the DB Plan. 

Assets
under Management. 

Total
assets under management include loans serviced for others and investment assets under management. Loans serviced for others and
investment assets under management are not carried as assets on the Company s consolidated balance sheet, and as such, total assets
under management is not a financial measurement recognized under GAAP, however, management believes its disclosure provides information
useful in understanding the trends in total assets under management. 

The
Company provides a wide range of investment advisory and wealth management services through Westfield Investment Services through
LPL Financial, a third-party broker-dealer. Investment assets under management decreased 35.6 million, or 18.9 , from 188.1
million for the year ended December 31, 2021, to 152.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2022. 

57

of Operating Results for Years Ended December 31, 2022 and 2021. 

General.

For
the twelve months ended December 31, 2022, the Company reported net income of 25.9 million, or 1.18 per diluted share, compared
to 23.7 million, or 1.02 per diluted share, for the twelve months ended December 31, 2021. 

Net
Interest Income and Net Interest Margin. 

During
the twelve months ended December 31, 2022, net interest income increased 6.0 million, or 8.3 , to 79.2 million, compared to
 73.2 million for the twelve months ended December 31, 2021. The increase in net interest income was due to an increase in interest
and dividend income of 6.1 million, or 7.6 , partially offset by an increase in interest expense of 24,000, or 0.4 . For the
twelve months ended December 31, 2022, the Company generated net interest income growth of 8.3 , overcoming a 6.0 million, or
89.2 , decrease in PPP income as the PPP program comes to a close. Excluding PPP income of 728,000 and 6.8 million for the twelve
months ended December 31, 2022 and the twelve months ended December 31, 2021, respectively, net interest income increased 12.1
million, or 18.2 for the same period. 

The
net interest margin for the twelve months ended December 31, 2022 was 3.31 , compared to 3.14 during the twelve months ended
December 31, 2021. The net interest margin, on a tax-equivalent basis, was 3.33 for the twelve months ended December 31, 2022,
compared to 3.16 for the twelve months ended December 31, 2021. Excluding the PPP income, the net interest margin increased 29
basis points from 2.99 for the twelve months ended December 31, 2021 to 3.28 for the twelve months ended December 31, 2022. 

The
average yield on interest-earning assets increased 15 basis point from 3.43 for the twelve months ended December 31, 2021 to
3.58 for the twelve months ended December 31, 2022. During the twelve months ended December 31, 2022, the average cost of funds,
including non-interest-bearing demand accounts and borrowings, decreased one basis point from 0.30 for the twelve months ended
December 31, 2021 to 0.29 for the twelve months ended December 31, 2022. For the twelve months ended December 31, 2022, the average
cost of core deposits, including non-interest-bearing demand deposits, increased three basis points from 0.17 for the twelve
months ended December 31, 2021 to 0.20 for the twelve months ended December 31, 2022. The average cost of time deposits decreased
12 basis points from 0.53 for the twelve months ended December 31, 2021 to 0.41 during the same period in 2022. The average
cost of borrowings, which include FHLB advances and subordinated debt, increased 122 basis points from 3.04 for the twelve months
ended December 31, 2021 to 4.26 for the twelve months ended December 31, 2022, due to the issuance of 20.0 million in subordinated
debt in April 2021. 

For
the twelve months ended December 31, 2022, average demand deposits, an interest-free source of funds, increased 39.0 million,
or 6.4 , from 609.0 million, or 28.0 of total average deposits, for the twelve months ended December 31, 2021, to 648.0 million,
or 28.6 of total average deposits, for the twelve months ended December 31, 2022. 

During
the twelve months ended December 31, 2022, average interest-earning assets increased 67.1 million, or 2.9 , to 2.4 billion.
The increase in average interest-earning assets was due to an increase in average loans of 65.6 million, or 3.5 , as well as
an increase in average securities of 87.7 million, or 27.4 , partially offset by a decrease of 86.2 million, or 77.0 , in short-term
investments, which consists of cash and cash equivalents. Excluding average PPP loans, average loans increased 170.5 million,
or 9.6 , and average interest-earnings assets increased 172.0 million, or 7.7 . 

Provision
for Loan Losses. 

The
provision for loan losses is reviewed by management based upon our evaluation of then-existing economic and business conditions
affecting our key lending areas and other conditions, such as new loan products, credit quality trends (including trends in nonperforming
loans expected to result from existing conditions), collateral values, loan volumes and concentrations, specific industry conditions
within portfolio segments that existed as of the balance sheet date and the impact that such conditions were believed to have
had on the collectability of the loan portfolio. 

58 

The
provision for loan losses increased 1.6 million, to 700,000 for the twelve months ended December 31, 2022, from a credit for
loan losses of 925,000 for the twelve months ended December 31, 2021, primarily driven by loan growth during the year ended December
31, 2022. The credit for loan losses for the twelve months ended December 31, 2021 was due to the Company reducing its qualitative
factors related to the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic and other economic trends used in the Company s allowance. 

The
Company recorded net charge-offs of 556,000 for the twelve months ended December 31, 2022, as compared to net charge-offs of
 445,000 for the twelve months ended December 31, 2021. The allowance for loan losses as a percentage of total loans was 1.00 
at December 31, 2022, compared to 1.06 at December 31, 2021. At December 31, 2022, the allowance for loan losses as a percentage
of nonperforming loans was 350.0 , compared to 398.6 , at December 31, 2021. 

Although
management believes it has established and maintained the allowance for loan losses at appropriate levels, future adjustments
may be necessary if economic, real estate and other conditions differ substantially from the current operating environment. 

Non-Interest
Income. 

For
the twelve months ended December 31, 2022, non-interest income increased 768,000, or 6.1 , from 12.6 million for the twelve
months ended December 31, 2021 to 13.3 million for the twelve months ended December 31, 2022. During the twelve months ended
December 31, 2021, non-interest income included the recognition of 555,000 in BOLI death benefits. During the twelve months ended
December 31, 2022, service charges and fees increased 712,000, or 8.5 , and mortgage banking income decreased 1.4 million from
the twelve months ended December 31, 2021 to the twelve months ended December 31, 2022. In 2021, the Company sold 59.7 million
in fixed rate residential real estate loans to the secondary market, compared to 277,000 in sales during the twelve months ended
December 31, 2022. Other income from loan-level swap fees on commercial loans decreased 33,000, or 56.9 , and income from BOLI
decreased 187,000, or 9.8 . 

On
October 31, 2022, the termination of the Westfield Bank Defined Benefit Pension Plan (the DB Plan became effective,
subject to regulatory approvals expected in the first quarter of 2023, with final settlement expected to occur occurring in the
second quarter of 2023. During the twelve months ended December 31, 2022, the Company recorded a curtailment gain related to the
DB Plan termination of 2.8 million through non-interest income. Excluding the defined benefit curtailment gain as a result of
the termination of the DB Plan and BOLI death benefits, non-interest income decreased 1.5 million, or 12.5 . During the twelve
months ended December 31, 2022, the Company reported unrealized losses on marketable equity securities of 717,000, compared to
unrealized losses of 168,000 during the twelve months ended December 31, 2021. During the twelve months ended December 31, 2022,
the Company also reported realized losses on the sale of securities of 4,000, compared to realized losses on the sale of securities
of 72,000 during the twelve months ended December 31, 2021. In addition, the Company reported a gain of 422,000 on non-marketable
equity investments during the twelve months ended December 31, 2022, compared to 898,000 during the twelve months ended December
31, 2021. Gains and losses from the investment portfolio vary from quarter to quarter based on market conditions, as well as the
related yield curve and valuation changes. During the twelve months ended December 31, 2021, the Company also recognized a loss
on interest rate swap termination of 402,000 representing the unamortized portion of a 3.4 million loss associated with the
previous termination of a 32.5 million interest rate swap on March 16, 2016. 

Non-Interest
Expense. 

For
the twelve months ended December 31, 2022, non-interest expense increased 2.3 million, or 4.2 , to 57.2 million, compared to
 54.9 million for the twelve months ended December 31, 2021. The increase in non-interest expense was primarily due to an increase
in salaries and employee benefits expense of 511,000, or 1.6 , due to normal annual salary increases as well as higher incentive
compensation costs. Other non-interest expense increased 878,000, or 10.2 , professional fees increased 531,000, or 24.3 , which
is comprised of legal fees, audit and compliance fees, as well as other professional fees. Occupancy expense increased 328,000,
or 7.0 , advertising expense increased 116,000, or 9.0 , and FDIC insurance expense increased 50,000, or 5.0 . These increases
were partially offset by a decrease in furniture and equipment expense of 58,000, or 2.8 , and a decrease in data processing
expense of 18,000, or 0.6 . During the twelve months ended December 31, 2021, the Company prepaid 32.5 million of FHLB borrowings
resulting in a loss of 45,000. For the twelve months ended December 31, 2022, the efficiency ratio was 61.8 , compared to 64.1 
for the twelve months ended December 31, 2021. For the twelve months ended December 31, 2022, the adjusted efficiency ratio, a
non-GAAP financial measure, was 63.6 , compared to 64.6 for the twelve months ended December 31, 2021. For more information regarding
the Company s use of Non-GAAP financial measures see Explanation of Use of Non-GAAP Financial Measurements. 

59 

Income
Taxes. 

Income
tax expense for the twelve months ended December 31, 2022 was 8.7 million, representing an effective tax rate of 25.2 , compared
to 8.0 million, representing an effective tax rate of 25.3 , for twelve months ended December 31, 2021. 

Liquidity
and Capital Resources. 

The
term liquidity refers to our ability to generate adequate amounts of cash to fund loan originations, loan purchases,
deposit withdrawals and operating expenses. Our primary sources of liquidity are deposits, scheduled amortization and prepayments
of loan principal and mortgage-backed securities, maturities and calls of investment securities and funds provided by our operations.
We also can borrow funds from the FHLB based on eligible collateral of loans and securities. Our material cash commitments include
funding loan originations, fulfilling contractual obligations with third-party service providers, maintaining operating leases
for certain of our Bank properties and satisfying repayment of our long-term debt obligations. 

Primary
Sources of Liquidity 

At
December 31, 2022 and December 31, 2021, outstanding borrowings from the FHLB were 36.2 million and 2.7 million, respectively.
At December 31, 2022, we had 407.4 million in available borrowing capacity with the FHLB. We have the ability to increase our
borrowing capacity with the FHLB by pledging investment securities or additional loans. 

In
addition, we have available lines of credit of 15.0 million and 50.0 million with other correspondent banks. Interest rates
on these lines are determined and reset on a daily basis by each respective bank. At December 31, 2022 and 2021, we did not have
an outstanding balance under either of these lines of credit. In addition, we may enter into reverse repurchase agreements with
approved broker-dealers. Reverse repurchase agreements are agreements that allow us to borrow money using our securities as collateral. 

We
also have outstanding at any time, a significant number of commitments to extend credit and provide financial guarantees to third
parties. These arrangements are subject to strict credit control assessments. Guarantees specify limits to our obligations. Because
many commitments and almost all guarantees expire without being funded in whole or in part, the contract amounts are not estimates
of future cash flows. We are also obligated under agreements with the FHLB to repay borrowed funds and are obligated under leases
for certain of our branches and equipment. 

Maturing
investment securities are a relatively predictable source of funds. However, deposit flows, calls of securities and prepayments
of loans and mortgage-backed securities are strongly influenced by interest rates, general and local economic conditions and competition
in the marketplace. These factors reduce the predictability of the timing of these sources of funds. 

The
Company s primary activities are the origination of commercial real estate loans, commercial and industrial loans and residential
real estate loans, as well as and the purchase of mortgage-backed and other investment securities. During the year ended December
31, 2022, we originated 447.4 million in loans, compared to 611.4 million in 2021. During the year ended December 31, 2022,
cash and cash equivalents decreased 73.1 million, or 70.7 , to 30.3 million, as cash on hand was used during the year to fund
loan growth. We purchased securities totaling 33.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2022, compared to purchases of 296.6
million for the year ended December 31, 2021. At December 31, 2022, the Company had approximately 176.7 million in loan commitments
and letters of credit to borrowers and approximately 328.8 million in available home equity and other unadvanced lines of credit. 

60 

Deposit
inflows and outflows are affected by the level of interest rates, the products and interest rates offered by competitors and by
other factors. At December 31, 2022, time deposit accounts scheduled to mature within one year totaled 288.7 million. Based on
the Company s deposit retention experience and current pricing strategy, we anticipate that a significant portion of these
time deposits will remain on deposit. We monitor our liquidity position frequently and anticipate that it will have sufficient
funds to meet our current funding commitments for the next 12 months and beyond. 

At
December 31, 2022, the Company and the Bank exceeded each of the applicable regulatory capital requirements (See Note 13, Regulatory
Capital , to our consolidated financial statements for further information on our regulatory requirements). 

Material
Cash Commitments 

The
Company entered into a long-term contractual obligation with a vendor for use of its core provider and ancillary services beginning
in 2016. Total remaining contractual obligations outstanding with this vendor as of December 31, 2022 were estimated to be 10.7
million, with 4.9 million expected to be paid within one year and the remaining 5.8 million to be paid within the next three
years. Further, the Company has operating leases for certain of its banking offices and ATMs. Our leases have remaining lease
terms of less than one year to sixteen years, some of which include options to extend the leases for additional five-year terms
up to ten years. Undiscounted lease liabilities totaled 11.2 million as of December 31, 2022. Principal payments expected to
be made on our lease liabilities during the twelve months ended December 31, 2023 were 1.4 million. The remaining lease liability
payments totaled 9.8 million and are expected to be made after December 31, 2023 (See Note 12, Leases , to our consolidated
financial statements for further information on our lease obligations). 

In
addition, the Company completed an offering of 20 million in aggregate principal amount of its 4.875 fixed-to-floating rate
subordinated notes (the Notes to certain qualified institutional buyers in a private placement transaction on April
20, 2021. Unless earlier redeemed, the Notes mature on May 1, 2031. At December 31, 2022, 19.7 million aggregate principle amount
of the Notes was outstanding. The Notes will bear interest from the initial issue date to, but excluding, May 1, 2026, or the
earlier redemption date, at a fixed rate of 4.875 per annum, payable quarterly in arrears on May 1, August 1, November 1 and
February 1 of each year, beginning August 1, 2021, and from and including May 1, 2026, but excluding the maturity date or earlier
redemption date, equal to the benchmark rate, which is the 90-day average secured overnight financing rate, plus 412 basis points,
determined on the determination date of the applicable interest period, payable quarterly in arrears on May 1, August 1, November
1 and February 1 of each year. The Company may also redeem the Notes, in whole or in part, on or after May 1, 2026, and at any
time upon the occurrence of certain events, subject in each case to the approval of the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve
(See Note 8, Long-Term Debt , to our consolidated financial statements for further information on our long-term debt). 

We
do not anticipate any material capital expenditures during the calendar year 2023, except in pursuance of the Company s
strategic initiatives. The Company does not have any balloon or other payments due on any long-term obligations or any off-balance
sheet items other than the commitments and unused lines of credit noted above. 

Off-Balance
Sheet Arrangements. 

The
Company does not have any off-balance sheet arrangements, other than noted above and in Note 16, Commitments and Contingencies,
 to our consolidated financial statements, that have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on our financial
condition, changes in financial condition, revenues or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital
resources that is material to investors. 

Management
of Market Risk. 

As
a financial institution, our primary market risk is interest rate risk since substantially all transactions are denominated in
U.S. dollars with no direct foreign exchange or changes in commodity price exposure. Fluctuations in interest rates will affect
both our level of income and expense on a large portion of our assets and liabilities. Fluctuations in interest rates will also
affect the market value of all interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities. 

61 

The
Company s interest rate management strategy is to limit fluctuations in net interest income as interest rates vary up or
down and control variations in the market value of assets, liabilities and net worth as interest rates vary. We seek to coordinate
asset and liability decisions so that, under changing interest rate scenarios, net interest income will remain within an acceptable
range. 

In
order to achieve the Company s objectives of managing interest rate risk, the Asset and Liability Management Committee ALCO meets periodically to discuss and monitor the market interest rate environment relative to interest rates that are offered on
our products. ALCO presents quarterly reports to the Board of Directors which includes the Company s interest rate risk
position and liquidity position. 

The
Company s primary source of funds are deposits, consisting primarily of time deposits, money market accounts, savings accounts,
demand accounts and interest-bearing checking accounts, which have shorter terms to maturity than the loan portfolio. Several
strategies have been employed to manage the interest rate risk inherent in the asset/liability mix, including but not limited
to: 

maintaining
 the diversity of our existing loan portfolio through residential real estate loans, commercial
 and industrial loans and commercial real estate loans; 

emphasizing
 investments with an expected average duration of five years or less; and 

when
 appropriate, using interest rate swaps to manage the interest rate position of the balance
 sheet. 

In
2022, cash flows from deposit inflows were used to fund loan growth and purchase held-to-maturity and available-for-sale securities.
The Company continues its emphasis on growing commercial loans, which typically have variable interest rates and shorter maturities
than residential loans. 

The
actual amount of time before loans are repaid can be significantly affected by changes in market interest rates. Prepayment rates
will also vary due to a number of other factors, including the regional economy in the area where the loans were originated, seasonal
factors, demographic variables and the assumability of the loans. However, the major factors affecting prepayment rates are prevailing
interest rates, related financing opportunities and competition. We monitor interest rate sensitivity so that we can adjust our
asset and liability mix in a timely manner and minimize the negative effects of changing rates. 

The
Company s liquidity sources are vulnerable to various uncertainties beyond our control. Loan amortization and investment
cash flows are a relatively stable source of funds, while loan and investment prepayments and calls, as well as deposit flows
vary widely in reaction to market conditions, primarily prevailing interest rates. Asset sales are influenced by pledging activities,
general market interest rates and unforeseen market conditions. Our financial condition is affected by our ability to borrow at
attractive rates, retain deposits at market rates and other market conditions. We consider our sources of liquidity to be adequate
to meet expected funding needs and also to be responsive to changing interest rate markets. 

Interest
Rate Risk. 

Interest
rate risk represents the sensitivity of earnings to changes in market interest rates. As interest rates change, the interest income
and expense streams associated with our financial instruments also change, thereby impacting net interest income, the primary
component of our earnings. ALCO utilizes the results of a detailed and dynamic simulation model to quantify the estimated exposure
of net interest income to sustained interest rate changes. While ALCO routinely monitors simulated net interest income sensitivity
over a rolling two-year horizon, they also utilize additional tools to monitor potential longer-term interest rate risk. 

The
simulation model captures the impact of changing interest rates on the interest income received and interest expense paid on all
interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities reflected on our consolidated balance sheet, as well as for derivative
financial instruments. This sensitivity analysis is compared to ALCO policy limits, which specify a maximum tolerance level for
net interest income exposure over a one and two-year horizon, assuming no balance sheet growth. 

62 

The
repricing and/or new rates of assets and liabilities moved in tandem with market rates. However, in certain deposit products,
the use of data from a historical analysis indicated that the rates on these products would move only a fraction of the rate change
amount. Pertinent data from each loan account, deposit account and investment security was used to calculate future cash flows.
The data included such items as maturity date, payment amount, next repricing date, repricing frequency, repricing index, repricing
spread, caps and floors. Prepayment speed assumptions were based upon the difference between the account rate and the current
market rate. We also evaluate changes in interest rate sensitivity under various scenarios including but not limited to nonparallel
shifts in the yield curve, variances in prepayment speeds and variances to correlations of instrument rates to market indexes. 

The
table below shows our net interest income sensitivity analysis reflecting the following changes to net interest income for the
first and second years of the simulation model. The analysis assumes no balance sheet growth, a parallel shift in interest rates,
and all rate changes were ramped over the first 12-month period and then maintained at those levels over the remainder
of the simulation horizon.

The
preceding sensitivity analysis does not represent a forecast of net interest income, nor do the calculations represent any actions
that management may undertake in response to changes in interest rates. They should not be relied upon as being indicative of
expected operating results. These hypothetical estimates are based upon numerous assumptions including, among others, the nature
and timing of interest rate levels, yield curve shape, prepayments on loans and securities, deposit decay rates, pricing decisions
on loans and deposits and reinvestment/replacement of asset and liability cash flows. While assumptions are developed based upon
current economic and local market conditions, we cannot make any assurances as to the predictive nature of these assumptions,
including how customer preferences or competitor influences might change. 

Periodically,
if deemed appropriate, we may use interest rate swaps, floors and caps, which are common derivative financial instruments, to
hedge our interest rate exposure to interest rate movements. The Board of Directors has approved hedging policy statements governing
the use of these instruments. These interest rate swaps are designated as cash flow hedges and involve the receipt of variable
rate amounts from a counterparty in exchange for our making fixed payments. We did not have any interest rate swap agreements
designated as cash flow hedges at December 31, 2022 or 2021.

Impact
of Inflation and Changing Prices. 

The
Company s consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes have been prepared in accordance with GAAP. GAAP generally
requires the measurement of financial position and operating results in terms of historical dollars without consideration for
changes in the relative purchasing power of money over time due to inflation. The impact of inflation is reflected in the increased
cost of our operations. Unlike industrial companies, our assets and liabilities are primarily monetary in nature. As a result,
changes in market interest rates have a greater impact on performance than do the effects of inflation.

reporting as of December 31, 2022, based on criteria established in Internal Control Integrated Framework (2013)
 issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission COSO ). In our opinion, the Company
maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2022, based on criteria
established in Internal Control Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the COSO. 

We
have also audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) PCAOB ),
the consolidated financial statements of the Company and our report dated March 10, 2023 expressed an unqualified opinion. 

Basis
for Opinion 

The
Company s management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment
of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting included in the accompanying Management s Annual Report
on Internal Control over Financial Reporting . Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company s internal
control over financial reporting based on our audit. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required
to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations
of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. 

We
conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit
to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material
respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that
a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the
assessed risk. Our audit also included performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe
that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion. 

65 

Definition
and Limitations of Internal Control over Financial Reporting 

A
company s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability
of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted
accounting principles. A company s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain
to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the
assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial
statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are
being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance
regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of the company s assets that could have
a material effect on the financial statements. 

Because
of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections
of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes
in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

Report
of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm 

To
the Shareholders and Board of Directors of 

 Western
New England Bancorp, Inc. 

Opinion
on the Consolidated Financial Statements 

We
have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Western New England Bancorp, Inc. and subsidiaries (the Company)
as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, the related consolidated statements of net income, comprehensive income, changes in shareholders 
equity and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2022, and the related notes (collectively referred
to as the financial statements). In our opinion, the financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial
position of the Company as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the
three years in the period ended December 31, 2022, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States
of America. 

We
also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB),
the Company s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2022, based on criteria established in Internal
Control - Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO)
and our report dated March 10, 2023 expressed an unqualified opinion on the effectiveness of the Company s internal controls
over financial reporting. 

Basis
for Opinion 

These
financial statements are the responsibility of the Company s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company s
financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent
with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the
Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. 

We
conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to
obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud.
Our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to
error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence
regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles
used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. We
believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion. 

F- 1 

Critical
Audit Matter 

The
critical audit matter communicated below is a matter arising from the current period audit of the financial statements that was
communicated or required to be communicated to the Company s Audit Committee and that: (1) relates to accounts or disclosures
that are material to the financial statements and (2) involved especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication
of a critical audit matter does not alter in any way our opinion on the financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not,
by communicating the critical audit matter below, providing a separate opinion on the critical audit matter or on the accounts
or disclosures to which it relates. 

Critical
Audit Matter Description 

As
described in Notes 1 and 3 to the financial statements, the Company has recorded an allowance for loan losses in the amount of
 19.9 million as of December 31, 2022, representing management s estimate of the probable losses inherent in the loan portfolio
as of that date. The allowance is established as losses are estimated to have occurred through a provision (credit)
for loan losses charged to earnings. 

The
determination of the allowance for loan losses requires significant judgment by management including the determination of qualitative adjustments to historical loss experience. 

How
the Critical Audit Matter was addressed in the Audit 

Our
principal audit procedures to evaluate management s estimates of the allowance for loan losses included tests of the following: 

Management s
 determination of general reserves, including determination of historical loss experience
 and qualitative adjustments to historical loss experience. 

The
 accuracy of management s calculation of the allowance for loan losses, including
 relevant internal controls. 

We
have served as the Company s auditor since 2004.

NOTES
TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 

 YEARS
ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2022, 2021 AND 2020 

 banking offices in Hampden County and Hampshire County in western Massachusetts and Hartford County and Tolland
County in northern Connecticut, and its primary sources of revenue are interest income from loans as well as interest income from
investment securities. The West Hartford Financial Services Center serves as the Company s Connecticut hub, housing Commercial
Lending, Cash Management and a Mortgage Loan Officer. The Bank s deposits are insured up to the maximum Federal Deposit
Insurance Corporation FDIC coverage limits. 

Realized
gains and losses on sales of securities and mortgage-backed securities are computed using the specific identification method and
are included in non-interest income on the trade date. The amortization of premiums and accretion of discounts are determined by
using the level yield method to the maturity date, except that premiums are amortized to the earliest call date or maturity. 

for owner-occupied homes, 
for second homes and 
for investment properties. Mortgages with loan-to-values greater than 
require private mortgage insurance. We do not grant subprime loans. Home equity loans and lines are secured by first or second
mortgages on one-to-four family owner-occupied properties. Equity loans and lines are underwritten to a maximum combined
loan-to-value of 
of the appraised value of the property. Underwriting approval is dependent on review of the borrower s ability to repay and
credit history in accordance with Westfield Bank s policy. The overall health of the economy, including unemployment rates and
housing pricing, will have an effect on the credit quality in this segment. 

Commercial
and industrial loans . Loans in this segment include commercial business loans and are generally secured by assignments of
corporate assets and personal guarantees of the business owners. Repayment is expected from the cash flows of the business. A
weakened economy, and resultant decreased consumer spending, will have an effect on the credit quality in this segment. 

Consumer
loans . Loans in this segment are both secured and unsecured and repayment is dependent on the credit quality of the individual
borrower. 

Allocated
component 

The
allocated component relates to loans that are classified as impaired. Impaired loans are identified by analysis of loan performance,
internal credit ratings and watch list loans that management believes are subject to a higher risk of loss. Impairment is measured
on a loan by loan basis for commercial real estate and commercial and industrial loans by either the present value of expected
future cash flows discounted at the loan s effective interest rate or the fair value of the collateral if the loan is collateral
dependent. An allowance is established when the discounted cash flows (or collateral value) of the impaired loan is lower than
the carrying value of that loan. Large groups of smaller balance homogeneous loans are collectively evaluated for impairment.
Accordingly, we do not separately identify individual consumer and residential real estate loans for impairment disclosures, unless
such loans are subject to a troubled debt restructuring agreement. 

A
loan is considered impaired when, based on current information and events, it is probable that we will be unable to collect the
scheduled payments of principal or interest when due according to the contractual terms of the loan agreement. Factors considered
by management in determining impairment include payment status, collateral value, and the probability of collecting scheduled
principal and interest payments when due. Loans that experience insignificant payment delays and payment shortfalls generally
are not classified as impaired. We determine the significance of payment delays and payment shortfalls on a case-by-case basis,
taking into consideration all of the circumstances surrounding the loan and the borrower, including the length of the delay, the
reasons for the delay, the borrower s prior payment record, and the amount of the shortfall in relation to the principal
and interest owed. 

We
may periodically agree to modify the contractual terms of loans. When a loan is modified and a concession is made to a borrower
experiencing financial difficulty, the modification is considered a troubled debt restructuring TDR ). All TDRs
are classified as impaired. 

While
we use our best judgment and information available, the ultimate appropriateness of the allowance is dependent upon a variety
of factors beyond our control, including the performance of our loan portfolio, the economy, changes in interest rates and the
view of the regulatory authorities toward loan classifications. 

Unallocated
component 

An
unallocated component may be maintained to cover uncertainties that could affect management s estimate of probable losses.
The unallocated component of the allowance reflects the margin of imprecision inherent in the underlying assumptions used in the
methodologies for estimating allocated and general reserves in the portfolio. 

Leasehold
 Improvements 
 - 
 
 Furniture
 and Equipment 
 - 

The
cost of maintenance and repairs is charged to expense when incurred. Major expenditures for betterments are capitalized and depreciated. 

Goodwill
is measured as the excess of the cost of a business combination over the sum of the amounts assigned to identifiable intangible
assets acquired less liabilities assumed. Goodwill is not amortized but rather assessed for impairment annually or more frequently
if circumstances warrant. 

Management
has the option of first assessing qualitative factors, such as events and circumstances, to determine whether it is more likely
than not, meaning a likelihood of more than 50 , the value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount. If, after considering
all relevant events and circumstances, management determines it is not more likely than not the fair value of a reporting unit
is less than its carrying amount, then performing an impairment test is unnecessary. For the year ended December 31, 2022, management
determined that it was not more likely than not the fair value of the reporting unit (the consolidated Company, in our case) was
less than its carrying amount. If management had determined otherwise, a fair value analysis would have been completed to determine
the impairment and necessary write-down of goodwill.

. The Company applied the standards provisions as a cumulative effect adjustment to retained earnings
as of the first reporting period in which the guidance is effective. The Company has implemented a third-party software to model
the allowance for loan losses in conformance with this ASU. The Company completed its allowance for credit losses ACL methodology as of the effectiveness date of . To estimate the ACL for loans and off-balance sheet credit exposures,
such as unfunded loan commitments, the Company utilizes a discounted cash flow model that contains additional assumptions to calculate
credit losses over the estimated life of financial assets and off-balance sheet credit exposures and will include the impact of
forecasted economic conditions. The estimate includes a one-year reasonable and supportable forecast period and thereafter a one-year
reversion period to the historical mean of its macro-economic assumption. The estimate will also include qualitative factors that
may not be reflected in quantitatively derived results to ensure that the ACL reflects a reasonable estimate of current expected
credit losses. Upon implementation, the Company s CECL transitional amount recorded to retained earnings was , net
of tax. In addition, the estimated ACL and allowance for unfunded commitments under both the incurred loss method and CECL will
be affected by various factors, which include but are not limited to, changes in the composition and balance of the Company s
loan portfolio and unfunded commitments, changes to internal risk ratings of borrowers, changes to the risk-profile of the loan
portfolio, changes in various macro-economic indicators, the impact of COVID-19 and geo-political events on the business environment,
and other factors.

During
the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, the Company did not record any other-than-temporary impairment OTTI charges on its investments. Management regularly reviews the portfolio for securities with unrealized losses. At December 31,
2022, management attributes the unrealized losses to increases in current market yields compared to the yields at the time the
investments were purchased by the Company and not due to credit quality. 

The
process for assessing investments for OTTI may vary depending on the type of security. In assessing the Company s investments
in government-sponsored and U.S. government guaranteed mortgage-backed securities and government-sponsored enterprise obligations,
the contractual cash flows of these investments are guaranteed by the respective government-sponsored enterprise; Federal Home
Loan Mortgage Corporation FHLMC ), Federal National Mortgage Association FNMA ), Federal Farm Credit
Bank FFCB ), or Federal Home Loan Bank FHLB ). Accordingly, it is expected that the securities would
not be settled at a price less than the par value of the Company s investments. Management s assessment of other debt securities
within the portfolio includes reviews of market pricing, ongoing credit quality evaluations, assessment of the investments materiality,
and duration of the investments unrealized loss position. At December 31, 2022, there was one corporate bond that was below investment
grade. The Company reviewed the financial strength of this bond and has concluded that the amortized cost remains supported by
the expected future cash flows of the security.

The
Company has transferred a portion of its originated commercial loans to participating lenders. The amounts transferred have been
accounted for as sales and are therefore not included in our accompanying consolidated balance sheets. We continue to service
the loans on behalf of the participating lenders. We share with participating lenders, on a pro-rata basis, any gains or losses
that may result from a borrower s lack of compliance with contractual terms of the loan. At December 31, 2022 and December
31, 2021, the Company was servicing commercial loans participated out to various other institutions totaling million and
 million, respectively. 

Residential
real estate mortgages are originated by the Bank both for its portfolio and for sale into the secondary market. The Bank may sell
its loans to institutional investors such as the FHLMC. Under loan sale and servicing agreements with the investor, the Bank generally
continues to service the residential real estate mortgages. The Bank pays the investor an agreed upon rate on the loan, which
is less than the interest rate received from the borrower. The Bank retains the difference as a fee for servicing the residential
real estate mortgages. The Bank capitalizes mortgage servicing rights at their fair value upon sale of the related loans, amortizes
the asset over the estimated life of the serviced loan, and periodically assesses the asset for impairment. The significant assumptions
used by a third party to estimate the fair value of capitalized servicing rights at December 31, 2022, include weighted average
prepayment speed for the portfolio using the Public Securities Association Standard Prepayment Model PSA), weighted average
internal rate of return ), weighted average servicing fee ), and average cost to service loans per loan).
The estimated fair value of capitalized servicing rights may vary significantly in subsequent periods primarily due to changing
market interest rates, and their effect on prepayment speeds and discount rates. For the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021,
the Company sold and million in residential real estate mortgages with servicing retained and recorded gains on
the sale of mortgages of and 1.4 million, respectively, within non-interest income. 

At
December 31, 2022 and December 31, 2021, the Company was servicing residential mortgage loans owned by investors totaling 
million and million, respectively. Servicing fee income of and was recorded for the years ended December
31, 2022 and 2021, respectively, and is included in service charges and fees on the consolidated statements of net income.

The
majority of impaired loans are included within the nonaccrual balances; however, not every loan on nonaccrual status has been
designated as impaired. Impaired loans include loans that have been modified in a TDR. 

Impaired
loans are individually evaluated and exclude large groups of smaller-balance homogeneous loans, such as residential mortgage loans
and consumer loans, which are collectively evaluated for impairment, and loans that are measured at fair value, unless the loan
is amended in a TDR. 

All
payments received on impaired loans in nonaccrual status are applied to principal. There was no interest income recognized on
nonaccrual impaired loans during the years ended December 31, 2022 and December 31, 2021. The Company s obligation to fulfill
the additional funding commitments on impaired loans is generally contingent on the borrower s compliance with the terms of the
credit agreement. If the borrower is not in compliance, additional funding commitments may or may not be made at the Company s
discretion. As of December 31, 2022, we have not committed to lend any additional funds for loans that are classified as impaired.
Payments received on impaired loans in accrual status are recorded in accordance with the contractual terms of the loan. 

Troubled
Debt Restructurings. 

Loans
are designated as a TDR when, as part of an agreement to modify the original contractual terms of the loan as a result of financial
difficulties of the borrower, the Bank grants the borrower a concession on the terms, that would not otherwise be considered.
Typically, such concessions may consist of a reduction in interest rate to a below market rate, taking into account the credit
quality of the note, extension of additional credit based on receipt of adequate collateral, or a deferment or reduction of payments
(principal or interest) which materially alters the Bank s position or significantly extends the note s maturity date, such that
the present value of cash flows to be received is materially less than those contractually established at the loan s origination.
All loans that are modified are reviewed by the Company to identify if a TDR has occurred. All TDR loans are classified as impaired. 

When
we modify loans in a TDR, we measure impairment similar to other impaired loans based on the present value of expected future
cash flows, discounted at the contractual interest rate of the original loan agreement, or use the current fair value of the collateral,
less selling costs for collateral dependent loans. If we determine that the value of the modified loan is less than the recorded
investment in the loan (net of previous charge-offs, deferred loan fees or costs and unamortized premium or discount), impairment
is recognized through a specific allowance or a charge-off to the allowance. Nonperforming TDRs are included in nonperforming
loans. 

There
were no charge-offs on TDRs during the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021. During the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021,
no TDRs defaulted (defined as 30 days or more past due) within 12 months of restructuring.

Quality Information. 

The
Company utilizes an eight-grade internal loan rating system for commercial real estate and commercial and industrial loans. Performing
residential real estate, home equity and consumer loans are grouped with Pass rated loans. Nonperforming residential
real estate, home equity and consumer loans are monitored individually for impairment and risk rated as substandard. 

Loans
rated 1 4 : Loans rated 1-4 represent groups of loans that are not subject to adverse criticism as defined in regulatory
guidance. Loans in these groups exhibit characteristics that represent acceptable risk. 

Loans
rated 5 : Loans rated 5 are considered Special Mention and may exhibit potential credit weaknesses or
downward trends and are being monitored by management. Loans in this category are currently protected based on collateral and
repayment capacity and do not constitute undesirable credit risk, but have potential weakness that may result in deterioration
of the repayment process at some future date. This classification is used if a negative trend is evident in the obligor s
financial situation. Special mention loans do not sufficiently expose the Company to warrant adverse classification. 

Loans
rated 6 : Loans rated 6 are considered Substandard . A loan is classified as substandard if the borrower
exhibits a well-defined weakness and may be inadequately protected by the current net worth and cash flow capacity to pay the
current debt. 

Loans
rated 7 : Loans rated 7 are considered Doubtful . Loans classified as doubtful have all the weaknesses
inherent in those classified substandard with the added characteristic that the weaknesses make collection or liquidation of the
loan highly questionable and improbable. The possibility of some loss is extremely high, but because of specific pending factors
that may work to the advantage and strengthening of the asset, its classification as an estimated loss is deferred until its more
exact status may be determined. 

Loans
rated 8 : Loans rated 8 are considered uncollectible. The loss classification does not mean that the asset has absolutely no
recovery or salvage value, but rather that it is not practical or desirable to defer writing off the asset because recovery and
collection time may be affected in the future. 

On
an annual basis, or more often if needed, we formally review the ratings on all commercial real estate and commercial and industrial
loans. In addition, management utilizes delinquency reports, the criticized report and other loan reports to monitor credit quality.
In addition, at least on an annual basis, the Company contracts with an external loan review company to review the internal credit
ratings assigned to loans in the commercial loan portfolio on a pre-determined schedule, based on the type, size, rating, and
overall risk of the loan. During the course of their review, the third party examines a sample of loans, including new loans,
existing relationships over certain dollar amounts and classified assets.

FHLB
advances provide more pricing and option alternatives for particular asset/liability needs. The FHLB provides a central credit
facility primarily for member institutions. As an FHLB member, the Company is required to own capital stock of the FHLB, calculated
periodically based primarily on its level of borrowings from the FHLB. FHLB borrowings are secured by certain securities from
the Company s investment portfolio not otherwise pledged as well as certain residential real estate and commercial real
estate loans. Advances are made under several different credit programs with different lending standards, interest rates and range
of maturities. This relationship is an integral component of the Company s asset-liability management program. At December
31, 2022, the Bank had million in additional borrowing capacity from the FHLB.

Restricted
Stock Awards. 

In
May 2014, the Company s shareholders approved the 2014 Omnibus Incentive Plan, a stock-based compensation plan (the 2014
RSA Plan ). Under the 2014 RSA Plan, up to shares of the Company s common stock were reserved for grants of
stock awards, including stock options and restricted stock, which may be granted to any officer, key employee or non-employee
director of WNEB. Any shares that were not issued because vesting requirements were not met were available for future issuance
under the 2014 RSA Plan. 

On
an annual basis, the Compensation Committee (the Committee approves long-term incentive awards out of the 2014
RSA Plan, whereby shares will be granted to eligible participants of the Company that are nominated by the Chief Executive Officer
and approved by the Committee, with vesting over a three-year term for employees and a one-year term for directors. Annual employee
grants provide for a periodic award that is both performance and time-based and is designed to recognize the executive s
responsibilities, reward performance and leadership and as a retention tool. The objective of the award is to align compensation
for the named executive officers and directors over a multi-year period directly with the interests of our shareholders by motivating
and rewarding creation and preservation of long-term financial strength, shareholder value and relative shareholder return. 

In
February 2020, shares were granted. Of the shares, shares were time-based, with vesting in 
and vesting ratably over a three-year period. The remaining shares granted are performance-based and are subject
to the achievement of the 2020 long-term incentive performance metrics, with of the performance-based shares vesting for each
performance metric. The primary performance metrics for the 2020 grants are return on equity and earnings per share. Performance-based
shares will be earned based upon how the Company performs relative to threshold, target and maximum absolute goals (i.e. Company-specific,
not relative to a peer index) on an annual performance period for return on equity metrics and for a three-year cumulative performance
period for earnings per share, but will be distributed at the end of the three-year period as earned.

stock conversion, we provided a loan to the ESOP Trust which was used to purchase , or shares, of the common stock
sold in the initial public offering. 

In
January 2007, as part of the second-step stock conversion, we provided an additional loan to the ESOP Trust which was used to

the DB Plan. Eligible employees become vested in the DB Plan after five years of service. In August 2022, the DB Plan s
assets were reallocated into fixed income pooled separate investment accounts offered by Principal Life Insurance Company, a division
of Principal Financial Group, serving as Custodian of the DB Plan (the Custodian ). The DB Plan is administered by
an officer of Westfield Bank (the DB Plan Administrator ). On September 30, 2016, we effected a soft freeze on the
DB Plan and therefore no new participants were included in the DB Plan after such effective date. 

On
July 26, 2022, the Board of Directors approved the termination of the DB Plan, which became effective as of October 31, 2022,
subject to regulatory approvals. Once the Company has received regulatory approval to terminate the DB Plan, which is expected
in the first quarter of 2023, the Company will make an additional cash contribution during the second quarter of 2023, if necessary,
in order to fully fund the DB Plan on a plan termination basis, followed by the purchase of annuity contracts to transfer its
remaining liabilities under the DB Plan, for those participants who do not opt for a one-time lump sum payment. At December 31,
2022, the Company reversed million in net unrealized losses recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income attributed
to both the DB Plan curtailment resulting from the termination of the DB Plan as well as changes in discount rates. In addition,
the Company recorded a gain on curtailment of 2.8 million through non-interest income.

separate accounts are valued at the Net Asset Value NAV of units held by the DB Plan at year end. The NAV is used
as a practical expedient to estimate fair value. This practical expedient would not be used if it was determined to be probable
that the funds will sell the underlying investments for an amount different from the reported NAV. Participant transactions (purchases
and sales) may occur daily. The preceding method described may produce a fair value calculation that may not be indicative of
net realizable value or reflective of future fair values. Furthermore, although the DB Plan administrators believes the valuation
methods are appropriate and consistent with other market participants, the use of different methodologies or assumptions to determine
the fair value of certain financial instruments could result in a different fair value measurement at the reporting date.

The
defined benefit plan offers a mixture of fixed income, equity and real assets as the underlying investment structure for its retirement
structure for the pension plan. In August 2022, the DB Plan s assets were reallocated into short-and-long duration fixed
income pooled separate investment accounts offered by the Custodian. In anticipation of DB Plan settlement during the second quarter
of 2023, the overall investment objective is to preserve principal and protect DB Plan assets from market volatility. Prior to
the DB Plan termination, the target allocation mix for the pension plan for 2022 was an equity-based investment deployment of
 of total portfolio assets based on advice received from an external advisory firm with confirmation by the Bank s Investment
Committee. The remainder of the portfolio was allocated to fixed income at of total assets. Trustees of the DB Plan select
investment managers for the portfolio and a second investment advisory firm is retained to provide allocation analysis.

Cash
Flow Hedges of Interest Rate Risk. 

The
Company s objectives in using interest rate derivatives are to add stability to interest income and expense and to manage
its exposure to interest rate movements. To accomplish these objectives, we entered into interest rate swaps as part of our interest
rate risk management strategy. These interest rate swaps are designated as cash flow hedges and involve the receipt of variable
rate amounts from a counterparty in exchange for our making fixed payments. 

For
derivatives designated as cash flow hedges, the changes in the fair value of the derivative is initially reported in other comprehensive
income (outside of earnings), net of tax, and subsequently reclassified to earnings when the hedged transaction affects earnings.
We are hedging our exposure to the variability in future cash flows for forecasted transactions over a maximum period of six years
(excluding forecasted payment of variable interest on existing financial instruments). There were no cash flow hedges on the balance
sheet as of December 31, 2022 or 2021. 

Non-hedging
Derivatives. 

Derivatives
not designated as hedges are not speculative, but rather result from a service the Company provides to certain customers. The
Company executes loan-level derivative products such as interest-rate swap agreements with commercial banking customers to aid
them in managing their interest-rate risk by converting floating-rate loan payments to fixed-rate loan payments. The Company concurrently
enters into offsetting swaps with a third-party financial institution, effectively minimizing the Company s net risk exposure
resulting from such transactions. The third-party financial institution exchanges the customer s fixed-rate loan payments for
floating-rate loan payments. As the interest-rate swap agreements associated with this program do not meet hedge accounting requirements,
changes in the fair value are recognized directly in earnings.

Credit-risk-related
Contingent Features 

By
using derivative financial instruments, we expose ourselves to credit risk. Credit risk is the risk of failure by the counterparty
to perform under the terms of the derivative contract. When the fair value of a derivative contract is positive, the counterparty
owes us, which creates credit risk for us. When the fair value of a derivative is negative, we owe the counterparty and, therefore,
it does not possess credit risk. The credit risk in derivative instruments is mitigated by entering into transactions with highly-rated
counterparties that we believe to be creditworthy and by limiting the amount of exposure to each counterparty. 

We
have agreements with our derivative counterparties that contain a provision where if we default on any of our indebtedness, including default
where repayment of the indebtedness has not been accelerated by the lender, then we could also be declared in default
on our derivative obligations. We also have agreements with certain of our derivative counterparties that contain a provision
where if we fail to maintain our status as well capitalized, then the counterparty could terminate the derivative positions and
we would be required to settle our obligations under the agreements. Certain of our agreements with our derivative counterparties
contain provisions where if a formal administrative action by a federal or state regulatory agency occurs that materially changes
our creditworthiness in an adverse manner, we may be required to fully collateralize our obligations under the derivative instrument. 

At
December 31, 2022, we had minimum collateral posting thresholds with certain of our derivative counterparties. As of December
31, 2022, we were not required to post collateral under these agreements because we did not have any derivatives in a liability
position with those counterparties.

On
October 13, 2022, the Company announced the completion of its previously authorized stock repurchase plan (the 2021 Plan pursuant to which the Company was authorized to repurchase up to million shares, or of its outstanding common stock, as
of the date the 2021 Plan was adopted. On July 26, 2022, the Board of Directors authorized a new stock repurchase plan (the 2022
Plan ), pursuant to which the Company is authorized to repurchase up to million shares, which is approximately .0 
of the Company s outstanding common stock as of the date the 2022 Plan was adopted. During the three months ended December
31, 2022, the Company repurchased shares of common stock under the 2022 Plan and during the twelve months ended December
31, 2022, the Company repurchased shares of common stock under both the 2021 and 2022 Plans. As of December 31, 2022,
there were shares of common stock available for repurchase under the 2022 Plan. 

We
are subject to dividend restrictions imposed by various regulators, including a limitation on the total of all dividends that
the Bank may pay to the Company in any calendar year, to an amount that shall not exceed the Bank s net income for the current
year, plus its net income retained for the two previous years, without regulatory approval. At December 31, 2022, the Bank had
 million in retained earnings available for payment of dividends without prior regulatory approval. In addition, the Bank
may not declare or pay dividends on, and we may not repurchase, any of our shares of common stock if the effect thereof would
cause shareholders equity to be reduced below applicable regulatory capital maintenance requirements or if such declaration,
payment or repurchase would otherwise violate regulatory requirements. The Bank will be prohibited from paying cash dividends
to the Company to the extent that any such payment would reduce the Bank s capital below required capital levels. Accordingly,
 million and million of our equity in the net assets of the Bank was restricted at December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively.

We
use the same credit policies in making commitments and conditional obligations as for on balance sheet instruments. 

Commitments
to extend credit are agreements to lend to a customer as long as there is no violation of any condition established in the contract.
Commitments generally have fixed expiration dates or other termination clauses and may require payment of a fee. Since some commitments
expire without being drawn upon, the total commitment amounts do not necessarily represent future cash requirements. We evaluate
each customer s creditworthiness on a case-by-case basis. The amount of collateral obtained, if deemed necessary by us upon
extension of credit, is based on management s credit evaluation of the counterparty. Collateral held varies but may include
accounts receivable, inventory, property, plant and equipment, and income-producing commercial properties. 

Standby
letters of credit are written conditional commitments that guarantee the performance of a customer to a third party. Those guarantees
are primarily issued to support public and private borrowing arrangements. The credit risk involved in issuing letters of credit
is essentially the same as that involved in extending loan facilities to customers. At December 31, 2022 and 2021, outstanding
standby letter of credit commitments totaled 22.0 million and 30.2 million, respectively, with standby letters of credit issued
by the FHLB on our behalf totaling million and million, respectively. 

At
December 31, 2022, outstanding commitments to extend credit totaled million, with million in fixed rate commitments
with interest rates ranging from to and million in variable rate commitments. At December 31, 2021, outstanding
commitments to extend credit totaled million, with million in fixed rate commitments with interest rates ranging
from to and million in variable rate commitments. 

We
also have risk participation agreements RPAs with another financial institution. The RPAs are a guarantee to share
credit risk associated with an interest rate swap on participation loans in the event of counterparty default. As such, we accept
a portion of the credit risk in order to participate in the loans and we receive a one-time fee. The interest rate swap is collateralized
(generally by real estate or business assets) by us and the third party, which limits the credit risk associated with the RPAs.
Per the terms of the RPAs, we must pledge collateral equal to our exposure for the interest rate swap. We monitor overall collateral
as part of our off-balance sheet liability analysis, and at December 31, 2022, believe sufficient collateral is available to cover
potential swap losses. 

In
the ordinary course of business, we are party to various legal proceedings, none of which, in our opinion, will have a material
effect on our consolidated financial position or results of operations. 

Vendor
Contract. 

The
Company entered into a long-term contractual obligation with a vendor for use of its core provider and ancillary services beginning
in 2016. Total remaining contractual obligations outstanding with this vendor as of December 31, 2022 were estimated to be 
million, with million expected to be paid within one year and the remaining million to be paid within the next three
years. 

Investment
Commitments. 

The
Bank is a limited partner in a Small Business Investment Company SBIC and committed to contribute capital of .0
million to the partnership. At December 31, 2022, the SBIC currently has a book value of million and is included in other
assets. The unfunded commitment to the partnership was at December 31, 2022. 

Employment
and change of control agreements. 

We
have entered into employment and change of control agreements with certain senior officers. The initial term of the employment
agreements is for three years subject to separate one-year extensions as approved by the Board of Directors at the end of each
applicable fiscal year. Each employment agreement provides for minimum annual salaries, discretionary cash bonuses and other fringe
benefits as well as severance benefits upon certain terminations of employment that are not for cause. The change of control agreements
expire one year following a notice of non-extension and only provide for severance benefits upon certain terminations of employment
that are not for cause and that are related to a change of control of the Company or the Bank.

Assets
Measured at Fair Value on a Non-recurring Basis. 

The
amount of impaired loans represents the carrying value, net of the related write-down or valuation allowance of impaired loans
for which adjustments are based on the estimated fair value of the underlying collateral. The fair value of impaired
loans with specific allocations of the allowance for loan losses is generally based on real estate appraisals performed by independent
licensed or certified appraisers. These appraisals may utilize a single valuation approach or a combination of approaches
including comparable sales and the income approach. Adjustments are routinely made in the appraisal process by the
appraisers to adjust for differences between the comparable sales and income data available. Management will discount
appraisals as deemed necessary based on the date of the appraisal and new information deemed relevant to the valuation. Such
adjustments are typically significant and result in a Level 3 classification of the inputs for determining fair value. The resulting
losses were recognized in earnings through the provision for loan losses. There were no liabilities measured at fair value on

Fair value estimates are made at a specific point in time, based on relevant market information and information about the financial
instrument. These estimates do not reflect any premium or discount that could result from offering for sale at one time our entire
holdings of a particular financial instrument. Where quoted market prices are not available, fair value estimates are based on
judgments regarding future expected loss experience, current economic conditions, risk characteristics of various financial instruments,
and other factors. These estimates are subjective in nature and involve uncertainties and matters of significant judgment. Changes
in assumptions could significantly affect the estimates.

failure of the Board to appoint or re-appoint or elect or re-elect the Executive to the position with the Company stated in section
3 of this Agreement; 

(B) if
the Executive is a member of the Board, the failure of the shareholders of the Company to elect or re-elect the Executive to the

failure, whether by amendment of the Company s Certificate of Incorporation, the Company s By-Laws, action of the Board
or the Company s shareholders or otherwise, to vest in the Executive the functions, duties, or responsibilities prescribed
in section 3 of this Agreement, unless, during such thirty (30)-day period, the Company cures such failure;

be exempt from Section 409A pursuant to Treasury Regulation Section 1.409A-1(b) (1) as non-taxable benefits; 

(iv) a
lump sum payment in an amount equal to the estimated present value of the salary that the Executive would have earned if he had
continued working for the Company and the Bank during the Remaining Unexpired Employment Period at the highest annual rate of salary
achieved during the period of three (3) years ending immediately prior to the date of termination (the Salary Severance
Payment ). The Salary Severance Payment shall be computed using the following formula: 

where SSP 
is the amount of the Salary Severance Payment (before the deduction of applicable federal, state and local withholding taxes);
 BS is the highest annual rate of salary achieved by the Executive during the period of three (3) years ending immediately
prior to the date of termination; PR is the number of payroll periods that occur during a year under the Company s
normal payroll practices; I equals the applicable federal short term rate established under section 1274 of the Internal
Revenue Code of 1986 (the Code for the month in which the Executive s termination of employment occurs (the
 Short Term AFR and n equals the product of the Remaining Unexpired Employment Period at the Executive s
termination of employment (expressed in years and fractions of years) multiplied by the number of payroll periods that occur during
a year under the Company s and the Bank s normal payroll practices. The Salary Severance Payment shall be made within
five (5) business days after the Executive s termination of employment and shall be in lieu of any claim to a continuation
of base salary which the Executive might otherwise have and in lieu of cash severance benefits under any severance benefits program
which may be in effect for officers or employees of the Bank or the Company; 

6 

(v) a
lump sum payment in an amount equal to the estimated present value of the annual bonuses that the Executive would have earned if
he had continued working for the Company and the Bank during the Remaining Unexpired Employment Period at the highest annual rate
of salary achieved during the period of three (3) years ending immediately prior to the date of termination (the Bonus Severance
Payment ). The Bonus Severance Payment shall be computed using the following formula: 

BSP = SSP x (ABP
/ ASP) 

where BSP 
is the amount of the Bonus Severance Payment (before the deduction of applicable federal, state and local withholding taxes); SSP 
is the amount of the Salary Severance Payment (before the deduction of applicable federal, state and local withholding taxes);
 BP is the aggregate of the annual bonuses paid or declared (whether or not paid) for the most recent period of three
(3) calendar years to end on or before the Executive s termination of employment; and SP is the aggregate base
salary actually paid to the Executive during such period of three (3) calendar years (excluding any year for which no bonus was
declared or paid). The Bonus Severance Payment shall be made within five (5) business days after the Executive s termination
of employment and shall be in lieu of any claim to a continuation of participation in annual bonus plans of the Bank or the Company
which the Executive might otherwise have; 

(vi) a
lump sum payment in an amount equal to the estimated present value of the long-term incentive bonuses that the Executive would
have earned if he had continued working for the Company and the Bank during the Remaining Unexpired Employment Period (the Incentive
Severance Payment ). The Incentive Severance Payment shall be computed using the following formula: 

ISP = (SSP
/ RUP) x (ALTIP / ALTSP) x Y 

where ISP 
is the amount of the Incentive Severance Payment (before the deduction of applicable federal, state and local withholding taxes);
 SSP is the amount of the Salary Severance Payment (before the deduction of applicable federal, state and local withholding
taxes); ALTIP is the aggregate of the most recently paid or declared (whether or not paid) long-term incentive compensation
payments (but not more than three (3) such payments) for performance periods that end on or before the Executive s termination
of employment; ALTSP is the aggregate base salary actually paid to the Executive during the performance periods covered
by the payments included in ALTIP and excluding base salary paid for any period for which no long-term incentive
compensation payment was declared or paid; RUP is the Remaining Unexpired Employment Period, expressed in years and
fractions of years; and Y is the aggregate (expressed in years and fractions of years) of the Remaining Unexpired
Employment Period plus the number of years and fraction of years that have elapsed since the end of the last performance period
for which a long-term incentive payment has been declared and paid. In the event that the Executive s employment terminates
prior to the payment date under any long-term incentive compensation plan, then for purposes of computing the Incentive Severance
Payment, the ALTSP shall be deemed to be the average of the target and maximum award level under such plan and the
 ALTSP shall be deemed to be the Executive s annual base salary as in effect on the Executive s termination
of employment. The Incentive Severance Payment shall be made within five (5) business days after the Executive s termination
of employment and shall be in lieu of any claim to a continuation of participation in cash long-term incentive compensation plans
of the Bank or the Company which the Executive might otherwise have; 

7 

(vii) a
lump sum payment in an amount equal to the excess (if any) of (A) the present value of the aggregate benefits to which he would
be entitled under any and all tax-qualified and non-tax-qualified defined benefit plans maintained by, or covering employees of,
the Company or the Bank (the Pension Plans if he had continued working for the Company and the. Bank during the
Remaining Unexpired Employment Period; over (B) the present value of the benefits to which the Executive and his spouse and/or
designated beneficiaries are actually entitled under such plans (the Pension Severance Payment ). The Pension Severance
Payment shall be computed according to the following formula: 

PSP=PPB - APB 

where PSP 
is the amount of the Pension Severance Payment (before deductions for applicable federal, state and local withholding taxes); APB 
is the aggregate lump sum present value of the actual vested pension benefits payable under the Pension Plans in the form of a
straight life annuity beginning at the earliest date permitted under the Pension Plans, computed on the basis of the Executive s
life expectancy at the earliest date on which payments under the Pension Plans could begin, determined by reference to Table VI
of section 1.72-9 of the Income Tax Regulations (the Assumed Life Expectancy ), and on the basis of an interest rate
assumption equal to the average bond-equivalent yield on United States Treasury Securities with a Constant Maturity of thirty (30)
Years for the month prior to the month in which the Executive s termination of employment occurs (the 30-Year Treasury
Rate ); and PPB is the lump sum present value of the pension benefits (whether or not vested) that would be
payable under the Pension Plans in the form of a straight life annuity beginning at the earliest date permitted under the Pension
Plans, computed on the basis that the Executive s actual age at termination of employment is his attained age as of his last
birthday that would occur during the Remaining Unexpired Employment Period, that his service for benefit accrual purposes under
the Pension Plans is equal to the aggregate of his actual service plus the Remaining Unexpired Employment Period, that his average
compensation figure used in determining his accrued benefit is equal to the highest annual rate of salary achieved by the Executive
during the period of three (3) years ending immediately prior to the date of termination, that the Executive s life expectancy
at the earliest date on which payments under the Pension Plans could begin is the Assumed Life Expectancy and that the interest
rate assumption used is equal to the 30-Year Treasury Rate. The Pension Severance Payment shall be made within five (5) business
days after the Executive s termination of employment and shall be in lieu of any claim to any actual increase in his accrued
benefit in the Pension Plans in respect of the Remaining Unexpired Employment Period; provided, however, that if the Pension
Severance Payment represents the benefits under a non-tax-qualified benefit plan, the payment shall be paid in the same time and
form as provided under the related non-tax-qualified benefit plan; 

8 

(viii) a
lump sum payment in an amount equal to the present value of the additional employer contributions that would have been credited
directly to his account(s) under any and all tax-qualified and non-tax-qualified defined contribution plans maintained by, or covering
employees of, the Bank and the Company (the Non-ESOP DC Plans ), plus the fair market value of the additional shares
of employer securities or other property that would have been allocated to his account as a result of employer contributions or
dividends under any tax-qualified leveraged employee stock ownership plan and any related non-tax-qualified supplemental plan maintained
by, or covering employees of, the Bank and the Company (the ESOP Plans if he had continued in employment during
the Remaining Unexpired Employment Period (the Defined Contribution Severance Payment ). The Defined Contribution
Severance Payment shall be computed according to the following formula: 

DCSP = [SSP x
(EC / BS)] + [(STK + PROP) x Y] 

where: DCSP 
is the amount of the Defined Contribution Severance Payment (before deductions for applicable federal, state and local withholding
taxes); SSP is the amount of the Salary Severance Payment (before deductions for applicable federal, state and local
withholding taxes); EC is the amount of employer contributions actually credited to the Executive s accounts
under the Non-ESOP Plans for the last plan year to end before his termination of employment; BS is the Executive s
compensation taken into account in computing EC; Y is the aggregate (expressed in years and fractions of years) of
the Remaining Unexpired Employment Period and the number of years and fractions of years that have elapsed between the end of plan
year for which EC was computed and the date of the Executive s termination of employment; STK is the fair market
value (determined on the basis of the midpoint of the highest and lowest reported sales price for a share of stock of the same
class during the thirty (30)-day period ending on the day of the Executive s termination of employment (the Fair Market
Value of a Share )) of the employer securities actually allocated to the Executive s accounts under the ESOP Plans
in respect of employer contributions and dividends applied to loan amortization payments for the last plan year to end before his
termination of employment; and PROP is the fair market value (determined as of the day before the Executive s
termination of employment using the same valuation methodology used to value the assets of the ESOP Plans) of the property other
than employer securities actually allocated to the Executive s accounts under the ESOP Plans in respect of employer contributions
and dividends applied to loan amortization payments for the last plan year to end before his termination of employment. The Defined
Contribution Severance Payment shall be made within five (5) business days after the Executive s termination of employment
and shall be in lieu of any claim to any actual increase in his accrued benefit in the Non-ESOP DC Plans or the ESOP DC Plans in
respect of the Remaining Unexpired Employment; provided, however, that if the Defined Contribution Severance Payment represents
the benefits under a non-tax-qualified defined contribution plan, the payment shall be paid in the same time and form as provided
under the related non-tax-qualified defined contribution plan; 

9 

(ix) at
the election of the Company made within thirty (30) days following the Executive s termination of employment, upon the surrender
of options or appreciation rights issued to the Executive under any stock option and appreciation rights plan or program maintained
by, or covering employees of, the Company or the Bank, a lump sum payment in an amount equal to the product of: 

(A) the
excess of (I) the Fair Market Value of a Share, over (II) the exercise price per share for such option or appreciation right, as
specified in or under the relevant plan or program; multiplied by 

(B) the
number of shares with respect to which options or appreciation rights are being surrendered. 

For the purpose
of computing this payment, the Executive shall be deemed fully vested in all options and appreciation rights under any stock option
or appreciation rights plan or program maintained by, or covering employees of, the Company or the Bank, even if he is not vested
under such plan or program; and 

(x) at
the election of the Company made within thirty (30) days following the Executive s termination of employment, upon the surrender
of any shares awarded to the Executive under any restricted stock plan maintained by, or covering employees of, the Company or
the Bank, the Company shall make a lump sum payment in an amount equal to the product of: 

(A) the
Fair Market Value of a Share granted under such plan; multiplied by 

(B) the
number of shares which are being surrendered.

of computing this payment, the Executive shall be deemed fully vested in all shares awarded under any restricted stock plan maintained
by, or covering employees of, the Company or the Bank, even if he is not vested under such plan.

The Company
and the Executive hereby stipulate that the damages which may be incurred by the Executive following any such termination of employment
are not capable of accurate measurement as of the date first above written and that the payments and benefits contemplated by this
section 9(b) constitute reasonable damages under the circumstances and shall be payable without any requirement of proof of actual
damage and without regard to the Executive s efforts, if any, to mitigate damages. The Company and the Executive further
agree that the Company may condition the payments and benefits (if any) due under sections 9(b)(iii), (iv), (v), (vi), (vii), (viii),
(ix) and (x) on the receipt of the Executive s resignation from any and all positions which he holds as an officer, director
or committee member with respect to the Company, the Bank or any subsidiary or affiliate of either of them; provided that such
resignation is requested in writing not later than five (5) business days after termination of employment. 

(c) The
Executive, the Company and the Bank acknowledge that each of the payments and benefits promised to the Executive under this Agreement
must either comply with the requirements of Section 409A and the regulations thereunder or qualify for an exception from compliance.
To that end, the Executive, the Company and the Bank agree that the termination benefits described in Section 9(b) are intended
to be exempt from Section 409A pursuant to Treasury Regulation Section 1.409A-1(b)(4) as short-term deferrals. 

Section 10. Death and Disability Benefits. 

(a) In
the event the Executive s employment with the Company terminates during the Employment Period because of the Executive s
death, then the Company shall pay to the Executive s estate the benefits listed in sections 9(b)(i) and 9(b)(ii) of this
Agreement. 

(b) The
Company may terminate the Executive s employment upon a determination, by vote of a majority of the members of the Boards
of Directors of the Company, acting in reliance on the written advice of a medical professional acceptable to them, that the Executive
is suffering from a physical or mental impairment which, at the date of the determination, has prevented the Executive from performing
his assigned duties on a substantially full-time basis for a period of at least ninety (90) days during the period of one (1) year
ending with the date of the determination or is likely to result in death or prevent the Executive from performing his assigned
duties on a substantially full-time basis for a period of at least ninety (90) days during the period of one (1) year beginning
with the date of the determination. In such event: 

(i) The
Company shall pay and deliver to the Executive (or in the event of his death before payment, to his estate and surviving dependents
and beneficiaries, as applicable) the benefits described in sections 9(b)(i) and 9(b)(ii). 

(ii) In
addition to the benefits described in sections 9(b)(i) and 9(b)(ii), the Company shall continue to pay the Executive his base salary,
at the annual rate in effect for him immediately prior to the termination of his employment, during a period ending on the earliest
of: (A) the expiration of ninety (90) days after the date of termination of his employment; (B) the date on which long-term disability
insurance benefits are first payable to him under any long-term disability insurance plan covering employees of the Bank or the
Company (the LTD Eligibility Date ); (C) the date of his death; and (D) the expiration of the Remaining Unexpired
Employment Period (the Initial Continuation Period ). If the end of the Initial Continuation Period is neither the
LTD Eligibility Date nor the date of his death, the Company shall continue to pay the Executive his base salary, at an annual rate
equal to sixty percent (60 of the annual rate in effect for him immediately prior to the termination of his employment, during
an additional period ending on the earliest of the LTD Eligibility Date, the date of his death and the expiration of the Remaining
Unexpired Employment Period. 

11 

A termination of employment
due to disability under this section 10 shall be effected by notice of termination given to the Executive by the Company and shall
take effect on the later of the effective date of termination specified in such notice or the date on which the notice of termination
is deemed given to the Executive. To that end, the Executive, the Company and the Bank agree that the disability benefits described
in this Section 10 are intended to be exempt from Section 409A pursuant to Treasury Regulation Section 1.409A-3(i) as permissible
payments. 

Section 11. Termination without Additional Company Liability. 

In the event that the
Executive s employment with the Company shall terminate during the Employment Period on account of: 

(a) the
discharge of the Executive for cause, which, for purposes of this Agreement, shall mean a discharge of the Executive
due to the Executive s (i) personal dishonesty, (ii) incompetence, (iii) willful misconduct, (iii) breach of fiduciary duties
involving personal profit, (iv) intentional failure to perform stated duties, (v) willful violation of any law, rule or regulation
(other than traffic violations or similar offenses) or final cease-and-desist order or (vi) material breach of any provision of
this Agreement; provided, however, that, if the Executive engages in any of the acts described in section 11 (a)(vi) above,
the Company shall provide the Executive with written notice of its intent to discharge the Executive for cause, and the Executive
shall have forty-five (45) days from the date on which the Executive receives such notice to cure any such acts; and provided,
further, that on and after the date that a Change of Control occurs, a determination under this section 11 shall require the
affirmative vote of at least three-fourths of the members of the Board acting in good faith and such vote shall not be made prior
to the expiration of a sixty (60)-day period following the date on which the Board shall, by written notice to the Executive, furnish
to him a statement of its grounds for proposing to make such determination, during which period the Executive shall be afforded
a reasonable opportunity to make oral and written presentations to the members of the Board, and to be represented by his legal
counsel at such presentations, to refute the grounds for the proposed determination; or 

(b) the
Executive s voluntary resignation from employment with the Company (including retirement) for reasons other than those specified
in section 9(a)(i) or Section 12; then the Company shall have no further obligations under this Agreement, other than the payment
to the Executive of his earned but unpaid salary as of the date of the termination of his employment and the provision of such
other benefits, if any, to which he is entitled as a former employee under the Company s employee benefit plans and programs
and compensation plans and programs. For purposes of this section 11, no act or failure to act, on the part of the Executive, shall
be considered willful unless it is done, or omitted to be done, by the Executive in bad faith or without reasonable
belief that the Executive s action or omission was in the best interests of the Company. Any act, or failure to act, based
upon authority given pursuant to a resolution duly adopted by the Board or based upon the written advice of counsel for the Company
shall be conclusively presumed to be done, or omitted to be done, by the Executive in good faith and in the best interests of the
Company. The cessation of employment of the Executive shall not be deemed to be for cause within the meaning of section
11(a) unless and until there shall have been delivered to the Executive a copy of a resolution duly adopted by the affirmative
vote of three-fourths of the members of the Board at a meeting of the Board called and held for such purpose (after reasonable
notice is provided to the Executive and the Executive is given an opportunity, together with counsel, to be heard before the Board),
finding that, in the good faith opinion of the Board, the Executive is guilty of the conduct described in section 11(a) above,
and specifying the particulars thereof in detail.

Section 13. Confidentiality. 

Unless he obtains the
prior written consent of the Company, the Executive shall keep confidential and shall refrain from using for the benefit of himself,
or any person or entity other than the Company or any entity which is a subsidiary of the Company or of which the Company is a
subsidiary, any material document or information obtained from the Company, or from its parent or subsidiaries, in the course of
his employment with any of them concerning their properties, operations or business (unless such document or information is readily
ascertainable from public or published information or trade sources or has otherwise been made available to the public through
no fault of his own) until the same ceases to be material (or becomes so ascertainable or available); provided, however, that
nothing in this section 13 shall prevent the Executive, with or without the Company s consent, from participating in or disclosing
documents or information in connection with any judicial or administrative investigation, inquiry or proceeding to the extent that
such participation or disclosure is required under applicable law. 

Section 14. Solicitation.

offer employment to, or take any other action intended, or that a reasonable person acting in like circumstances would expect,
to have the effect of causing any officer or employee of the Company, the Bank or any of their respective subsidiaries or affiliates
to terminate his or her employment and accept employment or become affiliated with, or provide services for compensation in any
capacity whatsoever to, any savings bank, savings and loan association, bank, bank holding company, savings and loan holding company,
or other institution engaged in the business of accepting deposits, making loans or doing business within Hampden county or any
other county in which the Company or the Bank maintains an office; 

15

any information, advice or recommendation with respect to any such officer or employee of any savings bank, savings and loan company,
bank, bank holding company, savings and loan holding company, or other institution engaged in the business of accepting deposits,
making loans or doing business within Hampden county or any other county in which the Company or the Bank maintains an office;
that is intended, or that a reasonable person acting in like circumstances would expect, to have the effect of causing any officer
or employee of the Company, the Bank, or any of their respective subsidiaries or affiliates to terminate his employment and accept
employment or become affiliated with, or provide services for compensation in any capacity whatsoever to, any savings bank, savings
and loan association, bank, bank holding company, savings and loan holding company, or other institution engaged in the business
of accepting deposits, making loans or doing business within Hampden county or any other county in which the Company or the Bank
maintains an office; 

(c) solicit,
provide any information, advice or recommendation or take any other action intended, or that a reasonable person acting in like
circumstances would expect, to have the effect of causing any customer of the Company, the Bank or any of their respective subsidiaries

not apply if the Executive is entitled to the benefits under section 12. 

Section 15. No Effect on Employee Benefit Plans or Programs. 

The termination of
the Executive s employment during the term of this Agreement or thereafter, whether by the Company or by the Executive, shall
have no effect on the rights and obligations of the parties hereto under the Company s qualified or non-qualified retirement,
pension, savings, thrift, profit-sharing or stock bonus plans, group life, health (including hospitalization, medical and major
medical), dental, accident and long term disability insurance plans or such other employee benefit plans or programs, or compensation
plans or programs, as may be maintained by, or cover employees of, the Company from time to time; provided, however, that
nothing in this Agreement shall be deemed to duplicate any compensation or benefits provided under any agreement, plan or program
covering the Executive to which the Company is a party and any duplicative amount payable under any such agreement, plan or program
shall be applied as an offset to reduce the amounts otherwise payable hereunder. 

16 

Section 16. Other Termination. 

Upon the expiration
of this Agreement, other than on account of the Executive s refusing to accept an extension offered by the Company or the
Executive s giving of a notice of non-extension, unless the Company shall offer to the Executive continued service either:
(i) in the same position in effect immediately prior to the expiration of this Agreement with cash compensation and pension and
welfare benefits no less favorable than those in effect immediately prior to the expiration of this Agreement; or (ii) in another
position acceptable to the Executive and upon mutually and reasonably agreeable terms, and termination of employment, the Executive
shall be entitled to receive for a period of twelve (12) months after the expiration of the Agreement (in this event, the Severance
Period and continuation of base salary at the rate then in effect plus medical, dental, life-insurance and disability coverage;
provided, that the Executive s continued participation is permissible or otherwise practicable under the general terms and
provisions of such plans. To the extent that continued participation is neither permissible nor practicable, the Company shall
take such actions as may be necessary to provide the Executive with substantially comparable benefits (without additional cost
to the Executive) outside the scope of such plans. If the Executive engages in regular employment after his termination of employment
(whether as an executive or as a self-employed person), any employee welfare benefits received by the Executive during the Severance
Period in consideration of such employment which are similar in nature to the employee welfare benefits provided by the Company
will relieve the Company of their obligations under this section 16 to provide comparable benefits to the extent of the benefits
so received. This section 16 shall have no application if, prior to the expiration of this Agreement, the Executive s employment
has terminated in a termination to which section 9, 10, 11 or 12 applies or if, after the expiration of this Agreement, the Executive s
employment is terminated with Cause. 

The Executive, the
Company and the Bank agree that the termination benefits other than the salary continuation payments described in this Section
16 are intended to be exempt from Section 409A pursuant to Treasury Regulation Section 1.409A-1(b)(1) as non-taxable benefits.

the Company, and their respective successors and assigns, including any successor by merger or consolidation or a statutory receiver
or any other person or firm or corporation to which all or substantially all of the assets and business of the Company may be sold
or otherwise transferred. Failure of the Company to obtain from any successor its express written assumption of the Company s
obligations hereunder at least sixty (60) days in advance of the scheduled effective date of any such succession shall be deemed
a material breach of this Agreement.

or permitted to be given under this Agreement, including any notice, direction, designation, consent, instruction, objection or
waiver, shall be in writing and shall be deemed to have been given at such time as it is delivered personally, or five (5) days

by him in connection with or arising out of any action, suit or proceeding in which he may be involved, as a result of his efforts,
in good faith, to defend or enforce the terms of this Agreement. For purposes of this Agreement, any settlement agreement which
provides for payment of any amounts in settlement of the Company s or the Bank s obligations hereunder shall be conclusive
evidence of the Executive s entitlement to indemnification hereunder, and any such indemnification payments shall be in addition
to amounts payable pursuant to such settlement agreement, unless such settlement agreement expressly provides otherwise. Any such
indemnification payments will occur promptly following a request therefor, and in any event not later than the last day of the
calendar year following the calendar year in which the indemnified expense is incurred or in which the Executive s legal
right thereto is finally determined. 

(b) The

shall not be affected by any set-off, counterclaim, recoupment, defense or other claim, right or action which the Company may have
against the Executive or others. In no event shall the Executive be obligated to seek other employment or take any other action
by way of mitigation of the amounts payable to the Executive under any of the provisions of this Agreement and such amounts shall
not be reduced whether or not the Executive obtains other employment.

any provision of this Agreement is invalid or unenforceable shall not affect the validity or enforceability of any other provision
hereof. 

Section 21. Waiver .

strict compliance with any of the terms, covenants or conditions hereof shall not be deemed a waiver of such term, covenant, or
condition. A waiver of any provision of this Agreement must be made in writing, designated as a waiver, and signed by the party
against whom its enforcement is sought. Any waiver or relinquishment of any right or power hereunder at any one (1) or more times
shall not be deemed a waiver or relinquishment of such right or power at any other time or times.

the same Agreement.

preempted by federal law, this Agreement shall be governed by and construed and enforced in accordance with the laws of the Commonwealth
of Massachusetts applicable to contracts entered into and to be performed entirely within the Commonwealth of Massachusetts. 

Section 24. Headings and Construction. 

The headings of sections
in this Agreement are for convenience of reference only and are not intended to qualify the meaning of any section. Any reference
to a section number shall refer to a section of this Agreement, unless otherwise stated.

Section 26. Non-duplication. 

The Company hereby
agrees to guarantee the payment by the Bank of any benefits and compensation to which the Executive is, or may be, entitled under
the terms and conditions of the employment agreement of even date herewith between the Bank and the Executive. In the event that
the Executive shall perform services for the Bank or any other direct or indirect subsidiary or affiliate of the Company or the
Bank, any compensation or benefits provided to the Executive by such other employer shall be applied to offset the obligations
of the Company hereunder, it being intended that this Agreement set forth the aggregate compensation and benefits payable to the
Executive for all services to the Company, the Bank and all of their respective direct or indirect subsidiaries and affiliates. 

Section 27. Dispute Resolution. 

(a) The
Executive acknowledges and agrees that upon any breach by the Executive of his obligations under sections 13 or 14 hereof, the
Company and Bank will have no adequate remedy at law, and accordingly will be entitled, in addition to monetary damages, to specific
performance and other appropriate injunctive and equitable relief. 

(b) Excluding
only requests for equitable relief by the Company or Bank under section 28(a) of this Agreement, in the event that there is any
claim or dispute arising out of or relating to this Agreement, or the breach thereof, and the parties hereto shall not have resolved
such claim or dispute within sixty (60) days after written notice from one (1) party to the other setting forth the nature of such
claim or dispute, then such claim or dispute shall be settled exclusively by binding arbitration in Boston, Massachusetts in accordance
with the Employment Arbitration Rules of the American Arbitration Association by an arbitrator mutually agreed upon by the parties
hereto or, in the absence of such agreement, by an arbitrator selected according to such Rules. Notwithstanding the foregoing,
if either the Company and Bank or the Executive shall request, such arbitration shall be conducted by a panel of three (3) arbitrators,
one (1) selected by the Company and Bank, one (1) selected by the Executive and the third selected by agreement of the first two
(2), or, in the absence of such agreement, in accordance with such Rules. Judgment upon the award rendered by such arbitrator(s)
shall be entered in any court having jurisdiction thereof upon the application of either party.

average annual compensation for the last five (5) consecutive calendar years to end prior to his termination of employment with
the Company (or for his entire period of employment with the Company if less than five (5) calendar years). The compensation payable

(e) Notwithstanding
anything herein contained to the contrary, if the Company is in default (within the meaning of section 3(x)(1) of the FDI Act,
12 U.S.C. 1813(x)(1), all obligations of the Company under this Agreement shall terminate as of the date of default, but
vested rights and obligations of the Company and the Executive shall not be affected. 

(f) Notwithstanding
anything herein contained to the contrary, all prospective obligations of the Bank hereunder shall be terminated, except to the
extent that a continuation of this Agreement is necessary for the continued operation of the Bank: (i) by the Director of the OCC
or his designee or the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation FDIC ), at the time the FDIC enters into an agreement
to provide assistance to or on behalf of the Bank under the authority contained in section 13(c) of the FDI Act, 12 U.S.C. Section
1823(c); (ii) by the Director of the OCC or his designee at the time such Director or designee approves a supervisory merger to
resolve problems related to the operation of the Bank or when the Bank is determined by such Director to be in an unsafe or unsound
condition. The vested rights and obligations of the parties shall not be affected. 

If and to the extent
that any of the foregoing provisions shall cease to be required or by applicable law, rule or regulation, the same shall become
inoperative as though eliminated by formal amendment of this Agreement. 

21 

Section 30. Payments to Key Employees. 

Notwithstanding anything
in this Agreement to the contrary, to the extent required under Section 409A, no payment to be made to a key employee (within the
meaning of Section 409A) shall be made sooner than six (6) months after such termination of employment; provided, however, that
to the extent such six (6)-month delay is imposed by Section 409A as a result of a Change of Control as defined in Section 12(a),
the payment shall be paid into a rabbi trust for the benefit of the Executive as if the six (6)-month delay was not imposed with
such amounts then being distributed to the Executive as soon as permissible under Section 409A. 

Section 31. Involuntary Termination Payments to Employees (Safe
Harbor). 

In the event a payment
is made to an employee upon an involuntary termination of employment, as deemed pursuant to this Agreement, such payment will not
be subject to Section 409A provided that such payment does not exceed two (2) times the lesser of (i) the sum of the Executive s
annualized compensation based on the taxable year immediately preceding the year in which termination of employment occurs or (ii)
the maximum amount that may be taken into account under a qualified plan pursuant to Section 401(a)(17) of the Code for the year
in which the Executive terminates service (the Safe Harbor Amount ). However, if such payment exceeds the Safe Harbor
Amount, only the amount in excess of the Safe Harbor Amount will be subject to Section 409A. In addition, if such Executive is
considered a key employee, such payment in excess of the Safe Harbor Amount will have its timing delayed and will be subject to
the six (6)-month wait-period imposed by Section 409A as provided in Section 30 of this Agreement. The Executive, the Company and
the Bank agree that the termination benefits described in this Section 31 are intended to be exempt from Section 409A pursuant
to Treasury Regulation Section 1.409A-1(b)(9)(iii) as the safe harbor for separation pay due to involuntary separation from service.

be exempt from Section 409A pursuant to Treasury Regulation Section 1.409A-l(b) (1) as non-taxable benefits;

lump sum payment in an amount equal to the estimated present value of the salary that the Executive would have earned if he had
continued working for the Company and the Bank during the Remaining Unexpired Employment Period at the highest annual rate of salary
achieved during the period of three (3) years ending immediately prior to the date of termination (the Salary Severance
Payment ). The Salary Severance Payment shall be computed using the following formula: 

5 

n 
 
 (BS/PR)

 [ 
 [1 + (I 1 PR)] n 
 ] 

where SSP is the
amount of the Salary Severance Payment (before the deduction of applicable federal, state and local withholding taxes); BS 
is the highest annual rate of salary achieved by the Executive during the period of three (3) years ending immediately prior to
the date of termination; PR is the number of payroll periods that occur during a year under the Company s normal
payroll practices; I equals the applicable federal short term rate established under section 1274 of the Internal
Revenue Code of 1986 (the Code for the month in which the Executive s termination of employment occurs (the
 Short Term AFR and n equals the product of the Remaining Unexpired Employment Period at the Executive s
termination of employment (expressed in years and fractions of years) multiplied by the number of payroll periods that occur during
a year under the Company s and the Bank s normal payroll practices. The Salary Severance Payment shall be
made within five (5) business days after the Executive s termination of employment and shall be in lieu of any claim to a
continuation of base salary which the Executive might otherwise have and in lieu of cash severance benefits under any severance
benefits program which may be in effect for officers or employees of the Bank or the Company; 

(v) a
lump sum payment in an amount equal to the estimated present value of the annual bonuses that the Executive would have earned if
he had continued working for the Company and the Bank during the Remaining Unexpired Employment Period at the highest annual rate
of salary achieved during the period of three (3) years ending immediately prior to the date of termination (the Bonus Severance
Payment ). The Bonus Severance Payment shall be computed using the following formula: 

BSP= SSP x (ABP/ASP)

amount of the Bonus Severance Payment (before the deduction of applicable federal, state and local withholding taxes); SSP 
is the amount of the Salary Severance Payment (before the deduction of applicable federal, state and local withholding taxes);
 BP is the aggregate of the annual bonuses paid or declared (whether or not paid) for the most recent period of three
(3) calendar years to end on or before the Executive s termination of employment; and SP is the aggregate base
salary actually paid to the Executive during such period of three (3) calendar years (excluding any year for which no bonus was
declared or paid). The Bonus Severance Payment shall be made within five (5) business days after the Executive s termination
of employment and shall be in lieu of any claim to a continuation of participation in annual bonus plans of the Bank or the Company
which the Executive might otherwise have; 

(vi) a
lump sum payment in an amount equal to the estimated present value of the long-term incentive bonuses that the Executive would
have earned if he had continued working for the Company and the Bank during the Remaining Unexpired Employment Period (the Incentive
Severance Payment ). The Incentive Severance Payment shall be computed using the following formula: 

ISP = (SSP / RUP) x (ALTIP /
ALTSP) x Y 

6 

where ISP is the
amount of the Incentive Severance Payment (before the deduction of applicable federal, state and local withholding taxes); SSP 
is the amount of the Salary Severance Payment (before the deduction of applicable federal, state and local withholding taxes);
 ALTIP is the aggregate of the most recently paid or declared (whether or not paid) long-term incentive compensation
payments (but not more than three (3) such payments) for performance periods that end on or before the Executive s termination
of employment; ALTSP is the aggregate base salary actually paid to the Executive during the performance periods covered
by the payments included in ALTSP and excluding base salary paid for any period for which no long-term incentive
compensation payment was declared or paid; RUP is the Remaining Unexpired Employment Period, expressed in years and
fractions of years; and Y is the aggregate (expressed in years and fractions of years) of the Remaining Unexpired
Employment Period plus the number of years and fraction of years that have elapsed since the end of the last performance period
for which a long-term incentive payment has been declared and paid. In the event that the Executive s employment terminates
prior to the payment date under any long-term incentive compensation plan, then for purposes of computing the Incentive Severance
Payment, the ALTSP shall be deemed to be the average of the target and maximum award level under such plan and the
 ALTSP shall be deemed to be the Executive s annual base salary as in effect on the Executive s termination
of employment. The Incentive Severance Payment shall be made within five (5) business days after the Executive s termination
of employment and shall be in lieu of any claim to a continuation of participation in cash long-term incentive compensation plans
of the Bank or the Company which the Executive might otherwise have; 

(vii) a
lump sum payment in an amount equal to the excess (if any) of: (A) the present value of the aggregate benefits to which he would
be entitled under any and all tax-qualified and non-tax-qualified defined benefit plans maintained by, or covering employees of,
the Company or the Bank (the Pension Plans if he had continued working for the Company and the Bank during the Remaining
Unexpired Employment Period; over (B) the present value of the benefits to which the Executive and his spouse and/or designated
beneficiaries are actually entitled under such plans (the Pension Severance Payment ). The Pension Severance Payment
shall be computed according to the following formula: 

PSP=PPB-APB 

where PSP is the
amount of the Pension Severance Payment (before deductions for applicable federal, state and local withholding taxes); APB 
is the aggregate lump sum present value of the actual vested pension benefits payable under the Pension Plans in the form of a
straight life annuity beginning at the earliest date permitted under the Pension Plans, computed on the basis of the Executive s
life expectancy at the earliest date on which payments under the Pension Plans could begin, determined by reference to Table VI
of section 1.72-9 of the Income Tax Regulations (the Assumed Life Expectancy ), and on the basis of an interest rate
assumption equal to the average bond-equivalent yield on United States Treasury Securities with a Constant Maturity of thirty (30)
Years for the month prior to the month in which the Executive s termination of employment occurs (the 30-Year Treasury
Rate ); and PPB is the lump sum present value of the pension benefits (whether or not vested) that would be
payable under the Pension Plans in the form of a straight life annuity beginning at the earliest date permitted under the Pension
Plans, computed on the basis that the Executive s actual age at termination of employment is his attained age as of his last
birthday that would occur during the Remaining Unexpired Employment Period, that his service for benefit accrual purposes under
the Pension Plans is equal to the aggregate of his actual service plus the Remaining Unexpired Employment Period, that his average
compensation figure used in determining his accrued benefit is equal to the highest annual rate of salary achieved by the Executive
during the period of three (3) years ending immediately prior to the date of termination, that the Executive s life expectancy
at the earliest date on which payments under the Pension Plans could begin is the Assumed Life Expectancy and that the interest
rate assumption used is equal to the 30-Year Treasury Rate. The Pension Severance Payment shall be made within five (5) business
days after the Executive s termination of employment and shall be in lieu of any claim to any actual increase in his accrued
benefit in the Pension Plans in respect of the Remaining Unexpired Employment Period; provided, however, that if the Pension
Severance Payment represents the benefits under a non-tax-qualified benefit plan, the payment shall be paid in the same time and
form as provided under the related non-tax-qualified benefit plan; and 

7 

(viii) 
a lump sum payment in an amount equal to the present value of the additional employer contributions that would have been credited
directly to his account(s) under any and all tax-qualified and non-tax-qualified defined contribution plans maintained by, or covering
employees of, the Bank and the Company (the Non-ESOP DC Plans ), plus the fair market value of the additional shares
of employer securities or other property that would have been allocated to his account as a result of employer contributions or
dividends under any tax-qualified leveraged employee stock ownership plan and any related non-tax-qualified supplemental plan maintained
by, or covering employees of, the Bank and the Company (the ESOP Plans if he had continued in employment during
the Remaining Unexpired Employment Period (the Defined Contribution Severance Payment ). The Defined Contribution
Severance Payment shall be computed according to the following formula: 

DCSP = [SSP x (EC / BS)] + [(STK
+ PROP) x Y] 

where: DCSP is
the amount of the Defined Contribution Severance Payment (before deductions for applicable federal, state and local withholding
taxes); SSP is the amount of the Salary Severance Payment (before deductions for applicable federal, state and local
withholding taxes); EC is the amount of employer contributions actually credited to the Executive s accounts
under the Non-ESOP Plans for the last plan year to end before his termination of employment; BS is the Executive s
compensation taken into account in computing EC; Y is the aggregate (expressed in years and fractions of years) of
the Remaining Unexpired Employment Period and the number of years and fractions of years that have elapsed between the end of plan
year for which EC was computed and the date of the Executive s termination of employment; STK is the fair market
value (determined on the basis of the mid-point of the highest and lowest reported sales price for a share of stock of the same
class during the thirty (30)-day period ending on the day of the Executive s termination of employment (the Fair Market
Value of a Share )) of the employer securities actually allocated to the Executive s accounts under the ESOP Plans
in respect of employer contributions and dividends applied to loan amortization payments for the last plan year to end before his
termination of employment; and PROP is the fair market value (determined as of the day before the Executive s
termination of employment using the same valuation methodology used to value the assets of the ESOP Plans) of the property other
than employer securities actually allocated to the Executive s accounts under the ESOP Plans in respect of employer contributions
and dividends applied to loan amortization payments for the last plan year to end before his termination of employment. The Defined
Contribution Severance Payment shall be made within five (5) business days after the Executive s termination of employment
and shall be in lieu of any claim to any actual increase in his accrued benefit in the Non-ESOP DC Plans or the ESOP DC Plans in
respect of the Remaining Unexpired Employment; provided, however, that if the Defined Contribution Severance Payment represents
the benefits under a non-tax-qualified defined contribution plan, the payment shall be paid in the same time and form as provided
under the related non-tax-qualified defined contribution plan. 

8 

The Bank and the Executive hereby stipulate
that the damages which may be incurred by the Executive following any such termination of employment are not capable of accurate
measurement as of the date first above written and that the payments and benefits contemplated by this section 9(b) constitute
reasonable damages under the circumstances and shall be payable without any requirement of proof of actual damage and without regard
to the Executive s efforts, if any, to mitigate damages. The Bank and the Executive further agree that the Bank may condition
the payments and benefits (if any) due under sections 9(b)(iii), (iv), (v), (vi), (vii) and (viii) on the receipt of the Executive s
resignation from any and all positions which he holds as an officer, director or committee member with respect to the Company,
the Bank or any subsidiary or affiliate of either of them; provided that such resignation is requested in writing not later than
five (5) business days after termination of employment. 

(c) The
Executive, the Company and the Bank acknowledge that each of the payments and benefits promised to the Executive under this Agreement
must either comply with the requirements of Section 409A and the regulations thereunder or qualify for an exception from compliance.
To that end, the Executive, the Company and the Bank agree that the termination benefits described in Section 9(b) are intended
to be exempt from Section 409A pursuant to Treasury Regulation Section 1.409A-1(b)(4) as short-term deferrals. 

Section 10. Death and Disability Benefits. 

(a) In
the event the Executive s employment with the Bank terminates during the Employment Period because of the Executive s
death, then the Bank shall pay to the Executive s estate the benefits listed in sections 9(b)(i) and 9(b)(ii) of this Agreement. 

9 

(b) The
Bank may terminate the Executive s employment upon a determination, by vote of a majority of the members of the Boards of
Directors of the Bank, acting in reliance on the written advice of a medical professional acceptable to them, that the Executive
is suffering from a physical or mental impairment which, at the date of the determination, has prevented the Executive from performing
his assigned duties on a substantially full-time basis for a period of at least ninety (90) days during the period of one (1) year
ending with the date of the determination or is likely to result in death or prevent the Executive from performing his assigned
duties on a substantially full-time basis for a period of at least ninety (90) days during the period of one (1) year beginning
with the date of the determination. In such event: 

(i) The
Bank shall pay and deliver to the Executive (or in the event of his death before payment, to his estate and surviving dependents
and beneficiaries, as applicable) the benefits described in sections 9(b)(i) and 9(b)(ii).

 that on and after the date that a Change of Control occurs, a determination under this section 11 shall require the affirmative
vote of at least three-fourths of the members of the Board acting in good faith and such vote shall not be made prior to the expiration

authority given pursuant to a resolution duly adopted by the Board or based upon the written advice of counsel for the Bank shall
be conclusively presumed to be done, or omitted to be done, by the Executive in good faith and in the best interests of the Bank.

three-fourths of the members of the Board at a meeting of the Board called and held for such purpose (after reasonable notice is
provided to the Executive and the Executive is given an opportunity, together with counsel, to be heard before the Board), finding

by him in connection with or arising out of any action, suit or proceeding in which he may be involved, as a result of his efforts,
in good faith, to defend or enforce the terms of this Agreement; provided, however, that the Executive shall have substantially
prevailed on the merits pursuant to a judgment, decree or order of a court of competent jurisdiction or of an arbitrator in an
arbitration proceeding. The determination whether the Executive shall have substantially prevailed on the merits and is therefore
entitled to such indemnification, shall be made by the court or arbitrator, as applicable. In the event of a settlement pursuant
to a settlement agreement, any indemnification payment under this section 18 shall be made only after a determination by the members
of the Board (other than the Executive and any other member of the Board to which the Executive is related by blood or marriage)
that the Executive has acted in good faith and that such indemnification payment is in the best interests of the Bank. For purposes
of this Agreement, any such indemnification payments shall be in addition to amounts payable pursuant to such settlement agreement,
unless such settlement agreement expressly provides otherwise. Any such indemnification payments will occur promptly following
a request therefor, and in any event not later than the last day of the calendar year following the calendar year in which the
indemnified expense is incurred or in which the Executive s legal right thereto is finally determined.

Section 19. Severability. 

A determination that
any provision of this Agreement is invalid or unenforceable shall not affect the validity or enforceability of any other provision
hereof. 

Section 20. Waiver. 

Failure to insist upon
strict compliance with any of the terms, covenants or conditions hereof shall not be deemed a waiver of such term, covenant, or
condition. A waiver of any provision of this Agreement must be made in writing, designated as a waiver, and signed by the party
against whom its enforcement is sought. Any waiver or relinquishment of any right or power hereunder at any one (1) or more times
shall not be deemed a waiver or relinquishment of such right or power at any other time or times.

This Agreement may
be executed in two (2) or more counterparts, each of which shall be deemed an original, and all of which shall constitute one and
the same Agreement.

preempted by federal law, this Agreement shall be governed by and construed and enforced in accordance with the laws of the Commonwealth
of Massachusetts applicable to contracts entered into and to be performed entirely within the Commonwealth of Massachusetts.

administered in such manner as shall be necessary to effect compliance with Section 409A and shall be subject to amendment in the

Bank, any compensation or benefits provided to the Executive by such other employer shall be applied to offset the obligations
of the Bank hereunder. 

Section 26. Dispute Resolution. 

(a) The
Executive acknowledges and agrees that upon any breach by the Executive of his obligations under sections 13 or 14 hereof, the
Company and Bank will have no adequate remedy at law, and accordingly will be entitled, in addition to monetary damages, to specific
performance and other appropriate injunctive and equitable relief. 

(b) Excluding
only requests for equitable relief by the Company or Bank under section 27(a) of this Agreement, in the event that there is any
claim or dispute arising out of or relating to this Agreement, or the breach thereof, and the parties hereto shall not have resolved
such claim or dispute within sixty (60) days after written notice from one (1) party to the other setting forth the nature of such
claim or dispute, then such claim or dispute shall be settled exclusively by binding arbitration in Boston, Massachusetts in accordance

average annual compensation for the last five (5) consecutive calendar years to end prior to his termination of employment with
the Bank (or for his entire period of employment with the Bank if less than five (5) calendar years). The compensation payable
to the Executive hereunder shall be further reduced (but not below zero) if such reduction would avoid the assessment of excise
taxes on excess parachute payments (within the meaning of section 280G of the Code). 

17 

(b) Notwithstanding
anything herein contained to the contrary, any payments to the Executive by the Bank, whether pursuant to this Agreement or otherwise,

of such notice, unless stayed by appropriate proceedings. If the charges in such notice are dismissed, the Bank, in its discretion,
may (i) pay to the Executive all or part of the compensation withheld while the Bank s obligations hereunder were suspended
and (ii) reinstate, in whole or in part, any of the obligations which were suspended. 

(d) Notwithstanding
anything herein contained to the contrary, if the Executive is removed and/or permanently prohibited from participating in the
conduct of the Bank s affairs by an order issued under section 8(e)(4) or 8(g)(1) of the FDI Act, 12 U.S.C. 1818(e)(4)
or (g)(1), all obligations of the Bank under this Agreement shall terminate as of the effective date of the order, but vested rights
of the Bank and the Executive shall not be affected. 

(e) Notwithstanding
anything herein contained to the contrary, if the Bank is in default (within the meaning of section 3(x)(1) of the FDI Act, 12
U.S.C. 1813(x)(1), all obligations of the Bank under this Agreement shall terminate as of the date of default, but vested
rights and obligations of the Bank and the Executive shall not be affected. 

(f) Notwithstanding
anything herein contained to the contrary, all prospective obligations of the Bank hereunder shall be terminated, except to the
extent that a continuation of this Agreement is necessary for the continued operation of the Bank: (i) by the Director of the OCC
or his designee or the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation FDIC ), at the time the FDIC enters into an agreement
to provide assistance to or on behalf of the Bank under the authority contained in section 13(c) of the FDI Act, 12 U.S.C. Section
1823(c); (ii) by the Director of the OCC or his designee at the time such Director or designee approves a supervisory merger to
resolve problems related to the operation of the Bank or when the Bank is determined by such Director to be in an unsafe or unsound
condition. The vested rights and obligations of the parties shall not be affected. 

If and to the extent
that any of the foregoing provisions shall cease to be required or by applicable law, rule or regulation, the same shall become
inoperative as though eliminated by formal amendment of this Agreement. 

18 

Section 29. Payments to Key Employees. 

Notwithstanding anything
in this Agreement to the contrary, to the extent required under Section 409A, no payment to be made to a key employee (within the
meaning of Section 409A) shall be made sooner than six (6) months after such termination of employment; provided, however, that
to the extent such six (6)-month delay is imposed by Section 409A as a result of a Change of Control as defined in Section 12(a),
the payment shall be paid into a rabbi trust for the benefit of the Executive as if the six (6)-month delay was not imposed with
such amounts then being distributed to the Executive as soon as permissible under Section 409A. 

Section 30. Involuntary Termination Payments to Employees (Safe
Harbor). 

In the event a payment
is made to an employee upon an involuntary termination of employment, as deemed pursuant to this Agreement, such payment will not
be subject to Section 409A provided that such payment does not exceed two (2) times the lesser of (i) the sum of the Executive s
annualized compensation based on the taxable year immediately preceding the year in which termination of employment occurs or (ii)
the maximum amount that may be taken into account under a qualified plan pursuant to Section 401(a)(17) of the Code for the year
in which the Executive terminates service (the Safe Harbor Amount ). However, if such payment exceeds the Safe Harbor
Amount, only the amount in excess of the Safe Harbor Amount will be subject to Section 409A. In addition, if such Executive is
considered a key employee, such payment in excess of the Safe Harbor Amount will have its timing delayed and will be subject to
the six (6)-month wait-period imposed by Section 409A as provided in Section 29 of this Agreement. The Executive, the Company and
the Bank agree that the termination benefits described in this Section 30 are intended to be exempt from Section 409A pursuant
to Treasury Regulation Section 1.409A-1(b)(9)(iii) as the safe harbor for separation pay due to involuntary separation from service.

event which would be described in section 1(b)(i), (ii), (iii) or (iv) if the term Bank were substituted for the

of either of them, by the Company, the Bank, or any subsidiary of either of them, or by any employee benefit plan maintained by
any of them. For purposes of this section 1(b), the term person shall have the meaning assigned to it under sections

contemplated does, in fact, occur. 

Section 2. Discharge Prior to a Pending Change of Control. 

The Bank may discharge
the Officer at any time prior to the occurrence of a Pending Change of Control for any reason or for no reason. In such event: 

(a) The
Bank shall pay to the Officer (or, in the event of his death, his estate) his earned but unpaid compensation (including, without

The Officer s
employment with the Bank shall terminate, automatically and without any further action on the part of any party to this Agreement,

Section 4. Termination Due to Disability after Change of
Control or Pending Change of Control. 

The Bank
may terminate the Officer s employment during the Term and after the occurrence of a Change of Control or a Pending Change
of Control upon a determination, by a majority vote of the members of the Board of Directors of the Bank, acting in reliance on
the written advice of a medical professional acceptable to it, that the Officer is suffering from a physical or mental impairment
which, at the date of the determination, has prevented the Officer from performing his assigned duties on a substantially full-time
basis for a period of at least ninety (90) days during the period of one (1) year ending with the date of the determination or
is likely to result in death or prevent the Officer from performing his assigned duties on a substantially full-time basis for
a period of at least ninety (90) days during the period of one (1) year beginning with the date of the determination. In such event: 

(a) The
Bank shall pay and deliver to the Officer (or in the event of his death before payment, to his estate and surviving dependents
and beneficiaries, as applicable) the Standard Termination Entitlements. 

(b) In
addition to the Standard Termination Entitlements, the Bank shall continue to pay the Officer his base salary, at the annual rate
in effect for him immediately prior to the termination of his employment, during a period ending on the earliest of: (i) the expiration
of ninety (90) days after the date of termination of his employment; (ii) the date on which long-term disability insurance benefits
are first payable to him under any long-term disability insurance plan covering employees of the Bank (the LTD Eligibility
Date ); (iii) the date of his death; and (iv) the expiration of the Assurance Period (the Initial Continuation Period ).
If the end of the Initial Continuation Period is neither the LTD Eligibility Date nor the date of his death, the Bank shall continue

prior to the termination of his employment, during an additional period ending on the earliest of the LTD Eligibility Date, the
date of his death and the expiration of the Assurance Period. 

4 

A termination of employment
due to disability under this section 4 shall be effected by a notice of termination given to the Officer by the Bank and shall
take effect on the later of the effective date of termination specified in such notice or the date on which the notice of termination
is deemed given to the Officer. 

Section 5. Discharge with Cause after Change of Control
or Pending Change of Control. 

(a) The
Bank may terminate the Officer s employment with Cause during the Term and after the occurrence of a Change
of Control or Pending Change of Control, but a termination shall be deemed to have occurred with Cause only if: the
Board of Directors of the Bank and the Board of Directors of the Company, by separate majority votes of their entire membership,
determine that the Officer should be discharged because of personal dishonesty, incompetence, willful misconduct, breach of fiduciary
duty involving personal profit, intentional failure to perform stated duties, willful violation of any law, rule or regulation
(other than traffic violations or similar offenses) or final cease and desist order, or any material breach of this Agreement. 

(b) If
the Officer is discharged with Cause during the Term and after a Change of Control or Pending Change of Control, the Bank shall
pay and provide to him (or, in the event of his death, to his estate, his surviving beneficiaries and his dependents) the Standard
Termination Entitlements only. 

Section 6. Discharge without Cause. 

The Bank
may discharge the Officer without Cause at any time after the occurrence of a Change of Control or Pending Change of Control, and
in such event: 

(a) The
Bank shall pay and deliver to the Officer (or in the event of his death before payment, to his estate and surviving dependents
and beneficiaries, as applicable) the Standard Termination Entitlements. 

(b) In
addition to the Standard Termination Entitlements: 

(i) During
the Assurance Period, the Bank shall provide for the Officer and his dependents continued group life, health (including hospitalization,
medical and major medical), dental, accident and long-term disability insurance benefits on substantially the same terms and conditions
(including any required premium-sharing arrangements, co-payments and deductibles) in effect for them immediately prior to the
Officer s resignation. The coverage provided under this section 6(b)(i) may, at the election of the Bank, be secondary to
the coverage provided as part of the Standard Termination Entitlements and to any employer-paid coverage provided by a subsequent
employer or through Medicare, with the result that benefits under the other coverages will offset the coverage required by this
section 6(b)(i). 

5 

(ii) The
Bank shall make a lump sum payment to the Officer (or, in the event of his death before payment, to his estate), in an amount equal
to the estimated present value of the salary that Officer would have earned if he had continued working for the Bank during the
Assurance Period at the highest annual rate of salary achieved during that portion of the employment period which is prior to Officer s
termination of employment with the Bank, where such present value is to be determined using a discount rate equal to the applicable
short-term federal rate prescribed under section 1274(d) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 Code ), compounded
using the compounding period corresponding to the Bank s regular payroll periods for its officers. Such lump sum shall be
paid in lieu of all other payments of salary provided for under this Agreement in respect of the period following any such termination. 

(iii) The
Bank shall make a lump sum payment to the Officer (or, in the event of his death before payment, to his estate), in an amount equal
to the payments that would have been made to Officer under any cash bonus or long-term or short-term cash incentive compensation
plan maintained by, or covering employees of, the Bank if he had continued working for the Bank during the Assurance Period and
had earned the maximum bonus or incentive award in each calendar year that ends during the Assurance Period, such payment to be
equal to the product of: 

(A) the
maximum percentage rate at which an award was ever available to Officer under such incentive compensation plan; multiplied by 

(B) the
salary that would have been paid to Officer during each such calendar year at the highest annual rate of salary achieved during
that portion of the employment period which is prior to Officer s termination of employment with the Bank. 

Such payment shall be made (without discounting for
early payment) within thirty (30) days following the Officer s termination of employment. 

The payments and benefits described in
section 6(b) are referred to in this Agreement as the Additional Change of Control Entitlements . 

Section 7. Resignation. 

(a) The
Officer may resign from his employment with the Bank at any time. A resignation under this section 7 shall be effected by notice
of resignation given by the Officer to the Bank and shall take effect on the later of the effective date of termination specified
in such notice or the date on which the notice of termination is deemed given to the Officer. The Officer s resignation of
any of the positions within the Bank or the Company to which he has been assigned shall be deemed a resignation from all such positions. 

6 

(b) The
Officer s resignation shall be deemed to be for Good Reason if the effective date of resignation occurs during
the Term, but on or after the effective date of a Change of Control, and is on account of: 

(i) the
failure of the Bank (whether by act or omission of the Board of Directors, or otherwise) to appoint or re-appoint or elect or reelect
the Officer to the position with Bank that he held immediately prior to the Change of Control (the Assigned Office or to a more senior office; 

(ii) a
material failure by the Bank, whether by amendment of the certificate of incorporation or organization, by-laws, action of the
Board of Directors of the Bank or otherwise, to vest in the Officer the functions, duties, or responsibilities customarily associated
with the Assigned Office; provided that the Officer shall have given notice of such failure to the Bank, and the Bank has not fully
cured such failure within thirty (30) days after such notice is deemed given; 

(iii) any
reduction of the Officer s rate of base salary in effect from time to time, whether or not material, or any failure (other
than due to reasonable administrative error that is cured promptly upon notice) to pay any portion of the Officer s compensation
as and when due; 

(iv) any
change in the terms and conditions of any compensation or benefit program in which the Officer participates which, either individually
or together with other changes, has a material adverse effect on the aggregate value of his total compensation package; provided
that the Officer shall have given notice of such material adverse effect to the Bank, and the Bank has not fully cured such material
adverse effect within thirty (30) days after such notice is deemed given; 

(v) any
material breach by the Bank of any material term, condition or covenant contained in this Agreement; provided that the Officer
shall have given notice of such material adverse effect to the Bank, and the Bank has not fully cured such material adverse effect
within thirty (30) days after such notice is deemed given; or 

(vi) a
change in the Officer s principal place of employment to a place that is not the principal executive office of the Bank,
or a relocation of the Bank s principal executive office to a location that is both more than twenty-five (25) miles away
from the Officer s principal residence and more than twenty-five (25) miles away from the location of the Bank s principal
executive office on the day before the occurrence of the Change of Control. 

7 

In all other cases, a resignation by the
Officer shall be deemed to be without Good Reason. In the event of resignation, the Officer shall state in his notice of resignation
whether he considers his resignation to be a resignation with Good Reason, and if he does, he shall state in such notice the grounds
which constitute Good Reason. 

(c) In
the event of the Officer s resignation for any reason, the Bank shall pay and deliver the Standard Termination Entitlements.
In the event of the Officer s resignation with Good Reason, the Bank shall also pay and deliver the Additional Termination
Entitlements. 

Section 8. Terms and Conditions of the Additional Termination
Entitlements. 

The Bank and the Officer
hereby stipulate that the damages which may be incurred by the Officer following any termination of employment are not capable
of accurate measurement as of the date first above written and that the Additional Termination Entitlements constitute reasonable
damages under the circumstances and shall be payable without any requirement of proof of actual damage and without regard to the
Officer s efforts, if any, to mitigate damages. The Bank and the Officer further agree that the Bank may condition the payment
and delivery of the Additional Termination Entitlements on the receipt of: (a) the Officer s resignation from any and all
positions which he holds as an officer, director or committee member with respect to the Bank or the Company or any subsidiary
or affiliate of either of them; and (b) a release of the Bank and its officers, directors, shareholders, subsidiaries and affiliates,
in form and substance satisfactory to the Bank, of any liability to the Officer, whether for compensation or damages, in connection
with his employment with the Bank and the termination of such employment except for the Standard Termination Entitlements and the
Additional Termination Entitlements. 

Section 9. No Effect on Employee Benefit Plans or Programs. 

The termination of the
Officer s employment during the Assurance Period or thereafter, whether by the Bank or by the Officer, shall have no effect
on the rights and obligations of the parties hereto under the Bank s qualified or non-qualified retirement, pension, savings,
thrift, profit-sharing or stock bonus plans, group life, health (including hospitalization, medical and major medical), dental,
accident and long term disability insurance plans or such other employee benefit plans or programs, or compensation plans or programs,
as may be maintained by, or cover employees of, the Bank from time to time; provided, however, that nothing in this Agreement shall
be deemed to duplicate any compensation or benefits provided under any agreement, plan or program covering the Officer to which
the Bank or Company is a party and any duplicative amount payable under any such agreement, plan or program shall be applied as
an offset to reduce the amounts otherwise payable hereunder. 

Section 10. Successors and Assigns. 

This Agreement will inure
to the benefit of and be binding upon the Officer, his legal representatives and testate or intestate distributees, and the Company
and the Bank and their respective successors and assigns, including any successor by merger or consolidation or a statutory receiver
or any other person or firm or corporation to which all or substantially all of the assets and business of the Company or the Bank
may be sold or otherwise transferred. Failure of the Bank to obtain from any successor its express written assumption of the Company s
or Bank s obligations hereunder at least 60 days in advance of the scheduled effective date of any such succession shall,
if such succession constitutes a Change of Control, constitute Good Reason for the Officer s resignation on or at any time
during the Term following the occurrence of such succession.

out of any action, suit or proceeding in which he may be involved, as a result of his efforts, in good faith, to defend or enforce
the terms of this Agreement; provided, however, that the Officer shall have substantially prevailed on the merits pursuant to a
judgment, decree or order of a court of competent jurisdiction or of an arbitrator in an arbitration proceeding. The determination

made by the court or arbitrator, as applicable. In the event of a settlement pursuant to a settlement agreement, any indemnification
payment under this section 12 shall be made only after a determination by the members of the Board (other than the Officer and

any provision of this Agreement must be made in writing, designated as a waiver, and signed by the party against whom its enforcement
is sought. Any waiver or relinquishment of any right or power hereunder at any one or more times shall not be deemed a waiver or
relinquishment of such right or power at any other time or times. 

Section 15. Counterparts. 

This Agreement
may be executed in two or more counterparts, each of which shall be deemed an original, and all of which shall constitute one and
the same Agreement.

provisions are included for the purposes of complying with various laws, rules and regulations applicable to the Bank: 

(a) 
Notwithstanding anything herein contained to the contrary, in no event shall the aggregate amount of compensation payable to the
Officer hereunder exceed three times the Officer s average annual compensation (within the meaning of the regulatory guidelines
of the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency OCC or any successor thereto) for the last five consecutive calendar
years to end prior to her termination of employment with the Bank (or for her entire period of employment with the Bank if less
than five calendar years). The compensation payable to the Officer hereunder shall be further reduced (but not below zero) if such
reduction would avoid the assessment of excise taxes on excess parachute payments (within the meaning of section 280G of the Code). 

(b) Notwithstanding
anything herein contained to the contrary, any payments to the Officer by the Bank, whether pursuant to this Agreement or otherwise,
arc subject to and conditioned upon their compliance with section 18(k) of the Federal Deposit Insurance Act FDI Act ),
12 U.S.C. 1828(k), and any regulation promulgated thereunder. 

(c) Notwithstanding
anything herein contained to the contrary, if the Officer is suspended from office and/or temporarily prohibited from participating
in the conduct of the affairs of the Bank pursuant to a notice served under section 8(e)(3) or 8(g)(1) of the FDI Act, 12 U.S.C.
 1818(e)(4) or 1818(g)(1), the Bank s obligations under this Agreement shall be suspended as of the date of service
of such notice, unless stayed by appropriate proceedings. If the charges in such notice are dismissed, the Bank, in its discretion,
may (i) pay to the Officer all or part of the compensation withheld while the Bank s obligations hereunder were suspended
and (ii) reinstate, in whole or in part, any of the obligations which were suspended. 

(d) Notwithstanding
anything herein contained to the contrary, if the Officer is removed and/or permanently prohibited from participating in the conduct
of the Bank s affairs by an order issued under section 8(e)(4) or 8(g)(1) of the FDI Act, 12 U.S.C. 1818(e)(4) or (g)(1),
all prospective obligations of the Bank under this Agreement shall terminate as of the effective date of the order, but vested
rights and obligations of the Bank and the Officer shall not be affected. 

(e) Notwithstanding
anything herein contained to the contrary, if the Bank is in default (within the meaning of section 3(x)(1) of the FDI Act, 12
U.S.C. 1813(x)(1), all obligations under this Agreement shall terminate as of the date of default, but vested rights and
obligations of the Bank and the Officer shall not be affected. 

(f) Notwithstanding
anything herein contained to the contrary, all prospective obligations of the Bank hereunder shall be terminated, except to the
extent that a continuation of this Agreement is necessary for the continued operation of the Bank: (i) by the Director of the OCC
or his designee or the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation FDIC at the time the FDIC enters into an agreement
to provide assistance to or on behalf of the Bank under the authority contained in section 13(c) of the FDI Act, 12 U.S.C. 1823(c);
(ii) by the Director of the OCC or his designee at the time such Director or designee approves a supervisory merger to resolve
problems related to the operation of the Bank or when the Bank is determined by such Director to be in an unsafe or unsound condition.
The vested rights and obligations of the parties shall not be affected. 

11 

(g) Notwithstanding
anything herein contained to the contrary, the Board may terminate the Officer s employment at any time, but any termination
by the Board other than a termination for cause (as such term is defined in section 5 hereof), shall not prejudice
the Officer s right to compensation or other benefits under the Agreement. The Officer shall have no right to receive compensation
or other benefits for any period after a termination for cause (as such term is defined in section 5 hereof). 

If and to the extent
that any of the foregoing provisions shall cease to be required or by applicable law, rule or regulation, the same shall become
inoperative as though eliminated by formal amendment of this Agreement. 

Section 20. Guaranty. 

The Company
hereby irrevocably and unconditionally guarantees to the Officer the payment of all amount, and the performance of all other obligations,
due from the Bank in accordance with the terms of this Agreement as and when due without any requirement of presentment, demand
of payment, protest of notice of dishonor or nonpayment. 

Section 21. Compliance with Code Section 409A. 

(a) It
is the intention of the Bank and the Officer that the payments, benefits and rights to which the Officer could be entitled pursuant
to this Agreement comply with Code Section 409A, the Treasury regulations and other guidance promulgated or issued thereunder (collectively,
 Section 409A to the extent that the requirements of Section 409A are applicable thereto, and after application of
all available exemptions, including but not limited to the short-term deferral rule and involuntary separation
pay plan exception and the provisions of this Agreement shall be construed in a manner consistent with that intention. If
any provision of this Agreement (or of any award of compensation, including equity compensation or benefits) would cause the Officer
to incur any additional tax or interest under Section 409A, the Bank shall, upon the specific request of the Officer, use its reasonable
business efforts to in good faith reform such provision to comply with Section 409A; provided that, to the maximum extent practicable,
the original intent and economic benefit to the Officer and the Bank of the applicable provision shall be maintained, but the Bank
shall have no obligation to make any changes that could create any additional economic cost or loss of benefit to the Bank. Any
provision required for compliance with Section 409A that is omitted from this Agreement shall be incorporated herein by reference
and shall apply retroactively, if necessary, and be deemed a part of this Agreement to the same extent as though expressly set
forth herein. 

(b) For
purposes of applying the provisions of Section 409A to this Agreement, each separately identified amount to which the Officer is
entitled under this Agreement shall be treated as a separate payment within the meaning of Section 409A. In addition, to the extent
permissible under Section 409A, any series of installment payments under this Agreement shall be treated as a right to a series
of separate payments. 

12 

(c) Neither
the Bank nor the Officer, individually or in combination, may accelerate any payment or benefit that is subject to Section 409A,
except in compliance with Section 409A and the provisions of this Agreement, and no amount that is subject to Section 409A shall
be paid prior to the earliest date on which it may be paid without violating Section 409A. If the consideration period (or revocation
period, if applicable) for any general release and waiver extends across two (2) calendar years, the payments to the Officer shall
be made or begin, as applicable, in the second of the calendar years. 

(d) If
and to the extent required to comply with Section 409A, a termination of employment shall not be deemed to have occurred for purposes
of this Agreement providing for the payment of any amounts or benefits upon or following a termination of employment unless such
termination is also a Separation from Service within the meaning of Section 409A and, for purposes of any provision
of this Agreement, references to termination, termination of employment , or like terms shall mean
 Separation from Service. 

(e) If
the Officer is deemed on the date of termination of his employment to be a specified employee, within the meaning
of that term under Code Section 409A(a)(2)(B) and using the identification methodology selected by the Bank from time to time,
or if none, the default methodology under Section 409A, then with regard to any payment or the providing of any benefit subject
to this Agreement and to the extent required to be delayed in compliance with Code Section 409A(a)(2)(B), and any other payment
or the provision of any other benefit that is required to be delayed in compliance with Code Section 409A(a)(2)(B), such payment
or benefit shall not be made or provided prior to the earlier of (i) the expiration of the six-month period measured from the date
of the Officer s Separation from Service or (ii) the date of the Officer s death. Any payments delayed pursuant to
this paragraph (whether they would have otherwise been payable in a single sum or in installments in the absence of such delay)
shall be paid or reimbursed to the Officer in a lump sum, and any remaining payments and benefits due under this Agreement shall
be paid or provided in accordance with the normal payment dates specified for them herein. The determination of whether the Officer
is a specified employee shall be made by the Bank in good faith applying Section 409A.
