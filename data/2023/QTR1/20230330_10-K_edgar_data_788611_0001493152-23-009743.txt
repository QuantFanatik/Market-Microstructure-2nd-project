1. BUSINESS. 

The
Company: 

Sigma Additive Solutions, Inc. (the Company, Sigma, 
 Sigma Additive, we, us and our is a software company that was founded by scientist-engineers composed of physicists and metallurgists then working at Los Alamos National
Labs for the purpose of developing sophisticated metallurgical products. Since 2016, the Company s focus has been
on solving the complex and challenging problem of how to best assure the high quality of metal parts manufactured in laser powder bed
additive manufacturing, or 3D, printing, machines. Sigma and many others believe that until this problem was solved, 3D manufacturing
of metal parts would not be scalable enough to grow past prototyping and mature into a major industry enjoying high quality yields and
cost-efficient production runs. The solution that Sigma developed to solve this problem is In-Process-Quality-Assurance IPQA software known as PrintRite3D . 

In
2018, the Sigma team enhanced and added user features to its PrintRite3D technology. In 2019, the Company began to productize and
test PrintRite3D on various 3D metal printers at customers sites through the Company s Rapid Test and Evaluation RTE program. Upon receiving favorable responses from the various RTEs, in 2020 the Company began to market PrintRite3D . Although the
worldwide COVID-19 pandemic adversely affected capital spending within the Company s targeted industries, the Company moved forward
with its plan to market PrintRite3D to the following industry segments: (1) global manufacturing companies with Additive Manufacturing AM initiatives; (2) 3D printer Original Equipment Manufacturers OEMs for purchases of licenses and generating
fees and royalties thereafter; (3) additive manufacturing software venders for alliances and licenses for co-sales; and (4) research
foundations, standards organizations and universities, all in service of Sigma s potential for setting the industry standard of
measurement by providing data and analytics as a metrics-based quality standard of metal quality for all 3D laser powder bed manufactured
parts, notwithstanding the design, metal, or brand of equipment upon which parts are manufactured. In 2022, we shifted our business model
from selling perpetual licenses of our combined hardware and software solution to subscription-based licenses and began the development
of a suite of software-only product offerings, which we believe will transform our business by providing a scalable, cost-effective solution
to our customers that can be more broadly connected to OEM s, hardware, and software partners. With the change to our
business model, and the desire to connect more fully to the full digital quality landscape, the business began to explore potential strategic
investments and mergers and acquisitions. This is a major focus in 2023, as management seeks capital for operations, and to provide runway
to future options, and to take Sigma to the next phase of our business.

Additive
Metal Manufacturing and the role and need for Sigma s technology: 

The
use of 3D printing technology dates to the 1980s for polymer applications, but the ability to print functional parts from metal
alloys has spurred significant interest and investment in AM in recent years. AM is now reshaping the product design process, entire
supply chains, and the vast landscape of manufacturing. Engineers are embracing new design freedoms to realize valuable product performance
improvements and cost efficiencies with lighter weight, better thermal management capability, better fluid mixing, customization, and
the ability to make different structures and textures that yield better part integration. 

We
believe that there are several significant hurdles to be overcome for broader adoption of additive technologies for the production of
industrial metal and polymer parts. Among these are lack of quality, consistency, and industry standards along with cost. The Company
believes PrintRite3D has the potential to contribute to widespread industrialization of 3D metal and polymer printing. Additionally,
the disruption in complex and rigid supply chains caused by COVID-19 exposed the country s vulnerability to shortages in times
of crisis. In response, manufacturers are devising strategies to be able to be more agile, increase their ability to manufacture mission
critical parts on demand, with more customization, and closer to where the end part will be needed, and we believe quality systems
to ensure consistency will play a critical role. Additionally, we believe that in-process data will play an important role in connecting
the full digital quality landscape from raw materials to final part. 

PrintRite3D 
Technology and Product Family 

The
current version of PrintRite3D is an integrated hardware and software edge computing platform, or in-process quality assurance
system, that combines inspection, feedback, data collection and critical analysis. It is a 3D printer platform-independent solution
that can be installed as a retrofit to an existing 3D printer or requested as a factory option from select 3D printer OEMs.
PrintRite3D provides a high-fidelity, accurate system that can confidently scale to multi-laser 3D metal and polymer printers.
The PrintRite3D system detects potential anomalies in real-time and incorporates machine learning in conjunction with developed
metrics to map those metrics to live post-process data. This provides the ability to reduce manufacturing costs by identifying
problems before post-production testing, while creating a certification framework that serves the needs of end-users,
printer manufacturers, and standards organizations. 

PrintRite3D
was initially developed to work with industrial 3D metal printers using the Powder Bed Fusion PBF process, which is the most widely
used process for industrial metal applications. In 2020, we announced PrintRite3D for Direct Energy Deposition, or DED, for metal parts.
PrintRite3D DED opened another segment of the industrial metal market for Sigma to sell and distribute our technology. In 2021, the
Company introduced PrintRite3D Selective Laser Sintering, or SLS, for polymer materials. The polymer market is larger and more advanced
than the metal market. There is an increasing need for quality and standards within the polymer market to support mission critical parts
such as those being used in aerospace, space exploration, and defense. The Company s entry into this market was customer driven
by a supplier of critical equipment to the space exploration market. The Company believes that PrintRite3D s ability to work across
a different 3D printers, processes and materials gives it a competitive advantage and will help accelerate the adoption of 3D printing
for industrial applications. 

In
2022, we began the development of a new suite of software-only products, which we believe will allow us to scale into production
across enterprises with large installations of production printers. These machine-health, process health, and part-health modules
will be built into the PrintRite3D suite. These products will combine streaming health data from major OEM s and off-axis
camera data, and thermal on-access melt pool technology to provide a centralized home for in-process quality solutions and reporting that can be connected to the broader digital quality ecosystem. We believe
the connected and open data we are creating will allow users to simplify their quality operations, identify gross defects, utilize
machine-learning and artificial intelligence platforms, and significantly improve production quality while lowering the cost of
development. 

Distribution
Methods 

Sigma
employs a multi-channel distribution model for its IPQA products, including a direct sales force, value added resellers VARs software and hardware partners, and 3D printer OEMs. In 2022, the majority of the Company s revenue was generated by direct sales
in North America and Europe and through OEM relationships. VARs are currently used in Japan and India. The Company plans to extend its
VAR channel outside of North America and Europe. Since 2020, the Company has moved to establish and extend relationships with 3D printer
OEMs, software partners, and integrated hardware partners to expand our footprint and ability to scale our business. 

The
Company markets its products through webinars, email and social media campaigns, and participation, both in person and virtually, in
industry events and tradeshows. In addition, the Company collaborates with international standards organizations in the establishment
of standards for AM. 

4 

Sources
and Availability of Parts and Materials 

We
have important relationships with several suppliers for critical components of our PrintRite3D systems, in particular optics
and data acquisition components, and development of our user interface. To-date, we have not experienced shortages of components;
however, in some cases COVID-19 has resulted in increased lead times and cost for certain parts. We manage the risk of component
shortages by sourcing backup suppliers, and in the case of our user interface, hiring engineers in-house and contractors to support
the ongoing development and maintenance. 

Dependence
on a Few Major Customers and Partners 

The
Company has established agreements with several international 3D printer OEMs, software, and integrated hardware companies. The Company
supports the OEM, software, and hardware relationships with joint marketing programs, field sales and technical support personnel to
assist in the sale of its technology. It is the Company s intent and focus to expand our OEM and software channels
through distribution relationships with existing and additional 3D printer OEMs, hardware, and software relationships in the future. 

Competition 

PrintRite3D is a
third-party, agnostic In-Process Quality Assurance system designed to provide a consistent, standards-based measurement and
prediction of quality across a heterogeneous collection of 3D printers. Competition historically has been viewed as printer OEMs
with their own monitoring system, usually as a separately priced option to its printers. However, with the move to software-only
solutions and API connection options to machines, Sigma believes it can provide machine agnostic analytics and reporting software
tools that help standardize digital quality in the industry. Additionally, we plan to work with OEMs to reduce costs of hardware,
grow and expand their quality monitoring as a standard machine option, and provide a standard language for quality. We believe that
the future of AM will consist of factories with various generations of printers from various manufacturers. The primary reasons that
global manufacturers will have machines from various vendors is that certain machines and technologies are better suited for
different applications than others. Additionally, as the industry progresses, innovation will accelerate, and new leaders will
emerge. Finally, many believe that there will be a consolidation of 3D metal manufacturers and the number of vendors will decrease
over the next decade from approximately 50 at present. Although standards for monitoring are slowly being set by various
international standards organizations, it is highly unlikely that printer OEMs will modify their monitoring systems to work with
other OEMs machines. Therefore, we believe that the best way to produce parts with a consistent level of quality is with a
third-party, agnostic, standards based IPQA system, such as PrintRite3D . Over the past year or so, new competitors have entered
the market with monitoring technology that follows Sigma s lead as a third-party agnostic system capable of working across 3D
printer machine types. However, most of these solutions are point solutions addressing one specific item of quality. These have
value, but do not provide the end user the full quality picture for regulators or customer needs. Sigma has expanded its quality
footprint to be a home for holistic in-process quality data. We see a path to integrate with other point solutions if customers find
interest in them, while still ensuring holistic quality for our end customers. Point solutions are useful; however, they fall short
of determining root cause, and unlike PrintRite3D, are not capable of instructing the printer, through closed-loop control, to vary
certain machine variables such as laser power to avoid creating the defects in the first place. 

Intellectual
Property 

We
regard our patents, trademarks, domain names, trade secrets, know-how, and other intellectual property as critical to our success.
We rely on a combination of patent, trademark, trade secret, other intellectual property law, confidentiality procedures, and
contractual provisions with employees, partners, and others to protect the technology and other proprietary rights, information and
know-how that comprise the core of our business. The tables below summarize our issued patents. We are currently prosecuting
foreign and U.S. patent applications related to our IPQA technology and rapid qualification of additive manufacturing for metal
parts. There is no guarantee, however, that the patent applications will result in issued patents or that if issued,
any patents will offer adequate protection under applicable law.

Government
Regulations 

Any
contracts that we enter into with governmental agencies will be subject to a variety of federal, state and local laws and regulations.
These regulations are aimed at preventing the inadvertent disclosure of munitions related data or the export of technical knowledge to
foreign countries. The work we do with governmental units may also be subject to laws respecting the confidentiality of any classified
or national security information we receive during the course of our activities under any government contract. 

Additionally,
our sales to U. S. government agencies are driven by pricing based on costs incurred to produce products or perform services. U.S.
government contracts generally are subject to Federal Acquisition Regulations FAR ), agency-specific regulations that
implement or supplement FAR, such as the se Defense Federal Acquisition Regulations and other applicable laws and regulations. These
regulations impose a broad range of requirements, many of which are unique to government contracting, including various procurement,
import and export, security, contract pricing and cost, contract termination and adjustment, and audit requirements. Our failure to
comply with these regulations and requirements could result in reductions of the value of contracts, contract modifications or
termination, and the assessment of penalties and fines and could lead to temporary or permanent suspension or debarment from
government contracting or subcontracting. In addition, government contractors are subject to routine
audits and investigations by U.S. government agencies such as the Defense Contract Audit Agency DCAA ). These agencies
review a contractor s performance, cost structure, and compliance with applicable laws, regulations, and standards. The DCAA
also reviews the adequacy of, and a contractor s compliance with, its internal control systems and policies, including the
contractor s purchasing, property, estimating, compensation, and information systems. 

As
of March 29, 2023, we have several active contracts with government agencies, and, funding permitting, we plan to seek to increase
government contracting in the future. 

Human
Capital 

As
of December 31, 2022, we had 25 full-time employees. We continue to balance a search for additional, qualified personnel to support our targeted growth in the area
of IPQA for AM, while ensuring that our operations are aligned towards our software focus
and corresponding cost structure. We believe that our future success will depend, in part, upon our ability to attract and retain
highly skilled employees and management and technical personnel. Employee engagement is important to us, and we strive to continuously
enhance our corporate culture and further the growth and development of our employees. 

All employees are responsible for upholding the Sigma Code of Ethics and
Business Conduct, which is important in delivering on our strategy. We maintain a compliance hotline for the confidential reporting of
any suspected policy violations or unethical business conduct on the part of our businesses, employees, officers, directors, suppliers,
or customers. 

Compensation
and Benefits 

We
strive to provide competitive compensation and benefits to our employees. Our benefit programs include bonuses, stock-based
compensation awards, a 401(k) plan with employer matching, healthcare and insurance benefits, flexible paid time off and other employee
assistance programs. 

COVID-19
Pandemic 

The
health and wellness of our employees is important to our success. We continue to follow guidance from health officials, and while
COVID-19 restrictions have been relaxed in the U.S. and Europe, we have maintained a number of health-related measures including, but not limited to, a flexible work-from-home
policy. 

There
continue to be isolated COVID-19 outbreaks in certain regions of the world, but these outbreaks have not had a significant impact on
our operations. The extent to which the COVID-19 epidemic may impact our business, operations, financial condition, liquidity
and results of operations in 2023 and beyond remains uncertain and unpredictable. 

Russia
- Ukraine Conflict 

In
February 2022, Russian forces invaded Ukraine. In response, the U.S., the European Union EU ), and several other
countries imposed economic and trade sanctions and other restrictions (collectively, global sanctions targeting
Russia and Belarus. Russia then imposed retaliatory economic measures against the U.S., the EU, and several other countries. We have
no sales to Russia or Ukraine, nor do we have any assets, employees or third-party contractors in Russia or Ukraine. The duration of
the conflict and further sanctions could have further impact on the global economy, financial markets and inflation. Due to the
uncertainty around the duration or outcome of the conflict, we cannot predict its effect on our business.

Recent
Developments 

On March 20, 2023, we announced the expansion of our collaboration with
Materialise, a global leader in 3D printing software and service solutions, to provide additive manufacturing (AM) users automated quality
control by integrating the PrintRite3D quality assurance solution into the new software solution Materialise Process Control. Combining
multiple complementary data sources and analytic methods allows businesses to make faster, data-driven decisions, improving operational
efficiency and driving revenue growth. Materialise Process Control allows manufacturers to analyze and correlate layer data from the 3D
printing process. Sigma and Materialise collaborated to integrate PrintRite3D into Process Control and to make it available in CO-AM,
Materialise s end-to-end software platform for 3D printing. Sigma s PrintRite3D suite provides in-process data, including
thermal data from the melt pool, yielding layer data that can enable users to find the root cause of defects faster. 

On
March 6, 2023, we announced that we will partner with DyeMansion, the global leader in connected and integrated post-processing solutions
for industrial polymer 3D-printing, to add an integrated hardware/software solution option that offers extra quality assurance for DyeMansion s
post-processing solutions: DM60, Powershot Performance and Powerfuse S. DyeMansion s comprehensive solution, the Print-to-Product
workflow and all components are applicable for Industry 4.0 and can be integrated seamlessly into various production processes. The real-time
monitoring and data analytics from Sigma s Machine Health module will complement DyeMansion s systems by offering reduced
cost per part, unmatched quality, and high sustainability. 

On
March 1, 2023, we announced that we had retained Lake Street Capital Markets as the Company s financial advisor in connection
with our consideration of a range of strategic alternatives designed to enhance shareholder value, including a possible strategic investment,
acquisition, merger, business combination, or similar transaction. 

ITEM
1A. RISK FACTORS. 

Our
business is subject to numerous risks. We caution you that the following important factors, among others, could cause our actual results
to differ materially from those expressed in statements made by us or on our behalf in filings with the SEC, press releases or communications
with investors and others. Any or all of our statements in this Report and in any other public statements we make may turn out
to be wrong. They can be affected by inaccurate assumptions or by known or unknown risks and uncertainties. The factors mentioned in
the discussion below will be important in determining future results. Consequently, actual future results may vary materially from those
anticipated in this Report or our other public statements. The occurrence of any of the events or developments described below
could harm our financial condition, results of operations, business and prospects. In such an event, the market price of our securities
could decline. Additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us or that we currently deem immaterial also may have similar
adverse effects on us. 

Risks
Related to Our Business 

We will require additional financing to continue
our operations, and there is substantial doubt regarding our ability to continue as a going concern. 

As of December 31, 2022, we had
cash of 2,845,931. Our existing cash on hand and anticipated revenues are sufficient to fund our remaining anticipated operating costs and capital expenditure
requirements only through May 2023. We will need to raise additional financings to fund our operations, maintain compliance with the NASDAQ
listing requirements and implement our business plan. There is no assurance as to the amount and availability of any required future financing
or the terms thereof. Such financing, if in the form of equity, may be highly dilutive to our existing stockholders and may otherwise
include onerous terms. If in the form of debt, such financing may include covenants and repayment obligations which may be difficult to
meet and that could adversely affect our business operations. We have no current understanding or arrangement to obtain any additional
financing. To the extent that funds are not available to us, we may be required to delay, limit, or terminate our business operations
and may lose our NASDAQ listing. 

In light of the foregoing,
there is substantial doubt our ability to continue as a going concern, and the report of our registered independent public accounting firm on our financial statements as of and for the year ended December 31, 2022 contains a going concern
qualification. 

We
are not profitable and may never become profitable. 

We
have incurred losses in every reporting period since we commenced business operations in 2010 and expect to continue to incur significant
losses for the foreseeable future. Our net loss applicable to common stockholders for the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021 was
 8,749,304 and 7,488,172, respectively. As of December 31, 2022, our accumulated deficit was 49,342,484. There is no assurance that
any revenues we generate will be sufficient for us to become profitable or to maintain profitability. Our revenues for the years ended
December 31, 2022 and December 31, 2021 were 630,428 and 1,651,765, respectively, and our operating expenses for those periods were
 9,029,502 and 9,571,185, respectively. Our current revenues are not sufficient to fund our operations. We cannot predict when, if ever,
we might achieve profitability and we are not certain that we will be able to sustain profitability, if achieved. If we fail to achieve
or maintain profitability, the market price of our securities is likely to be adversely affected. 

Our
operating history makes evaluation of our business difficult. 

We are continuing to develop our
technologies and to implement our business plan. Our ability to implement a successful business plan remains unproven, and there is no
assurance that we will ever generate sufficient revenues to sustain our business. Our operating history, together with the other risks
discussed in this Risk Factors section, may make it difficult for prospective investors and others to evaluate our business. 

We
face the risks normally associated with a new business. 

We
face all of the risks inherent in a business based upon emerging technologies, including the expenses, difficulties, complications and delays frequently
encountered in connection with conducting new operations and efforts to develop and commercialize technologies. These uncertainties
include developing our technologies and our brand name, raising capital to meet our working capital requirements, and expanding our
customer base, among others. If we are not effective in addressing these risks, we will not be able to achieve profitability in the
future, and we may not have adequate working capital to meet our obligations as they become due. 

8 

Our
business may be adversely affected by a global economic downturn. 

Any
economic downturn generally could cause a drop in government spending and business investment, which could have a material adverse effect
on our business. Further, as a result of the current global economic and geopolitical situation, there may be a disruption or delay in
performance by our third-party contractors and suppliers. If such third parties are unable to adequately satisfy their contractual commitments
to us in a timely manner, our business could be adversely affected. 

We
could incur significant damages if we are unable to adequately discharge our contractual obligations. 

Our
failure to comply with contract requirements or to meet our clients performance expectations on a contract could materially and
adversely affect our financial performance and our reputation. This, in turn, would impact our ability to compete for new clients and
contracts. Our failure to meet contractual obligations could also result in substantial actual and consequential damages under the terms
of such contracts. In addition, some of our contracts require us to indemnify clients for our failure to meet performance standards and/or
contain liquidated damages provisions and financial penalties related to performance failures. Although we maintain liability insurance,
the policy limits may not be adequate to provide protection against all such potential liabilities. 

Some
of our clients may terminate our contracts prior to completion, which could result in revenue shortfalls and reduce profitability or
cause losses on contracts. 

Some
of our contracts with clients contain initial or base periods of one or more years, as well as option periods typically covering more
than one-half of the contract s initial duration. However, such clients are under no obligation to exercise the option to extend
the contract term. The profitability of some of our contracts could be adversely impacted if such options are not exercised and the contract
term is not extended accordingly. Additionally, our contracts contain provisions permitting a client to terminate the contract on short
notice, with or without cause. The unexpected termination of significant contracts could result in significant revenue shortfalls. If
revenue shortfalls occur and are not offset by corresponding reductions in expenses, our business could be adversely affected. We cannot
anticipate if, when or to what extent a client might terminate its contracts with us. 

We
may not be able to effectively control and manage our growth, which would negatively impact our operations. 

We
have operated our current line of business for approximately eleven years, and we expect to grow in the future as our business develops
and becomes further established. If our business grows as we anticipate, it will be necessary for us to manage our expansion in an orderly
fashion. Any significant growth in our activities or in the market for our services will require extension of our managerial, operational,
marketing and other resources. Future growth will also impose significant additional responsibilities upon the members of management
to identify, recruit, maintain, integrate, and motivate new employees. Our failure to manage growth effectively may lead to operational
inefficiencies that will have a negative effect on our profitability. Additionally, if our growth comes at the expense of providing quality
service and generating reasonable profits, our ability to successfully bid for contracts and our profitability will be adversely affected.
We cannot assure investors that we will be able to effectively manage any future growth we may experience. 

Failure
to obtain adequate insurance coverage could put us at risk for uninsured losses. 

Some
or all of our customers may require insurance as a requirement to conduct business with us. A lthough
we currently have product liability insurance, we may be unable to obtain or maintain adequate liability insurance on acceptable terms,
if at all, and there is a risk that our insurance will not provide adequate coverage against our potential losses. Additionally, there
are certain types of losses that may not be insurable at a cost that we can afford, and insurance may not be available at any cost with
respect to certain losses. Claims or losses in excess of any insurance coverage we may obtain, or the lack of insurance coverage, could
put us at risk of uninsured loss, which would have a material adverse effect on our business and financial condition. 

We
are dependent on key personnel, and the loss of any of these individuals could harm our business. 

We
depend on key scientific and other personnel. The loss of any of these individuals could harm our business and significantly delay or
prevent the achievement of our business objectives. In addition, our delivery of services will be labor-intensive: when we are awarded
a contract, we may need to quickly hire project leaders and project management personnel. The additional staff may also create a concurrent
demand for increased administrative personnel. The success of our business will require that we attract, develop, motivate and retain: 

experienced
 and innovative executive officers; 

senior
 managers who have successfully managed or designed programs in the public sector; and 

information
 technology professionals who have designed or implemented complex information technology projects. 

9 

Innovative,
experienced and technically proficient individuals are in great demand and are likely to remain a limited resource. We may be unable
to continue to attract and retain desirable executive officers, senior managers, and technology professionals. Our inability to hire
sufficient personnel on a timely basis or the loss of significant numbers of executive officers and senior managers could adversely affect
our business. 

We
may be dependent on cash flow and payments from customers in order to meet our expense obligations. 

A
number of factors may cause our revenues, cash flow and operating results to vary from quarter to quarter, including the following: 

the
 progression of contracts; 

the
 rate of customer adoption of our new subscription pricing program; 

the
 commencement, completion or termination of contracts during any particular quarter; 

the
 schedules of government agencies and large multinational corporations for awarding contracts; 

the
 failure of our customers to fulfill their obligations under contracts with us; and 

the
 term of awarded contracts and potential acquisitions. 

Changes
in the volume of activity and the number of contracts commenced, completed or terminated during any quarter may cause significant variations
in our cash flow from operations because a significant portion of our expenses are fixed. Fixed expenses include, rent, payroll, insurance,
employee benefits, taxes and other administrative costs and overhead. Moreover, we expect to incur significant operating expenses during
the start-up and early stages of large contracts and typically do not receive corresponding payments in that same quarter. 

We
may make acquisitions in the future that we are unable to effectively manage given our limited resources. 

We
may choose to grow our business by acquiring other entities. We may be unable to manage businesses that we acquire or to integrate
them successfully without incurring substantial expenses, delays or other problems that could negatively impact our results of operations.
Moreover, business combinations involve additional risks, including: 

diversion
 of management s attention; 

loss
 of key personnel; 

our
 becoming significantly leveraged as a result of the incurrence of debt to finance an acquisition; 

assumption
 of unanticipated legal or financial liabilities; 

unanticipated
 operating, accounting or management difficulties in connection with the acquired entities; 

amortization
 of acquired intangible assets, including goodwill; and 

dilution
 to existing stockholders and our earnings per share. 

Also,
client dissatisfaction or performance problems with an acquired firm could materially and adversely affect our reputation as a whole.
Further, the acquired businesses may not achieve the revenues and earnings that we anticipated. 

We
may be unable to develop or commercialize new and rapidly evolving technologies. 

Many
of our activities involve developing products or processes that are based upon new, rapidly evolving technologies. The ability to commercialize
or further develop these technologies could fail for a variety of reasons, both within and outside of our control. 

10 

We
may be unable to protect our intellectual property rights. 

Our
success in part depends on the ability to protect our intellectual property and proprietary technology. To do so, we will be required
to prosecute patent applications and maintain patents, obtain new patents and pursue trade secret and other intellectual property protection.
There can be no assurance that our program for protection of intellectual property and proprietary technology will be sufficient to protect
our intellectual property and proprietary technology from competitors. Our business is also subject to the risk that our issued patents
will not provide us with significant competitive advantages if, for example, a competitor was to independently develop or obtain similar
or superior technologies. In addition, our issued patents may be challenged or infringed upon by third parties. The enforcement of intellectual
property rights is subject to considerable uncertainty and can be expensive and time-consuming. Patent reform laws and court decisions
interpreting such laws, may create additional uncertainty around our ability to obtain and enforce patent protection. Any significant
impairment of our intellectual property rights could harm our business and our ability to compete. The unauthorized use of our intellectual
property could make it more expensive to do business and harm our operating results. Proprietary trade secrets and unpatented know-how
are also very important to our business; however, trade secrets are difficult to protect. Our employees, consultants, contractors, outside
scientific collaborators and other advisors may unintentionally or willfully disclose our confidential information to competitors, and
confidentiality agreements may not provide an adequate remedy in the event of unauthorized disclosure of confidential or proprietary
information. 

We
may be sued by third parties who claim that we have infringed their intellectual property rights. 

We
may be exposed to future litigation by third parties based on claims that our research, development and commercialization activities
infringe the intellectual property rights of third parties to which we do not hold licenses or other rights, or that we have misappropriated
the trade secrets of others. Any litigation or claims against us, whether or not valid, could result in substantial costs, and could
place a significant strain on our financial and human resources. In addition, if successful, such claims could cause us to pay substantial
damages. Furthermore, because of the substantial amount of discovery required in connection with intellectual property litigation, there
is a risk that some of our confidential information could be compromised by disclosure during this type of litigation. 

Our
bylaws contain provisions for indemnifying our officers and directors. 

Our
bylaws contain provisions with respect to the indemnification of our officers and directors against all costs, charges and expenses actually
and reasonably incurred by an officer or director paid to settle an action or satisfy a judgment in a civil, criminal or administrative
action or proceeding to which he or she is made a party by reason of being or having been one of our directors or officers. To the extent
that our directors and officers insurance policy does not provide reimbursement for such costs, charges, expenses and other
amounts, we may incur substantial expenses in satisfying our indemnification obligations. 

Our
operating costs could be significantly higher than we expect, and this could reduce our future profitability. 

In
addition to general economic conditions, market fluctuations and international risks, significant increases in operating, development
and implementation costs could adversely affect us due to numerous factors, many of which are beyond our control. 

11 

A
cyber incident could result in information theft, data corruption, operational disruption and/or financial loss. 

Businesses
have become increasingly dependent on digital technologies to conduct day-to-day operations. At the same time, cyber incidents, including
deliberate attacks or unintentional events, have increased. A cyber-attack could include gaining unauthorized access to digital systems
for purposes of misappropriating assets or sensitive information, corrupting data, or causing operational disruption or result in denial
of service on websites. We depend on digital technology, including information systems and related infrastructure, to process and record
financial and operating data, and communicate with our employees and business partners. Our technologies, systems, networks, and those
of our business partners may become the target of cyber-attacks or information security breaches that could result in the unauthorized
release, gathering, monitoring, misuse, loss or destruction of proprietary and other information, or other disruption of our business
operations. The consequences of such loss, possible misuse of our proprietary and confidential information, or operational disruptions
could include, among other things, unfavorable publicity, damage to our reputation, difficulty marketing our products, customer allegations
of breach-of-contract, claims and litigation by affected parties, investigations by and other proceedings involving governmental authorities
and possible financial liabilities for damages, any of which could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition, reputation
and relationships with customers and partners. We also rely on a number of third-party service providers to host, store or otherwise
process information for us, or to provide other facilities or infrastructure that we make use of, including cloud-based 
providers of corporate infrastructure services relating to, among other things, human resources, electronic communication services and
some financial functions, and we are therefore dependent on the security systems of these providers. Any security breaches or incidents
or other unauthorized access to, or disruptions of, our service-providers systems or viruses, loggers, ransomware or other malfeasant
code in their data or software, or unauthorized access to or acquisition of any data they process or otherwise maintain for us could
expose us to information loss, corruption and unavailability, operational disruptions, and misappropriation of confidential information,
and could have similar consequences to us as any incidents affecting our own systems or the data we process or maintain. We and our third
parties face these threats from a variety of sources, including attacks from hackers, phishing and other forms of social engineering,
and human error or employee or contractor malfeasance. Because the techniques used to obtain unauthorized access to or sabotage security
systems change frequently and are often not recognized until after an attack, we and our third-party service providers may be unable
to anticipate the techniques or implement adequate preventative measures, thereby exposing us to material adverse effects on our business,
financial condition, results of operations and growth prospects. A security breach or other security incident impacting us or our third-party
service providers could require a substantial level of financial resources to rectify and otherwise respond to, may be difficult to identify
or address in a timely manner, and could result in claims, investigations, and inquires by private parties or governmental entities that
may divert management s attention and require the expenditure of significant time and resources, and which may cause us to incur
substantial fines, penalties, or other liability and related legal and other costs. Any actual or perceived security breach or other
security incident may also harm our reputation and market position. Any of the foregoing matters could harm our operating results and
financial condition. Although to-date we have not experienced any losses relating to cyber-attacks, there is no assurance that we will
not suffer such losses in the future. As cyber threats continue to evolve, we may be required to expend significant additional resources
to continue to modify or enhance our protective measures or to investigate and remediate any information security vulnerabilities. 

Our
results of operations may be negatively impacted by the COVID-19 epidemic. 

The
potential reemergence of the coronavirus, which has caused a broad impact globally, including restrictions on travel and quarantine policies
put in place by businesses and governments, may have a material economic effect on our business. Additionally, the coronavirus may result
in disruption of financial markets, which may reduce our ability to access capital on favorable terms or at all. 

Risks
Related to Our Securities 

The
price of our securities is subject to volatility related or unrelated to our operations, which could result in substantial losses for
our stockholders. 

Between
January 1, 2022 and December 31, 2022, the trading price of our common stock has ranged from a low of 0.40 to a high of 2.42 and could
be subject to wide fluctuations in the future in response to various factors, some of which are beyond our control. These factors include
those discussed previously in this Risk Factors section and others, such as: 

delays
 or failures in the commercialization of our current or future products and services; 

quarterly
 variations in our results of operations or those of our competitors; 

12 

changes
 in our earnings estimates or recommendations by securities analysts or adverse publicity about us or our products or services; 

announcements
 by us or our competitors of new products and services, significant contracts, commercial relationships, acquisitions or capital commitments;

adverse
 developments with respect to our intellectual property rights; 

commencement
 of litigation involving us or our competitors; 

any
 major changes in our Board of Directors or management; 

market
 conditions in our industry; and 

general
 economic conditions in the United States and abroad. 

In
addition, the stock market, in general, may experience broad market fluctuations, which may adversely affect the market price or liquidity
of our securities. 

We
could be subject to securities class action litigation. 

Any
sudden decline in the market price of our securities could trigger securities class action lawsuits against us. If any of our stockholders
were to bring such a lawsuit against us, we could incur substantial costs defending the lawsuit and the time and attention of our management
would be diverted from our business and operations. We also could be subject to damages claims if we are found to be at fault in connection
with a decline in our market price of our securities. 

Historically,
there has been a limited trading market in our common stock, and you may therefore have difficulty selling your securities at a price
that you determine is satisfactory. 

Our
common stock is listed on The Nasdaq Capital Market. Historically, there has been a limited trading market for our common stock. There
is no assurance that our common stock will actively trade in the public market at or above a price that you consider acceptable. If an
active market for our common stock is not maintained, it may be difficult for you to sell your shares of common stock when you wish to
sell them or at a price that you consider satisfactory. An inactive trading market may also impair our ability to raise capital to continue
to fund operations by selling securities and may impair our ability to acquire other companies or technologies by using our securities
as consideration. 

There
is no assurance that we will satisfy the continued listing requirements of The NASDAQ Capital Market. 

On
October 14, 2022, Nasdaq notified us that the closing bid price for our common stock had been below 1.00 per share for 30 consecutive
business days, and that the Company therefore is not in compliance with the minimum bid price requirement for continued inclusion on
The Nasdaq Capital Market under Nasdaq Listing Rule 5550(a)(2). The notice indicates that the Company has 180 calendar days, or until
April 12, 2023, to regain compliance with this requirement. The Company can regain compliance with the 1.00 minimum bid price requirement
if the closing bid price of the Company s common stock is at least 1.00 for a minimum of ten consecutive business days during
the 180-day compliance period. If the Company does not regain compliance during the initial compliance period, the Company may be eligible
for additional time to regain compliance. To qualify, the Company will be required to meet the continued listing requirement for market
value of its publicly held shares and all other Nasdaq initial listing standards, except the bid price requirement, and will need to
provide written notice to Nasdaq of the Company s intention to cure the deficiency during the second compliance period by effecting
a reverse stock split, if necessary. If the Company meets these requirements, we expect that Nasdaq will grant the Company the additional
180 calendar days to regain compliance with the minimum bid price requirement. 

13 

If
we fail to satisfy a Nasdaq requirement for continued listing, Nasdaq could provide notice that our common stock will become subject
to delisting. In such event, Nasdaq rules would permit us to appeal the decision to reject our proposed compliance plan or any delisting
determination to a Nasdaq Hearings Panel. If our securities are de-listed from The Nasdaq Capital Market, our stockholders could incur
material adverse consequences such as reduced liquidity for their securities and reduced market prices for their securities. Following
such de-listing, we could encounter increased difficulty in issuing additional securities at an attractive price, or at all, in order
to fund our operations. 

You
may experience additional dilution as a result of future equity offerings. 

In
order to raise additional capital, we may sell additional shares of our common stock or other securities convertible into
or exchangeable for our common stock. The price per share at which we sell additional shares of our common stock, or securities convertible
or exchangeable into common stock, in future transactions may be lower than the price per share that you paid for our common stock. 

We
have broad discretion in the use of the net proceeds of our securities offerings and may not use them effectively. 

We
intend to use our cash for the development of our products and services, and to pursue a possible strategic investment or other transaction. Our management has broad discretion in the use of cash and will
have the right to use our cash in ways that differ substantially from our current plans. Management may spend our cash in ways that do
not improve our results of operations or enhance the value of our securities. The failure by management to apply funds effectively could
result in financial losses that could have a material and adverse effect on our business and cause the market price of our securities
to decline. 

Our
outstanding warrants may result in further dilution to our stockholders. 

Certain
of our outstanding warrants to purchase a total of up to approximately 898,806 shares of our common stock contain so-called
full-ratchet anti-dilution adjustments in the event we sell or issue shares of common stock or common stock equivalents at an
effective price less than the exercise price of such warrants, subject to certain exceptions. Of these warrants, warrants with an
aggregate exercise price of 956,015 also provide for a ratable increase in the number of shares purchasable upon exercise of the
warrants in the event the exercise price per share of the warrants is reduced. These anti-dilution adjustments resulted in a reduction in the exercise price of such warrants to 0.58 per share and an increase of 1,265,896 shares in the number of underlying warrant
shares due to the grant of stock options to our directors and officers in January 2023. The anti-dilution adjustments of our outstanding
warrants would be triggered by future issuances of shares of our common stock at a price per share below the then-exercise price of
such warrants, which adjustments would have a further dilutive effect on our stockholders. 

We
do not intend to pay dividends on our common stock, and your ability to achieve a return on your investment will depend on appreciation
in the market price of our securities. 

We
currently intend to invest our future earnings, if any, to fund our growth and not to pay any cash dividends on our common stock. Since
we do not intend to pay dividends, your ability to receive a return on your investment will depend on any future appreciation in the
market price of our securities. There is no assurance that our securities will appreciate in price. 

If
securities or industry analysts do not publish research or reports about us, or if they issue adverse or misleading opinions regarding
us or our securities, the market price of our securities and their trading volume could decline. 

If
we do not obtain and maintain research coverage by securities and industry analysts, the market price for our securities may be adversely
affected. The market price of our securities also may decline if any analyst who covers us issues an adverse or erroneous opinion regarding
us, our business model, our intellectual property or our performance. If one or more analysts cease coverage of us or fail to regularly
publish reports on us, we could lose visibility in the financial markets, which could cause the market price of our securities and their
trading volume to decline and possibly adversely affect our ability to engage in future financings. 

Sales
of a substantial number of shares of our common stock in the public market could cause our stock price to fall. 

As of December 31, 2022, we had
10,498,802 outstanding shares of common stock. Future sales of a large number of our shares or shares issuable upon exercise of our outstanding
warrants and stock options, or the perception that a large number of shares may be sold, could have a material adverse effect on the trading
price of our common stock. 

We
will incur significant costs to ensure compliance with U.S. and Nasdaq reporting and corporate governance requirements. 

We
incur significant costs associated with compliance with our SEC public company reporting requirements and with applicable U.S. and
Nasdaq corporate governance requirements, including requirements under the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002. These rules and regulations
may also make it more difficult and more expensive for us to obtain director and officer liability insurance and we may be required
to accept reduced policy limits and coverage or incur substantially higher costs to obtain the same or similar coverage. As a
result, it may be difficult for us to attract and retain qualified individuals to serve on our Board of Directors or as executive
officers. 

14 

If
we fail to maintain effective internal control over financial reporting, the market price of our securities may be adversely affected. 

As
a public reporting company, we are required to establish and maintain effective internal control over financial reporting. Failure to
establish such internal control, or any failure of such internal control once established, could adversely impact our public disclosures
regarding our business, financial condition or results of operations. Any failure of our internal control over financial reporting could
also prevent us from maintaining accurate accounting records and discovering accounting errors and financial frauds. 

Rules
adopted by the SEC pursuant to Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 require annual assessment of our internal control over financial
reporting. The standards that must be met for management to assess the internal control over financial reporting as effective are complex,
and require significant documentation, testing and possible remediation to meet the detailed standards. We may encounter problems or
delays in completing activities necessary to make an assessment of our internal control over financial reporting. If we cannot assess
our internal control over financial reporting as effective, investor confidence and share value may be negatively impacted. In addition,
management s assessment of internal control over financial reporting may identify weaknesses and conditions that need to be addressed
in our internal control over financial reporting or other matters that may raise concerns for investors. Any actual or perceived weaknesses
and conditions that need to be addressed in our internal control over financial reporting (including those weaknesses identified in our
periodic reports), or disclosure of management s assessment of our internal control over financial reporting may have an adverse
impact on the price of our securities. 

Provisions
in our articles of incorporation and bylaws could discourage a takeover that stockholders may consider favorable and may lead to entrenchment
of management. 

Our
articles of incorporation and bylaws contain provisions that could delay or prevent changes in control or changes in our management without
the consent of our Board of Directors. These provisions include the following: 

a
 classified Board of Directors with three-year staggered terms, which may delay the ability of stockholders to change the membership
 of a majority of our Board of Directors; 

no
 cumulative voting in the election of directors, which limits the ability of minority stockholders to elect director candidates; 

the
 exclusive right of our Board of Directors to elect a director to fill a vacancy created by the expansion of the Board of Directors
 or the resignation, death or removal of a director, which prevents stockholders from being able to fill vacancies on our Board of Directors; 

the
 ability of our Board of Directors to alter our bylaws without obtaining stockholder approval; 

the
 required approval of the holders of at least two-thirds of the shares entitled to vote at an election of directors to adopt, amend
 or repeal our bylaws or repeal the provisions of our articles of incorporation and bylaws regarding the election and removal of directors;

a
 prohibition on stockholder action by written consent, which forces stockholder action to be taken at an annual or special meeting
 of our stockholders; 

the
 requirement that a special meeting of stockholders may be called only by the chairman of the Board of Directors, the chief executive
 officer, the president (in the absence of a chief executive officer) or the Board of Directors, which may delay the ability of our
 stockholders to force consideration of a proposal or to take action, including the removal of directors; and 

advance
 notice procedures that stockholders must comply with in order to nominate candidates to our Board of Directors or to propose matters
 to be acted upon at a stockholders meeting, which may discourage or deter a potential acquirer from conducting a solicitation
 of proxies to elect the acquirer s own slate of directors or otherwise attempting to obtain control of us. 

These
provisions could inhibit or prevent possible transactions that some stockholders may consider attractive. 

15 

We
could issue one or more additional series of shares of preferred stock with the effect of diluting existing stockholders and impairing
their voting and other rights. 

Our
Board of Directors is authorized to issue up to 10,000,000 shares of preferred stock and may determine the terms of future preferred
stock offerings without further action by our stockholders. If we issue preferred stock, it could affect your rights or reduce the value
of our outstanding common stock. In particular, specific rights granted to future holders of preferred stock may include voting rights,
preferences as to dividends and liquidation, conversion, and redemption rights, sinking fund provisions, and restrictions on our ability
to merge with or sell our assets to a third party. As of December 31, 2022, 465 shares of our preferred stock are outstanding, consisting
of 132 shares of Series D Preferred Stock and 333 shares of Series E Preferred Stock. In addition to the possible negative effect on
the market price of our common shares resulting from the public sale or perceived sale of common shares issuable upon conversion or exercise
of these securities, the Certificate of Designations for the Series D Preferred Stock provides that upon occurrence of certain triggering
events described in the Certificate, including but not limited to, payment defaults, breaches of the transaction documents pertaining
to the Series D Preferred Stock and failure to maintain listing on The Nasdaq Capital Market, the Series D Preferred Shares would become
subject to redemption, at the option of the holder, at a 125 premium to the underlying value of the Series D Shares being redeemed.

Overview 

Sigma
is a leading provider of in-process quality assurance (IPQA software to the additive manufacturing industry. Sigma specializes
in the development and commercialization of real-time monitoring solutions known as PrintRite3D for 3D metal and polymer
advanced manufacturing technologies. PrintRite3D detects and classifies defects and anomalies real-time during the manufacturing
process, enabling significant cost-savings and production efficiencies. We work closely with international standards organizations,
renowned universities, research organizations, advanced manufacturers, OEMs, and leading software companies.
PrintRite3D is printer agnostic and works with most of the leading 3D metal printers, as well as a growing base of polymer printers. 

Strategic
Direction 

2022
was a year of significant change for our Company, from our symbolic name change to the execution of a new approach to the market. We
have a mission to accelerate the adoption of additive manufacturing by setting the industry standard for quality, and we have charted
our path to deliver the first holistic digital quality experience for the additive industry with the following objectives: 

Simplifying
 the quality experience from up to twelve disparate software licenses and multiple manual spreadsheets, to a single user experience
 that is holistic and integrated with production workflow. 

Building
 strategic partnerships, expanding our partner ecosystem, and best ensuring success of existing customers as they move into production. 

Offering
 products that are easier to use and less expensive, both for initial purchases and as expansion opportunities. 

Attracting
 a strategic corporate investment partner with clear product, customer, and financial synergies. 

A
holistic digital quality experience connects in-process data upstream to CAD/CAM through the downstream inspection and material data.
This digital quality journey begins by creating a new qualification framework for in-process data. The path to qualified parts and continued
production relies on more than just melt pool monitoring; it also covers machine health, process health, and part health. Our customers
require specific data for qualification and certification of parts and need a holistic approach to production quality, and further, require
a way to simplify quality from 8-12 disparate software licenses and several manual spreadsheets to one user experience that is integrated
into their production workflow. 

17 

In
order to expand the number of OEMs distributing our technology, we launched a three-tiered OEM program directed to: (1) new OEMs without
their own quality assurance or monitoring solution; (2) established OEMs with a quality monitoring offering, but who have customers with
multiple printers from multiple OEMs and want a single third party quality and analytics solution with consistent quality metrics across
printers, processes and materials; and (3) OEMs building open application programming interfaces, or APIs, to integrate components of
Sigma s proprietary technology with their current offerings. We are now working with OEMs on their next generation printers to
offer a software-only solution that will utilize the printer s computing infrastructure and dramatically reduce the overall cost
of its technology, enabling the opportunity to move towards a software only embedded solution on every printer sold by partner OEMs.
To further augment this initiative, we have also begun integrating with industry wide hardware providers, such as our recently announced
relationship with a laser scanner provider. 

We
began offering our current PrintRite3D integrated hardware and software solution on a subscription basis in 2022. Among other things,
 the change reduced the initial upfront cost to a new user from over 100,000 to approximately 3,000- 5,000 per month. The
combination of subscription pricing and the new software-only products that can be embedded into OEM and software partner offerings are
intended to make our technology more affordable to acquire and easier to bundle, distribute and support in an effort to become the industry
standard. 

The
shift in our business model adversely affected our revenues and near-term revenue growth as we increased our focus on building strategic
partnerships, expanding our partner ecosystem, and ensuring the success of our existing customers as they move into production. In 2022, we relied primarily on retrofit work while the software only products were still under development .
We expect that the percentage of the Company s revenue coming from OEMs will increase in 2023 and beyond, especially with the availability
of a software-only product as we work to integrate into existing hardware, such as laser scanner technology and OEM s upstream designs
for next generation systems. Our ability
to generate revenues in the future will depend on our ability to further commercialize and increase market presence of our traditional
PrintRite3D technology, along with our new software-only offerings that start to link industry quality together. Additionally, it
will depend on whether key prospective customers continue to move from additive manufacturing prototyping to production, which our products
are intended to accelerate. However, we believe these changes to our business model will contribute to faster adoption of our product
by end users and will result in more predictable and profitable revenues over the longer term. 

Over
the past twelve years, Sigma has invested its resources to solve the problem of in-process AM quality: melt pool analytics for the part , which originated as a retrofit lab solution. Our prior product offering met the needs of materials scientists,
but overlooked the production needs of shop floor technicians, process engineers, and operations teams. The addition of our machine 
and process software products for additive manufacturing will provide a holistic in-process quality base for us to connect
to the broader digital quality ecosystem. 

As
part of our vision to build the future of connected digital quality and enhance shareholder value, we have undertaken an initiative to
evaluate a range of strategic alternatives, including possible strategic investment, acquisition, merger, business combination, or similar
transaction with clear product, customer, and financial synergies to Sigma. This work is focused on identified companies that connect
to our long-term quality vision. This strategic initiative is focused on synergies and potential product integration to accelerate market
visibility and customer adoption. To execute Sigma s vision and realize our potential, we will need to raise additional capital, or
execute a strategic transaction, which may include, a possible strategic investment, acquisition, merger, business combination, or similar
transaction. 

We
believe the industry is evolving. Application Programming Interfaces, or APIs, are opening up as some of our relationships with OEMs
have become public. There is also a trend toward consolidation in additive manufacturing as companies align for profitability. Sigma
has made demonstrable progress in 2022 connecting to other products in the AM digital quality stream, and a connection to a strategic
partner paired with near term execution can augment our ability to scale, support the market, and create value. Further, alignment with
a strategic investor or acquirer allows for common growth, vision, and funding of the Company to achieve its mission, but also provides an opportunity
for other strategic relationships, including potential acquisitions that can further accelerate the execution of our digital quality
vision. 

To
facilitate our ability to execute our strategic initiatives on the product, pricing, and partner fronts, we have taken several steps
to conserve our cash by reducing our operating expenses. Compensation and benefits are our single largest expense, comprising approximately
53 of our total operating expenses for 2022. We reduced our total full-time headcount by a net of eight employees in 2022 and experienced
a further reduction of six employees in 2023 as a result of furloughs and departures from the Company. As of March 29, 2023,
our full-time employee headcount was 19. In addition to headcount reductions, we have reduced our spend on advertising, marketing and
investor relations, consultants, and employee travel. We continue to evaluate our expenses and will consider further reductions as appropriate.
 Lastly, Sigma has developed a deep patent portfolio which we believe is widely applicable to the 3D printing industry. We have recently begun exploring an intellectual property licensing program, which we believe may facilitate a strategic transaction.

Covid-19
Business Update 

The
worldwide COVID-19 pandemic caused a reduction, and in some cases a freeze, in capital spending within the Company s targeted
industries, which negatively affected our revenue in 2021. Additionally, this slowed the development of our technology based on
prolonged budget reductions and delays at development partner sites. With slowed customer interaction, Sigma experienced some
slowing of planned integrations and qualification into 2022. With the relaxing of COVID-19 restrictions in the U.S. and Europe in
2022, business activity began to return to near pre-pandemic levels, and we have resumed qualification and integration of our technology with
partners and customers who experienced such prior delays. Regarding our supply chain, however, the Company continues to experience increased lead
times for certain hardware components of PrintRite3D. The future impact of the outbreak, including variations of the virus, is
highly uncertain so that no assurance can be given that the outbreak will not have a material adverse impact on the future results
of the Company. It is also uncertain as to any further disruption of the financial markets, which may reduce our ability to access
capital, either at all, or on favorable terms. 

Critical
Accounting Policies and Estimates 

The
preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States requires management
to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported assets, liabilities, sales and expenses in the accompanying financial statements.
Critical accounting policies are those that require the most subjective and complex judgments, often employing the use of estimates about
the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain. By their nature, changes in these assumptions and estimates could significantly
affect our financial position or results of operations. Significant accounting estimates that may materially change in the near future
are revenue recognition, impairment of long-lived assets, values of stock compensation awards and stock equivalents granted as offering
costs, and allowance for bad debts and inventory obsolescence. Such critical accounting policies, including the assumptions and judgments
underlying them, are disclosed in Note 1 to the Financial Statements included in this Annual Report. However, we do not believe that
there are any alternative methods of accounting for our operations that would have a material effect on our financial statements. 

The
critical accounting policies and estimates addressed below reflect our most significant judgements and estimates used in the preparation
of our financial statements. 

Revenue
Recognition - The Company s revenue is derived primarily from sales of our software and related hardware suite under perpetual
licenses and from providing engineering services under contracts. The Company recognizes revenue in accordance with ASC Topic No. 606.
In May 2014, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued Accounting Standards Update (ASU) No. 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts
with Customers . ASU 2014-09 is a comprehensive revenue recognition standard that superseded nearly all existing revenue recognition
guidance under prior GAAP and replaced it with a principles-based approach for determining revenue recognition. The core principle of
the standard is the recognition of revenue upon the transfer of promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the
consideration to which the company expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services. In general, we determine revenue recognition
by: (1) identifying the contract, or contracts, with our customer; (2) identifying the performance obligations in the contract; (3) determining
the transaction price; (4) allocating the transaction price to performance obligations in the contract; and (5) recognizing revenue when,
or as, we satisfy performance obligations by transferring the promised goods or services. 

In
January 2022, the Company began offering a subscription option to its customers pursuant to which we lease our PrintRite3D platform
for terms between 12 and 36 months and provide technical support and maintenance for the term of the arrangement, as well as installation
and training. The Company has determined these are leases because they relate to discrete pieces of equipment to which customers have
the right to substantially all the economic benefit and exclusive right to use during the term of the arrangement. These leases are classified
as operating leases and the Company retains title to the underlying equipment. 

The
leases may be renewed for successive one-year terms unless notice is given by either party of its intent not to renew at least 30 days
before the end of the lease term. For leases with 36-month terms, the lessee may terminate the agreement after the first 18 months with
30-days written notice. Some, but not all, of the leases permit lessees to purchase the asset at any time at an amount that approximates
fair value and are not reasonably certain to be exercised at the inception of the lease. There are no anticipated variable lease payments
at the inception of the lease. 

There
are two non-lease components in the arrangement that consist of technical support and maintenance, and installation and training. The
Company has elected the single component practical expedient to combine the technical support and maintenance with the lease as they
have the same pattern of transfer. The installation and training component does not have the same pattern of transfer; therefore, this
component is not eligible for the single component practical expedient. The lease consideration is allocated on a relative fair value
basis of the underlying lease and non-lease components. The Company has estimated the residual value of the leased equipment based on
its useful life, and the ability to refurbish and sell the equipment, as well as the Company s ability to componentize the hardware
and utilize subassemblies in other products. 

19 

The
Company is depreciating assets over their useful life of 7 years, but certain subassemblies and components may have a longer economic
life. 

Accounts
Receivable and Allowance for Doubtful Accounts - Trade accounts receivable are carried at original invoice amount less an estimate
made for doubtful accounts. We determine the allowance for doubtful accounts by identifying potential troubled accounts and by using
historical experience and future expectations applied to an aging of accounts. Trade accounts receivable are written off when deemed
uncollectible. Recoveries of trade accounts receivable previously written off are recorded as income when received. 

Inflation
 - While we do not believe that inflation had a material effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations during
the year ended December 31, 2022, we experienced increases in wages and other compensation costs, and costs for certain components of
our PrintRite3D product. If our costs become subject to significant inflationary pressures, we may not be able to fully offset such higher
costs through price increases. Our inability or failure to do so could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition
and results of operations. 

Inventory
Valuation - Inventories consist of raw materials used in the production of customized parts, work-in-process and finished goods components
which will be sold to customers. Inventories are valued at the lower of cost or net realizable value, using the first-in, first-out (FIFO)
method. Charges for obsolete inventory are based on specific identification of inventory items resulting from regular, on ongoing reviews
of our build of materials. 

Leases
 - The Company primarily leases office space from third parties. The Company determines if a contract is a lease at inception. A contract
contains a lease if the contract conveys the right to control the use of an identified asset for a period of time in exchange for consideration.
The lease term begins on the commencement date, which is the date the Company takes possession of the asset and may include options to
extend or terminate the lease when it is reasonably certain that the option will be exercised. Leases are classified as operating or
finance leases based on factors such as the lease term, lease payments, and the economic life, fair value and estimated residual value
of the asset. Where leases include an option to purchase the leased asset at the end of the lease term, this is assessed as a part of
the Company s lease classification determination. The Company only has short-term leases, with remaining lease terms of less than
one year. The leases are cancelable at any time upon 45 days written notice. Therefore, the Company has elected the short-term lease
recognition exemption for all leases, whereby leases are not recorded on the Company s balance sheet and lease payments are recognized
as lease expense on a straight-line basis over the lease term. 

Long-Lived
and Intangible Assets Long-lived assets and certain identifiable definite life intangibles to be held and used by the Company
are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable.
The Company continuously evaluates the recoverability of its long-lived assets based on estimated future cash flows and the estimated
liquidation value of such long-lived assets and provides for impairment if such undiscounted cash flows are insufficient to recover the
carrying amount of the long-lived assets. If impairment exists, an adjustment is made to write the asset down to its fair value, and
a loss is recorded as the difference between the carrying value and fair value. Fair values are determined based on quoted market values,
discounted cash flows or internal and external appraisals, as applicable. Assets to be disposed of are carried at the lower of carrying
value or estimated net realizable value. Utility patents are amortized over a 17-year period. Patents which are pending are not amortized. 

Stock-Based Compensation We measure the compensation costs of stock-based compensation arrangements based on the grant-date
fair value and recognize the costs in the financial statements over the period during which employees are required to provide
services. Stock-based compensation arrangements may include stock options, grants of shares of common stock with and without
restrictions, performance-based awards, share appreciation rights and employee share purchase plans. Stock-based compensation is
measured on the date of grant at its fair value. 

Equity
instruments issued to non-employees are recorded on the basis of the grant date fair value of the instruments. In general, the measurement
date is either (a) when a performance commitment, as defined, is reached or (b) the earlier of the date that (i) the non-employee performance
requirement is complete or (ii) the instruments are vested. The measured value related to the instruments is recognized over a period
based on the facts and circumstances of each particular grant. 

The
grant date fair value of stock-based compensation and other equity instruments is calculated using the Black Scholes valuation
model, and requires estimates of several inputs to the model, including risk-free interest rates, dividends, and expected volatility
of our stock price.

Results
of Operations 

Year
Ended December 31, 2022 Compared to the Year Ended December 31, 2021 

We
generate revenues through hardware and software licensing of our PrintRite3D technology to customers that seek to improve their
manufacturing production processes, and through ongoing annual software upgrades and maintenance fees. Additionally, we generate revenues
from development work utilizing our metal AM equipment and engineering team. Our ability to generate revenues in the future will depend on our ability to
further commercialize and increase market presence of our PrintRite3D technologies, and it will depend on whether key prospective
customers continue to move from AM metal prototyping to production. 

Employees
and Headcount 

At
December 31, 2022, our full time employee headcount was 25, as compared to 33 at December 31, 2021. The decrease of 8 employees was primarily
related to the shift in our business model as we move away from selling expensive perpetual licenses for PrintRite3D, in which most of
the cost comes from physical hardware, to setting up for our future software-only subscription model. 

The
labor market is extremely competitive, and our highly trained, skilled, and talented employees are heavily recruited by others. To that
end, we have made additional investments in our employees designed to ensure we remain competitive in the marketplace. This also aligns
well with, and reinforces, our employee first culture. In addition to salaries, we improved our benefits by offering a
premium health care plan option and increasing the Company s contribution to premiums. We have also added a Company paid short-term
disability insurance plan and optional long-term disability insurance plan. And finally, we have increased equity related compensation
to everyone in our Company, from non-employee directors to executive management to employees and consultants. We believe that this is
an important component of aligning shareholder, company, and employee interests and vests everyone in the growth and success of Sigma. 

Infrastructure 

In
addition to the investments made to improve our manufacturing processes and engineering designs, in fiscal 2021 we added new software
applications to assist us in achieving the leverage we need in our operations, both now and for the future. In particular, we added software
subscriptions for a customer relationship management system (CRM ), a product lifecycle management system PLM ),
and a project tracking and management system, all of which we believe will help us improve controls, efficiency and communication throughout
the Company. 

Revenue
and Cost of Revenue 

During
the fiscal year ended December 31, 2022 fiscal 2022 ), we generated 630,428 in revenues, as compared to 1,651,765 in the fiscal year ended December 31, 2021 fiscal 2021 ). The decrease was due to a decrease in perpetual
license sales of our PrintRite3D units of 1,141,323 and decreased contract additive manufacturing revenue of 11,189.
Partially offsetting these decreases were an increase in revenues of 31,177 from our subscription-based pricing program, increased
revenues from our legacy Rapid Test and Evaluation RTE program of 33,000, increased on-site installation and
support revenue of 35,035, an increase in consulting service revenue of 4,500, and an increase in annual maintenance contract
revenue of 27,463. Our cost of revenue for fiscal 2022 was 349,930, as compared to 559,965 for fiscal 2021, a
decrease of 210,035, or 37.5 . The decrease was primarily attributable to fewer unit sales in 2022, partially offset by increased
travel costs incurred related to installations from 2021 sales. 

Gross
Margin 

In
fiscal year 2022, our gross margin decreased to 44 from 66 in 2021 due primarily to an increase in the price of certain
PrintRite3D system components as a result of configuration changes, discounted sales to universities and research institutions as members of our AcGovDustrial Network, and
the aforementioned increase in travel costs incurred related to system installations. 

Operating
Expenses 

Sigma s
operating expenses for fiscal 2022 were 9,029,502 as compared to 9,571,185 for fiscal 2021, a decrease of 541,683, or 5.7 . The
decrease was primarily attributable to a decrease in stock-based compensation, a decrease in operating and research and development
costs, partially offset by increases in salary and benefits, office expenses due to a company-wide global conference held in May of
2022, and increased business travel in 2022 as further described below. 

21 

Salary
and benefits costs were 4,740,437 for fiscal 2022, as compared to 4,286,368 for fiscal 2021, an increase of 454,069, or 10.5 . The
increase was comprised of: (a) 534,963 in employee salary increases and average full-time employee headcount increasing by two; (b)
a 79,289 increase in severance due to the termination of employment of six employees; and (c) increased taxes and benefits of 174,616.
Partially offsetting these increases were: (1) a decrease in commissions of 24,815; (2) a decrease in incentive
bonuses of 215,490; and (3) a decrease in stock appreciation rights expense of 94,494 due to the revaluation of the compensation liability
as a result of the decrease in our stock price in fiscal 2022. 

Stock-based
compensation was 793,251 for fiscal 2022, as compared to 1,066,455 for fiscal 2021, a decrease of 273,204, or 25.6 . This decrease
was primarily due to fewer stock options granted in fiscal 2022. 

We
incurred operations and research and development costs of 653,194 during fiscal 2022, as compared to 890,553 in fiscal 2021, a decrease
of 237,359, or 26.7 . The decrease was primarily due to a decrease in operations costs of 224,335 and a decrease in research and development
costs of 13,024. The decrease in operations expense was due to: (a) a decrease in charges for inventory obsolescence of 81,544; (b)
equipment upgrades in 2021 in both our manufacturing facility and our 3D metal printer totaling 14,777; (c) a decrease in parts and
material purchases of 107,936; and (d) a decrease in purchase of lab supplies of 20,078. The decrease in research and development costs
was due to expenses associated with a simulation project in 2021 of 97,188, partially offset by an increase in consulting costs of 64,164
in connection with ongoing PrintRite3D software development and 20,000 for research on laser application of PrintRite3D for a new OEM. 

We
incurred investor, public relations, and marketing expenses of 422,645 during fiscal 2022, as compared
to 503,823 during the same period in 2021. The decrease of 81,178, or 16.1 , was due to a decrease in investor relations
consulting costs of 84,832 resulting from a revaluation of SARs at December 31, 2022 and lower advertising
expenses of 11,301. Partially offsetting these decreases was an increase in tradeshow expenses of 14,955 as compared to 2021, when COVID-19
travel restrictions precluded attendance at such events. 

Organizational
costs for fiscal 2022 were 311,606, compared to 726,147 for fiscal 2021. The decrease of 414,541, or 57 , was primarily
attributable to: (a) a decrease in non-employee director fees of 369,830, mostly as a result of a decrease in stock options issued;
and (b) a decrease in stockholder services of 43,832, primarily due to expenses incurred in 2021 in connection with a special
stockholders meeting. 

Legal
and professional fees in fiscal 2022 were 725,285, as compared to 915,530 during fiscal 2021, a decrease of 190,245, or 20.8 .
This decrease was a result of a decrease in legal expenses of 25,757 due to one less stockholder meeting and fewer regulatory
filings in fiscal 2022, a decrease in recruiting expenses of 109,061 related to new hires in 2021, a decrease in consulting
expenses of 38,915 and a decrease in accounting fees of 16,089 due to the fulltime hire of former outside accounting
personnel. 

Office
expenses for fiscal 2022 were 914,802, as compared to 734,386 for fiscal 2021, an increase of 180,416, or 24.6 . The increase resulted
from: (a) an increase in travel and entertainment of 82,241 related to increased travel as compared to fiscal 2021 as a result of the
easing of COVID-19 related travel restrictions; (b) an increase in expenses of 109,435 related to a Company-wide, global conference
held in May of 2022; (c) an increase in payroll service fees of 10,735 related to new hires; (d) an increase in dues and subscriptions
of 38,847 for new customer relationship management, product lifecycle management, and project management software; and (e) an increase
in utilities expenses of 2,459. Partially offsetting these increases were decreases in postage and shipping of 47,580, and decreases
in office supplies of 11,998 and education expenses of 3,723. 

Other
operating expenses were 352,115 for fiscal 2022, as compared to 353,818 for fiscal 2021, a decrease of 1,703. The decrease was
due to: (a) a decrease in SEC filing fees of 6,102; (b) a decrease in licensing fees of 2,166; and (c) a decrease in bank fees,
primarily credit card transaction fees of 9,325. These decreases were partially offset by an increase in insurance policy premiums
for fiscal 2022 of 15,890. 

In fiscal 2022, we
realized net other income of 56,580, as compared to 1,094,780 in fiscal 2021. The decrease of 1,038,200, or 94.8 , was due to a
gain in fiscal 2021 of 1,092,441 from the revaluation of the derivative liability related to our private placement of warrants, a
foreign currency exchange loss of 15,927 in fiscal 2022 due to the strengthening of the US dollar against the Euro, and a decrease
in interest income of 6,460. Partially offsetting these decreases was an increase of 76,628 in New Mexico state incentives in fiscal 2022. 

22 

Sigma s
net loss before preferred dividends for fiscal 2022 increased by 1,307,819 and totaled 8,692,424, as compared to a net loss before
preferred dividends of 7,384,605 for fiscal 2021. Net loss applicable to common stockholders for fiscal 2022 was 8,749,304, as
compared to 7,488,172 for fiscal 2021. The fiscal 2022 net operating loss component of the overall loss was 269,619 higher than in
fiscal 2021 and the other income component was 1,038,200 lower. Preferred stock dividends were 56,880 in fiscal 2022 and 103,567
in fiscal 2021. 

Liquidity
and Capital Resources 

Due
to uncertainties regarding our ability to meet our current and future operating and capital expenses, there is substantial doubt
about our ability to continue as a going concern for 12 months from the date of the filing of this Annual Report, and the report of
our registered independent public accounting firm on our financial statements as of and for the year ended December 31, 2022
included in Item 15 of this Annual Report contains a going concern qualification. 

As
of December 31, 2022, we had 2,845,931 in cash and working capital of 3,644,522, as compared to 11,447,047 in cash and working capital
of 11,702,358 as of December 31, 2021. 

We
currently have no arrangement to obtain any additional financing. We have taken several steps to conserve our cash, including
furloughing non-essential employees, reducing or eliminating certain marketing and advertising programs, limiting employee travel,
and reducing investor relations expenses and certain consulting expenses. Our existing cash on hand and anticipated revenues are sufficient to fund our
remaining anticipated operating costs and capital expenditure requirements only through May 2023. We have based this estimate on
assumptions that may prove to be wrong, and we could exhaust our capital resources sooner than we expect, or extend such resources longer than we expect. 

Because
of the numerous risks and uncertainties associated with the research, development, and commercialization of our products, we are unable
to estimate the exact amount of our working capital requirements. Our future capital requirements will depend on many factors, including: 

The
 cost of expending, maintaining, and enforcing our intellectual property portfolio, including filing, prosecuting, defending and enforcing
 our patent claims and other intellectual property rights; 

The
 effect of competing technological and market developments; 

The
 revenue from the sales of our existing and future products; 

The
 cost of operating as a public company; and 

The
 other factors listed under Item 1A Risk Factors. 

Our
major sources of funding have been proceeds from public and private offerings of our equity securities (both common stock and preferred
stock), and from warrant exercises. In 2022, we did not raise any funds. In January 2021, the Company closed a public offering of 1,711,783
shares of common stock at 3.00 per share, resulting in net proceeds of approximately 4,532,444 after deducting underwriting discounts
and commissions and other offering expenses payable by the Company. In March 2021, the Company closed a public offering of 2,190,000
shares of common stock at 4.445 per share, resulting in net proceeds to the Company of approximately 8,736,488 after deducting placement
agent commissions and other offering costs payable by the Company. Concurrent with the public offering, the Company issued warrants to
investors to purchase an aggregate of 2,190,000 shares of common stock to holders in a private placement. The warrants entitle the holders
to purchase one share of our common stock at an exercise price equal to 4.32 per share commencing on May 24, 2021 and will expire two
years from such date. 

We
will need to raise additional amounts to fund our operations, maintain compliance with the NASDAQ listing requirements and implement
our business plan. There is no assurance as to the amount and availability of any required future financing or the terms thereof.
Such financing, if in the form of equity, may be highly dilutive to our existing stockholders and may otherwise include onerous
terms. If in the form of debt, such financing may include covenants and repayment obligations which may be difficult to meet and
that could adversely affect our business and operations. To the extent that funds are not available to us, we may be required to
delay, limit, or terminate our business and operations and lose our NASDAQ listing. 

While
we expect that continued enhancements of our IPQA -enabled PrintRite3D technology, together with transitioning to a
subscription-based, software-only product offering will enable us to further commercialize this technology into the AM metal market
in 2023, we will be unable to do so without additional funding. Should we be able to secure such funding, we plan to seek to
continue funding our development activities and operating expenses by licensing our PrintRite3D systems and supporting field
services, as applicable, and providing PrintRite3D -enabled engineering consulting services concerning our areas of expertise
(materials and manufacturing quality assurance and process control technologies) and through the use of proceeds from sales of our
securities and potential exercises of our outstanding warrants.

Net
Cash Used in Operating Activities 

During
fiscal 2022, net cash used in operating activities was 8,212,154, which was the result of a net loss of 8,692,424 before preferred
dividends and the use of cash for working capital of 543,280, partially offset by non-cash expenses of 1,023,550 related to
depreciation and amortization of 116,167, and stock-based compensation of 907,383. Changes in working capital were driven by an increase in inventory of 240,863, a decrease in deferred revenue of 28,782, and a decrease in accounts payable and
accrued expenses of 323,259, partially offset by a decrease in accounts receivable of 40,572. The increase in inventory was
primarily due to stocking of certain components of our PrintRite3D systems with long order lead times, and an increase in contract
assets resulting from PrintRite3D systems on our lease program. The decrease in accounts payable and accrued expenses was primarily
due to a decrease in accrued bonuses in 2022. 

During
fiscal 2021, net cash used in operating activities was 6,298,959, driven by a net loss of 7,384,605 before preferred dividends,
partially offset by non-cash expenses of 769,787 and cash generated from working capital of 315,859. Non-cash expenses were
comprised of: (1) depreciation and amortization of 94,105; and (2) stock-based compensation of 1,768,123; partially offset by a gain on derivative liability of 1,092,441. Cash generated from working capital was driven by an increase in accounts payable and
accrued expenses of 373,563 primarily as a result of increased accrued bonuses in 2021, and an increase in deferred revenue of
 70,898, partially offset by increases in accounts receivable of 80,630 and inventory of 50,429. The increase in accounts
receivable was due to increased sales, and the increase in inventory was primarily due to stocking of certain components of our
PrintRite3D systems with long order lead times. 

Net
Cash Used by Investing Activities 

Net
cash used by investing activities in fiscal 2022 was 388,962, as compared to 359,750 in fiscal 2021. The increase was due to
increased patent costs of 47,112, partially offset by a decrease in purchases of property, plant and equipment of
 17,900. 

Net
Cash Provided by Financing Activities 

No
cash was provided by financing activities in fiscal 2022. In fiscal 2021, cash provided by financing activities was 14,404,942,
consisting of net proceeds of 13,268,932 from financings and 1,136,010 in proceeds from the exercise of warrants. 

We
have no off-balance sheet arrangements as defined in Item 303(a) of Regulation S-K.

Evaluation
of Disclosure Controls and Procedures 

Rule
13a-15(e) under the Exchange Act defines the term disclosure controls and procedures as those controls and procedures designed
to ensure that information required to be disclosed by a company in the reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is recorded,
processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC rules and forms and that such information is accumulated
and communicated to the company s management, including its principal executive and principal financial officers, or persons performing
similar functions, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.

Management s
Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting 

Management
is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting, as such term is defined in Exchange
Act Rule 13a-15(f) under the Exchange Act. Our management, with the participation of our Chief Executive Officer, and Chief Financial
Officer, conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of our control over financial reporting based on the framework in Internal Control-Integrated
Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. Based on its evaluation under
the framework, management has concluded that our internal control over financial reporting was effective as of December 31, 2022. 

We
continuously seek to improve and strengthen our control processes to ensure that our controls and procedures are adequate and
effective. Any failure to implement and maintain improvements in the controls over our financial reporting could cause us to fail to
meet our reporting obligations under the SEC s rules and regulations. Any failure to improve our internal controls to address the
weakness we have identified could also cause investors to lose confidence in our reported financial information, which could have a negative
impact on the trading price of our common stock. 

This Report does not include an
attestation report of the Company s registered independent public accounting firm regarding internal control over financial reporting,
which is not required for smaller reporting companies. 

Changes
in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting 

There
were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting during the fourth quarter of the year ended December 31, 2022 that have
materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.

Kent
Summers was appointed to our Board of Directors on January 18, 2018. Mr. Summers was also appointed to serve as a member of the Company s
Audit Committee, Compensation Committee, and Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee. 

Mr.
Summers currently divides his time among a number of independent activities which focus on early-stage technology company formation and

early-stage business growth strategies, enterprise sales, business acquisitions, as well as his background and extensive company management
and leadership experience. 

Director
Independence 

Our
Board of Directors currently consists of five members. As a result of his previous role as Chief Executive Officer, Mr. Ruport is not
considered an independent director. As a result of his April 1, 2022 appointment as Chief Executive Officer, Mr. Brunsberg is also not
considered an independent director. Our Board of Directors has determined that our other directors, Salvatore Battinelli, Dennis Duitch
and Kent Summers, constituting a majority of our directors, are independent as that term is defined under Rule 5605(a)(2)
of the Nasdaq marketplace rules. Pursuant to Nasdaq rules, our board must consist of a majority of independent directors. 

The
Nasdaq independence definition includes a series of objective tests, including that the director is not, and has not been for at least
three years, one of our employees and that neither the director nor any of his family members has engaged in various types of business
dealings with us. In addition, as required by Nasdaq rules, our Board of Directors has made a subjective determination as to Messrs.
Battinelli, Duitch and Summers, our independent directors, that no relationships exist, which, in the opinion of our Board of Directors,
would interfere with the exercise of independent judgment in carrying out the responsibilities of a director. In making these determinations,
our Board of Directors reviewed and discussed information provided by the directors and us with regard to each director s business
and personal activities and relationships as they may relate to us and our management. There are no family relationships among any of
our directors or executive officers. 

29 

Classified
Board of Directors 

In
accordance with our amended and restated bylaws, our Board of Directors is divided into three classes with staggered, three-year terms.
At each annual meeting of stockholders, the successors to directors whose terms then expire will be elected to serve from the time of
election and qualification until the third annual meeting following election. Our directors are classified as follows: 

the
 Class I director is Mark Ruport, with a term expiring at our 2024 annual meeting of stockholders; 

the
 Class II directors are Salvatore Battinelli and Jacob Brunsberg, with terms expiring at our 2025 annual meeting of stockholders;
 and 

the
 Class III directors are Dennis Duitch and Kent Summers, with terms expiring at our 2023 annual meeting of stockholders. 

Our
amended and restated bylaws provide that the authorized number of directors may be changed by resolution of the Board of Directors. Any
additional directorships resulting from an increase in the number of directors will be distributed among the three classes so that, as
nearly as possible, each class will consist of one-third of the directors. The division of our Board of Directors into three classes
with staggered three-year terms may delay or prevent a change of our management or a change in control of our Company. 

Leadership
Structure of the Board 

Any
director or our Board of Directors as a whole may be removed with or without cause at any meeting of stockholders by the affirmative vote of the holders of at least
two-thirds of our outstanding voting stock entitled to vote in the election of directors. Our amended and restated bylaws provide
our Board of Directors with flexibility in its discretion to combine or separate the positions of Chairman of the Board and Chief
Executive Officer. Our Board of Directors believes it is important to select the
Company s Chairman and Chief Executive Officer in the manner it considers in the best interests of the Company at any given
time. Our Board of Directors believes that the Chairman and Chief Executive Officer positions may be filled by one individual or by
two different individuals, as determined by our Board of Directors based on circumstances then in existence. 

On
April 1, 2022, our Board of Directors appointed Mr. Ruport as Chairman of the Board. The Chairman of the Board presides at all meetings
of our Board of Directors and exercises and performs such other powers and duties as may be assigned to him from time to time by the
Board or prescribed by our amended and restated bylaws. The Chairman of the Board is appointed by our Board of Directors on an annual
basis. 

Our
Board of Directors has no established policy on whether it should be led by a Chairman who is also the Chief Executive Officer, and has
in the past combined the roles of Chairman and Chief Executive Officer. Our Board currently is committed to the separated roles given
the circumstances of our Company. However, our Board of Directors continually evaluates our leadership structure and could, in the future,
decide to combine the Chairman and Chief Executive Officer positions if it believes that doing so would serve the best interests of our
Company and our stockholders. 

Board
Meetings and Committees 

During
our fiscal year ended December 31, 2022, the Board of Directors held fourteen meetings, and each director attended at least 75 of the
aggregate of (i) the total number of meetings of our Board of Directors held during the period he was a director and (ii)
the total number of meetings held by all committees of our Board of Directors on which he served during the periods that he served. 

Although
we do not have a formal policy regarding attendance by members of our Board of Directors at annual meetings of stockholders, we encourage,
but do not require, our directors to attend. Each of our then current directors attended our 2022 Annual Meeting of Stockholders. 

30 

Our
Board of Directors has established three standing committees-audit, compensation, and nominating and corporate governance, each of
which operates under a written charter that has been approved by our Board of Directors. Each committee charter has been posted on the Investors

at www.sigmaadditive.com. The Company intends to disclose any changes in, or waivers from, this code by posting such information on the
same website or by filing a Form 8-K, in each case to the extent such disclosure is required by rules of the SEC or Nasdaq. The reference
to our website address does not constitute incorporation by reference of the information contained at or available through our website,
and you should not consider it to be a part of this Annual Report. 

Considerations
in Evaluating Director Nominees 

Our
Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee uses a variety of methods for identifying and evaluating director nominees. In its evaluation
of director candidates, our Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee will consider the current size and composition of our Board
of Directors and the needs of our Board of Directors and the respective committees of our Board of Directors. Some of the qualifications
that our Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee considers include, without limitation, issues of character, integrity, judgment,
diversity of experience, independence, area of expertise, corporate experience, length of service, potential conflicts of interest and
other commitments. Nominees must also have the ability to offer advice and guidance to our Chief Executive Officer based on past experience
in positions with a high degree of responsibility and be leaders in the companies or institutions with which they are affiliated. Director
candidates must have sufficient time available in the judgment of our Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee to perform all board
of director and committee responsibilities. Members of our Board of Directors are expected to prepare for, attend, and participate in
all board of director and applicable committee meetings. Other than the foregoing, there are no stated minimum criteria for director
nominees, although our Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee may also consider such other factors as it may deem, from time to
time, are in our and our stockholders best interests. 

Although
our Board of Directors does not maintain a specific policy with respect to board diversity, our Board of Directors believes that our
Board of Directors should be a diverse body, and our Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee considers a broad range of backgrounds
and experiences. In making determinations regarding nominations of directors, our Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee may take
into account the benefits of diverse viewpoints. Our Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee also will consider these and other
factors as it oversees the annual Board of Director and committee evaluations. After completing its review and evaluation of director
candidates, our Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee recommends to our full Board of Directors the director nominees for selection. 

Stockholder
Recommendations for Nominations to the Board of Directors 

Our
Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee will consider candidates for director recommended by stockholders so long as such recommending
stockholder was a stockholder of record both at the time of giving notice and at the time of the annual meeting, and such recommendations
comply with our amended and restated articles of incorporation and amended and restated bylaws and applicable laws, rules and regulations,
including those promulgated by the SEC. The Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee will evaluate such recommendations in accordance
with its charter, our amended and restated bylaws, our policies and procedures for director candidates, as well as the regular director
nominee criteria described above. This process is designed to ensure that our Board of Directors includes members with diverse backgrounds,
skills and experience, including appropriate financial and other expertise relevant to our business. Eligible stockholders wishing to
recommend a candidate for nomination should contact the Secretary in writing. Our Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee has discretion
to decide which individuals to recommend for nomination as directors. 

32 

Role
of Board in Risk Oversight Process 

Risk
assessment and oversight are an integral part of our governance and management processes. Our Board of Directors encourages management
to promote a culture that incorporates risk management into our corporate strategy and day-to-day business operations. Management discusses
strategic and operational risks at regular management meetings and conducts specific strategic planning and review sessions during the
year that include a focused discussion and analysis of the risks we face. Throughout the year, senior management reviews these risks
with the Board of Directors at regular board meetings as part of management presentations that focus on particular business functions,
operations or strategies, and presents the steps taken by management to mitigate or eliminate such risks. Our Board of Directors does
not have a standing risk management committee, but rather administers this oversight function directly through the Board of Directors
as a whole, as well as through standing committees of the Board of Directors that will address risks inherent in their respective areas
of oversight. In particular, our Audit Committee is responsible for overseeing our major financial risk exposures and the steps our management
has taken to monitor and control these exposures. The Audit Committee also monitors compliance with legal and regulatory requirements
and considers and approves or disapproves any related-person transactions. Our Nominating and Governance Committee monitors the effectiveness
of our corporate governance guidelines that we may adopt or amend from time to time. Our Compensation Committee assesses and monitors
whether any of our compensation policies and programs has the potential to encourage excessive risk-taking by our management. 

Delinquent
Section 16(a) Reports 

Section
16(a) of the Exchange Act requires the Company s executive officers and directors, and persons who own more
than 10 of a registered class of the Company s equity securities, to file reports of ownership and changes in ownership with the SEC. Executive officers, directors and greater than 10 stockholders are required
by SEC regulations to furnish the Company with copies of all Section 16(a) forms they file. 

The
Company believes that during the fiscal year ended December 31, 2022, its executive officers, directors and greater than 10 stockholders
timely filed all reports under Section 16(a). 

ITEM
11. EXECUTIVE COMPENSATION 

Processes
and Procedures for Compensation Decisions 

Our
Compensation Committee is responsible for the executive compensation programs for our executive officers and reports to our Board of
Directors on its discussions, decisions and other actions. Typically, our Chief Executive Officer makes recommendations to our
Compensation Committee and is involved in the determination of compensation for the respective executive officers that report to
him. Our Chief Executive Officer does not determine his own compensation. Our Chief Executive Officer makes recommendations to our
Compensation Committee regarding short- and long-term compensation for all executive officers based on our results, an individual
executive officer s contribution toward these results and performance toward individual goal achievement. Our Compensation
Committee then reviews the recommendations and other data and makes decisions (or makes recommendations to the Board) as to total
compensation for each executive officer as well as each individual compensation component. 

The
following table sets forth compensation for services rendered in all capacities to the Company: (i) for each person who served as the
Company s Chief Executive Officer at any time during the past fiscal year, and (ii) for our two most highly compensated executive
officers, other than our Chief Executive Officer, who were employed with the Company on December 31, 2022 (the foregoing executives are
herein collectively referred to as the named executive officers ).

Potential
Payments Upon Termination or Change-in-Control 

On
July 1, 2022, our Board of Directors, upon the recommendation of the Compensation Committee, adopted retention bonus and change in control
plans for certain of our named executive officers as described below. 

Retention
Bonus Plan 

The
retention bonus plan consists of the award of retention bonuses to Mr. Brunsberg, and Mr. Orzechowski as an incentive to remain in our
employ through the end of the retention period. The retention bonus amount for Mr. Brunsberg is 375,000, which is equal to 150 of his
base salary in effect on July 1, 2022, and the retention bonus amount for Mr. Orzechowski is 200,000, which is equal to 100 of his
base salary in effect on July 1, 2022. The retention bonuses are payable 50 in cash and 50 in SARs for each executive. 

The
SARs will have an exercise price of 1.30 i.e ., the closing price of our common stock on the grant date) and will vest, in full,
on March 15, 2025, subject to the executive remaining in our continuous employ through such date. 

The
cash component of the retention bonuses will be paid upon the end of the retention period coinciding with the filing of the
Company s 2024 Annual Report on Form 10-K, subject to the executive s continuous employment by the Company through the
filing date. In the event of a change in control of the Company prior to such filing, the executives would be entitled
to payment in cash of a pro rata portion of their total respective bonuses. The balance of the retention bonuses would terminate . Assuming
a change in control had occurred on December 31, 2022, the amount of retention bonuses payable to Mr. Brunsberg and Mr. Orzechowski
would have been 67,164 and 35,821, respectively. 

Change
in Control Plan 

The
change in control plan adopted on July 1, 2022, as modified by our Board of Directors on January 24, 2023, provides that following a
 Change in Control of the Company, Messrs. Brunsberg and Orzechowski each would be entitled to a cash payment equal to
two times his base annual salary in effect on July 1, 2022 i.e ., 500,000 for Mr. Brunsberg and 400,000 for Mr. Orzechowski),
less any base salary payments received between the date of the change in control and the termination date, if his employment
is terminated by the Company without cause or the executive resigns for Good Reason within two years following
the Change in Control . For purposes of the plan, Change in Control means: (i) a liquidation or dissolution
of the Company; (ii) a merger or consolidation of the Company with or into another corporation or entity (other than a merger with a
wholly owned subsidiary); (iii) a sale of all or substantially all of the assets of the Company; or (iv) a purchase or other acquisition
of more than 50 of the outstanding stock of the Company by one person or by more than one person acting in concert. Good Reason 
means: (i) a reduction in the executive s annual base salary as in effect on the date immediately prior to the Change in Control
or a failure to make any scheduled base salary payment within fifteen days after its due date, unless the Company s Board of Directors
determines in good faith that such base salary reduction is more than offset by the aggregate value of any new compensation plans or
other employment-related benefits that are provided to the Executive after the Change in Control; (ii) the Company s requirement
that the executive perform his employment duties at an office that is more than 25 miles from the Company s office at which the
executive was principally employed on the date immediately prior to the Change in Control; (iii) a change or diminution in executive s
employment duties that is materially inconsistent with the duties usually associated with their position at a corporation; or (iv) a
failure by the Company to continue for the benefit of the executive any material compensation plan in which the executive participated
on the date immediately prior to the Change in Control, unless the discontinuation of such plan was outside the Company s reasonable
control or unless the Company discontinues such plan for all of its executive officers. 

41 

Equity
Awards 

We
offer stock options, stock appreciation rights, and stock awards to certain of our employees, including our executive officers, as the
long-term incentive component of our compensation program. We generally grant equity awards to new hires upon their commencing employment
with us. Our stock options allow employees to purchase shares of our common stock at a price per share equal to the fair market value
of our common stock on the date of grant and may or may not be intended to qualify as incentive stock options for U.S.
federal income tax purposes. Our stock appreciation rights allow employees to receive a cash payment for the difference between the market
price of our common stock on the date of exercise and the strike price. We sometimes also offer stock options, stock appreciation rights
and stock awards to our consultants in lieu of cash. Our stock options allow consultants to purchase shares of our common stock at a
price per share equal to the fair market value of our common stock on the date of grant and are not intended to qualify as incentive
stock options for U.S. federal income tax purposes. Our stock appreciation rights allow consultants to receive a cash payment
for the difference between the market price of our common stock on the date of exercise and the strike price. Stock options, stock appreciation
rights, and stock awards granted to our executive officers may be subject to accelerated vesting in certain circumstances. 

Retirement
Plans 

We
maintain a qualified 401(k) plan, in which all eligible employees may participate. We make safe harbor contributions to match 100 of
each participant s contribution up to 3 of salary, and 50 of the next 2 of salary contributed. Safe harbor contributions are
100 vested. We may also elect, on an annual basis, to make a discretionary contribution to the plan, but have not done so to date. Our
elective matches and elective contributions vest to participant accounts as follows: 20 after two years of service, and 20 per year
thereafter until the participant reaches 6 years of service, at which time, employer contributions vest 100 . As a tax-qualified retirement
plan, contributions to the 401(k) plan and earnings on those contributions are not taxable to the employees until distributed from the
401(k) plan. 

No
Tax Gross-Ups 

We
do not make gross-up payments to cover our executive officers personal income taxes that may pertain to any of the compensation
paid or provided by our Company. 

2013
Equity Incentive Plan 

Plan
Purpose 

Our
Board of Directors adopted the 2013 Plan, which terminated on March 15, 2023, to (1) encourage selected employees, officers, directors,
consultants and advisers to improve our operations and increase our profitability, (2) encourage selected employees, officers, directors,
consultants and advisers to accept or continue employment or association with us, and (3) increase the interest of selected employees,
officers, directors, consultants and advisers in our welfare through participation in the growth in value of our common stock. All of
our current employees, officers, directors and consultants were eligible to participate in the 2013 Plan. 

Administration 

The
2013 Plan is administered by the Board or by a committee to which administration of the Plan, or of part of thereof, is delegated
by the Board. The 2013 Plan is currently administered by our Compensation Committee, which we refer to below as the Administrator. 
The Administrator is responsible for selecting the officers, employees, directors, consultants and advisers who will receive Options,
Stock Appreciation Rights and Stock Awards. Subject to the requirements imposed by the 2013 Plan, the Administrator is also responsible
for determining the terms and conditions of each Option and Stock Appreciation Right award, including the number of shares subject to
the Option, the exercise price, expiration date and vesting period of the Option and whether the option is an Incentive Option or a Non-Qualified
Option. Subject to the requirements imposed by the 2013 Plan, the Administrator is also responsible for determining the terms and conditions
of each Stock Award, including the number of shares granted, the purchase price (if any), and the vesting, transfer and other restrictions
imposed on the stock. The Administrator has the power, authority and discretion to make all other determinations deemed necessary or
advisable for the administration of the 2013 Plan or of any award under the 2013 Plan. 

The
2013 Plan is not subject to the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 and is not a qualified pension, profit sharing or bonus
plan under Section 401(a) of the Internal Revenue Code. 

Stock
Subject to the 2013 Plan 

As of March 29, 2023, there were
2,014,659 shares previously issued or subject to outstanding awards under the 2013 Plan. The plan expired on March 15, 2023 and therefore
there are no shares available for future issuance under the 2013 Plan. 

Vesting 

Each
Option, Stock Appreciation Right or Stock Award will become exercisable or non-forfeitable (that is, vest under conditions
specified by the Administrator at the time of grant. Vesting typically is based upon continued service as a director or employee but
may be based upon any performance criteria and other contingencies that are determined by the Administrator. Shares subject to Stock
Awards may be subject to specified restrictions concerning transferability, repurchase by the Company and forfeiture of the shares issued,
together with such other restrictions as may be determined by the Administrator. 

Expiration
Date 

Each
Option or Stock Appreciation Right must be exercised by a date specified in the award agreement, which may not be more than ten years
after the grant date. Except as otherwise provided in the relevant agreement, an Option or Stock Appreciation Right ceases to be exercisable
ninety days after the termination of the holder s service with us. 

42 

Transfers
of Options 

Unless
otherwise determined by the Administrator, Options are not transferable except by will or the laws of descent and distribution. 

Purchase
Price Payment 

Unless
otherwise determined by the Administrator, the purchase price of common stock acquired under the 2013 Plan is payable by cash or check
at the time of an Option exercise or acquisition of a Stock Award. The Company does not charge participants any fees or commissions in
connection with their acquisition of common stock under the 2013 Plan. The Administrator also has discretion to accept the following
types of payment from participants: 

A
 secured or unsecured promissory note, provided that this method of payment is not available to a participant who is a director or
 an executive officer; 

Shares
 of our Common Stock already owned by the Option or Stock Award holder as long as the surrendered shares have a fair market value
 that is equal to the acquired stock and have been owned by the participant for at least six months; 

The
 surrender of shares of Common Stock then issuable upon exercise of an Option; and 

A
 cashless option exercise in accordance with applicable regulations of the SEC and the Federal Reserve Board. 

Withholding
Taxes 

At
the time of his or her exercise of an Option or Stock Appreciation Right, an employee is responsible for paying all applicable federal
and state withholding taxes. A holder of Stock Awards is responsible for paying all applicable federal and state withholding taxes once
the shares covered by the award cease to be forfeitable or at any other time required by applicable law. 

Securities
Law Compliance 

Shares
of common stock will not be issued pursuant to the exercise of an Option or the receipt of a Stock Award unless the Administrator determines
that the exercise of the Option or receipt of the Stock Award and the issuance and delivery of such shares will comply with all relevant
provisions of law, including, without limitation, the Securities Act of 1933 (the Securities Act ), applicable state and
foreign securities laws and the requirements of any stock exchange on which our common stock is traded. 

Effects
of Certain Corporate Transactions 

Except
as otherwise determined by the Administrator, in the event of a corporate transaction, all previously unexercised Options
and Stock Appreciation Rights will terminate immediately prior to the consummation of the corporate transaction and all unvested Restricted
Stock awards will be forfeited immediately prior to the consummation of the corporate transaction. The Administrator, in its discretion,
may permit exercise of any Options or Stock Appreciation Rights prior to their termination, even if those awards would not otherwise
have been exercisable, or provide that outstanding awards will be assumed or an equivalent Option or Stock Appreciation Right substituted
by a successor corporation. The Administrator, in its discretion, may remove any restrictions as to any Restricted Stock awards or provide
that all outstanding Restricted Stock awards will participate in the corporate transaction with an equivalent stock substituted by the
successor corporation subject to the restrictions. In general, a corporate transaction means: 

Our
 liquidation or dissolution; 

Our
 merger or consolidation with or into another corporation as a result of which we are not the surviving corporation; 

A
 sale of all or substantially all of our assets; or 

A
 purchase or other acquisition of more than 50 of our outstanding stock by one person, or by more than one person acting in concert.

43 

Other
Adjustment Provisions 

If
the stock of the Company is changed by reason of a stock split, reverse stock split, stock dividend, recapitalization, combination or
reclassification, appropriate adjustments shall be made by the Administrator, in its discretion, in (1) the number and class of shares
of stock subject to the 2013 Plan and each Option and grant of Stock Awards outstanding under the 2013 Plan, and (2) the purchase price
of each outstanding Option and (if applicable) Stock Award. 

Termination of the Plan 

The
2013 Plan terminated automatically on March 15, 2023, which was the tenth anniversary of the date of the 2013 Plan s adoption by
our Board of Directors. 

2020
Stock Appreciation Rights Plan 

On
June 23, 2020, our Board of Directors adopted the Sigma Labs, Inc. 2020 Stock Appreciation Rights Plan (the Plan ). The
purposes of the Plan are to: (i) enable the Company to attract and retain the types of employees, consultants, and directors (collectively,
 Service Providers who will contribute to the Company s long-range success; (ii) provide incentives that align the
interests of Service Providers with those of the shareholders of the Company; and (iii) promote the success of the Company s business.
The Plan only provides for incentive awards that are only made in the form of stock appreciation rights payable in cash SARs ).
No shares of common stock were reserved in connection with the adoption of the Plan since no shares will be issued pursuant to the Plan. 

Governance
of the Plan 

The
Plan will be administered by the Compensation Committee of the Board or, in the Board s sole discretion, by the Board. The Compensation
Committee will have the authority to, among other things, (i) construe and interpret the Plan and apply its provisions; (ii) promulgate,
amend, and rescind rules and regulations relating to the administration of the Plan; (iii) delegate its authority to one or more persons
who is an officer of the Company within the meaning of Section 16 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the Exchange
Act ), and the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder with respect to SARs that do not involve insiders within
the meaning of Section 16 of the Exchange Act; (iv) determine when SARs are to be granted under the Plan and the applicable grant date;
(v) prescribe the terms and conditions of each SAR, including, without limitation, the exercise price and medium of payment and vesting
provisions, and to specify the provisions of the SAR Agreement relating to such grant; (vi) amend any outstanding SARs, subject, in certain
cases, to the participant s consent; and (vii) make all other determinations which may be necessary or advisable for the administration
of the Plan. 

Eligible
Participants 

SARS
may be granted only to persons who are Service Providers, and those persons whom the Committee determines are reasonably expected to
become Service Providers following the grant date. The Committee may from time to time designate those Service Providers, if any, to
be granted SARs under the Plan, the number of SARs which will be granted to each such person, and any other terms or conditions relating
to SARs as it may deem appropriate to the extent consistent with the provisions of the Plan. A participant who has been granted a SAR
may, if otherwise eligible, be granted additional incentive awards at any time. 

Grant .
The Committee may grant SARs to any Service Provider. A SAR is the right to receive an amount equal to the Spread with respect to a share
of the Company s common stock upon the exercise of the SAR. The Spread is the difference between the exercise price
per share specified in a SAR agreement on the date of grant and the fair market value per share on the date of exercise of the SAR. 

General
Provisions . The terms and conditions of each SAR will be evidenced by a SAR agreement. The exercise price per share will not be less
than 100 of the fair market value of a Share on the date of grant of the SAR. The term of the SAR will be determined by the Committee
but may not be greater than ten years from the date of grant. 

44 

Exercise .
SARs are exercisable subject to such terms and conditions as the Committee may specify in the SAR agreement for the SAR. A SAR may be
exercised by the delivery of a signed written notice of exercise to the Company, which must be received and accepted by the Company as
of a date set by the Company in advance of the effective date of the proposed exercise. The notice must set forth the number of SARs
being exercised, together with any additional documents the Company may require. 

Settlement .
Upon exercise of a SAR, the Grantee will receive an amount equal to the Spread. The Spread, less applicable withholdings, will be payable
only in cash. In no event may any SAR be settled in any manner other than by delivery of a cash payment from the Company. 

Form
of SAR Agreement 

Each
participant to whom a SAR is granted will be required to enter into a SAR agreement with the Company, in such a form as is provided by
the Committee. The SAR agreement will contain specific terms as determined by the Committee, in its discretion, with respect to the participant s
particular SAR. Such terms need not be uniform among all participants or any similarly situated participants. The SAR agreement may include,
without limitation, vesting, forfeiture and other provisions particular to the particular participant s SAR, as well as, for example,
provisions to the effect that the participant must abide by all the terms and conditions of the Plan and such other terms and conditions
as may be imposed by the Committee. A SAR will include such terms and conditions as are determined by the Committee, in its discretion,
to be appropriate with respect to any participant. 

The
Committee may specify in a SAR agreement that the participant s rights, payments, and benefits with respect to a SAR will be subject
to forfeiture upon the occurrence of certain specified events, in addition to any otherwise applicable vesting or performance conditions
of the incentive award. Such events may include, but are not limited to, termination with cause or other conduct by the participant that
is detrimental to the business or reputation of the Company. 

Termination
of Employment 

Unless
otherwise expressly provided in the participant s SAR agreement, if the participant s employment is terminated for any reason
other than due to cause, death or disability, any non-vested portion of any outstanding SAR at the time of such termination will automatically
expire and terminate and no further vesting will occur after the termination date. In such event, except as otherwise expressly provided
in the SAR agreement, the participant will be entitled to exercise such participant s rights only with respect to the portion of
the SAR that was vested as of the termination date for a period that will end on the earlier of (i) the expiration date set forth in
the SAR agreement or (ii) ninety days after the date of termination. 

Termination
for Cause 

Unless
otherwise expressly provided in the participant s SAR agreement, in the event of the termination of a participant s employment
for cause, all vested and non-vested SARs granted to such participant will immediately expire, and will not be exercisable to any extent. 

Disability
or Death 

Unless
otherwise expressly provided in the participant s SAR agreement, upon termination of employment as a result of the participant s
disability or death, (i) any non-vested portion of any outstanding SAR will immediately terminate upon termination and no further vesting
will occur, and (ii) any vested SAR will expire on the earlier of either (A) the expiration date set forth in the SAR agreement or (B)
12 months following the participant s termination of employment. 

Continuation 

Subject
to the conditions and limitations of the Plan and applicable law, in the event that a participant ceases to be an employee, outside director
or consultant, as applicable, for whatever reason, the Committee and participant may mutually agree with respect to any outstanding SAR
then held by the participant (i) for an acceleration or other adjustment in any vesting schedule applicable to the SAR award; (ii) for
a continuation of the exercise period following termination for a longer period than is otherwise provided under such SAR; or (iii) to
any other change in the terms and conditions of the SAR. In the event of any such change to an outstanding SAR, a written amendment to
the participant s SAR agreement will be required. No amendment to a participant s SAR will be made to the extent compensation
payable pursuant thereto as a result of such amendment would be considered deferred compensation that is not excepted from taxation or
penalties under Code Section 409A, unless otherwise determined by the Committee. 

45 

SARs
granted under the Plan are not transferable other than to a designated beneficiary upon the Participant s death or by will or the
laws of descent and distribution. 

Change
in Control 

Unless
otherwise provided in a SAR Agreement, notwithstanding any contrary provision in the Plan, in the event of a Change in Control (as defined
in the Plan), all outstanding SARs will become 100 vested and immediately exercisable. 

Amendment 

The
Board at any time, and from time to time, may amend or terminate the Plan. The Committee at any time, and from time to time, may amend
the terms of any one or more SAR agreements, except that the Committee may not affect any amendment which would otherwise constitute
an impairment of the rights under any SAR unless the participant consents in writing. 

As
of March 29, 2023, there were 991,631 SARs outstanding under the 2020 Plan. 

Director
Compensation 

We
believe that a combination of cash and equity compensation is appropriate to attract and retain the individuals we desire to serve on
our Board of Directors. Our cash compensation policies are designed to encourage frequent and active interaction between directors and
our executives both during and between formal meetings as well as compensate our directors for their time and effort. Further, we believe
it is important to align the long-term interests of our non-employee directors (i.e., directors who are not employed by us as officers
or employees) with those of the Company and its stockholders, and that awarding equity compensation to, and thereby increasing ownership
of our common stock by, our non-employee directors is an appropriate means to achieve this alignment. Directors who are also employees
of our company do not receive compensation for their service on our Board of Directors. 

Under
our director compensation program for 2022, each non-employee director received annual compensation of 30,000, and an option to purchase
14,000 shares of our common stock, which is fully vested. All cash fees are paid quarterly. Also, each non-employee director may be reimbursed
for his reasonable expenses incurred in the performance of his duties as a director as our Board of Directors determines from time to
time. Our Compensation Committee intends to evaluate our director compensation program and determine whether any changes should be recommended
to the Board. 

The
following table sets forth certain information concerning the compensation paid to non-employee directors in 2022 for their services
as directors of the Company. The compensation of Mr. Brunsberg, who serves as a director and our President and Chief Executive
Officer, is described in the Summary Compensation Table of Executive Officers. Our non-employee directors do not receive fringe or
other benefits.

12. SECURITY OWNERSHIP OF CERTAIN BENEFICIAL OWNERS AND MANAGEMENT AND RELATED STOCKHOLDER MATTERS 

The
following table sets forth certain information regarding beneficial ownership of our common stock as of March 29, 2023 (a) by each person
known by us to own beneficially 5 or more of any class of our common stock, (b) by our named executive officers and each of our directors
(and director nominees) and (c) by all executive officers and directors of the Company as a group. 

The
number of shares beneficially owned by each stockholder is determined in accordance with SEC rules. Under these rules, beneficial ownership
includes any shares as to which a person has sole or shared voting power or investment power. Percentage ownership is based on 10,772,713
shares of our common stock outstanding on March 29, 2023. In computing the number of shares beneficially owned by a person and the percentage
ownership of that person, shares of common stock subject to stock options, warrants or other rights held by such person that are currently
convertible or exercisable or will become convertible or exercisable within 60 days of March 29, 2023 are considered outstanding, although
these shares are not considered outstanding for purposes of computing the percentage ownership of any other person. 

We
believe, based on information provided to us, that each of the stockholders listed below has sole voting and investment power with respect
to the shares beneficially owned by the stockholder unless noted otherwise, subject to community property laws where applicable.

On March 15, 2013, the Company s Board of Directors approved the Company s 2013 Equity Incentive Plan. The 2013 Equity
Incentive Plan was approved by our stockholders on October 10, 2013. On August 9, 2022, an amendment to our 2013 Equity Incentive
Plan was approved by our stockholders to increase the number of shares of our common stock subject to the 2013 Equity Incentive Plan
to 2,265,000. The Plan automatically expired on March 15, 2023, which was the tenth anniversary of the adoption of the Plan by
the Company s Board of Directors. 

(2)
On June 23, 2020, our Board of Directors adopted the Sigma Labs, Inc. 2020 Stock Appreciation Rights Plan (the Plan ). The
purposes of the Plan are to: (i) enable the Company to attract and retain the types of employees, consultants, and directors who will
contribute to the Company s long-range success; (ii) provide incentives that align the interests of Service Providers with those
of the shareholders of the Company; and (iii) promote the success of the Company s business. The Plan only provides for incentive
awards in the form of stock appreciation rights payable in cash SARs ). No shares of common stock are reserved in connection
with the adoption of the Plan since no shares will be issued pursuant to the Plan. As of December 31, 2022, the Company had awarded 1,157,787
SARs pursuant to the Plan. 

(3)
On December 3, 2019, in conjunction with the hiring of Mark K. Ruport, the Company s former President and Chief Executive Officer,

an exercise price of 11.20, which fully vested and became exercisable on December 3, 2022. In accordance with Nasdaq Listing Rule 5635(c)(4),

reviewing and approving any such transactions, our Audit Committee is tasked to consider all relevant facts and circumstances, including,

The
Audit Committee s pre-approval policies and procedures and other protocols are discussed in its written charter which can be found
at www.sigmaadditive.com under the tab Investors. Before our independent registered public accounting firm is engaged by
the Company to render audit or non-audit services, the Audit Committee must pre-approve the engagement. Audit Committee pre-approval
of audit and non-audit services are not required if the engagement for the services is entered into pursuant to pre-approval policies
and procedures established by the Audit Committee regarding the Company s engagement of the independent registered public accounting
firm, provided the policies and procedures are detailed as to the particular service, the Audit Committee is informed of each service
provided and such policies and procedures do not include delegation of the Audit Committee s responsibilities under the Exchange
Act to the Company s management. The Audit Committee may delegate to one or more designated members of the Audit Committee the
authority to grant pre-approvals. If the Audit Committee elects to establish pre-approval policies and procedures regarding non-audit
services, the Audit Committee must be informed of each non-audit service provided by the independent registered public accounting firm.
Audit Committee pre-approval of non-audit services (other than review and attestation services) also will not be required if such services
fall within available exceptions established by the SEC. The Audit Committee may not engage the independent registered public accounting
firm to perform non-audit services prohibited by law or regulation. On an annual basis, our management reports to the Audit Committee
all audit services performed during the previous 12 months and all fees billed by our independent registered public accounting firm for
such services.

REPORT
OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM 

 To
the Board of Directors and 

 Stockholders of Sigma Additive Solutions, Inc. (formerly Sigma Labs, Inc.) 

Opinion
on the Financial Statements 

We
have audited the accompanying balance sheets of Sigma Additive Solutions, Inc. (the Company) as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, and the
related statements of operations, stockholders equity, and cash flows for each of the years in the two-year period ended December
31, 2022, and the related notes (collectively referred to as the financial statements). In our opinion, the financial statements present
fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, and the results of its operations
and its cash flows for each of the years in the two-year period ended December 31, 2022, in conformity with accounting principles generally
accepted in the United States of America. 

Consideration
of the Company s Ability to Continue as a Going Concern 

The
accompanying financial statements have been prepared assuming the Company will continue as a going concern. As discussed in Note 1 to
the financial statements, the company has sustained recurring losses and negative cash flows from operations since inception. The Company
will require additional funding in the public or private markets to continue operations for the next year. These factors raise substantial
doubt about its ability to continue as a going concern. Management s plans in regard to these matters are also described in Note
1. The financial statements do not include any adjustments that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty. 

Basis
for Opinion 

These
financial statements are the responsibility of the Company s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company s
financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board
(United States) (PCAOB) and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities
laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. 

We
conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain
reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. The Company
is not required to have, nor were we engaged to perform, an audit of its internal control over financial reporting. As part of our audits,
we are required to obtain an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion
on the effectiveness of the Company s internal control over financial reporting. Accordingly, we express no such opinion. 

Our
audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error
or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding
the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant
estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe that our audits
provide a reasonable basis for our opinion. 

Critical
Audit Matters 

The
critical audit matters communicated below are matters arising from the current period audit of the financial statements that were communicated
or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that: (1) relate to accounts or disclosures that are material to the financial
statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of critical audit matters
does not alter in any way our opinion on the financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit
matters below, providing separate opinions on the critical audit matters or on the accounts or disclosures to which they relate. 

F- 2 

Revenue
Recognition Multiple Deliverables in Revenue Contracts 

Description
of the Matter : 

As
discussed in Note 1 to the financial statements, Sigma Additive Solutions, Inc. s revenue is derived primarily from the sale of
software, the related hardware suite, and engineering services. The Company s contracts with customers typically include the promise
to transfer multiple goods and/or services to the customer. Management must assess whether each promised good or service is distinct
for the purpose of identifying the performance obligations within the contract and must then determine and allocate the transaction price
to the performance obligations. This assessment can be subjective and requires management to make judgments about the individual promised
goods or services and whether such goods or services are separable and distinct from the other aspects of the contractual relationship. 

Auditing
management s assessment and recognition of revenue can be complex, involves judgment, and is based on a thorough understanding
of the Company s offerings. 

How
we Addressed the Matter in Our Audit : 

We
obtained a thorough understanding of the controls the Company has in place to perform this assessment including walk-throughs of the
key controls and analysis of the design and operating effectiveness of these controls. To evaluate Sigma Additive Solutions, Inc. s
assessment of performance obligations and allocation of price, our audit procedures included, among others, reading and evaluating management s
assumptions used to determine the distinct performance obligations and price allocations. We compared the stand-alone price for each
performance obligation to the allocated prices to ensure the allocation was reasonable. We also obtained confirmations from customers
verifying the terms of the contracts.

per share, resulting in net proceeds of approximately after deducting underwriting discounts and commissions and other offering
expenses payable by the Company. In March 2021, the Company closed a public offering of its securities in which it issued shares
of common stock at per share, resulting in net proceeds to the Company of approximately after deducting placement agent
commissions and other offering costs payable by the Company. During the first quarter of 2021, the Company issued shares of common
stock pursuant to the exercise of warrants, resulting in net proceeds to the Company of . 

The
continuing operations of the Company are no longer solely dependent upon financing the cost of product development in the absence of
revenues, but rather upon our abilities to finance our efforts to successfully ramp up commercialization, thus earning the product validation
of both customer licensing and purchases and creating a dynamic in which public and private offerings facilitate the growth of revenues. 

The
Company currently has sufficient cash and working capital to fund operations through May 2023 and will require additional funding in
the public or private markets in the near-term to be able to continue operations. The Company currently has no understanding or
agreement to obtain such funding, and there is no assurance that we will be successful in obtaining additional funding. If we fail
to obtain sufficient funding when needed, we will be forced to delay, scale back or eliminate all or a portion of our
commercialization efforts and operations. As a result, there is substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern.

Pursuant
to ASC 815.40.25.10, such warrants were accounted for as a derivative liability because the Company did not have sufficient authorized
and unissued shares of common stock available to settle the warrants at the issue date. On May 24, 2021, upon receiving stockholder approval
to increase its authorized common shares, the Company reclassified the warrant liability to equity pursuant to ASC 815.40.35.8.

The

before the end of the lease term. For leases with 36-month terms, the lessee may terminate the agreement after the first 18 months with
30-days written notice. Some, but not all, of the leases permit lessees to purchase the equipment at any time at an amount that approximates
fair value and are not reasonably certain to be exercised at the inception of the lease. There are no anticipated variable lease payments
at the inception of the lease. 

There
are two non-lease components in the arrangement that consist of technical support and maintenance, and installation and training. The
Company has elected the single component practical expedient to combine the technical support and maintenance with the lease as they
have the same pattern of transfer. The installation and training component does not have the same pattern of transfer; therefore, this
component is not eligible for the single component practical expedient. The consideration has been allocated on a relative fair value
basis of the underlying lease and non-lease components. The Company has estimated the residual value of the leased equipment based on
its useful life, and the ability to refurbish and sell the equipment, as well as the Company s ability to componentize the hardware

of which have been issued under the 2013 Plan. At December 31, 2021, there are vested options exercisable for shares of common
stock. Options to purchase shares of common stock were exercised during the year ended December 31, 2021. 

The
Company generally grants stock options to employees, consultants and directors at exercise prices equal to the fair market value of the
Company s stock on the dates of grant. Stock options are typically granted throughout the year and generally vest over three years
of service and expire five years from the date of the award, unless otherwise specified. The Company recognizes compensation expense
for the fair value of the stock options over the requisite service period for each stock option award. 

Total
employee share-based compensation expense for the year ended December 31, 2022, was 
all of which is related to stock options. Total employee share-based compensation for 2021 totaled , of which is
related to stock options. There was no capitalized share-based compensation cost as of December 31, 2022 or 2021, and there were no
recognized tax benefits during the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021. 

To
estimate the value of an award, the Company uses the Black-Scholes option-pricing model. This model requires inputs such as expected
life, expected volatility and risk-free interest rate. The forfeiture rate also impacts the amount of aggregate compensation. These inputs
are subjective and generally require significant analysis and judgment to develop. While estimates of expected life, volatility and forfeiture
rate are derived primarily from the Company s historical data, the risk-free rate is based on the yield available on U.S. Treasury
constant maturity rates with similar terms to the expected term of the stock option awards. The fair value of share-based awards was
estimated using the Black-Scholes model with the following weighted-average assumptions for the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021: 

Risk-free interest rate 
 -

The
aggregate intrinsic value is calculated as the difference between the exercise price of the underlying awards and the quoted price of
our common stock for those awards that have an exercise price below the closing price of our Common Stock on December
31, 2022. All of the 2022 option grants have an exercise price above .

common stock Share upon the exercise of the SAR. The Spread is the difference between the exercise price
per share specified in a SAR agreement on the date of grant and the fair market value per share on the date of exercise of the SAR. The
exercise price per share will not be less than 100 of the fair market value of a Share on the date of grant of the SAR. The administrator
of the Plan will have the authority to, among other things, prescribe the terms and conditions of each SAR, including, without limitation,
the exercise price and medium of payment and vesting provisions, and to specify the provisions of the SAR Agreement relating to such

years through 2038, and the remainder of the losses, which total can be carried forward indefinitely. However, if
certain substantial changes in the Company s ownership should occur, there could be an annual limitation on the amount of net
operating loss carryforward which can be utilized. The amount of and ultimate realization of the benefits from the operating loss
carryforwards for income tax purposes is dependent, in part, upon the tax laws in effect, the future earnings of the Company and
other future events, the effects of which cannot be determined. Because of the uncertainty surrounding the realization of the loss
carryforwards, the Company has established a valuation allowance equal to the tax effect of the loss carryforwards and other
temporary differences of approximately 
and at December
31, 2022 and 2021, respectively, and, therefore, no deferred tax asset has been recognized for the loss carryforwards.

owned by the Holder together with any Affiliates and Attribution Parties) and of which portion of this Warrant is exercisable, in each
case subject to the Beneficial Ownership Limitation, and the Company shall have no obligation to verify or confirm the accuracy of such
determination. In addition, a determination as to any group status as contemplated above shall be determined in accordance with Section
13(d) of the Exchange Act and the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder. For purposes of this Section 1(e), in determining the
number of outstanding shares of Common Stock, a Holder may rely on the number of outstanding shares of Common Stock as reflected in (A)
the Company s most recent periodic or annual report filed with the Commission, as the case may be, (B) a more recent public announcement
by the Company or (C) a more recent written notice by the Company or the Transfer Agent setting forth the number of shares of Common
Stock outstanding. Upon the written or oral request of a Holder, the Company shall within two Trading Days confirm orally and in writing
to the Holder the number of shares of Common Stock then outstanding. In any case, the number of outstanding shares of Common Stock shall
be determined after giving effect to the conversion or exercise of securities of the Company, including this Warrant, by the Holder or
its Affiliates or Attribution Parties since the date as of which such number of outstanding shares of Common Stock was reported. The
 Beneficial Ownership Limitation shall be 4.99 of the number of shares of the Common Stock outstanding immediately
after giving effect to the issuance of shares of Common Stock issuable upon exercise of this Warrant. The Holder, upon notice to the
Company, may increase or decrease the Beneficial Ownership Limitation provisions of this Section 1(e), provided that the Beneficial Ownership
Limitation in no event exceeds 9.99 of the number of shares of the Common Stock outstanding immediately after giving effect to the issuance
of shares of Common Stock upon exercise of this Warrant held by the Holder and the provisions of this Section 1(e) shall continue to
apply. Any increase in the Beneficial Ownership Limitation will not be effective until the 61 st day after such notice is delivered
to the Company. The provisions of this paragraph shall be construed and implemented in a manner otherwise than in strict conformity with
the terms of this Section 1(e) to correct this paragraph (or any portion hereof) which may be defective or inconsistent with the intended
Beneficial Ownership Limitation herein contained or to make changes or supplements necessary or desirable to properly give effect to
such limitation. The limitations contained in this paragraph shall apply to a successor holder of this Warrant. 

Section
2 . Certain Adjustments . 

a) Stock
 Dividends and Splits . If the Company, at any time while this Warrant is outstanding:
 (i) pays a stock dividend or otherwise makes a distribution or distributions on shares of
 its Common Stock (which, for avoidance of doubt, shall not include any shares of Common Stock
 issued by the Company upon exercise of this Warrant), (ii) subdivides outstanding shares
 of Common Stock into a larger number of shares, (iii) combines (including by way of reverse
 stock split) outstanding shares of Common Stock into a smaller number of shares, or (iv)
 issues by reclassification of shares of the Common Stock any shares of capital stock of the
 Company, then in each case the Exercise Price shall be multiplied by a fraction of which
 the numerator shall be the number of shares of Common Stock (excluding treasury shares, if
 any) outstanding immediately before such event and of which the denominator shall be the
 number of shares of Common Stock outstanding immediately after such event, and the number
 of shares issuable upon exercise of this Warrant shall be proportionately adjusted such that
 the aggregate Exercise Price of this Warrant shall remain unchanged. Any adjustment made
 pursuant to this Section 2(a) shall become effective immediately after the record date for
 the determination of stockholders entitled to receive such dividend or distribution and shall
 become effective immediately after the effective date in the case of a subdivision, combination
 or re-classification. 

b) Adjustment
 for Reclassification, Exchange and Substitution . If the Common Stock is changed into
 the same or a different number of shares of any class or classes of capital stock, whether
 by recapitalization, reclassification or otherwise (other than a subdivision or combination
 of shares or stock dividend or a reorganization, merger, consolidation or sale of assets
 provided for elsewhere in this Section 2), then and in such event the Holder shall have the
 right thereafter, upon exercise of this Warrant to receive the kind and amount of stock and
 other securities and property receivable upon such reorganization or other change in an amount
 equal to the amount that the Holder would have been entitled to have had it immediately prior
 to such reorganization, reclassification or change exercised this Warrant, but only to the
 extent this Warrant is actually exercised, all subject to further adjustment as provided
 herein. 

c) Reorganization,
 Mergers, Consolidations or Sales of Assets . If at any time or from time to time there
 is a capital reorganization of the Common Stock (other than a recapitalization, subdivision,
 combination, reclassification or exchange of the Common Stock provided for elsewhere in this
 Section 2) or merger or consolidation of the Company with or into another corporation, or
 the sale of all or substantially all of the Company s properties and assets to any other
 person, then, as a part of such reorganization, merger, consolidation or sale, provision
 shall be made so that the Holder shall thereafter be entitled to receive upon exercise of
 this Warrant (and only to the extent this Warrant is exercised), the number of shares of
 stock or other securities or property of the Company, or of the successor corporation resulting
 from such merger or consolidation or sale, to which a holder of Common Stock or other securities
 deliverable upon the exercise of this Warrant would otherwise have been entitled on such
 capital reorganization, merger, consolidation or sale. In any such case, appropriate adjustments
 shall be made in the application of the provisions of this Section 2 (including adjustment
 of the Exercise Price then in effect and number of shares purchasable upon exercise of this
 Warrant) which shall be applicable after such events; provided, however, that any such adjustments
 shall be made so as to ensure that the provisions of this Section 2 applicable after such
 events shall, to the extent practicable, be equivalent to the provisions of this Section
 2 applicable before such events. 

d) Calculations .
 All calculations under this Section 2 shall be made to the nearest cent or the nearest 1/100th
 of a share, as the case may be. For purposes of this Section 2, the number of shares of Common
 Stock deemed to be issued and outstanding as of a given date shall be the number of shares
 of Common Stock (excluding treasury shares, if any) issued and outstanding. 

e) Notice
 to Holder . 

i.
 Adjustment to Exercise Price . Whenever the Exercise Price is adjusted pursuant this Section 2, the Company shall promptly deliver
to the Holder by facsimile or email a notice setting forth the Exercise Price after such adjustment and any resulting adjustment to the
number of Warrant Shares and setting forth a brief statement of the facts requiring such adjustment. 

ii.
 Notice to Allow Exercise by Holder . If (A) the Company shall declare a dividend (or any other distribution in whatever form) on
the Common Stock, (B) the Company shall authorize the granting to all holders of the Common Stock rights or warrants to subscribe for
or purchase any shares of capital stock of any class or of any rights, (C) the approval of any stockholders of the Company shall be required
in connection with any reclassification of the Common Stock, any consolidation or merger to which the Company is a party, any sale or
transfer of all or substantially all of the assets of the Company, or any compulsory share exchange whereby the Common Stock is converted
into other securities, cash or property, or (D) the Company shall authorize the voluntary or involuntary dissolution, liquidation or
winding up of the affairs of the Company, then, in each case, the Company shall cause to be delivered by facsimile or email to the Holder
at its last facsimile number or email address as it shall appear upon the Warrant Register of the Company, at least 20 calendar days
prior to the applicable record or effective date hereinafter specified, a notice stating (x) the date on which a record is to be taken
for the purpose of such dividend, distribution, redemption, rights or warrants, or if a record is not to be taken, the date as of which
the holders of the Common Stock of record to be entitled to such dividend, distributions, redemption, rights or warrants are to be determined
or (y) the date on which such reclassification, consolidation, merger, sale, transfer or share exchange is expected to become effective
or close, and the date as of which it is expected that holders of the Common Stock of record shall be entitled to exchange their shares
of the Common Stock for securities, cash or other property deliverable upon such reclassification, consolidation, merger, sale, transfer
or share exchange; provided that the failure to deliver such notice or any defect therein or in the delivery thereof shall not affect
the validity of the corporate action required to be specified in such notice. 

Section
3 . Transfer of Warrant . 

a)
 New Warrants . This Warrant may be divided or combined with other Warrants upon presentation hereof at the aforesaid office of
the Company, together with a written notice specifying the names and denominations in which new Warrants are to be issued, signed by

or combination, the Company shall execute and deliver a new Warrant or Warrants in exchange for the Warrant or Warrants to be divided
or combined in accordance with such notice. All Warrants issued on transfers or exchanges shall be dated the initial issuance date of
this Warrant and shall be identical with this Warrant except as to the number of Warrant Shares issuable pursuant thereto. 

b)
 Warrant Register . The Company shall register this Warrant, upon records to be maintained by the Company for that purpose (the
 Warrant Register ), in the name of the record Holder hereof from time to time. The Company may deem and treat the
registered Holder of this Warrant as the absolute owner hereof for the purpose of any exercise hereof or any distribution to the Holder,
and for all other purposes, absent actual notice to the contrary. 

c)
 Representation by the Holder. The Holder, by the acceptance hereof, represents and warrants that it is acquiring this Warrant
and, upon any exercise hereof, will acquire the Warrant Shares issuable upon such exercise, for its own account and not with a view to
or for distributing or reselling such Warrant Shares or any part thereof in violation of the Securities Act or any applicable state securities
law, except pursuant to sales registered or exempted under the Securities Act. 

Section
4 . Miscellaneous . 

a)
 No Rights as Stockholder Until Exercise . This Warrant does not entitle the Holder to any voting rights, dividends or other rights
as a stockholder of the Company prior to the exercise hereof, except as expressly set forth in Section 2. 

b)
 Loss, Theft, Destruction or Mutilation of Warrant . The Company covenants that upon receipt by the Company of evidence reasonably
satisfactory to it of the loss, theft, destruction or mutilation of this Warrant or any stock certificate relating to the Warrant Shares,
and in case of loss, theft or destruction, of indemnity or security reasonably satisfactory to it (which, in the case of the Warrant,
shall not include the posting of any bond), and upon surrender and cancellation of such Warrant or stock certificate, if mutilated, the
Company will make and deliver a new Warrant or stock certificate of like tenor and dated as of such cancellation, in lieu of such Warrant
or stock certificate. 

c)
 Saturdays, Sundays, Holidays, etc . If the last or appointed day for the taking of any action or the expiration of any right required
or granted herein shall not be a Business Day, then, such action may be taken or such right may be exercised on the next succeeding Business
Day. 

d)
 Authorized Shares . 

The
Company covenants that, during the period the Warrant is outstanding, it will reserve from its authorized and unissued Common Stock a
sufficient number of shares to provide for the issuance of the Warrant Shares upon the exercise of any purchase rights under this Warrant.
The Company further covenants that its issuance of this Warrant shall constitute full authority to its officers who are charged with
the duty of issuing the necessary Warrant Shares upon the exercise of the purchase rights under this Warrant. The Company will take all
such reasonable action as may be necessary to assure that such Warrant Shares may be issued as provided herein without violation of any
applicable law or regulation, or of any requirements of the Trading Market upon which the Common Stock may be listed. The Company covenants
that all Warrant Shares which may be issued upon the exercise of the purchase rights represented by this Warrant will, upon exercise
of the purchase rights represented by this Warrant and payment for such Warrant Shares in accordance herewith, be duly authorized, validly
issued, fully paid and non-assessable and free from all taxes, liens and charges created by the Company in respect of the issue thereof
(other than taxes in respect of any transfer occurring contemporaneously with such issue). 

Except
and to the extent as waived or consented to by the Holder, the Company shall not by any action, including, without limitation, amending
its articles of incorporation or through any reorganization, transfer of assets, consolidation, merger, dissolution, issue or sale of
securities or any other voluntary action, avoid or seek to avoid the observance or performance of any of the terms of this Warrant, but
will at all times in good faith assist in the carrying out of all such terms and in the taking of all such actions as may be necessary
or appropriate to protect the rights of Holder as set forth in this Warrant against impairment. Without limiting the generality of the
foregoing, the Company will (i) not increase the par value of any Warrant Shares above the amount payable therefor upon such exercise
immediately prior to such increase in par value, (ii) take all such action as may be necessary or appropriate in order that the Company
may validly and legally issue fully paid and non-assessable Warrant Shares upon the exercise of this Warrant and (iii) use commercially
reasonable efforts to obtain all such authorizations, exemptions or consents from any public regulatory body having jurisdiction thereof,
as may be, necessary to enable the Company to perform its obligations under this Warrant. 

e)
 Governing Law . This Warrant shall be governed by and construed and enforced in accordance with the laws of the State of Nevada,
without giving effect to its conflicts of law principles. 

f)
 Restrictions . The Holder acknowledges that the Warrant Shares acquired upon the exercise of this Warrant will have restrictions
upon resale imposed by state and federal securities laws. 

g)
 Nonwaiver and Expenses . No course of dealing or any delay or failure to exercise any right hereunder on the part of Holder shall
operate as a waiver of such right or otherwise prejudice the Holder s rights, powers or remedies. Without limiting any other provision
of this Warrant, if the Company willfully and knowingly fails to comply with any provision of this Warrant, which results in any material
damages to the Holder, the Company shall pay to the Holder such amounts as shall be sufficient to cover any costs and expenses including,
but not limited to, reasonable attorneys fees, including those of appellate proceedings, incurred by the Holder in collecting
any amounts due pursuant hereto or in otherwise enforcing any of its rights, powers or remedies hereunder. 

h)

with reference to the following:

A. The
Company believes that it is in the best interests of the Company to foster the continuous employment of key management personnel such
as the Executive. 

B. The
Company and the Executive desire to enter into this Agreement to induce the Executive to continue his employment with the Company during
the Retention Period (as defined below) and any period in which the Company may be engaged in negotiations regarding a Change in Control
(as defined below) and during the two-year period following a Change in Control. 

C. This
Agreement is entered into in connection with and as part of the retention bonus plan and change in control plan adopted by the Board
of Directors of the Company on July 1, 2022 (the Effective Date and reported on Form 8-K filed by the Company with
the Securities and Exchange Commission on July 8, 2022. 

NOW,
THEREFORE, in consideration of the foregoing and other good and valuable consideration, the receipt and sufficiency of which hereby are
acknowledged, the Company and the Executive hereby agree as follows: 

ARTICLE
1 

 DEFINITIONS 

For
purposes of this Agreement, each of the following terms defined in this Article 1 shall have its defined meaning wherever used in this
Agreement.

herein. 

1.2 Cause .
 Cause means (i) the Executive s conviction of a felony that is injurious to the business of the Company, (ii) the
Executive s willful and continued failure to perform his Employment duties, (iii) the Executive s willful misconduct that
is injurious to the business of the Company, or (iv) the Executive s willful violation of any material provision of any employment
policy of the Company; provided, however, that the Executive s inability to perform his or her duties because of a Disability shall
not constitute a basis for the Company s termination of the Executive s Employment for Cause. Notwithstanding the foregoing,
the Executive s Employment shall not be subject to termination for Cause without (w) the Company s delivery to the Executive
of a notice of intention to terminate, such notice to describe the reasons for the proposed Employment termination and to be delivered
to the Executive at least ten days prior to the actual termination date, (x) an opportunity for the Executive within the period prior
to the proposed Employment termination to cure any such breach (if curable) giving rise to the proposed termination, and (y) an opportunity
for the Executive, if he chooses, to be heard before the Board of Directors of the Company.

1.5 Continuous Service. Continuous Service means that the Participant s
service with the Company or an Affiliate, as an Employee, Consultant or Director, is not interrupted or terminated. The Participant s
Continuous Service shall not be deemed to have terminated merely because of a change in the capacity in which the Participant renders
service to the Company as an Employee, Consultant or Director, provided that there is no interruption or termination of the Participant s
Continuous Service; provided further that if any Award is subject to Section 409A of the Code, this sentence shall only be given effect
to the extent consistent with Section 409A of the Code. For example, a change in status from an Employee of the Company to solely a Director
will not constitute an interruption of Continuous Service. The Committee or its delegate, in its sole discretion, may determine whether
Continuous Service shall be considered interrupted in the case of any leave of absence approved by that party, including sick leave,
military leave or any other personal or family leave of absence. The Committee or its delegate, in its sole discretion, may determine
whether a Company transaction, such as a sale or spin-off of a division or subsidiary that employs a Participant, shall be deemed to
result in a termination of Continuous Service for purposes of affected Awards, and such decision shall be final, conclusive, and binding.

 Disability . Disability means a physical or mental disability of the Executive, as certified in a written
statement from a licensed physician selected or approved by the Executive Committee, that results in the Executive being unable to perform

days or (ii) 180 days (regardless of whether such days are consecutive) during any period of 365 consecutive days. 

1.7
 Employment . Employment means the Executive s employment in any capacity with the Company. 

1.8 Exchange
Act . Exchange Act means the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended. 

1.9 Good
Reason . Good Reason means the occurrence after a Change in Control of any of the following actions by the Company,
unless the Executive, in his discretion, consents thereto in writing or the action by the Company is reversed or abandoned within 30
days after the Company receives from the Executive written notice of the Executive s objection to the action: (i) a reduction in
the Executive s annual base salary as in effect on the date immediately prior to the Change in Control or a failure to make any
scheduled base salary payment within fifteen days after its due date, unless the Company s Board of Directors determines in good
faith that such base salary reduction is more than offset by the aggregate value of any new compensation plans or other Employment-related
benefits that are provided to the Executive after the Change in Control; (ii) the Company s requirement that the Executive perform
his Employment duties at an office that is more than 25 miles from the Company s office at which the Executive was principally
employed on the date immediately prior to the Change in Control; (iii) a change or diminution in Executive s employment duties
that is materially inconsistent with the duties usually associated with the office of the Chief Financial Officer of a corporation; or
(iv) a failure by the Company to continue for the benefit of the Executive any material compensation plan in which the Executive participated
on the date immediately prior to the Change in Control, unless the discontinuation of such plan was outside the Company s reasonable
control or unless the Company discontinues such plan for all of its executive officers. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Good Reason for
the Executive to terminate his Employment shall not exist by reason of any of the Company s actions described in the preceding
sentence if the action is preceded by a written notice from the Company of an intention to terminate the Executive s Employment
for Cause or because of the Executive s Disability and is then followed by a termination of Employment for Cause or Disability.]

to the Executive s remaining in our Continuous Service through such date), unless earlier vested in connection with a Change in
Control of the Company as provided therein. 

1.12 Securities
Act . Securities Act means the Securities Act of 1933, as amended.

as the case may be.

ARTICLE

 RETENTION
BONUS 

2.1 Right
to a Retention Bonus . The Company previously granted the Executive the SARs. The Executive shall be entitled to receive the cash
component of the Retention Bonus in the amount specified in Section 2.2 if, but only if: 

(a) The
Executive remains in the Continuous Service of the Company as of the expiration of the Retention Period or the earlier occurrence of
a Change in Control. 

2.2 Amount
of the Retention Bonus . If the Executive becomes entitled thereto as provided in Section 2.1, the cash component of the Retention
Bonus shall be 187,500 i.e ., 75 of the Executive s base annual salary in effect on the Effective Date); provided, however,
that in the event of a Change in Control prior to the expiration of the Retention Period the cash component of the Retention Bonus shall
be a pro rata portion of 375,000 (i.e., 150 of the Executive s base annual salary on the Effective Date), determined based on
the ratio that the number of days between the Effective Date and the occurrence of the Change in Control bears to the number of days
between the Effective Date and the expiration of the Retention Period. 

3 

2.3 Payment
of the Retention Bonus . The cash component of the Retention Bonus to which the Executive becomes entitled pursuant to Section
2.2 shall be paid within ten days following the expiration of the relevant Retention Period or upon a Change in Control, as applicable. 

2.4 Withholding
of Taxes . The Company may withhold from the cash component of the Retention Bonus all federal, state, local, FICA, Medicaid and
similar taxes required by applicable law to be withheld by the Company. Notwithstanding any action the Company takes with respect to
any or all income tax, social insurance, payroll tax, or other tax-related withholding, the ultimate liability for all Tax-Related Items
is and remains the Participant s responsibility.

PAYMENT 

3.1 Right
to a Severance Payment . In addition to the Retention Bonus to which the Executive is entitled under Section 2.1, the Executive
shall be entitled to receive a Severance Payment in the amount specified in Section 3.3 if, but only if: 

(a) A
Change in Control occurs; 

(b) The
Executive is an employee of the Company immediately prior to the Change in Control; and 

(c) (i)
The Executive s Employment is terminated Without Cause within two years after the Change of Control or (ii) the Executive terminates
his Employment for Good Reason after the Change in Control and within 60 days after the occurrence of the fact or event that permitted
the Executive to terminate his Employment for Good Reason. 

3.2 Notice
of Termination . Any purported termination of the Executive s Employment after the occurrence of a Change in Control for
Cause or Good Reason or because of the Executive s Disability shall be communicated to the other party by written notice of termination.
The notice (i) shall be given at least 15 days prior to the Employment termination date, (ii) shall specify the Employment termination
date (which shall not be more than thirty days after the delivery of the notice), and (iii) shall set forth in reasonable detail the
facts claimed to provide a basis for the Employment termination for the specified reason. 

3.3 Amount
of the Severance Payment . 

(a) If
the Executive becomes entitled to a Severance Payment under this Agreement, the amount of the Severance Payment shall equal the product
of two times the Executive s annual base salary that was in effect on the Effective Date; provided, however, that any base salary
that is excluded from gross income for federal income tax purposes pursuant to Section 125 or 401(k) of the Code and any base salary
that is deferred by the Executive pursuant to an employer-sponsored deferred compensation plan shall be included in the calculation of
the Executive s base salary for purposes of this Section 3.3(a). 

4 

(b) The
amount of the Severance Payment calculated under Section 3.3(a) above shall be reduced by the amount of base salary received between
the date of the Change in Control and the Executive s termination date, and all cash severance-type payments which the Executive
receives pursuant to any other severance plan, agreement, policy or program of the Company or any of the Company s subsidiaries.
However, if the amount of the cash severance-type payments received under such other severance plan, agreement, policy or program is
greater than the Severance Payment that is payable under this Agreement, the Executive shall be entitled to the amount payable under
such other plan, agreement, policy or program in lieu of the Severance Payment under this Agreement. The payment to the Executive of
the Retention Bonus or any amount under a stock option plan, stock incentive plan, shareholders agreement or similar agreement

be construed as a severance-type payment.

(b) As
a condition to the receipt of the Severance Payment, the Executive must execute and deliver to the Company a general release provided

3.5 Excise
Tax Limitation . Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, if the Company determines in good faith that any
portion of the Retention Bonus or Severance Payment to which the Executive is entitled would be subject to the excise tax imposed by
Section 4999 of the Code, then the Retention Bonus or Severance Payment, as the case may be, shall be reduced by the Company to the minimum
extent necessary to avoid any such excise tax. All determinations required to be made pursuant to the preceding sentence shall be made
by the Board of Directors of the Company, which shall provide supporting calculations and documentation to the Executive promptly following
his request therefor. 

3.6 Withholding
of Taxes . The Company may withhold from the Severance Payment and any other amounts payable under this Agreement all federal,
state, local, FICA, Medicaid and similar taxes required by applicable law to be withheld by the Company. Notwithstanding any action the
Company takes with respect to any or all income tax, social insurance, payroll tax, or other tax-related withholding, the ultimate liability
for all Tax-Related Items is and remains the Participant s responsibility. 

3.7 No
Mitigation Duty . The Executive shall have no duty to mitigate the amount of the Severance Payment by seeking other employment

continued group health care coverage under COBRA, any obligation on the part of the Company to provide base salary, bonuses, life and
health insurance coverage, other employee benefits, expense reimbursements and perquisites to the Executive shall terminate on the date
of the termination of the Executive s Employment, regardless of the reason that the Executive s Employment terminated. 

(b) Notwithstanding
anything to the contrary in Section 3.9(a) or in any other provision of this Agreement, upon a termination of Employment for any reason
(i) the Executive shall be entitled to receive any base salary that is accrued but unpaid as of the Employment termination date, (ii)
to the extent provided by written Company policies or by applicable law, the Executive shall be entitled to receive any bonus or vacation
pay that is accrued but unpaid as of the Employment termination date, (iii) the Executive shall be entitled to receive any compensation

as specifically provided (i) in this Agreement, (ii) in any written employment agreement or other written agreement that the Executive

agrees with the Executive s claim or (ii) an arbitrator agrees with the Executive s claim and awards the Executive the Retention
Bonus or the Severance Payment in an arbitration proceeding. All other provisions of this Article 3 shall be applicable to any Retention
Bonus and Severance Payment payments to which the Executive becomes entitled under this Section 3.14.

acknowledged, the Company and the Executive hereby agree as follows:

purposes of this Agreement, each of the following terms defined in this Article 1 shall have its defined meaning wherever used in this
Agreement.

herein.

Executive s willful and continued failure to perform his Employment duties, (iii) the Executive s willful misconduct that
is injurious to the business of the Company, or (iv) the Executive s willful violation of any material provision of any employment
policy of the Company; provided, however, that the Executive s inability to perform his or her duties because of a Disability shall
not constitute a basis for the Company s termination of the Executive s Employment for Cause. Notwithstanding the foregoing,
the Executive s Employment shall not be subject to termination for Cause without (w) the Company s delivery to the Executive
of a notice of intention to terminate, such notice to describe the reasons for the proposed Employment termination and to be delivered
to the Executive at least ten days prior to the actual termination date, (x) an opportunity for the Executive within the period prior
to the proposed Employment termination to cure any such breach (if curable) giving rise to the proposed termination, and (y) an opportunity

service to the Company as an Employee, Consultant or Director, provided that there is no interruption or termination of the Participant s
Continuous Service; provided further that if any Award is subject to Section 409A of the Code, this sentence shall only be given effect

Continuous Service shall be considered interrupted in the case of any leave of absence approved by that party, including sick leave,
military leave or any other personal or family leave of absence. The Committee or its delegate, in its sole discretion, may determine

unless the Executive, in his discretion, consents thereto in writing or the action by the Company is reversed or abandoned within 30
days after the Company receives from the Executive written notice of the Executive s objection to the action: (i) a reduction in
the Executive s annual base salary as in effect on the date immediately prior to the Change in Control or a failure to make any
scheduled base salary payment within fifteen days after its due date, unless the Company s Board of Directors determines in good
faith that such base salary reduction is more than offset by the aggregate value of any new compensation plans or other Employment-related
benefits that are provided to the Executive after the Change in Control; (ii) the Company s requirement that the Executive perform
his Employment duties at an office that is more than 25 miles from the Company s office at which the Executive was principally
employed on the date immediately prior to the Change in Control; (iii) a change or diminution in Executive s employment duties
that is materially inconsistent with the duties usually associated with the office of the Chief Financial Officer of a corporation; or
(iv) a failure by the Company to continue for the benefit of the Executive any material compensation plan in which the Executive participated
on the date immediately prior to the Change in Control, unless the discontinuation of such plan was outside the Company s reasonable
control or unless the Company discontinues such plan for all of its executive officers. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Good Reason for
the Executive to terminate his Employment shall not exist by reason of any of the Company s actions described in the preceding
sentence if the action is preceded by a written notice from the Company of an intention to terminate the Executive s Employment
for Cause or because of the Executive s Disability and is then followed by a termination of Employment for Cause or Disability.]

be a pro rata portion of 200,000 (i.e., 100 of the Executive s base annual salary on the Effective Date), determined based on

Cause or Good Reason or because of the Executive s Disability shall be communicated to the other party by written notice of termination.

receives pursuant to any other severance plan, agreement, policy or program of the Company or any of the Company s subsidiaries.
However, if the amount of the cash severance-type payments received under such other severance plan, agreement, policy or program is

such other plan, agreement, policy or program in lieu of the Severance Payment under this Agreement. The payment to the Executive of
the Retention Bonus or any amount under a stock option plan, stock incentive plan, shareholders agreement or similar agreement
in consideration for the Executive s equity ownership interest in the Company or any direct or indirect parent company shall not
be construed as a severance-type payment. 

3.4 Payment
of the Severance Payment; Release Agreement . 

(a) Subject
to the following paragraphs of this Section 3.4, the Severance Payment to which the Executive is entitled pursuant to Section 3.3 shall
be paid in a lump sum concurrently with the termination of Employment of the Executive as described in Section 3.1(c). 

(b) As
a condition to the receipt of the Severance Payment, the Executive must execute and deliver to the Company a general release provided
by the Company, to be in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to the Company, that releases the Company and its respective owners,
directors, officers, managers, employees, subsidiaries and agents from any and all claims that the Executive may have against such released
Persons, whether known or unknown, absolute or contingent, other than (i) claims under this Agreement, (ii) claims under any other written
agreement to which the Executive is a party, (iii) claims under written employee benefit plans, (iv) claims for accrued but unpaid salary,
bonuses, vacation pay and expense reimbursement obligations, and (v) claims that may not be waived or released under applicable law. 

3.5 Excise
Tax Limitation . Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, if the Company determines in good faith that any
portion of the Retention Bonus or Severance Payment to which the Executive is entitled would be subject to the excise tax imposed by
Section 4999 of the Code, then the Retention Bonus or Severance Payment, as the case may be, shall be reduced by the Company to the minimum
extent necessary to avoid any such excise tax. All determinations required to be made pursuant to the preceding sentence shall be made
by the Board of Directors of the Company, which shall provide supporting calculations and documentation to the Executive promptly following
his request therefor. 

3.6 Withholding
of Taxes . The Company may withhold from the Severance Payment and any other amounts payable under this Agreement all federal,
state, local, FICA, Medicaid and similar taxes required by applicable law to be withheld by the Company. Notwithstanding any action the
Company takes with respect to any or all income tax, social insurance, payroll tax, or other tax-related withholding, the ultimate liability
for all Tax-Related Items is and remains the Participant s responsibility. 

3.7 No
Mitigation Duty . The Executive shall have no duty to mitigate the amount of the Severance Payment by seeking other employment
or by taking any other action, and the amount of the Severance Payment shall not be reduced by any income that the Executive receives
from subsequent employment. 

5 

3.8 No
Right to Receive Base Salary, Bonuses, Benefits and Perquisites After an Employment Termination . 

(a) Except
as may otherwise be agreed to in writing between the Company and the Executive or as may be required by applicable law with respect to
continued group health care coverage under COBRA, any obligation on the part of the Company to provide base salary, bonuses, life and
health insurance coverage, other employee benefits, expense reimbursements and perquisites to the Executive shall terminate on the date
of the termination of the Executive s Employment, regardless of the reason that the Executive s Employment terminated. 

(b) Notwithstanding
anything to the contrary in Section 3.9(a) or in any other provision of this Agreement, upon a termination of Employment for any reason
(i) the Executive shall be entitled to receive any base salary that is accrued but unpaid as of the Employment termination date, (ii)
to the extent provided by written Company policies or by applicable law, the Executive shall be entitled to receive any bonus or vacation
pay that is accrued but unpaid as of the Employment termination date, (iii) the Executive shall be entitled to receive any compensation
that he previously deferred in accordance with the terms of any written deferred compensation plan maintained by the Company, and (iv)
the Executive shall remain entitled to be reimbursed for any business expenses that were properly incurred by him during the Executive s
Employment in accordance with Company policies. 

3.9 No
Payments or Benefits Prior to a Change in Control . Prior to the expiration of the Retention Period or an earlier Change in Control,
the Executive shall not be entitled to receive any Retention Bonus, Severance Payment or other payments or benefits under this Agreement.
Except as provided below in Section 3.14, the Executive shall not be entitled to receive any Retention Bonus, Severance Payment or other
payments or benefits under this Agreement if his Employment is terminated for any reason prior to the expiration of the Retention Period
or earlier Change in Control and if a Change in Control subsequently occurs. 

3.10 No
Death, Disability or Retirement Payments or Benefits Payable Under this Agreement . Except as provided in Section 2.1 with respect
to a Retention Bonus and in Section 3.8(b) with respect to accrued but unpaid salary, vacation time, bonuses and other specified accrued
items, this Agreement does not provide the Executive with a right to receive a Severance Payment or any other payments or benefits if
his Employment terminates before the expiration of the Retention Period or before or after the occurrence of a Change in Control by reason
of Disability, death, retirement or for any other reason except a termination described in Section 3.1(c). 

3.11 Benefits
Under Other Company Plans . Except as provided above in Section 3.3(b), the Severance Payment shall not reduce any amounts otherwise
payable to the Executive under, or in any way diminish any of the Executive s rights as an employee under, any written employee
benefit, retirement or incentive plan or written employment agreement to which the Executive is now, or subsequently becomes, a party
or a participant. 

3.12 At
Will Employment . Neither this Agreement nor the Retention Bonus or Severance Payment payable hereunder shall be deemed to limit,
replace or otherwise affect the at will nature of the Executive s Employment, and this Agreement shall not be construed
as an employment contract. Nothing contained in this Agreement shall be construed as creating any minimum period of Employment. Except
as specifically provided (i) in this Agreement, (ii) in any written employment agreement or other written agreement that the Executive
may enter into with the Company, or (iii) in any written employee manual, policy or benefit plan that the Company has provided to the
Executive, the Company shall have no obligation to make any compensation, severance or other payments to the Executive, or to provide
any other benefits to the Executive, after the date of the termination of the Executive s Employment for any reason. This Agreement
does not provide a pension for the Executive, nor shall any payment hereunder be characterized as deferred compensation. 

6 

3.13 Term
of this Agreement . This Agreement shall commence on the Effective Date. If a Change in Control has not occurred, either the Company
or the Executive may terminate this Agreement and all obligations of the parties hereunder upon the delivery of at least one year s
prior written notice to the other party; provided, however, that if a Change in Control occurs prior to the effective date of the termination
notice described in the preceding sentence, this Agreement shall not terminate pursuant to such termination notice. Furthermore, this
Agreement may be terminated after the occurrence of a Change in Control only by the written agreement of the Company and the Executive;
provided, however, that the Executive shall be entitled to a Severance Payment hereunder only as provided in Section 3.1. 

3.14 Termination
of Employment in Anticipation of a Change of Control . Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, if the Executive s
Employment is terminated within 90 days prior to the occurrence of a Change in Control, the Executive shall be entitled to claim that
his Employment was terminated (i) by the Company Without Cause or by the Executive for Good Reason and (ii) because of the anticipated
Change in Control. The Executive shall have the burden of proving such claim. The Retention Bonus in the amount described in Section
2.1 and the Severance Payment described in Section 3.3 shall be owed to the Executive if, but only if, (i) the Company in its discretion
agrees with the Executive s claim or (ii) an arbitrator agrees with the Executive s claim and awards the Executive the Retention
Bonus or the Severance Payment in an arbitration proceeding. All other provisions of this Article 3 shall be applicable to any Retention
Bonus and Severance Payment payments to which the Executive becomes entitled under this Section 3.14. 

3.15 Confidential
Information . After the termination for any reason of the Executive s Employment, the Executive shall at no time, without
the prior written consent of the Company or as may otherwise be required by a court of competent jurisdiction, (i) directly or indirectly
divulge to any Person other than the Company or a Person designated in writing by the Company any confidential information or trade secrets
regarding the Company or any of its subsidiaries or affiliated companies or (ii) directly or indirectly use any such confidential information
or trade secrets for the Executive s personal benefit or the benefit of any Person other than the Company and its subsidiaries
and affiliates in the Executive s performance of his employment duties.
