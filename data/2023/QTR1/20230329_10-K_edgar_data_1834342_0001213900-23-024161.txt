actual results will not materially differ from expectations. Such statements include, but are not limited to, any statements relating
to our ability to consummate any acquisition or other business combination and any other statements that are not statements of current
or historical facts. These statements are based on management s current expectations, but actual results may differ materially due
to various factors, including, but not limited to: 

our ability to complete our initial business combination (as defined below), including the 20Cube Business Combination (as defined below); 

our success in retaining or recruiting, or changes required in, our officers, key employees or directors following our initial business combination;

the ability of our officers and directors to generate a number of potential acquisition opportunities; 

our pool of prospective target businesses, including 20Cube (as defined below);

our financial performance. 

The forward-looking statements
contained in this Report are based on our current expectations and beliefs concerning future developments and their potential effects
on us. Future developments affecting us may not be those that we have anticipated. These forward-looking statements involve a number of
risks, uncertainties (some of which are beyond our control) or other assumptions that may cause actual results or performance to be materially
different from those expressed or implied by these forward-looking statements. Should one or more of these risks or uncertainties materialize,
or should any of our assumptions prove incorrect, actual results may vary in material respects from those projected in these forward-looking
statements. We undertake no obligation to update or revise any forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future
events or otherwise, except as may be required under applicable securities laws.

PART I 

Item 1. Business. 

Overview 

We are a blank check company
incorporated as a Delaware corporation and formed for the purpose of effecting an initial business combination. Since our initial public
offering, we have focused our search for an initial business combination on businesses that may provide significant opportunities for
attractive investor returns. While we may pursue an initial business combination target in any stage of its corporate evolution or in
any industry or sector, since our initial public offering, we have primarily focused our search on companies in technology and financial
sectors with an enterprise value of approximately 250 million to 750 million, although we may find a deal below or above that
range, including but not limited to firms with a nexus to Japan. Our management team has had significant success sourcing, acquiring,
growing and monetizing these types of companies. We believe this experience makes us well suited to identify, source, negotiate and execute
an initial business combination with the ultimate goal of pursuing attractive risk-adjusted returns for our stockholders. 

Initial Public Offering 

On February 11, 2021, we consummated
our initial public offering of 12,500,500 units. Each unit consists of one share of Class A common stock and one-half of one redeemable
warrant of the Company, with each warrant entitling the holder thereof to purchase one share of Class A common stock for 11.50 per whole
share. The units were sold at a price of 10.00 per unit, generating gross proceeds to the Company of 125,005,000. 

Simultaneously with the closing
of the initial public offering, we completed the private sale of an aggregate of 4,250,100 private placement warrants to our sponsor at
a purchase price of 1.00 per private placement warrant, generating gross proceeds of 4,250,100. The issuance of the private placement
warrants was made pursuant to the exemption from registration contained in Section 4(a)(2) of the Securities Act. 

A total of 125,005,000, comprised
of 122,504,900 of the proceeds from the initial public offering and 2,500,100 of the proceeds of the sale of the private placement warrants
was placed in the trust account maintained by Continental, acting as trustee. 

Although our amended and restated
certificate of incorporation had provided that we were required to consummate our initial business combination on or prior to February
8, 2023 (24 months after the closing of our initial public offering), in December 2022, our stockholders approved an amendment to our
amended and restated certificate of incorporation to authorize our board of directors to approve up to six successive extension periods
of one month each, through August 8, 2023. In February 2023, our board approved an initial extension until March 8, 2023 and further extensions
of up to five additional successive one-month periods, unless our board shall otherwise determine. At the date hereof, the current extension
period will terminate on April 8, 2023. If our initial business combination is not consummated by August 8, 2023 (or earlier if our board
determines not to extend the monthly periods), then we will be obligated to liquidate and distribute all amounts in our trust account. 

20Cube Business Combination 

On October 18, 2022, the Company
entered into the 20Cube Business Combination Agreement with Pubco, Merger Sub, 20Cube and the Signing Sellers. Capitalized terms not defined

Business Strategy 

Our management team is led
by Michael L. Lerch (our Chairman) and Richard Chisholm (our Chief Executive Officer), who have worked together for over 15 years and
hold, respectively, the Chief Investment Officer and Chief Executive Officer positions at ECM. 

Our business strategy has
been and will continue to be to leverage the management team s and Evolution s investment program to identify and complete
our initial business combination with a company, such as 20Cube, that has potential for value creation for stockholders. Key elements
of the investment program include: 

Long Track Record of Senior
Leadership Supported by a Proven Organization . The management team and Evolution have led successful investments in both US and non-US public
and private companies across a broad range of sectors including, but not limited to technology, finance, and real estate. We believe that
combining the management team s expertise with support from Evolution is a key differentiator for the identification, structuring,
and execution of the initial business combination. 

Dynamic Sourcing Network
and Leading Industry Relationships . In finding a suitable target company, the management team has utilized and will continue to utilize
the in-house sourcing professionals of Evolution as well as an expansive network of well-established external relationships
with agents, advisors, and investment banks. We believe this approach provides us with a significant and unique pipeline of opportunities. 

Significant Investing Experience .
We believe the management team s and Evolution s extensive track record of profitable investments fits well with the goal
of identifying an attractive target, such as 20Cube, for our initial business combination. We believe that our management team s
and Evolution s patient and disciplined approach that seeks to create value through aligning stakeholders allows us to quickly effect
a value-enhancing acquisition. 

Management Practices .
The management team and Evolution aim to promote sustainable corporate growth, increase of corporate value, and enhance earnings power
and capital efficiency. The management team and Evolution align with and support the broad direction of corporate strategy of the combined
business and have established an environment where appropriate risk-taking by the senior management is supported. We believe that
our management emphasis on stakeholder alignment and disciplined risk taking drives stockholder value and benefits not only management
but also employees, customers, business partners, creditors and the communities in which we operate. 

Execution and Structuring
Capability . The management team and Evolution have substantial experience in executing transactions across expansionary and recessionary
market cycles utilizing a variety of transaction structures that help us to minimize risk and to position potential business combination
target for success. Furthermore, the management team and Evolution have extensive experience negotiating and executing transaction documentation
which are proving invaluable in consummating the initial business combination. We believe that the management team s and Evolution s
combined expertise and reputation make us well situated to source, evaluate, structure and complete a successful initial business combination. 

7 

Business Combination Criteria 

Our business combination criteria
are not limited to a particular industry or geographic sector, however, given the experience of our management team and board, since our
initial public offering, we have primarily focused our search on companies in the technology and financial sectors with an enterprise
value of approximately 250 million to 750 million, although we may find a deal below or above that range, including but not
limited to firms with a nexus to Japan. 

We have identified the following
general criteria and guidelines that we believe are consistent with our acquisition philosophy and our management s experience,
and that we believe are important in evaluating prospective business combination opportunities. We have used and will continue to use
these criteria and guidelines to evaluate business combination opportunities such as the 20Cube Business Combination, but we may decide
to consummate our initial business combination with a target business that meets some but not all of these criteria and guidelines. 

Strong management . We have sought companies with strong management teams already in place. We spend significant time understanding a company s leadership and culture and align our executive team in a complimentary manner; 

Benefit from Capital Markets . We have sought companies with a management team that has the ambition to take advantage of the improved liquidity and additional capital that can come from a successful listing in the United States. The access to the capital markets could allow the company s business to accelerate its growth and build its capital profile; 

Sourced Through our Proprietary Channels . We are not participating in broadly marketed processes, but rather aim to leverage our extensive network to source our business combination; 

Favorable Industry Outlook . We have sought to identify companies with a target business where the end user markets of such target business products or services have a promising growth outlook; 

Middle-Market Businesses . We have sought companies with a total enterprise value between 250 million to 750 million, although we may find a deal below or above that range. We believe there are a considerable number of potential target businesses within this valuation range that can benefit from new capital for scalable operations to generate substantial revenue and earnings growth; 

Defensible business niche . We have sought to identify companies that have a leading or niche market position and that demonstrate advantages when compared to their competitors, which may help to create barriers to entry against new competitors. We anticipate that these barriers to entry will enhance the ability of these businesses or assets to generate strong returns; 

Evolution s Ability to Add Value . We have sought companies that operate within Evolution s or our operating partners areas of expertise, and for whom Evolution may provide capital structure solutions, through either capital infusions, creative and/or unique structures or recapitalizations in order to optimize the company s balance sheet and increase equity value; 

Performance Catalysts . We have sought to identify companies that have clearly identifiable opportunities to execute on growth initiatives following the initial business combination; 

Lower valuation relative to publicly traded peers . We have sought companies that are valued in the private market significantly lower than their publicly traded peers. We believe that this valuation differential facilitates the initial business combination negotiation by allowing the opportunity for liquidity and multiple expansion for the targets current stockholders, while at the same time allowing meaningful upside for our stockholders post-business combination; and 

Benefit from Being a Public Company . We have sought companies that can inherently benefit from a public listing in the United States. These inherent benefits include acquisition currency, greater visibility and branding among customers, enhanced access to debt and equity capital markets, and potential access to the world s largest investors. 

8 

These criteria are not intended
to be exhaustive. Any evaluation relating to the merits of a particular initial business combination may be based, to the extent relevant,
on these general guidelines as well as other considerations, factors and criteria that our management team may deem relevant. 

Competitive Strengths 

The sourcing, valuation, diligence
and execution capabilities of Messrs. Lerch and Chisholm, and Evolution, provide us with a significant pipeline of opportunities from
which to evaluate and select a business that will benefit from our expertise. We may also have the benefit of using our sponsor as our
lead financial advisor on our business combinations and other transactions. Our competitive strengths include the following: 

Strong Management Team and Sponsorship. We are leveraging the extensive experience of our management team and Evolution s investment team in sourcing and structuring acquisitions, financings and advisory transactions across a variety of economic cycles. We believe Evolution s investment team s ability to self-originate, effectively diligence, and thoughtfully structure transactions enable us to identify high quality businesses with great potential. We believe we benefit from the long tenure and experience of our management team and Evolution s investment team s track record in investment banking, corporate finance, and investment management. 

Proprietary Sourcing Channels and Leading Industry Relationships. We believe the capabilities and connections associated with our management team, in combination with those of Evolution, provide us with a differentiated pipeline of acquisition opportunities that would be difficult for other participants in the market to replicate. These sourcing capabilities are further bolstered by our management team and Evolution s reputation and deep industry relationships. 

Investing Experience. We believe our management s deep experience investing in private and public markets, combined with the Evolution s track record of identifying and sourcing transactions positions us well to appropriately evaluate potential business combinations, such as 20Cube, and to select one that will be well received by the public markets. 

Execution and Structuring Capability. The expertise of our management team and Evolution s resources allow us to identify, structure and complete a business combination that will present an attractive investment thesis for the public markets. These types of transactions are typically complex and require creativity, industry knowledge, expertise, rigorous due diligence, and extensive negotiation and documentation. We believe that by focusing our investment activities on these types of transactions, we will identify investment opportunities that have attractive risk/reward profiles based on their valuations and structural characteristics. 

Expertise in Regulated Industries. Many of the potential acquisition targets we consider may operate within a closely regulated industry. We believe that the experience of our management team and Evolution with closely regulated financial industries is advantageous when evaluating certain acquisition targets. 

Status as a Public Company . We believe our structure makes us an attractive business combination partner to prospective target businesses, such as 20Cube. As an existing public company, we offer a target business an alternative to the traditional initial public offering through a merger or other business combination with us. In this situation, the owners of the target business would exchange their shares of stock, shares or other equity interests in the target business for our shares. Once public, we believe the target business would have greater access to capital, an elevated profile among potential new customers and vendors, and additional means to attract and retain talented employees.

Our Acquisition, Investment and Post-Closing
Process 

In evaluating prospective
business combinations, such as the 20Cube Business Combination, we conduct a thorough due diligence review process that encompasses, among
other things: an analysis of overall industry and competitive conditions, a review of historical financial and operating data, meetings
with incumbent management and employees, interaction with third-parties who are industry experts, on-site inspection of facilities
and assets, discussion with customers and suppliers, legal and other reviews as we deem appropriate. We utilize the expertise of our management
team and our sponsor s and its affiliates resources in analyzing and evaluating operating plans, financial projections and
determining the appropriate return expectations given the risk profile of the target business as well as the suitability of the target
to become a public company. 

We are not prohibited from
pursuing an initial business combination with a company that is affiliated with our sponsor, officers or directors, subject to certain
approvals and consents. In the event we seek to complete our initial business combination with a company that is affiliated with our sponsor,
officers or directors, we, or a committee of independent directors, will obtain an opinion from an independent investment banking firm
or another independent firm that commonly renders fairness opinions that our initial business combination is fair to us from a financial
point of view. 

Our Business Combination Process 

Members of our management
team directly and indirectly own our founder shares, common stock and/or private placement warrants, and, accordingly, may have a conflict
of interest in determining whether a particular target business is an appropriate business with which to effectuate our initial business
combination. Further, each of our officers and directors may have a conflict of interest with respect to evaluating a particular business
combination if the retention or resignation of any such officers and directors were to be included by a target business as a condition
to any agreement with respect to our initial business combination. 

Each of our officers and directors
presently has, and any of them in the future may have additional, fiduciary or contractual obligations to other entities pursuant to which
such officer or director is or will be required to present a business combination opportunity. Accordingly, if any of our officers or
directors becomes aware of a business combination opportunity which is suitable for an entity to which he or she has then-current fiduciary
or contractual obligations, he or she will honor his or her fiduciary or contractual obligations to present such opportunity to such entity.
We believe, however, that the fiduciary duties or contractual obligations of our officers or directors will not materially affect our
ability to complete our initial business combination, as we believe any such opportunities presented would be smaller than what we are
interested in, in different fields than what we would be interested in, or to entities that are not themselves in the business of engaging
in business combinations. Our amended and restated certificate of incorporation provides that we renounce our interest in any corporate
opportunity offered to any director or officer unless such opportunity is expressly offered to such person solely in his or her capacity
as a director or officer of our company and such opportunity is one we are legally and contractually permitted to undertake and would
otherwise be reasonable for us to pursue, and to the extent the director or officer is permitted to refer that opportunity to us without
violating another legal obligation. 

Our officers and directors
may become an officer or director of another SPAC with a class of securities intended to be registered under the Exchange Act even before
we have entered into a definitive agreement regarding our initial business combination. 

Our Management Team 

Members of our management
team are not obligated to devote any specific number of hours to our matters but they devote as much of their time as they deem necessary
to our affairs and will continue to do so until we have completed our initial business combination. The amount of time that any member
of our management team devotes in any time period will vary based on the current stage of the business combination process. We believe
our management team s operating and transaction experience and relationships with companies provide us with a substantial number
of potential business combination targets. Over the course of their careers, the members of our management team have developed a broad
network of contacts and corporate relationships in many industries. This network has grown through the activities of our management team
sourcing, acquiring and financing businesses, our management team s relationships with sellers, financing sources and target management
teams and the experience of our management team in executing transactions under varying economic and financial market conditions. 

10 

Status as a Public Company 

We believe our structure make
us an attractive business combination partner to target businesses. As a public company, we offer a target business an alternative to
the traditional initial public offering through a merger or other business combination with us. Following an initial business combination,
we believe the target business would have greater access to capital and additional means of creating management incentives that are better
aligned with stockholders interests than it would as a private company. A target business can further benefit by augmenting its
profile among potential new customers and vendors and aid in attracting talented employees. In a business combination transaction with
us, the owners of the target business may, for example, exchange their shares of stock in the target business for our shares of Class A
common stock (or shares of a new holding company) or for a combination of our shares of Class A common stock and cash, allowing us
to tailor the consideration to the specific needs of the sellers. 

Although there are various
costs and obligations associated with being a public company, we believe target businesses, such as 20Cube, will find this method a more
expeditious and cost-effective method to becoming a public company than the typical initial public offering. The typical initial public
offering process takes a significantly longer period of time than the typical business combination transaction process, and there are
significant expenses in the initial public offering process, including underwriting discounts and commissions, marketing and road show
efforts that may not be present to the same extent in connection with an initial business combination with us. 

Furthermore, once a proposed
initial business combination is completed, the target business will have effectively become public, whereas an initial public offering
is always subject to the underwriters ability to complete the offering, as well as general market conditions, which could delay
or prevent the offering from occurring or could have negative valuation consequences. Following an initial business combination, we believe
the target business would then have greater access to capital and an additional means of providing management incentives consistent with
stockholders interests and the ability to use its shares as currency for acquisitions. Being a public company can offer further
benefits by augmenting a company s profile among potential new customers and vendors and aid in attracting talented employees. 

While we believe that our
structure and our management team s backgrounds make us an attractive business partner, some potential target businesses may view
our status as a blank check company, such as our lack of an operating history and our ability to seek stockholder approval of any proposed
initial business combination, negatively. 

We are an emerging
growth company, as defined in Section 2(a) of the Securities Act, as modified by the JOBS Act. As such, we are eligible to
take advantage of certain exemptions from various reporting requirements that are applicable to other public companies that are not emerging
growth companies including, but not limited to, not being required to comply with the independent registered public accounting
firm attestation requirements of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, reduced disclosure obligations regarding executive compensation
in our periodic reports and proxy statements, and exemptions from the requirements of holding a non-binding advisory vote on executive
compensation and stockholder approval of any golden parachute payments not previously approved. If some investors find our securities
less attractive as a result, there may be a less active trading market for our securities and the prices of our securities may be more
volatile. 

In addition, Section 107
of the JOBS Act also provides that an emerging growth company can take advantage of the extended transition period provided
in Section 7(a)(2)(B) of the Securities Act for complying with new or revised accounting standards. In other words, an emerging
growth company can delay the adoption of certain accounting standards until those standards would otherwise apply to private companies.
We intend to take advantage of the benefits of this extended transition period. 

We will remain an emerging
growth company until the earlier of (1) the last day of the fiscal year (a) following February 11, 2026, the fifth anniversary
of the completion of our initial public offering, (b) in which we have total annual gross revenue of at least 1.235 billion,
or (c) in which we are deemed to be a large accelerated filer, which means the market value of our Class A common stock that
is held by non-affiliates exceeds 700 million as of the prior June 30 th , and (2) the date on which we
have issued more than 1.0 billion in non-convertible debt securities during the prior three-year period. 

11 

Additionally, we are
a smaller reporting company as defined in Rule 10(f)(1) of Regulation S-K. Smaller reporting companies may take advantage
of certain reduced disclosure obligations, including, among other things, providing only two years of audited financial statements. We
will remain a smaller reporting company until the last day of the fiscal year in which (1) the market value of our common stock held
by non-affiliates exceeds 250 million as of the end of the prior June 30 th , or (2) our annual revenues exceeded
 100 million during such completed fiscal year and the market value of our common stock held by non-affiliates exceeds 700 million
as of the prior June 30 th . 

Financial Position 

We had funds available for
an initial business combination in the amount of approximately 5,327,678 as of December 31, 2022, assuming no redemptions in connection
with the stockholder vote on the proposal to approve our initial business combination and after payment of 4,375,175 of deferred underwriting
fees. 

Effecting Our Initial Business Combination 

We are not presently engaged
in, and we will not engage in, any operations until we consummate our initial business combination. We intend to effectuate our initial
business combination using cash from the proceeds of our initial public offering and the private placement, the proceeds of the sale of
our shares in connection with our initial business combination (pursuant to forward purchase agreements or backstop agreements which we
may enter into following the consummation of our initial business combination or otherwise), shares issued to the owners of the target,
debt issued to bank or other lenders or the owners of the target, or a combination of the foregoing. We may seek to complete our initial
business combination with a company or business that may be financially unstable or in its early stages of development or growth, which
would subject us to the numerous risks inherent in such companies and businesses. 

If our initial business
combination is paid for using equity or debt securities, or not all of the funds released from the trust account are used for payment
of the consideration in connection with our initial business combination or used for redemptions of our Class A common stock, we
may apply the balance of the cash released to us from the trust account for general corporate purposes, including for maintenance or expansion
of operations of the post-transaction company, the payment of principal or interest due on indebtedness incurred in completing our
initial business combination, to fund the purchase of other companies or for working capital. We may seek to raise additional funds through
a private offering of debt or equity securities in connection with the completion of our initial business combination, and we may effectuate
our initial business combination using the proceeds of such offering rather than using the amounts raised in our initial public offering
and held in the trust account. In addition, we may target businesses larger than we could acquire with the net proceeds of our initial
public offering and the sale of the private placement warrants and may as a result be required to seek additional financing to complete
such proposed initial business combination. Subject to compliance with applicable securities laws, we would expect to complete such financing
only simultaneously with the completion of our initial business combination. In the case of an initial business combination funded with
assets other than the trust account assets, our proxy materials or tender offer documents disclosing the initial business combination
would disclose the terms of the financing and, only if required by law, we would seek stockholder approval of such financing. There are
no prohibitions on our ability to raise funds privately or through loans in connection with our initial business combination. 

For more information on the
20Cube Business Combination and the equity and financing arrangements associated therewith, please see 20Cube Business Combination
Agreement above.

Sources of Target Businesses 

Target business candidates,
such as 20Cube, have been brought to our attention from various unaffiliated sources, including investment bankers and investment professionals.
Target businesses have been brought to our attention by such unaffiliated sources as a result of being solicited by us by calls or mailings.
These sources introduce us to target businesses in which they think we may be interested on an unsolicited basis, since many of these
sources will have read this Report and know what types of businesses we are targeting. Our officers and directors, as well as our sponsor
and their affiliates, also bring to our attention target business candidates that they become aware of through their business contacts
as a result of formal or informal inquiries or discussions they may have, as well as attending trade shows or conventions. In addition,
we receive a number of proprietary deal flow opportunities that would not otherwise necessarily be available to us as a result of the
business relationships of our officers and directors and our sponsor and their respective industry and business contacts as well as their
affiliates. We may engage the services of professional firms or other individuals that specialize in business acquisitions on any formal
basis, in which event we may pay a finder s fee, consulting fee, advisory fee or other compensation to be determined in an arm s
length negotiation based on the terms of the transaction. We will engage a finder only to the extent our management determines that the
use of a finder may bring opportunities to us that may not otherwise be available to us or if finders approach us on an unsolicited basis
with a potential transaction that our management determines is in our best interest to pursue. Payment of finder s fees is customarily
tied to completion of a transaction, in which case any such fee will be paid out of the funds held in the trust account. In no event,
however, will our sponsor or any of our existing officers or directors, or any entity with which our sponsor or officers are affiliated,
be paid any finder s fee, reimbursement, consulting fee, monies in respect of any payment of a loan or other compensation by the
company prior to, or in connection with any services rendered for any services they render in order to effectuate, the completion of our
initial business combination (regardless of the type of transaction that it is). Although none of our sponsor, executive officers or directors,
or any of their respective affiliates, will be allowed to receive any compensation, finder s fees or consulting fees from a prospective
business combination target in connection with a contemplated initial business combination, we do not have a policy that prohibits our
sponsor, executive officers or directors, or any of their respective affiliates, from negotiating for the reimbursement of out-of-pocket expenses
by a target business. We paid our sponsor a total of 10,000 per month for office space, utilities and secretarial and administrative
support and to reimburse our sponsor for any out-of-pocket expenses related to identifying, investigating and completing an initial
business combination. These fees were suspended as of February 28, 2023. Some of our officers and directors may enter into employment
or consulting agreements with the post-transaction company following our initial business combination. The presence or absence of
any such fees or arrangements will not be used as a criterion in our selection process of an initial business combination candidate. 

We are not prohibited from
pursuing an initial business combination with an initial business combination target that is affiliated with our sponsor, officers or
directors or making the initial business combination through a joint venture or other form of shared ownership with our sponsor, officers
or directors. While 20Cube is not affiliated with our sponsor, officers or directors, in the event that we do not consummate the 20Cube
Business combination and we seek to complete our initial business combination with an initial business combination target that is affiliated
with our sponsor, officers or directors, we, or a committee of independent directors, would obtain an opinion from an independent investment
banking firm or from another independent entity that commonly renders valuation opinions that such an initial business combination is
fair to our company from a financial point of view. We are not required to obtain such an opinion in any other context. 

Potential target companies
may have had prior discussions with other blank check companies, bankers in the industry and/or other professional advisors including
blank check companies with which our executive officers or board of directors were affiliated. We may pursue transactions with such potential
targets (i) if such other blank check companies are no longer pursuing transactions with such potential targets, (ii) if we
become aware that such potential targets are interested in a potential initial business combination with us and (iii) if we believe
such transactions would be attractive to our stockholders. If any of our officers or directors becomes aware of an initial business combination
opportunity that falls within the line of business of any entity to which he or she has pre-existing fiduciary or contractual obligations,
he or she may be required to present such business combination opportunity to such entity prior to presenting such business combination
opportunity to us. Our officers and directors currently have certain relevant fiduciary duties or contractual obligations that may take
priority over their duties to us. 

Selection of a Target Business and Structuring
of our Initial Business Combination 

Nasdaq rules require that
we must complete one or more business combinations having an aggregate fair market value of at least 80 of the value of the assets held
in the trust account (excluding the deferred underwriting commissions and taxes payable on the interest earned on the trust account) at
the time of our signing a definitive agreement in connection with our initial business combination. The fair market value of our initial
business combination will be determined by our board of directors based upon one or more standards generally accepted by the financial
community, such as discounted cash flow valuation, a valuation based on trading multiples of comparable public businesses or a valuation
based on the financial metrics of M A transactions of comparable businesses. If our board of directors is not able to independently
determine the fair market value of our initial business combination, we will obtain an opinion from an independent investment banking
firm or another independent entity that commonly renders valuation opinions with respect to the satisfaction of such criteria. While we
consider it unlikely that our board of directors will not be able to make an independent determination of the fair market value of our
initial business combination, it may be unable to do so if it is less familiar or experienced with the business of a particular target
or if there is a significant amount of uncertainty as to the value of a target s assets or prospects. Additionally, pursuant to
Nasdaq rules, any initial business combination must be approved by a majority of our independent directors. 

13 

We do not intend to purchase
multiple businesses in unrelated industries in conjunction with our initial business combination. Subject to this requirement, our management
will have virtually unrestricted flexibility in identifying and selecting one or more prospective target businesses, although we will
not be permitted to effectuate our initial business combination with another blank check company or a similar company with nominal operations.
We anticipate structuring our initial business combination either (i) in such a way so that the post-transaction company in which
our public stockholders own shares will own or acquire 100 of the equity interests or assets of the target business or businesses, or
(ii) in such a way so that the post-transaction company owns or acquires less than 100 of such interests or assets of the target
business in order to meet certain objectives of the target management team or stockholders. However, we will only complete an initial
business combination if the post-transaction company owns or acquires 50 or more of the outstanding voting securities of the target
or otherwise acquires a controlling interest in the target sufficient for it not to be required to register as an investment company under
the Investment Company Act. Even if the post-transaction company owns or acquires 50 or more of the voting securities of the target,
our stockholders prior to the initial business combination may collectively own a minority interest in the post-transaction company,
depending on valuations ascribed to the target and us in the initial business combination. For example, we could pursue a transaction
in which we issue a substantial number of new shares in exchange for all of the outstanding capital stock of a target. In this case, we
would acquire a 100 controlling interest in the target. However, as a result of the issuance of a substantial number of new shares, our
stockholders immediately prior to our initial business combination could own less than a majority of our outstanding shares subsequent
to our initial business combination. If less than 100 of the equity interests or assets of a target business or businesses are owned
or acquired by the post-transaction company, the portion of such business or businesses that is owned or acquired is what will be
taken into account for purposes of Nasdaq s 80 fair market value test. If the initial business combination involves more than one
target business, the 80 fair market value test will be based on the aggregate value of all of the transactions and we will treat the
target businesses together as the initial business combination for purposes of a tender offer or for seeking stockholder approval, as
applicable. 

To the extent we effect our
initial business combination with a company or business that may be financially unstable or in its early stages of development or growth
we may be affected by numerous risks inherent in such company or business. Although our management will endeavor to evaluate the risks
inherent in a particular target business, we cannot assure you that we will properly ascertain or assess all significant risk factors. 

Any costs incurred with respect
to the identification and evaluation of a prospective target business with which our initial business combination is not ultimately completed
will result in our incurring losses and will reduce the funds we can use to complete another business combination. 

Lack of Business Diversification 

For an indefinite period of
time after the completion of our initial business combination, the prospects for our success may depend entirely on the future performance
of a single business. Unlike other entities that have the resources to complete business combinations with multiple entities in one or
several industries, it is probable that we will not have the resources to diversify our operations and mitigate the risks of being in
a single line of business. In addition, we have focused our search for an initial business combination in a single industry. By completing
our initial business combination with only a single entity, our lack of diversification may: 

subject us to negative economic, competitive and regulatory developments, any or all of which may have a substantial adverse impact on the particular industry in which we operate after our initial business combination, and 

cause us to depend on the marketing and sale of a single product or limited number of products or services. 

14 

Limited Ability to Evaluate the Target s
Management Team 

Although we closely scrutinize
the management of a prospective target business, including the management team of 20Cube, when evaluating the desirability of effecting
our initial business combination with that business and plan to continue to do so if the 20Cube Business Combination is not consummated
and we week other business combination opportunities, our assessment of the target business management may not prove to be correct.
In addition, the future management may not have the necessary skills, qualifications or abilities to manage a public company. Furthermore,
the future role of members of our management team, if any, in the target business cannot presently be stated with any certainty. The determination
as to whether any of the members of our management team will remain with the combined company will be made at the time of our initial
business combination. While it is possible that one or more of our directors will remain associated in some capacity with us following
our initial business combination, it is unlikely that any of them will devote their full efforts to our affairs subsequent to our initial
business combination. Moreover, we cannot assure you that members of our management team will have significant experience or knowledge
relating to the operations of the particular target business. 

We cannot assure you that
any of our key personnel will remain in senior management or advisory positions with the combined company. The determination as to whether
any of our key personnel will remain with the combined company will be made at the time of our initial business combination. 

Following an initial business
combination, we may seek to recruit additional managers to supplement the incumbent management of the target business. We cannot assure
you that we will have the ability to recruit additional managers, or that additional managers will have the requisite skills, knowledge
or experience necessary to enhance the incumbent management. 

Stockholders May Not Have the Ability to Approve
Our Initial Business Combination 

We may conduct redemptions
without a stockholder vote pursuant to the tender offer rules of the SEC. However, we will seek stockholder approval if it is required
by law or applicable stock exchange rule (as is the case with the 20Cube Business Combination), or we may decide to seek stockholder approval
for business or other legal reasons. Presented in the table below is a graphic explanation of the types of initial business combinations
we may consider and whether stockholder approval is currently required under Delaware law for each such transaction. 

Type of Transaction 
 Whether Stockholder Approval is Required 
 
 Purchase of assets 
 No 
 
 Purchase of stock of target not involving a merger with the company 
 No 
 
 Merger of target into a subsidiary of the company 
 No 
 
 Merger of the company with a target 
 Yes 

Under Nasdaq s listing
rules, stockholder approval would be required for our initial business combination if, for example: 

we issue shares of Class A common stock that will be equal to or in excess of 20 of the number of shares of our Class A common stock then outstanding; 

any of our directors, officers or substantial stockholders (as defined by Nasdaq rules) has a 5 or greater interest (or such persons collectively have a 10 or greater interest), directly or indirectly, in the target business or assets to be acquired or otherwise and the present or potential issuance of common stock could result in an increase in outstanding shares of common stock or voting power of 5 or more; or 

the issuance or potential issuance of common stock will result in our undergoing a change of control. 

See 20Cube Business
Combination Agreement above for more information regarding the requisite approvals needed in the 20Cube Business Combination. 

15 

Permitted Purchases of our Securities 

If we seek stockholder approval
of our initial business combination and we do not conduct redemptions in connection with our initial business combination pursuant to
the tender offer rules, our sponsor, initial stockholders, directors, officers, advisors or their affiliates may purchase shares or public
warrants in privately negotiated transactions or in the open market either prior to or following the completion of our initial business
combination. There is no limit on the number of shares our initial stockholders, directors, officers, advisors or their affiliates may
purchase in such transactions, subject to compliance with applicable law and Nasdaq rules. However, they have no current commitments,
plans or intentions to engage in such transactions and have not formulated any terms or conditions for any such transactions. If they
engage in such transactions, they will not make any such purchases when they are in possession of any material nonpublic information not
disclosed to the seller or if such purchases are prohibited by Regulation M under the Exchange Act. We do not currently anticipate that
such purchases, if any, would constitute a tender offer subject to the tender offer rules under the Exchange Act or a going-private transaction
subject to the going-private rules under the Exchange Act; however, if the purchasers determine at the time of any such purchases
that the purchases are subject to such rules, the purchasers will comply with such rules. Any such purchases will be reported pursuant
to Section 13 and Section 16 of the Exchange Act to the extent such purchasers are subject to such reporting requirements. None
of the funds held in the trust account will be used to purchase shares or public warrants in such transactions prior to completion of
our initial business combination. 

The purpose of any such purchases
of shares could be to vote such shares in favor of the initial business combination and thereby increase the likelihood of obtaining stockholder
approval of the initial business combination or to satisfy a closing condition in an agreement with a target that requires us to have
a minimum net worth or a certain amount of cash at the closing of our initial business combination, where it appears that such requirement
would otherwise not be met. The purpose of any such purchases of public warrants could be to reduce the number of public warrants outstanding
or to vote such warrants on any matters submitted to the warrant holders for approval in connection with our initial business combination.
Any such purchases of our securities may result in the completion of our initial business combination that may not otherwise have been
possible. In addition, if such purchases are made, the public float of our shares of Class A common stock or warrants
may be reduced and the number of beneficial holders of our securities may be reduced, which may make it difficult to maintain or obtain
the quotation, listing or trading of our securities on a national securities exchange. 

Our sponsor, officers, directors
and/or their affiliates anticipate that they may identify the stockholders with whom our sponsor, officers, directors or their affiliates
may pursue privately negotiated purchases by either the stockholders contacting us directly or by our receipt of redemption requests submitted
by stockholders following our mailing of proxy materials in connection with our initial business combination. To the extent that our sponsor,
officers, directors, advisors or their affiliates enter into a private purchase, they would identify and contact only potential selling
stockholders who have expressed their election to redeem their shares for a pro rata share of the trust account or vote against our initial
business combination, whether or not such stockholder has already submitted a proxy with respect to our initial business combination.
Our sponsor, officers, directors, advisors or their affiliates will only purchase shares if such purchases comply with Regulation M under
the Exchange Act and the other federal securities laws. 

Any purchases by our sponsor,
officers, directors and/or their affiliates who are affiliated purchasers under Rule 10b-18 under the Exchange Act will only
be made to the extent such purchases are able to be made in compliance with Rule 10b-18, which is a safe harbor from liability for
manipulation under Section 9(a)(2) and Rule 10b-5 of the Exchange Act. Rule 10b-18 has certain technical requirements
that must be complied with in order for the safe harbor to be available to the purchaser. Our sponsor, officers, directors and/or their
affiliates will not make purchases of common stock if the purchases would violate Section 9(a)(2) or Rule 10b-5 of the
Exchange Act. Any such purchases will be reported pursuant to Section 13 and Section 16 of the Exchange Act to the extent such
purchases are subject to such reporting requirements. 

See 20Cube Business
Combination Agreement above for more information regarding such purchases in the 20Cube Business Combination. 

16 

Redemption Rights for Public Stockholders in
Connection with Completion of our Initial Business Combination 

We will provide our public
stockholders with the opportunity to redeem all or a portion of their shares of Class A common stock upon the completion of our initial
business combination, such as the 20Cube Business Combination, at a per-share price, payable in cash, equal to the aggregate amount
then on deposit in the trust account as of two business days prior to the consummation of the initial business combination, such as the
20Cube Business Combination, including interest earned on the funds held in the trust account and not previously released to us to pay
our taxes, divided by the number of then outstanding public shares, subject to the limitations described herein. The amount in the trust
account was approximately 10.09 per public share as of December 31, 2022. The per-share amount we will distribute to investors who
properly redeem their shares will not be reduced by the deferred underwriting commissions we will pay to the underwriters. The redemption
rights will include the requirement that a beneficial holder must identify itself in order to validly redeem its shares. Our sponsor,
officers and directors have entered into a letter agreement with us, pursuant to which they have agreed to waive their redemption rights
with respect to any founder shares and any public shares held by them in connection with the completion of our initial business combination. 

See 20Cube Business
Combination Agreement above for more information on the additional agreements entered into in connection with the 20Cube Business
Combination. 

Manner of Conducting Redemptions 

We will provide our public
stockholders with the opportunity to redeem all or a portion of their shares of Class A common stock upon the completion of our initial
business combination either (i) in connection with a stockholder meeting called to approve the initial business combination, such
as the 20Cube Business Combination, or (ii) by means of a tender offer if the 20Cube Business Combination is not consummated. The
decision as to whether we will seek stockholder approval of a proposed initial business combination or conduct a tender offer will be
made by us, solely in our discretion, and will be based on a variety of factors such as the timing of the transaction and whether the
terms of the transaction would require us to seek stockholder approval under the law or stock exchange listing requirement. Under Nasdaq
rules, asset acquisitions and stock purchases would not typically require stockholder approval while direct mergers with our company where
we do not survive and any transactions where we issue more than 20 of our outstanding common stock or seek to amend our amended and restated
certificate of incorporation would require stockholder approval. If we structure an initial business combination with a target company
in a manner that requires stockholder approval, we will not have discretion as to whether to seek a stockholder vote to approve the proposed
initial business combination. We may conduct redemptions without a stockholder vote pursuant to the tender offer rules of the SEC unless
stockholder approval is required by law or stock exchange listing requirements or we choose to seek stockholder approval for business
or other legal reasons. So long as we obtain and maintain a listing for our securities on Nasdaq, we will be required to comply with such
rules. 

If a stockholder vote is not
required and we do not decide to hold a stockholder vote for business or other legal reasons, we will, pursuant to our amended and restated
certificate of incorporation: 

conduct the redemptions pursuant to Rule 13e-4 and Regulation 14E of the Exchange Act, which regulate issuer tender offers, and 

file tender offer documents with the SEC prior to completing our initial business combination which contain substantially the same financial and other information about the initial business combination and the redemption rights as is required under Regulation 14A of the Exchange Act, which regulates the solicitation of proxies. 

Upon the public announcement
of our initial business combination, we or our sponsor will terminate any plan established in accordance with Rule 10b5-1 to
purchase shares of our Class A common stock in the open market if we elect to redeem our public shares through a tender offer, to
comply with Rule 14e-5 under the Exchange Act. 

17 

In the event we conduct redemptions
pursuant to the tender offer rules, our offer to redeem will remain open for at least 20 business days, in accordance with Rule 14e-1(a)
under the Exchange Act, and we will not be permitted to complete our initial business combination until the expiration of the tender offer
period. In addition, we will not redeem any public shares unless our net tangible assets will be at least 5,000,001 either immediately
prior to or upon consummation of our initial business combination and after payment of underwriters fees and commissions (so that
we are not subject to the SEC s penny stock rules) or any greater net tangible asset or cash requirement which may
be contained in the agreement relating to our initial business combination. If public stockholders tender more shares than we have offered
to purchase, we will withdraw the tender offer and not complete the initial business combination. 

If, however, stockholder approval
of the transaction is required by law or stock exchange listing requirement, or we decide to obtain stockholder approval for business
or other legal reasons, we will, pursuant to our amended and restated certificate of incorporation: 

conduct the redemptions in conjunction with a proxy solicitation pursuant to Regulation 14A of the Exchange Act, which regulates the solicitation of proxies, and not pursuant to the tender offer rules, and 

file proxy materials with the SEC. 

In the event that we seek
stockholder approval of our initial business combination, we will distribute proxy materials and, in connection therewith, provide our
public stockholders with the redemption rights described above upon completion of the initial business combination. 

If we seek stockholder approval,
we will complete our initial business combination only if a majority of the outstanding shares of common stock voted are voted in favor
of the initial business combination. A quorum for such meeting will consist of the holders present in person or by proxy of shares of
outstanding capital stock of the company representing a majority of the voting power of all outstanding shares of capital stock of the
company entitled to vote at such meeting. Our initial stockholders count toward this quorum and pursuant to the letter agreement, our
sponsor, officers and directors have agreed to vote their founder shares and any public shares purchased during or after our initial public
offering (including in open market and privately negotiated transactions) in favor of our initial business combination. For purposes of
seeking approval of the majority of our outstanding shares of common stock voted, non-votes will have no effect on the approval of
our initial business combination once a quorum is obtained. As a result, because a majority of the voting power of our outstanding common
stock is held by the holders of our founder shares due to the redemption of 11,538,407 public shares in connection with our Special Meeting,
an initial business combination can be approved without the approval of any of the holders of our public shares. We will give approximately
30 days (but not less than 10 days nor more than 60 days) prior written notice of any such meeting, if required, at which
a vote shall be taken to approve our initial business combination. These quorum and voting thresholds, and the voting agreements of our
initial stockholders, may make it more likely that we will consummate our initial business combination. Each public stockholder may elect
to redeem its public shares irrespective of whether they vote for or against the proposed transaction. 

Our amended and restated certificate
of incorporation provides that we may not redeem our public shares unless our net tangible assets are at least 5,000,001 either immediately
prior to or upon consummation of our initial business combination and after payment of underwriters fees and commissions (so that
we are not subject to the SEC s penny stock rules) or any greater net tangible asset or cash requirement which may
be contained in the agreement relating to our initial business combination. For example, the proposed initial business combination may
require: (i) cash consideration to be paid to the target or its owners, (ii) cash to be transferred to the target for working
capital or other general corporate purposes or (iii) the retention of cash to satisfy other conditions in accordance with the terms
of the proposed initial business combination. In the event the aggregate cash consideration we would be required to pay for all shares
of Class A common stock that are validly submitted for redemption plus any amount required to satisfy cash conditions pursuant to
the terms of the proposed initial business combination exceed the aggregate amount of cash available to us, we will not complete the initial
business combination or redeem any shares, and all shares of Class A common stock submitted for redemption will be returned to the
holders thereof. 

See 20Cube Business
Combination Agreement above for more information regarding the requisite approvals needed for the 20Cube Business Combination. 

Tendering Stock Certificates in Connection
with Redemption Rights 

We may require our public
stockholders seeking to exercise their redemption rights, whether they are record holders or hold their shares in street name, 
to either tender their certificates to our transfer agent prior to the meeting held to approve a proposed initial business combination
by a date set forth in the proxy materials mailed to such holders or to deliver their shares to the transfer agent electronically using
the DWAC System, at the holder s option. The proxy materials that we will furnish to holders of our public shares in connection
with our initial business combination will indicate whether we are requiring public stockholders to satisfy such delivery requirements.
Accordingly, a public stockholder would have from the time we send out our proxy materials until the date set forth in such proxy materials
to tender its shares if it wishes to seek to exercise its redemption rights. Given the relatively short exercise period, it is advisable
for stockholders to use electronic delivery of their public shares. 

18 

There is a nominal cost associated
with the above-referenced tendering process and the act of certificating the shares or delivering them through the DWAC System. The
transfer agent will typically charge the tendering broker a customary fee and it would be up to the broker whether or not to pass this
cost on to the redeeming holder. However, this fee would be incurred regardless of whether or not we require holders seeking to exercise
redemption rights to tender their shares. The need to deliver shares is a requirement of exercising redemption rights regardless of the
timing of when such delivery must be effectuated. 

The foregoing is different
from the procedures used by many blank check companies. In order to perfect redemption rights in connection with their business combinations,
many blank check companies would distribute proxy materials for the stockholders vote on an initial business combination, and a
holder could simply vote against a proposed initial business combination and check a box on the proxy card indicating such holder was
seeking to exercise his or her redemption rights. After the initial business combination was approved, the company would contact such
stockholder to arrange for him or her to deliver his or her certificate to verify ownership. As a result, the stockholder then had an
 option window after the completion of the initial business combination during which he or she could monitor the price of
the company s stock in the market. If the price rose above the redemption price, he or she could sell his or her shares in the open
market before actually delivering his or her shares to the company for cancellation. As a result, the redemption rights, to which stockholders
were aware they needed to commit before the stockholder meeting, would become option rights surviving past the completion
of the initial business combination until the redeeming holder delivered its certificate. The requirement for physical or electronic delivery
prior to the meeting ensures that a redeeming holder s election to redeem is irrevocable once the initial business combination is
approved. 

Any request to redeem such
shares, once made, may be withdrawn at any time up to the date set forth in the proxy materials. Furthermore, if a holder of a public
share delivered its certificate in connection with an election of redemption rights and subsequently decides prior to the applicable date
not to elect to exercise such rights, such holder may simply request that the transfer agent return the certificate (physically or electronically).
It is anticipated that the funds to be distributed to holders of our public shares electing to redeem their shares will be distributed
promptly after the completion of our initial business combination. 

If our initial business combination
is not approved or completed for any reason, then our public stockholders who elected to exercise their redemption rights would not be
entitled to redeem their shares for the applicable pro rata share of the trust account. In such case, we will promptly return any certificates
delivered by public holders who elected to redeem their shares. 

If the 20Cube Business Combination
is not completed, we may continue to try to complete an initial business combination with a different target until August 8, 2023 as determined
by the board of directors in its sole discretion and as such Extension is included in a public announcement. 

Redemption of Public Shares and Liquidation
if no Initial Business Combination 

Although our amended and restated
certificate of incorporation had provided that we were required to consummate our initial business combination on or prior to February
8, 2023 (24 months after the closing of our initial public offering), in December 2022, our stockholders approved an amendment to our
amended and restated certificate of incorporation to authorize our board of directors to approve up to six successive extension periods
of one month each, through August 8, 2023. In February 2023, our board approved an initial extension until March 8, 2023 and further extensions
of up to five additional successive one-month periods, unless our board shall otherwise determine. At the date hereof, the current extension
period will terminate on April 8, 2023. If our initial business combination is not consummated by August 8, 2023 (or earlier if our board
determines not to extend the monthly periods), we will: (i) cease all operations except for the purpose of winding up, (ii) as
promptly as reasonably possible but not more than ten business days thereafter, redeem the public shares, at a per-share price, payable
in cash, equal to the aggregate amount then on deposit in the trust account including interest earned on the funds held in the trust account
and not previously released to us to pay our taxes (less up to 100,000 of interest to pay dissolution expenses), divided by the number
of then outstanding public shares, which redemption will completely extinguish public stockholders rights as stockholders (including
the right to receive further liquidating distributions, if any), subject to applicable law, and (iii) as promptly as reasonably possible
following such redemption, subject to the approval of our remaining stockholders and our board of directors, dissolve and liquidate, subject
in each case to our obligations under Delaware law to provide for claims of creditors and the requirements of other applicable law. There
will be no redemption rights or liquidating distributions with respect to our warrants, which will expire worthless if we fail to complete
our initial business combination by April 8, 2023, subject to the ability of the board to extend such period at its discretion. 

19 

Our sponsor, officers and
directors have entered into a letter agreement with us, pursuant to which they have waived their rights to liquidating distributions from
the trust account with respect to any founder shares held by them if we fail to complete our initial business combination by April 8,
2023. However, if our sponsor, officers or directors acquire public shares in the future, they will be entitled to liquidating distributions
from the trust account with respect to such public shares if we fail to complete our initial business combination by April 8, 2023. 

Our sponsor, officers and
directors have agreed, pursuant to a written agreement with us, that they will not propose any amendment to our amended and restated certificate
of incorporation (i) to modify the substance or timing of our obligation to redeem 100 of our public shares if we do not complete
our initial business combination by April 8, 2023 or (ii) with respect to any other provision relating to stockholders rights
or pre-initial business combination activity, unless we provide our public stockholders with the opportunity to redeem their shares
of Class A common stock upon approval of any such amendment at a per-share price, payable in cash, equal to the aggregate amount
then on deposit in the trust account including interest earned on the funds held in the trust account and not previously released to us
to pay our taxes divided by the number of then outstanding public shares. However, we may not redeem our public shares unless our net
tangible assets are at least 5,000,001 either immediately prior to or upon consummation of our initial business combination and after
payment of underwriters fees and commissions (so that we are not subject to the SEC s penny stock rules). If
this optional redemption right is exercised with respect to an excessive number of public shares such that we cannot satisfy the net tangible
asset requirement (described above), we would not proceed with the amendment or the related redemption of our public shares at such time. 

If we do not consummate the
20Cube Business Combination or any other initial business combination by the deadline set forth in our amended and restated certificate
of incorporation, as amended, we expect that all costs and expenses associated with implementing our plan of dissolution, as well as payments
to any creditors, will be funded from amounts remaining out of the approximately 600,000 of proceeds held outside the trust account,
immediately following our initial public offering, although we cannot assure you that there will be sufficient funds for such purpose.
We will depend on sufficient interest being earned on the proceeds held in the trust account to pay any tax obligations we may owe. However,
if those funds are not sufficient to cover the costs and expenses associated with implementing our plan of dissolution, to the extent
that there is any interest accrued in the trust account not required to pay taxes on interest income earned on the trust account balance,
we may request the trustee to release to us an additional amount of up to 100,000 of such accrued interest to pay those costs and expenses. 

If we were to expend all of
the net proceeds of our initial public offering and the sale of the private placement warrants, other than the proceeds deposited in the
trust account, and without taking into account interest, if any, earned on the trust account, the per-share redemption amount received
by stockholders upon our dissolution would be approximately 10.00. The proceeds deposited in the trust account could, however, become
subject to the claims of our creditors which would have higher priority than the claims of our public stockholders. We cannot assure you
that the actual per-share redemption amount received by stockholders will not be substantially less than 10.00. Under Section 281(b)
of the DGCL, our plan of dissolution must provide for all claims against us to be paid in full or make provision for payments to be made
in full, as applicable, if there are sufficient assets. These claims must be paid or provided for before we make any distribution of our
remaining assets to our stockholders. While we intend to pay such amounts, if any, we cannot assure you that we will have funds sufficient
to pay or provide for all creditors claims. 

Although we will seek to have
all vendors, service providers, prospective target businesses or other entities with which we do business execute agreements with us waiving
any right, title, interest or claim of any kind in or to any monies held in the trust account for the benefit of our public stockholders,
there is no guarantee that they will execute such agreements or even if they execute such agreements that they would be prevented from
bringing claims against the trust account including but not limited to fraudulent inducement, breach of fiduciary responsibility or other
similar claims, as well as claims challenging the enforceability of the waiver, in each case in order to gain an advantage with respect
to a claim against our assets, including the funds held in the trust account. If any third party refuses to execute an agreement waiving
such claims to the monies held in the trust account, our management will perform an analysis of the alternatives available to it and will
only enter into an agreement with a third party that has not executed a waiver if management believes that such third party s engagement
would be significantly more beneficial to us than any alternative. Examples of possible instances where we may engage a third party that
refuses to execute a waiver include the engagement of a third-party consultant whose particular expertise or skills are believed
by management to be significantly superior to those of other consultants that would agree to execute a waiver or in cases where management
is unable to find a service provider willing to execute a waiver. KPMG and the underwriters of the offering did not execute agreements
with us waiving such claims to the monies held in the trust account. 

20 

In addition, there is no guarantee
that such entities will agree to waive any claims they may have in the future as a result of, or arising out of, any negotiations, contracts
or agreements with us and will not seek recourse against the trust account for any reason. Our sponsor has agreed that it will be liable
to us if and to the extent any claims by a third party for services rendered or products sold to us, or a prospective target business
with which we have entered into a written letter of intent, confidentiality or similar agreement or business combination agreement, reduce
the amount of funds in the trust account to below the lesser of (i) 10.00 per public share and (ii) the actual amount per public
share held in the trust account as of the date of the liquidation of the trust account, if less than 10.00 per share due to reductions
in the value of the trust assets, less taxes payable, provided that such liability will not apply to any claims by a third party or prospective
target business who executed a waiver of any and all rights to the monies held in the trust account (whether or not such waiver is enforceable)
nor will it apply to any claims under our indemnity of the underwriters of our initial public offering against certain liabilities, including
liabilities under the Securities Act. However, we have not asked our sponsor to reserve for such indemnification obligations, nor have
we independently verified whether our sponsor has sufficient funds to satisfy its indemnity obligations and believe that our sponsor s
only assets are securities of our company. Therefore, we cannot assure you that our sponsor would be able to satisfy those obligations.
None of our officers or directors will indemnify us for claims by third parties including, without limitation, claims by vendors and prospective
target businesses. 

In the event that the proceeds
in the trust account are reduced below (i) 10.00 per public share or (ii) such lesser amount per public share held in the trust
account as of the date of the liquidation of the trust account, due to reductions in value of the trust assets, in each case net of the
amount of interest which may be withdrawn to pay taxes, and our sponsor asserts that it is unable to satisfy its indemnification obligations
or that it has no indemnification obligations related to a particular claim, our independent directors would determine whether to take
legal action against our sponsor to enforce its indemnification obligations. While we currently expect that our independent directors
would take legal action on our behalf against our sponsor to enforce its indemnification obligations to us, it is possible that our independent
directors in exercising their business judgment may choose not to do so if, for example, the cost of such legal action is deemed by the
independent directors to be too high relative to the amount recoverable or if the independent directors determine that a favorable outcome
is not likely. We have not asked our sponsor to reserve for such indemnification obligations and we cannot assure you that our sponsor
would be able to satisfy those obligations. Accordingly, we cannot assure you that due to claims of creditors the actual value of the
per-share redemption price will not be less than 10.00 per public share. 

We will seek to reduce the
possibility that our sponsor will have to indemnify the trust account due to claims of creditors by endeavoring to have all vendors, service
providers, prospective target businesses or other entities with which we do business execute agreements with us waiving any right, title,
interest or claim of any kind in or to monies held in the trust account. Our sponsor will also not be liable as to any claims under our
indemnity of the underwriters of our initial public offering against certain liabilities, including liabilities under the Securities Act.
We will have access to up to approximately 1,000,000 with which to pay any such potential claims. In the event that we liquidate and
it is subsequently determined that the reserve for claims and liabilities is insufficient, stockholders who received funds from our trust
account could be liable for claims made by creditors. 

Under the DGCL, stockholders
may be held liable for claims by third parties against a corporation to the extent of distributions received by them in a dissolution.
The pro rata portion of our trust account distributed to our public stockholders upon the redemption of our public shares in the event
we do not complete our initial business combination by April 8, 2023 (subject to any further Extension as outlined above) may be considered
a liquidating distribution under Delaware law. If the corporation complies with certain procedures set forth in Section 280 of the
DGCL intended to ensure that it makes reasonable provision for all claims against it, including a 60-day notice period during which
any third-party claims can be brought against the corporation, a 90-day period during which the corporation may reject any claims
brought, and an additional 150-day waiting period before any liquidating distributions are made to stockholders, any liability of
stockholders with respect to a liquidating distribution is limited to the lesser of such stockholder s pro rata share of the claim
or the amount distributed to the stockholder, and any liability of the stockholder would be barred after the third anniversary of the
dissolution. 

21 

Furthermore, if the pro rata
portion of our trust account distributed to our public stockholders upon the redemption of our public shares in the event we do not complete
our initial business combination within 24 months from the closing of our initial public offering (subject to any Extension as outlined
above), is not considered a liquidating distribution under Delaware law and such redemption distribution is deemed to be unlawful (potentially
due to the imposition of legal proceedings that a party may bring or due to other circumstances that are currently unknown), then pursuant
to Section 174 of the DGCL, the statute of limitations for claims of creditors could then be six years after the unlawful redemption
distribution, instead of three years, as in the case of a liquidating distribution. In December 2022, our stockholders approved an amendment
to our amended and restated certificate of incorporation to authorize our board of directors to approve up to six successive extension
periods of one month each, through August 8, 2023. In February 2023, our board approved an initial extension until March 8, 2023 and further
extensions of up to five additional successive one-month periods, unless the board shall otherwise. At the date hereof, the current extension
period will terminate on April 8, 2023. If we are unable to complete our initial business combination by April 8, 2023 (subject to any
further Extension as outlined above), we will: (i) cease all operations except for the purpose of winding up, (ii) as promptly
as reasonably possible but not more than ten business days thereafter, redeem the public shares, at a per-share price, payable in
cash, equal to the aggregate amount then on deposit in the trust account including interest earned on the funds held in the trust account
and not previously released to us to pay our taxes (less up to 100,000 of interest to pay dissolution expenses), divided by the number
of then outstanding public shares, which redemption will completely extinguish public stockholders rights as stockholders (including
the right to receive further liquidating distributions, if any), subject to applicable law, and (iii) as promptly as reasonably possible
following such redemption, subject to the approval of our remaining stockholders and our board of directors, dissolve and liquidate, subject
in each case to our obligations under Delaware law to provide for claims of creditors and the requirements of other applicable law. As
such, our stockholders could potentially be liable for any claims to the extent of distributions received by them (but no more) and any
liability of our stockholders may extend well beyond the third anniversary of such date. 

Because we will not be complying
with Section 280, Section 281(b) of the DGCL requires us to adopt a plan, based on facts known to us at such time that will
provide for our payment of all existing and pending claims or claims that may be potentially brought against us within the subsequent
10 years. However, because we are a blank check company, rather than an operating company, and our operations will be limited to
searching for prospective target businesses to acquire, the only likely claims to arise would be from our vendors (such as lawyers, investment
bankers, etc.) or prospective target businesses. As described above, pursuant to the obligation contained in our underwriting agreement,
we will seek to have all vendors, service providers, prospective target businesses or other entities with which we do business execute
agreements with us waiving any right, title, interest or claim of any kind in or to any monies held in the trust account. As a result
of this obligation, the claims that could be made against us are significantly limited and the likelihood that any claim that would result
in any liability extending to the trust account is remote. Further, our sponsor may be liable only to the extent necessary to ensure that
the amounts in the trust account are not reduced below (i) 10.00 per public share or (ii) such lesser amount per public share held
in the trust account as of the date of the liquidation of the trust account, due to reductions in value of the trust assets, in each case
net of the amount of interest withdrawn to pay taxes and will not be liable as to any claims under our indemnity of the underwriters of
our initial public offering against certain liabilities, including liabilities under the Securities Act. In the event that an executed
waiver is deemed to be unenforceable against a third party, our sponsor will not be responsible to the extent of any liability for such
third-party claims. 

If we file a bankruptcy petition
or an involuntary bankruptcy petition is filed against us that is not dismissed, the proceeds held in the trust account could be subject
to applicable bankruptcy law, and may be included in our bankruptcy estate and subject to the claims of third parties with priority over
the claims of our stockholders. To the extent any bankruptcy claims deplete the trust account, we cannot assure you we will be able to
return 10.00 per share to our public stockholders. Additionally, if we file a bankruptcy petition or an involuntary bankruptcy petition
is filed against us that is not dismissed, any distributions received by stockholders could be viewed under applicable debtor/creditor
and/or bankruptcy laws as either a preferential transfer or a fraudulent conveyance. As a result, a bankruptcy
court could seek to recover some or all amounts received by our stockholders. Furthermore, our board of directors may be viewed as having
breached its fiduciary duty to our creditors and/or may have acted in bad faith, thereby exposing itself and our company to claims of
punitive damages, by paying public stockholders from the trust account prior to addressing the claims of creditors. We cannot assure you
that claims will not be brought against us for these reasons. 

22 

Our public stockholders will
be entitled to receive funds from the trust account only upon the earlier to occur of: (i) the completion of our initial business
combination, (ii) the redemption of any public shares properly tendered in connection with a stockholder vote to amend any provisions
of our amended and restated certificate of incorporation (A) to modify the substance or timing of our obligation to offer redemption
rights in connection with any proposed initial business combination or to redeem 100 of our public shares if we do not complete our initial
business combination by April 8, 2023 (subject to any further Extension as outlined above) or (B) with respect to any other provision
relating to stockholders rights or pre-initial business combination activity, and (iii) the redemption of all of our
public shares if we are unable to complete our business combination by April 8, 2023 (subject to any further Extension as outlined above),
subject to applicable law. In no other circumstances will a stockholder have any right or interest of any kind to or in the trust account.
In the event we seek stockholder approval in connection with our initial business combination, a stockholder s voting in connection
with the initial business combination alone will not result in a stockholder s redeeming its shares to us for an applicable pro
rata share of the trust account. Such stockholder must have also exercised its redemption rights as described above. These provisions
of our amended and restated certificate of incorporation, as amended like all provisions of our amended and restated certificate of incorporation,
as amended, may be amended with a stockholder vote. 

Competition 

In identifying, evaluating
and selecting a target business for our initial business combination, such as 20Cube, we have encountered competition from other entities
having a business objective similar to ours, including other blank check companies, private equity groups and leveraged buyout funds,
and operating businesses seeking strategic business combinations. Many of these entities are well established and have extensive experience
identifying and effecting business combinations directly or through affiliates. Moreover, many of these competitors possess greater financial,
technical, human and other resources than we do. Our ability to acquire larger target businesses is limited by our available financial
resources. This inherent limitation gives others an advantage in pursuing the initial business combination of a target business. Furthermore,
our obligation to pay cash in connection with our public stockholders who exercise their redemption rights may reduce the resources available
to us for our initial business combination and our outstanding warrants, and the future dilution they potentially represent, may not be
viewed favorably by certain target businesses. Either of these factors may place us at a competitive disadvantage in successfully negotiating
an initial business combination. 

Employees 

We currently have three officers.
These individuals are not obligated to devote any specific number of hours to our matters but they devote as much of their time as they
deem necessary to our affairs until we have completed our initial business combination. The amount of time they devote in any time period
varies based on the stage of the initial business combination process we are in. We do not intend to have any full-time employees
prior to the completion of our initial business combination. 

Periodic Reporting and Financial Information 

Our units, Class A common
stock and warrants are registered under the Exchange Act and have reporting obligations, including the requirement that we file annual,
quarterly and current reports with the SEC. In accordance with the requirements of the Exchange Act, our annual reports contain financial
statements audited and reported on by our independent registered public accountants. 

23 

We will provide stockholders
with audited financial statements of the prospective target business as part of the tender offer materials or proxy solicitation materials,
such as the 20Cube Registration Statement, sent to stockholders to assist them in assessing the target business. In all likelihood, these
financial statements will need to be prepared in accordance with, or reconciled to, GAAP, or IFRS, depending on the circumstances, and
the historical financial statements may be required to be audited in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. These financial statement
requirements may limit the pool of potential targets we may conduct an initial business combination with because some targets may be unable
to provide such statements in time for us to disclose such statements in accordance with federal proxy rules and complete our initial
business combination within the prescribed time frame. We cannot assure you that any particular target business identified by us as a
potential business combination candidate will have financial statements prepared in accordance with GAAP or that the potential target
business will be able to prepare its financial statements in accordance with the requirements outlined above. To the extent that these
requirements cannot be met, we may not be able to acquire the proposed target business. While this may limit the pool of potential business
combination candidates, we do not believe that this limitation will be material. 

We are required to evaluate
our internal control procedures for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2022 as required by the Sarbanes-Oxley Act. Only in the
event we are deemed to be a large accelerated filer or an accelerated filer, and no longer qualify as an emerging growth company, will
we be required to have our internal control procedures audited. A target company may not be in compliance with the provisions of the Sarbanes-Oxley
Act regarding adequacy of their internal controls. The development of the internal controls of any such entity to achieve compliance with
the Sarbanes-Oxley Act may increase the time and costs necessary to complete any such business combination. We have filed a Registration
Statement on Form 8-A with the SEC to voluntarily register our securities under Section 12 of the Exchange Act. As a result,
we are subject to the rules and regulations promulgated under the Exchange Act. We have no current intention of filing a Form 15
to suspend our reporting or other obligations under the Exchange Act prior or subsequent to the consummation of our initial business combination. 

We will remain an emerging
growth company until the earlier of (1) the last day of the fiscal year (a) following February 11, 2026, the fifth anniversary
of the completion of our initial public offering, (b) in which we have total annual gross revenue of at least 1.235 billion,
or (c) in which we are deemed to be a large accelerated filer, which means the market value of our shares of Class A common
stock that are held by non-affiliates exceeds 700 million as of the prior June 30 th , and (2) the date on which
we have issued more than 1.0 billion in non-convertible debt during the prior three-year period. 

Item 1A. Risk Factors. 

As a smaller reporting company
under Rule 12b-2 of the Exchange Act, we are not required to include risk factors in this Report. However, below is a partial list of
material risks, uncertainties and other factors that could have a material effect on the Company and its operations: 

we are a blank check company with no revenue or basis to evaluate our ability to select a suitable business target; 

we may not be able to select an appropriate target business or businesses and complete our initial business combination, including the 20Cube Business Combination, in the prescribed time frame; 

our expectations around the performance of a prospective target business or businesses, including 20Cube, may not be realized; 

we may not be successful in retaining or recruiting required officers, key employees or directors following our initial business combination; 

our officers and directors may have difficulties allocating their time between the Company and other businesses and may potentially have conflicts of interest with our business or in approving our initial business combination; 

we may not be able to obtain additional financing to complete our initial business combination, including the 20Cube Business Combination, or reduce the number of stockholders requesting redemption; 

24 

we may issue our shares to investors in connection with our initial business combination at a price that is less than the prevailing market price of our shares at that time; 

you may not be given the opportunity to choose the initial business target or to vote on the initial business combination; 

trust account funds may not be protected against third party claims or bankruptcy; 

the availability to us of funds from interest income on the trust account balance may be insufficient to operate our business prior to the business combination; 

our financial performance following a business combination with an entity may be negatively affected by their lack an established record of revenue, cash flows and experienced management; 

there may be more competition to find an attractive target for an initial business combination, which could increase the costs associated with completing our initial business combination and may result in our inability to find a suitable target; 

changes in the market for directors and officers liability insurance could make it more difficult and more expensive for us to negotiate and complete an initial business combination; 

if the 20Cube Business Combination is not consummated, we intend to liquidate; 

we may engage one or more of our underwriters or one of their respective affiliates to provide additional services to us after the initial public offering, which may include acting as a financial advisor in connection with an initial business combination or as placement agent in connection with a related financing transaction. Our underwriters are entitled to receive deferred underwriting commissions that will be released from the trust account only upon a completion of an initial business combination. These financial incentives may cause them to have potential conflicts of interest in rendering any such additional services to us after the initial public offering, including, for example, in connection with the sourcing and consummation of an initial business combination; 

our warrants are accounted for as derivative liabilities and are recorded at fair value upon issuance with changes in fair value each period reported in earnings, which may have an adverse effect on the market price of our common stock or may make it more difficult for us to consummate an initial business combination; 

since our initial stockholders will lose their entire investment in us if our initial business combination is not completed (other than with respect to any public shares they may acquire during or after this offering), and because our sponsor, officers and directors may profit substantially even under circumstances in which our public stockholders would experience losses in connection with their investment, a conflict of interest may arise in determining whether a particular business combination target is appropriate for our initial business combination; 

changes in laws or regulations or how such laws or regulations are interpreted or applied, or a failure to comply with any laws or regulations, may adversely affect our business, including our ability to negotiate and complete our initial business combination, and results of operations; 

the value of the founder shares following completion of our initial business combination is likely to be substantially higher than the nominal price paid for them, even if the trading price of our common stock at such time is substantially less than 10.00 per share; 

the per-share redemption amount received by stockholders may be substantially less than 10.00; 

25 

resources
could be wasted in researching acquisitions that are not completed, which could materially adversely affect subsequent attempts to locate
and acquire or merge with another business. If we have not completed our initial business combination within the required time period,
our public stockholders may receive only approximately 10.00 per share, or less than such amount in certain circumstances, on the liquidation
of our trust account and our warrants will expire worthless; 

in March 2022, the SEC issued proposed
rules relating to certain activities of SPACs. Certain of the procedures that we or a potential business combination target, or others,
may determine to undertake in connection with such proposals may increase our costs and the time needed to complete our initial business
combination and may constrain the circumstances under which we could complete an initial business combination. The need for compliance
with such proposals may cause us to liquidate the funds in the trust account or liquidate the Company at an earlier time than we might
otherwise choose; 

if we are deemed to be an investment company for purposes of the Investment Company Act, we may abandon our efforts to complete an initial business combination and instead liquidate the Company; 

to mitigate the risk that we might be deemed to be an investment company for purposes of the Investment Company Act, we have instructed the trustee to liquidate the investments held in the trust account and instead to hold the funds in the trust account in a demand deposit account at a bank until the earlier of the consummation of our initial business combination or our liquidation. As a result, following the liquidation of investments in the trust account, we would likely receive less interest on the funds held in the trust account, which would likely reduce the dollar amount our public stockholders would receive upon any redemption or liquidation of the Company; 

we may not be able to complete an initial business combination with certain potential target companies if a proposed transaction with the target company may be subject to review or approval by regulatory authorities pursuant to certain U.S. or foreign laws or regulations, including the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States; 

recent increases in inflation and interest rates in the United States and elsewhere could make it more difficult for us to consummate an initial business combination such as the 20Cube Business Combination; 

military conflict in Ukraine or elsewhere may lead to increased price volatility for publicly traded securities, which could make it more difficult for us to consummate an initial business combination such as the 20Cube Business Combination; 

a 1 U.S. federal excise tax may be imposed on us in connection with our redemptions of shares in connection with a business combination or other stockholder vote pursuant to which stockholders would have a right to submit their shares for redemption; and

Cautionary Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements 

All statements other than
statements of historical fact included in this Report including, without limitation, statements in this section regarding our financial
position, business strategy and the plans and objectives of management for future operations, are forward-looking statements. When used
in this Report, words such as anticipate, believe, estimate, expect, intend 
and similar expressions, as they relate to us or our management, identify forward-looking statements. Such forward-looking statements
are based on the beliefs of management, as well as assumptions made by, and information currently available to, our management. Actual
results could differ materially from those contemplated by the forward- looking statements as a result of certain factors detailed in
our filings with the SEC. All subsequent written or oral forward-looking statements attributable to us or persons acting on the Company s
behalf are qualified in their entirety by this paragraph. 

The following discussion and
analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with the financial statements and the notes
thereto contained elsewhere in this Report. 

Overview 

We are a blank check company
incorporated as a Delaware corporation and formed for the purpose of effecting a merger, capital stock exchange, asset acquisition, stock
purchase, reorganization or similar business combination with one or more businesses, which we refer to as our initial business combination. 

We intend to effectuate our
initial business combination using cash from the proceeds of our initial public offering that closed on February 11, 2021 and the sale
of the private placement warrants in the private placement, and from additional issuances of, if any, our capital stock and our debt,
or a combination of cash, stock and debt. On October 18, 2022, the Company entered into the 20Cube Business Combination Agreement with
Pubco, Merger Sub, 20Cube and the Signing Sellers. For more information on the 20Cube Business Combination and the equity and financing
arrangements associated therewith, please see 20Cube Business Combination Agreement above. 

As of December 31, 2022,
we had current assets of 607,268 and current liabilities of 1,805,935. As of December 31, 2021, we had current assets of 411,265 and
current liabilities of 84,058. Further, we expect to continue to incur significant costs in the pursuit of our acquisition plans.

Recent Developments 

On October 18, 2022, the Company,
20Cube, Pubco, Merger Sub and the Signing Sellers entered into the 20Cube Business Combination Agreement pursuant to which (a) Merger
Sub will merge with and into the Company, with the Company continuing as the surviving company, as a result of which (i) the Company will
become a wholly-owned subsidiary of Pubco, (ii) each issued and outstanding security of the Company immediately prior to the Effective
Time of the Merger will no longer be outstanding and will be canceled, in exchange for the right of the holder thereof to receive a substantially
equivalent security to be issued by Pubco, and (b) Pubco will (i) acquire the issued and outstanding ordinary shares of 20Cube from the
Signing Sellers and each additional holder of 20Cube shares that becomes a party to the 20Cube Business Combination Agreement in exchange
for ordinary shares of Pubco, (ii) all outstanding in-the-money vested options exercisable for 20Cube ordinary shares will be canceled
and extinguished and automatically converted into the right to receive Pubco ordinary shares at the exchange ratio applicable to subsection
(b)(i) of this paragraph less the exercise price for such option, and (iii) all outstanding unvested options exercisable for ordinary
shares in 20Cube shall be assumed by Pubco and replaced with options exercisable for Pubco ordinary shares, all upon the terms and subject
to the conditions set forth in the 20Cube Business Combination Agreement and in accordance with the provisions of applicable law. 

For a full description of
the 20Cube Merger Agreement and the proposed 20Cube Business Combination, please see Item 1. Business. 

Results of Operations 

For the year ended
December 31, 2022, we had net income of 3,971,796 of which 4,460,924 is related to the change in the fair value of the warranty
liability, 1,669,542 is related to the gain on marketable securities held in trust account, and 1,304,061 is related to the professional
service fees. For the year ended December 31, 2021, we had net income of 7,955,328, of which 9,578,671 is related to the change in the
fair value of the warrant liability. Our business activities from inception to December 31, 2021 consisted primarily of our formation
and completing our initial public offering, and since our initial public offering, our activity has been limited to identifying and evaluating
prospective acquisition targets for our initial business combination. 

Liquidity and Capital Resources 

Prior to the closing of our
initial public offering, our only source of liquidity was an initial sale of founder shares, to our sponsor, and the proceeds of the Note.
The Note was repaid upon the closing of the initial public offering. 

On April 6, 2022, the sponsor agreed to loan the Company an aggregate
of up to 1,500,000 to cover expenses pursuant to the 2022 Note. The 2022 Note does not bear interest and is payable upon the completion
of an Initial Business Combination. As of December 31, 2022, there was 1,000,000 outstanding on this 2022 Note. 

The IPO Registration Statement
was declared effective by the SEC on February 8, 2021. On February 9, 2021, the underwriters exercised their option to purchase additional
units. Our initial public offering of 12,500,500 units, including 1,630,500 units pursuant to the underwriters exercise of such
option, closed on February 11, 2021. Simultaneously with the closing of our initial public offering, we consummated the sale of an aggregate
of 4,250,100 private placement warrants, each exercisable to purchase one share of our Class A common stock, par value 0.0001 per
share, at an exercise price of 11.50 per share, to our sponsor, at a price of 1.00 per private placement warrant, generating proceeds
of 4,250,100. On February 11, 2021, we placed 125,005,000 of proceeds (including 4,375,175 of deferred underwriting discount) from
the initial public offering and the private placement warrants into the trust account, with Continental acting as trustee. 

In connection with the Special
Meeting, stockholders holding 11,538,407 public shares exercised their right to redeem their shares for a pro rata portion of the funds
in the trust account. As a result, approximately 116,366,572 (approximately 10.08 per public share) was removed from the trust account
to pay such holders. At December 31, 2022 and 2021, we had cash held in a custodian account of 607,268 and 402,215, respectively,
and working capital of 1,198,667) and 327,207, respectively. 

30 

We do not believe we will
need to raise additional funds in order to meet the expenditures required for operating our business prior to our initial business combination
apart from making additional drawdowns on the 2022 Note. However, if our estimates of the costs of identifying a target business, undertaking
in-depth due diligence and negotiating an initial business combination are less than the actual amount necessary to do so, we may have
insufficient funds available to operate our business prior to our initial business combination. Moreover, we may need to obtain additional
financing either to completer our initial business combination or because we become obligated to redeem a significant number of our shares
of Class A common stock upon completion of our initial business combination, in which case we may issue additional securities or incur
debt in connection with such initial business combination (including from our affiliates or affiliates of our sponsor). 

For more information on the
financing for the 20Cube Business Combination, please see Item 1. Business. 

Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements 

We have no obligations, assets
or liabilities which would be considered off-balance sheet arrangements. We do not participate in transactions that create relationships
with unconsolidated entities or financial partnerships, often referred to as variable interest entities, which would have been established
for the purpose of facilitating off-balance sheet arrangements. 

We have not entered into any off-balance sheet
financing arrangements, established any SPACs, guaranteed any debt or commitments of other entities, or entered into any non-financial agreements
involving assets. 

Contractual Obligations 

As of December 31, 2022
and 2021, we did not have any long-term debt, capital lease obligations, operating lease obligations or long-term liabilities. On February
8, 2021, we entered into an administrative support agreement pursuant to which we have agreed to pay our sponsor a total of 10,000 per
month for office space, administrative and support services. These fees were suspended as of February 28, 2022. For the year ended December
31, 2022, the Company incurred expenses of 20,000 under this agreement. 

The underwriters of our initial
public offering are entitled to underwriting discounts and commissions of 5.5 , of which 2.0 (or 2,500,100) was paid at the closing
of the initial public offering and 3.5 (or 4,375,175) was deferred. The deferred underwriting discount will be paid to the underwriters
upon the completion of our initial business combination. 

Critical Accounting Policies/Estimates 

The preparation of financial
statements and related disclosures in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported
amounts of assets and liabilities, disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the condensed financial statements,
and expenses during the periods reported. Actual results could materially differ from those estimates. We have identified the following
as our critical accounting policies: 

Net Income Per Share of Common Stock 

Net income per share of common
stock is computed by dividing net income by the weighted average number of shares of common stock outstanding during the period. We apply
the two-class method in calculating earnings per share. Accretion associated with the redeemable shares of Class A common
stock is excluded from earnings per share as the redemption value approximates fair value. 

As of December 31, 2022
and 2021, we had outstanding warrants to purchase up to 10,500,350 shares of Class A common stock. The weighted average of these
shares was excluded from the calculation of diluted net income per share of common stock since the exercise of the warrants is contingent
upon the occurrence of future events. As of December 31, 2022, we did not have any dilutive securities or other contracts that could,
potentially, be exercised or converted into shares of common stock and then share in our earnings. As a result, diluted net income per
share of common stock is the same as basic net income per share of common stock for the periods. 

31 

Redeemable Shares of Class A Common Stock 

All of the 12,500,500 shares
of Class A common stock sold as parts of the units in our initial public offering contain a redemption feature. In accordance with the
FASB ASC Topic 480-10-S99-3A Distinguishing Liabilities from Equity ASC 480 ), Classification and Measurement
of Redeemable Securities , redemption provisions not solely within the control of the Company require the security to be classified
outside of permanent equity. Ordinary liquidation events, which involve the redemption and liquidation of all of the entity s equity
instruments, are excluded from the provisions of ASC 480. The Company classifies all shares of Class A common stock as redeemable. 

Warrant Liability 

We account for the warrants
in accordance with the guidance contained in FASB ASC Topic 815 Derivatives and Hedging ASC 815 ), under
which the warrants do not meet the criteria for equity treatment and must be recorded as derivative liabilities. Accordingly, we classify
the warrants as liabilities at their fair value and adjusts the warrants to fair value at each reporting period. This liability is subject
to re-measurement at each balance sheet date until the warrants are exercised, and any change in fair value is recognized in
our statement of operations. The fair value of the private placement warrants and public warrants issued in connection with our initial
public offering are measured using a Black-Scholes-Merton model and listed market price of such public warrants. 

Recent Accounting Pronouncements 

Management does not believe
that any recently issued, but not yet effective, accounting pronouncements, if currently adopted, would have a material effect on our
financial statements. 

Factors That May Adversely
Affect our Results of Operations 

Our
results of operations and our ability to complete an initial business combination may be adversely affected by various factors that could
cause economic uncertainty and volatility in the financial markets, many of which are beyond our control. Our business could be impacted
by, among other things, downturns in the financial markets or in economic conditions, increases in oil prices, inflation, increases in
interest rates, supply chain disruptions, declines in consumer confidence and spending, the ongoing effects of the COVID-19 pandemic,
including resurgences and the emergence of new variants, and geopolitical instability, such as the military conflict in Ukraine. We cannot
at this time fully predict the likelihood of one or more of the above events, their duration or magnitude or the extent to which they
may negatively impact our business and our ability to complete initial business combination. 

Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk. 

We are a smaller reporting
company as defined by Rule 12b-2 of the Exchange Act and are not required to provide the information otherwise required under this Item. 

Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data. 

Reference is made to pages
F-1 through F-20 comprising a portion of this Report, which are incorporated herein by reference. 

Item 9. Changes in and Disagreements with Accountants on Accounting
and Financial Disclosure. 

None. 

Item 9A. Controls and Procedures. 

Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures 

Disclosure controls and procedures
are controls and other procedures designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in our reports filed or submitted under
the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC s rules and forms.
Disclosure controls and procedures include, without limitation, controls and procedures designed to ensure that information required to
be disclosed in our reports filed or submitted under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to management, including our Chief
Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer (together, the Certifying Officers ), or persons performing similar functions,
as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. 

32 

Under
the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our Certifying Officers, we carried out an evaluation of the effectiveness
of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act.
Based on the foregoing, our Certifying Officers concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of the end of
the period covered by this Report. 

We
do not expect that our disclosure controls and procedures will prevent all errors and all instances of fraud. Disclosure controls and
procedures, no matter how well conceived and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the objectives of the
disclosure controls and procedures are met. Further, the design of disclosure controls and procedures must reflect the fact that there
are resource constraints, and the benefits must be considered relative to their costs. Because of the inherent limitations in all disclosure
controls and procedures, no evaluation of disclosure controls and procedures can provide absolute assurance that we have detected all
our control deficiencies and instances of fraud, if any. The design of disclosure controls and procedures also is based partly on certain
assumptions about the likelihood of future events, and there can be no assurance that any design will succeed in achieving its stated
goals under all potential future conditions. 

Management s Annual Report on Internal
Control over Financial Reporting 

As required by SEC rules and
regulations implementing Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate
internal control over financial reporting. Our internal control over financial reporting is designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding
the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of our financial statements for external reporting purposes in accordance with
GAAP. Our internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that: 

(1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail,
accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of our company, 

(2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as
necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with GAAP, and that our receipts and expenditures are being made
only in accordance with authorizations of our management and directors, and 

(3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection
of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of our assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements. 

Because
of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect errors or misstatements in our financial
statements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate
because of changes in conditions, or that the degree or compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. Management assessed
the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting at December 31, 2022. In making these assessments, management used
the criteria set forth by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO) in Internal Control Integrated
Framework (2013). Based on our assessments and those criteria, management determined that we did maintain effective internal control over
financial reporting as of December 31, 2022. 

This Report does not include
an attestation report of internal control over financial reporting from our independent registered public accounting firm due to our status
as an emerging growth company under the JOBS Act. 

Changes in Internal Control over Financial
Reporting 

There have been no changes
to our internal control over financial reporting during the fiscal year ended December 31, 2022 that materially affected, or are reasonably
likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting. 

Item 9B. Other Information.

of Tokai Tokyo Financial Holdings Company Ltd. (TYO: 8616), where he at times served as a member of the audit and supervisory committee
and advisory committee on nominations and compensation. Mr. Kashiwagi holds a Bachelor of Arts in Economics from Keio University
and a Master in Public Affairs from Princeton University. Mr. Kashiwagi was selected to serve on our board of directors for his extensive
experience as a policy maker in the Japanese government, his background as an independent non-executive board member of Japanese
publicly listed companies, and his standing in international organizations.

Takahiro Fushimi has served
as one of our independent directors since our initial public offering. Since October 2016, Mr. Fushimi has been an executive director
of C4 Capital for New Commons, a firm that focuses on social impact investing. In January 2020, Mr. Fushimi founded ICHI Commons

Mr. Fushimi holds a Bachelor of Arts in Law from Keio University. He was selected to join the board of directors for his notable
insight into the technology industry and ties with private technology companies and leading organizations in Japan. 

Number and Terms of Office of Officers and
Directors 

We have seven directors. Our
board of directors is divided into three classes with only one class of directors being elected in each year and each class (except for
those directors appointed prior to our first annual meeting of stockholders) serving a three-year term. In accordance with Nasdaq
corporate governance requirements, we were not required to hold an annual meeting until one year after our first fiscal year end following
our listing on Nasdaq. The term of office of the first class of directors, consisting of Messrs. Valentine and MacLean, expired at our
first annual meeting of stockholders. At our Special Meeting, which was held in lieu of our first annual meeting of stockholders, Messrs.
Valentine and MacLean were re-elected to serve until the annual meeting of the Company to be held in 2025 or until their successors are
appointed and qualified. The term of office of the second class of directors, consisting of Ms. Miyashita, Mr. Fushimi and Mr. Kashiwagi,
will expire at the second annual meeting of stockholders. The term of office of the third class of directors, consisting of Messrs. Lerch
and Chisholm will expire at the third annual meeting of stockholders. 

Our officers are appointed
by the board of directors and serve at the discretion of the board of directors, rather than for specific terms of office. Our board of
directors is authorized to appoint persons to the offices set forth in our bylaws as it deems appropriate. Our bylaws provide that our
officers may consist of a Chairman of the Board, Chief Executive Officer, Chief Financial Officer, President, Vice Presidents, Secretary,
Treasurer, Assistant Secretaries and such other offices as may be determined by the board of directors. 

Committees of the Board of Directors 

Our board of directors have
two standing committees: an audit committee and a compensation committee. Subject to phase-in rules and a limited exception, Nasdaq
rules and Rule 10A-3 of the Exchange Act require that the audit committee of a listed company be comprised solely of independent
directors, and Nasdaq rules require that the compensation committee of a listed company be comprised solely of independent directors.
Each committee operates under a charter that has been approved by our board and has the composition and responsibilities described below. 

Audit Committee 

We have established an audit
committee of the board of directors. Messrs. Kashiwagi, Fushimi and MacLean serve as members of our audit committee, and Mr. MacLean
chairs the audit committee. Under the Nasdaq listing standards and applicable SEC rules, we are required to have at least three members
of the audit committee, all of whom must be independent. Each of Messrs. Kashiwagi, Fushimi and MacLean meet the independent director
standard under Nasdaq listing standards and under Rule 10-A-3(b)(1) of the Exchange Act. 

Each member of the audit committee
is financially literate and our board of directors has determined that Mr. MacLean qualifies as an audit committee financial expert 
as defined in applicable SEC rules. 

36 

We have adopted
an audit committee charter, which details the principal functions of the audit committee, including: 

the appointment, compensation, retention, replacement, and oversight of the work of the independent registered public accounting firm engaged by us; 

pre-approving all audit and permitted non-audit services to be provided by the independent registered public accounting firm engaged by us, and establishing pre-approval policies and procedures; 

setting clear hiring policies for employees or former employees of the independent registered public accounting firm, including but not limited to, as required by applicable laws and regulations; 

setting clear policies for audit partner rotation in compliance with applicable laws and regulations; 

obtaining and reviewing a report, at least annually, from the independent registered public accounting firm describing (i) the independent registered public accounting firm s internal quality-control procedures, (ii) any material issues raised by the most recent internal quality-control review, or peer review, of the audit firm, or by any inquiry or investigation by governmental or professional authorities within the preceding five years respecting one or more independent audits carried out by the firm and any steps taken to deal with such issues and (iii) all relationships between the independent registered public accounting firm and us to assess the independent registered public accounting firm s independence; 

reviewing and approving any related party transaction required to be disclosed pursuant to Item 404 of Regulation S-K promulgated by the SEC prior to us entering into such transaction; and 

reviewing with management, the independent registered public accounting firm, and our legal advisors, as appropriate, any legal, regulatory or compliance matters, including any correspondence with regulators or government agencies and any employee complaints or published reports that raise material issues regarding our financial statements or accounting policies and any significant changes in accounting standards or rules promulgated by FASB, the SEC or other regulatory authorities. 

Compensation Committee 

We have established a compensation
committee of the board of directors. Messrs. Valentine and MacLean serve as members of our compensation committee. Under the Nasdaq listing
standards and applicable SEC rules, we are required to have at least two members of the compensation committee, all of whom must be independent.
Messrs. Valentine and MacLean are independent and Mr. Valentine chairs the compensation committee. 

We have adopted a compensation
committee charter, which details the principal functions of the compensation committee, including: 

reviewing and approving on an annual basis the corporate goals and objectives relevant to our Chief Executive Officer s compensation, if any is paid by us, evaluating our Chief Executive Officer s performance in light of such goals and objectives and determining and approving the remuneration (if any) of our Chief Executive Officer based on such evaluation; 

reviewing and approving on an annual basis the compensation, if any is paid by us, of all of our other officers; 

reviewing on an annual basis our executive compensation policies and plans; 

implementing and administering our incentive compensation equity-based remuneration plans; 

assisting management in complying with our proxy statement and annual report disclosure requirements; 

approving all special perquisites, special cash payments and other special compensation and benefit arrangements for our officers and employees; 

if required, producing a report on executive compensation to be included in our annual proxy statement; and 

reviewing, evaluating and recommending changes, if appropriate, to the remuneration for directors. 

37 

Notwithstanding the foregoing,
as indicated above, other than the payment to our sponsor of 10,000 per month, for office space, utilities and secretarial and administrative
support and reimbursement of expenses, no compensation of any kind, including finders, consulting or other similar fees, has been or will
be paid to any of our existing stockholders, officers, directors or any of their respective affiliates, prior to, or for any services
they render in order to effectuate the consummation of an initial business combination. Accordingly, it is likely that prior to the consummation
of an initial business combination, the compensation committee will only be responsible for the review and recommendation of any compensation
arrangements to be entered into in connection with such initial business combination. 

The charter also provides
that the compensation committee may, in its sole discretion, retain or obtain the advice of a compensation consultant, legal counsel or
other adviser and will be directly responsible for the appointment, compensation and oversight of the work of any such adviser. However,
before engaging or receiving advice from a compensation consultant, external legal counsel or any other adviser, the compensation committee
will consider the independence of each such adviser, including the factors required by Nasdaq and the SEC. 

Director Nominations 

We do not have a standing
nominating committee though we intend to form a corporate governance and nominating committee as and when required to do so by law or
Nasdaq rules. In accordance with Rule 5605 of the Nasdaq rules, a majority of the independent directors may recommend a director
nominee for selection by the board of directors. The board of directors believes that the independent directors can satisfactorily carry
out the responsibility of properly selecting or approving director nominees without the formation of a standing nominating committee.
The directors who will participate in the consideration and recommendation of director nominees are Messrs. MacLean, Valentine and Kashiwagi.
In accordance with Rule 5605 of the Nasdaq rules, all such directors are independent. As there is no standing nominating committee,
we do not have a nominating committee charter in place. 

The board of directors will
also consider director candidates recommended for nomination by our stockholders during such times as they are seeking proposed nominees
to stand for election at the next annual meeting of stockholders (or, if applicable, a special meeting of stockholders). Our stockholders
that wish to nominate a director for election to our board of directors should follow the procedures set forth in our bylaws. 

We have not formally established
any specific, minimum qualifications that must be met or skills that are necessary for directors to possess. In general, in identifying
and evaluating nominees for director, the board of directors considers educational background, diversity of professional experience, knowledge
of our business, integrity, professional reputation, independence, wisdom, and the ability to represent the best interests of our stockholders. 

Code of Ethics 

We have filed a copy of our
form of Code of Ethics, our audit committee charter, and our compensation committee charter as exhibits to the IPO Registration Statement.
You will be able to review these documents by accessing our public filings at the SEC s web site at www.sec.gov. In addition, a
copy of the Code of Ethics will be provided without charge upon request from us. We intend to disclose any amendments to or waivers of
certain provisions of our Code of Ethics in a Current Report on Form 8-K. 

Delinquent Section 16(a) Reports 

Section 16(a) of the Exchange
Act requires our executive officers, directors and persons who beneficially own more than 10 of a registered class of our equity securities
to file with the SEC initial reports of ownership and reports of changes in ownership of our common stock and other equity securities.
These executive officers, directors, and greater than 10 beneficial owners are required by SEC regulation to furnish us with copies of
all Section 16(a) forms filed by such reporting persons. Based solely on our review of such forms furnished to us and written representations
from certain reporting persons, we believe that during the year ended December 31, 2022, all reports applicable to our executive officers,
directors and greater than 10 beneficial owners were filed in a timely manner in accordance with Section 16(a) of the Exchange Act, except
as set forth below: 

In January 2023, Red Dawn
Capital LLC failed to timely file one Form 3. 

38 

Item 11. Executive Compensation 

None of our officers has received
any cash compensation for services rendered to us. We paid our sponsor a total of 10,000 per month for office space, utilities and secretarial
and administrative support. These fees were suspended as of February 28, 2022. No compensation of any kind, including any finder s
fee, reimbursement or consulting fee, are paid by us to our sponsor, officers and directors, or any affiliate of our sponsor or officers,
prior to, or in connection with any services rendered in order to effectuate, the consummation of our initial business combination (regardless
of the type of transaction that it is). However, these individuals are reimbursed for any out-of-pocket expenses incurred in connection
with activities on our behalf such as identifying potential target businesses and performing due diligence on suitable business combinations.
We do not have a policy that prohibits our sponsor, executive officers or directors, or any of their respective affiliates, from negotiating
for the reimbursement of out-of-pocket expenses by a target business. Our audit committee reviews on a quarterly basis all payments
that were made to our sponsor, officers or directors, or our or their affiliates. Any such payments prior to an initial business combination
are made using funds held outside the trust account. Other than quarterly audit committee review of such payments, we do not expect to
have any additional controls in place governing our reimbursement payments to our directors and executive officers for their out-of-pocket
expenses incurred in connection with identifying and consummating an initial business combination. 

After the completion of our
initial business combination, directors or members of our management team who remain with us may be paid consulting or management fees
from the combined company. All of these fees will be fully disclosed to stockholders, to the extent then known, in the tender offer materials
or proxy solicitation materials furnished to our stockholders in connection with a proposed initial business combination. We have not
established any limit on the amount of such fees that may be paid by the combined company to our directors or members of management. It
is unlikely the amount of such compensation will be known at the time of the proposed initial business combination, because the directors
of the post-combination business will be responsible for determining officer and director compensation. Any compensation to be paid
to our officers will be determined, or recommended to the board of directors for determination, either by a compensation committee constituted
solely by independent directors or by a majority of the independent directors on our board of directors. 

We will not take any action
to ensure that members of our management team maintain their positions with us after the consummation of our initial business combination,
although it is possible that some or all of our officers and directors may negotiate employment or consulting arrangements to remain with
us after our initial business combination. The existence or terms of any such employment or consulting arrangements to retain their positions
with us may influence our management s motivation in identifying or selecting a target business but we do not believe that the ability
of our management to remain with us after the consummation of our initial business combination will be a determining factor in our decision
to proceed with any potential business combination. We are not party to any agreements with our officers and directors that provide for
benefits upon termination of employment. 

Item 12. Security Ownership of Certain Beneficial Owners and Management
and Related Stockholder Matters. 

The following table sets
forth information regarding the beneficial ownership of our common stock as of March 28, 2023, based on information
obtained from the persons named below, with respect to the beneficial ownership of common stock, by: 

each person known by us to be the beneficial owner of more than 5 of our outstanding common stock; 

each of our executive officers and directors that beneficially owns our common stock; and 

all our executive officers and directors as a group. 

39 

In the table below,
percentage ownership is based on 4,087,218 shares of our common stock, consisting of (i) 962,093 shares of our Class A common stock
and (ii) 3,125,125 shares of our Class B common stock, issued and outstanding as of March 28, 2023. Except as otherwise
required by law or the Company s amended and restated certificate of incorporation, on all matters to be voted upon, holders
of the shares of Class A common stock and shares of Class B common stock vote together as a single class. Currently, all of the
shares of Class B common stock are convertible into Class A common stock on a one-for-one basis. 

Unless otherwise indicated,
we believe that all persons named in the table have sole voting and investment power with respect to all shares of common stock beneficially
owned by them. The following table does not reflect record or beneficial ownership of the private placement warrants as these warrants
are not exercisable within 60 days of the date of this Report.

Item 13. Certain Relationships and Related Transactions, and Director
Independence. 

In December 2020, our
sponsor paid 25,000, or 0.009 per share, to cover certain offering and formation costs in exchange for 2,875,000 founder shares. In
February 2021, we effected a stock dividend of approximately 0.087 shares for each share of Class B common stock outstanding, resulting
in our initial stockholders holding an aggregate of 3,125,125 founder shares. The number of founder shares issued was determined based
on the expectation that such founder shares would represent 20 of the outstanding shares upon completion of our initial public offering.
The founder shares (including the Class A common stock issuable upon exercise thereof) may not, subject to certain limited exceptions,
be transferred, assigned or sold by the holder. 

Our sponsor purchased of an
aggregate of 4,250,100 private placement warrants for a purchase price of 1.00 per warrant in a private placement that occurred simultaneously
with the closing of our initial public offering. Each private placement warrant entitles the holder thereof to purchase one share of our
Class A common stock at a price of 11.50 per share. The private placement warrants (including the Class A common stock issuable upon
exercise thereof) may not, subject to certain limited exceptions, be transferred, assigned or sold by the holder until 30 days after the
completion of our initial business combination. 

If any of our officers or
directors becomes aware of an initial business combination opportunity that falls within the line of business of any entity to which he
or she has then-current fiduciary or contractual obligations, he or she will honor his or her fiduciary or contractual obligations
to present such business combination opportunity to such other entity. Our officers and directors currently have certain relevant fiduciary
duties or contractual obligations that may take priority over their duties to us. 

Since February 2021, we have
paid our sponsor a total of 10,000 per month for office space, utilities and secretarial and administrative support services. These fees
were suspended as of February 28, 2022. 

Other than the foregoing,
no compensation of any kind, including any finder s fee, reimbursement, consulting fee or monies in respect of any payment of a
loan, has been or will be paid by us to our sponsor, officers and directors, or any affiliate of our sponsor or officers, prior to, or
in connection with any services rendered in order to effectuate, the consummation of an initial business combination (regardless of the
type of transaction that it is). However, these individuals are reimbursed for any out-of-pocket expenses incurred in connection
with activities on our behalf such as identifying potential target businesses and performing due diligence on suitable business combinations.
We do not have a policy that prohibits our sponsor, executive officers or directors, or any of their respective affiliates, from negotiating
for the reimbursement of out-of-pocket expenses by a target business. Our audit committee reviews on a quarterly basis all payments
that were made to our sponsor, officers, directors or our or their affiliates and will determine which expenses and the amount of expenses
that will be reimbursed. There is no cap or ceiling on the reimbursement of out-of-pocket expenses incurred by such persons in connection
with activities on our behalf. 

In addition, in order to finance
transaction costs in connection with an intended initial business combination, our sponsor or an affiliate of our sponsor or certain of
our officers and directors may, but are not obligated to, loan us funds on a non-interest bearing basis as may be required. If we
complete an initial business combination, we would repay such loaned amounts. In the event that the initial business combination does
not close, we may use a portion of the working capital held outside the trust account to repay such loaned amounts but no proceeds from
our trust account would be used for such repayment. Up to 1,500,000 of such loans may be convertible into warrants at a price of 1.00
per warrant at the option of the lender. The warrants would be identical to the private placement warrants, including as to exercise price,
exercisability and exercise period. We do not expect to seek loans from parties other than our sponsor or an affiliate of our sponsor
as we do not believe third parties will be willing to loan such funds and provide a waiver against any and all rights to seek access to
funds in our trust account. 

After our initial business
combination, members of our management team who remain with us may be paid consulting, management or other fees from the combined company
with any and all amounts being fully disclosed to our stockholders, to the extent then known, in the tender offer or proxy solicitation
materials, as applicable, furnished to our stockholders. It is unlikely the amount of such compensation will be known at the time of distribution
of such tender offer materials or at the time of a stockholder meeting held to consider our initial business combination, as applicable,
as it will be up to the directors of the post-combination business to determine executive and director compensation. 

41 

Prior to the closing of our
initial public offering, our only source of liquidity was an initial sale of founder shares, to our sponsor, and the proceeds of the Note.
The Note was repaid upon the closing of the Public Offering. 

On April 6, 2022, the Company
issued the 2022 Note in the principal amount of up to 1,500,000 to the sponsor. The 2022 Note was issued in connection with advances
the sponsor will make to the Company for working capital expenses. The 2022 Note bears no interest and is due and payable on the date
on which the Company consummates its initial business combination. The principal balance may not be prepaid without the sponsor s
written consent. At the election of the sponsor, all or a portion of the unpaid principal amount of the April 6 Note may be converted
into warrants at a price of 1.00 per warrant (the Conversion Warrants ). The Conversion Warrants would be identical to the
warrants issued by the Company to the sponsor in a private placement in connection with the Company s initial public offering. The
Conversion Warrants and their underlying securities are entitled to the registration rights set forth in the 2022 Note. As of December
31, 2022, there was 1,000,000 outstanding on the 2022 Note. 

On the February 3, 2023, meeting,
the board approved a one-month extension to March 8, 2023, plus up to five additional automatic one-month extensions, unless the board
determines otherwise. Our board resolved to authorize an Extension of the deadline for completing our business combination to April 8,
2023. 

For more information on the
agreements entered into in connection with the 20Cube Business Combination, please see Item 1. Business. 

Director Independence 

Nasdaq listing standards require
that a majority of our board of directors be independent. An independent director is defined generally as a person other
than an officer or employee of the company or its subsidiaries or any other individual having a relationship which in the opinion of the
company s board of directors, would interfere with the director s exercise of independent judgment in carrying out the responsibilities
of a director. Our board of directors has determined that Messrs. MacLean, Fushimi, Valentine and Kashiwagi are independent directors 
as defined in the Nasdaq listing standards and applicable SEC rules. Our independent directors will have regularly scheduled meetings
at which only independent directors are present. 

Item 14 . Principal Accountant Fees and
Services. 

The following is a summary
of fees paid or to be paid to KPMG for services rendered. 

Audit Fees 

Audit fees consist of fees
for professional services rendered for the audit of our year-end financial statements and services that are normally provided by KPMG
in connection with regulatory filings. The aggregate fees of KPMG for professional services rendered for the audit of our annual financial
statements, review of the financial information included in our Forms 10-Q for the respective periods and other required filings with
the SEC for the years ended December 31, 2022 and December 31, 2021 totaled approximately 109,000 and 206,500, respectively. The above
amounts include interim procedures and audit fees, as well as attendance at audit committee meetings. 

Audit-Related Fee 

Audit-related fees consist
of fees billed for assurance and related services that are reasonably related to performance of the audit or review of our financial statements
and are not reported under Audit Fees. These services include attest services that are not required by statute or regulation
and consultations concerning financial accounting and reporting standards. During the years ended December 31, 2022 and December 31, 2021,
we did not pay KPMG any audit-related fees. 

Tax Fees 

The aggregate fees of KPMG
for professional services rendered for tax compliance for the years ended December 31, 2022 and December 31, 2021 totaled approximately
 5,900 and 5,500, respectively. 

All Other Fees 

We did not pay KPMG for any
other services for the years ended December 31, 2022 and December 31, 2021. 

Pre-Approval Policy 

Our audit committee was formed
upon the consummation of our initial public offering. As a result, the audit committee did not pre-approve all of the foregoing services,
although any services rendered prior to the formation of our audit committee were approved by our board of directors. Since the formation
of our audit committee, and on a going-forward basis, the audit committee has and will pre-approve all auditing services and permitted
non-audit services to be performed for us by our auditors, including the fees and terms thereof (subject to the de minimis exceptions
for non-audit services described in the Exchange Act which are approved by the audit committee prior to the completion of the audit).

Report of Independent Registered
Public Accounting Firm 

To the Stockholders and the Board of Directors of 
Evo
Acquisition Corp.: 

Opinion on the Financial Statements 

We have audited the accompanying balance
sheets of Evo Acquisition Corp. (the Company) as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, the related statements of operations, changes in
stockholders equity, and cash flows for the years then ended, and the related notes (collectively, the financial statements).
In our opinion, the financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of
December 31, 2022 and 2021, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for the years then ended, in conformity with U.S.
generally accepted accounting principles. 

Basis for Opinion 

These financial statements are the responsibility of the
Company s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements based on our audits. We are a public
accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB) and are required to be independent
with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities
and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. 

We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards
of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements
are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. Our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material
misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures
included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audits also included
evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation
of the financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.

We have served as the

(16) of the Investment Company Act, with a maturity of 185 days or less, or in any open-ended investment company that holds itself
out as a money market fund meeting the conditions of Rule 2a-7 of the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended (the
 Investment Company Act ), as determined by the Company, until the earlier of: (i) the consummation of a Business
Combination or (ii) the distribution of the funds in the Trust Account to the Company s stockholders, as described below,

of the net assets held in the Trust Account (as defined below) (excluding any deferred underwriting fees and taxes payable
on the interest earned on the Trust Account) within 24 months of the Initial Public Offering to continue operations. In December 2022,
the Company s stockholders approved an amendment to its amended and restated certificate of incorporation to authorize the Company s
board of directors to approve up to six successive extension periods of one month each, through August 8, 2023. In February 2023, the
Company s board approved an initial extension until March 8, 2023 and further extensions of up to five additional successive one-month
periods, unless the board shall otherwise determine. At the date hereof, the current extension period will terminate on April 8, 2023.
If a Business Combination is not consummated by August 8, 2023 (or earlier if our board determines not to extend the monthly periods),
then the Company will be obligated to liquidate and distribute all amounts in the Trust Account. The Company will only complete a Business
Combination if the post-transaction company owns or acquires or more of the outstanding voting securities of the target or otherwise
acquires a controlling interest in the target business sufficient for it not to be required to register as an investment company under
the Investment Company Act. There is no assurance that the Company will be able to successfully effect a Business Combination.

either prior to or upon such consummation
of a Business Combination and, if the Company seeks stockholder approval, a majority of the Public Shares and Founder Shares (as defined
in Note 5), voting together as a single class, are voted in favor of the Business Combination. If a stockholder vote is not required by
law and the Company does not decide to hold a stockholder vote for business or other reasons, the Company will, pursuant to its Amended
and Restated Certificate of Incorporation then in effect (the Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation ), conduct
the redemptions pursuant to the tender offer rules of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission SEC and file tender
offer documents with the SEC prior to completing a Business Combination. If, however, stockholder approval of the transaction is required
by law, or the Company decides to obtain stockholder approval for business or other reasons, the Company will offer to redeem shares in
conjunction with a proxy solicitation pursuant to the proxy rules and not pursuant to the tender offer rules. If the Company seeks stockholder
approval in connection with a Business Combination, the Sponsor has agreed to vote its Founder Shares and any Public Shares purchased
during or after the Initial Public Offering in favor of approving a Business Combination. Additionally, each public stockholder may elect
to redeem their Public Shares irrespective of whether they vote for or against the Business Combination or don t vote at all.

any claims by a third party who executed a waiver of any and all rights to seek access to the Trust Account and except as to any claims
under the Company s indemnity of the underwriters of the Initial Public Offering against certain liabilities, including liabilities
under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the Securities Act ). Moreover, in the event that an executed waiver is deemed
to be unenforceable against a third party, the Sponsor will not be responsible to the extent of any liability for such third-party claims.
The Company will seek to reduce the possibility that the Sponsor will have to indemnify the Trust Account due to claims of creditors by
endeavoring to have all vendors, service providers (except the Company s independent registered public accounting firm), prospective
target businesses or other entities with which the Company does business, execute agreements with the Company waiving any right, title,
interest or claim of any kind in or to monies held in the Trust Account.

Class A Common Stock sold as part of the Units in the Initial Public Offering contain a redemption feature which allows for the redemption
of such public shares in connection with the Company s liquidation, if there is a stockholder vote or tender offer in connection
with the Business Combination and in connection with certain amendments to the Company s certificate of incorporation. In accordance
with SEC and its staff s guidance on redeemable equity instruments, which has been codified in ASC 480-10-S99, redemption provisions
not solely within the control of the Company require common stock subject to redemption to be classified outside of permanent equity.
Given that the Class A Common Stock was issued with other freestanding instruments (i.e., public warrants), the initial carrying value
of Class A Common Stock classified as temporary equity is the allocated proceeds based on the guidance in ASC 470-20.
