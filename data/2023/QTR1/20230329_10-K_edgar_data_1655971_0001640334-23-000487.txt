Such forward-looking statements include, among others, those statements including the words "believes", "anticipates", "expects", "intends", "estimates", "plans" and words of similar import. Such forward-looking statements involve known and unknown risks, uncertainties and other factors that may cause our actual results, performance or achievements, or industry results, to be materially different from any future results, performance or achievements expressed or implied by such forward-looking statements. Forward-looking statements are based on our current expectations and assumptions regarding our business, potential target businesses, the economy, and other future conditions. Because forward-looking statements relate to the future, by their nature, they are subject to inherent uncertainties, risks and changes in circumstances that are difficult to predict. Our actual results may differ materially from those contemplated by the forward-looking statements. We caution you therefore that you should not rely on any of these forward-looking statements as statements of historical fact or as guarantees or assurances of future performance. Important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those in the forward-looking statements include our ability to raise capital when needed and on acceptable terms; our ability to make acquisitions and integrate acquired businesses into our company; our ability to attract and retain management; the intensity of competition; changes in the political and regulatory environment and in business and economic conditions in the United States and globally; and the continuing effect of the Covid-19 pandemic. These risks and others described under the section "Risk Factors" below are not exhaustive. Given these uncertainties, readers of this Annual Report are cautioned not to place undue reliance on such forward-looking statements. We disclaim any obligation to update any such factors or to publicly announce the result of any revisions to any of the forward-looking statements contained herein to reflect future events or developments. All references in this Annual Report to the "Company", "we", "us", or "our", are to Glacier Worldwide, Inc., a Nevada corporation. 3 Table of Contents PART I ITEM 1. BUSINESS Overview The Company was formed on August 17, 2015 in the State of Nevada under the name PostAds, Inc. to provide an online market place. On January 6, 2021, the Company changed its name from PostAds, Inc. to Glacier Worldwide, Inc. Currently the Company has not commenced operations and currently has no planned principal operations. Its activities since inception include devoting substantially all of its efforts to business planning and development. The Company has generated no revenue from operations. In July 2020 the Company consummated an agreement (the Exchange Agreement with Breyon Prescott, pursuant to which Mr. Prescott contributed his wholly-owned subsidiary Drnq Budz or the Subsidiary to the Company in consideration for 78,000,000 shares of our common stock. Mr. Prescott owns approximately 78 of the Company s outstanding shares. In August 2019, Mr. Prescott and his colleague Jason Martin formed Glacier Sports Agency, Inc. Glacier Sports ). Glacier Sports represents athletes in their contract negotiations for professional sports clubs and teams. Glacier Sports also assists their clients with sponsorships, public relations and endorsement deals. The Company is currently in negotiations to acquire up to six (6) sports injury recovery and prevention centers Recovery Centers in the Los Angeles, California area. The Recovery Centers provide physical therapy and frontline injury treatment to patients that have suffered a sports related injury. The Recovery Centers also engage in sports injury management, which is the management of a specific injury such that it allows an individual to return to their chosen sport without damaging or compromising their body. 4 Table of Contents Given Mr. Prescott s engagement with Glacier Sports, the Company feels acquiring the Recovery Centers would be a good cultural fit, create dynamic synergies, and would be an important step in growing the Company. The Company is further exploring options to engage in apparel production and manufacturing. The Company aims to sell private label clothing, such that a manufacturer will develop styles of blank products and let customers purchase units and customize with their own branding. We believe Mr. Prescott s history and experience in the entertainment, media and music industries allows our Company the unique opportunity to leverage his relationships and networks to continue to create business opportunities and growth within our Company. The Company intends to pursue these opportunities within the next twelve (12) months. Our principal executive office is located at 10390 Santa Monica Boulevard, Los Angeles, California 90025 and our telephone number is (310) 359-6791. Shell Company Status We are currently a shell company, as that term is defined in Rule 12b-2 of the Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the Exchange Act ). Going forward, our main business operations consist of seeking a business combination with a private entity whose business would present an opportunity for its shareholders. Our objectives discussed below are extremely general and are not intended to restrict discretion of our Board of Directors to search for and enter into potential business opportunities or to reject any such opportunities. Given Mr. Prescott s experience and network, we hope to leverage his experience and contacts in the music, entertainment, sports and media industries. However, we will not restrict our potential candidate target companies to any specific business, industry or geographical location and, thus, may acquire any type of business. Further, we may acquire or combine with a venture that is in its preliminary or early stages of development, one that is already in operation, or one that is in a more mature stage of its corporate existence. Accordingly, business opportunities may be available in many different industries and at various stages of development, all of which will make the task of comparative investigation and analysis of such business opportunities difficult and complex. We believe that there are numerous companies seeking the perceived benefits of a publicly registered corporation. These benefits are commonly thought to include the following: the ability to use registered securities to acquire assets or businesses; increased visibility in the marketplace; greater ease of borrowing from financial institutions; improved stock trading efficiency; greater shareholder liquidity; greater ease in subsequently raising capital; ability to compensate key employees through stock options and other equity awards; enhanced corporate image; and a presence in the United States capital markets. It is anticipated that any securities issued in any such reorganization would be issued in reliance upon exemption from registration under applicable federal and state securities laws. In some circumstances, however, as a negotiated element of a transaction, we may agree to register all or a part of such securities immediately after the transaction is consummated or at specified times thereafter. The issuance of substantial additional securities and their potential sale into any trading market which may develop in our securities may have a depressive effect on that market. 5 Table of Contents With respect to any merger or acquisition, negotiations with target company management are expected to focus on the percentage of our company that the target company shareholders would acquire in exchange for all of their shareholdings in the target company. Depending upon, among other things, the target company s assets and liabilities, our existing shareholders will in all likelihood hold a substantially lesser percentage ownership interest in our company following any merger or acquisition. The percentage ownership of our existing shareholders may be subject to significant reduction in the event we acquire a target company with substantial assets. Any merger or acquisition effected by us can be expected to have a significant dilutive effect on the percentage of shares held by our shareholders at such time. We will participate in a business opportunity only after the negotiation and execution of appropriate agreements. Although the terms of such agreements cannot be predicted, generally such agreements will require certain representations and warranties of the parties thereto, will specify certain events of default, will detail the terms of closing and the conditions which must be satisfied by the parties prior to and after such closing, will outline the manner of bearing costs, including costs associated with our attorneys and accountants, and will include miscellaneous other terms. It is anticipated that the investigation of specific business opportunities and the negotiation, drafting and execution of relevant agreements, disclosure documents and other instruments will require substantial management time and attention and substantial cost for accountants, attorneys and others. If a decision is made not to participate in a specific business opportunity, the costs theretofore incurred in the related investigation would not be recoverable. Furthermore, even if an agreement is reached for the participation in a specific business opportunity, the failure to consummate that transaction may result in our loss of the related costs incurred. Competition We expect to encounter substantial competition in our efforts to identify and consummate a transaction with a business opportunity. The primary competition will be from other companies organized and funded for similar purposes, small venture capital partnerships and corporations, small business investment companies and wealthy individuals, all of which may have substantially greater financial and other resources than we do. In view of our limited financial resources and limited management availability, we may be at a competitive disadvantage compared to our competitors. Employees We presently have no employees apart from Breyon Prescott, our sole officer and director. Mr. Prescott is engaged in outside business activities and anticipates that he will devote to our business limited time until the acquisition of a successful business opportunity has been identified. We expect no significant changes in the number of our employees other than such changes, if any, incident to a business combination. We intend to hire additional management and other support personnel when we have reached a point in our proposed growth that would allow for such employment. In the interim, we will rely upon consultants to assist us in identifying and investigating acquisition opportunities. Reports to Security Holders We file annual, quarterly and current reports and other information with the SEC. You may read and copy any reports, statement or other information that we file with the SEC at the SEC s public reference room at 100 F Street, N.E., Washington, D.C. 20549. Please call the SEC at (202) 551-8090 for further information on the public reference room. These SEC filings are also available to the public from commercial document retrieval services and at the Internet site maintained by the SEC at http://www.sec.gov. 6 Table of Contents Item 1A Risk Factors The Company believes there have been no material changes from the risk factors previously disclosed in the Company s 2021 Annual Report on Form 10-K. The risks and uncertainties described in the 2021 Annual Report on Form 10-K should be carefully reviewed. These are not the only risks and uncertainties that the Company faces. Additional risks and uncertainties that the Company does not currently know about or that we currently believe are immaterial, or that the Company has not predicted, may also harm our business operations or adversely affect the Company. If any of these risks or uncertainties actually occurs, the Company s business, financial condition, operating results or liquidity could be adversely affected. ITEM 1B. UNRESOLVED STAFF COMMENTS None. ITEM 2. PROPERTIES None. ITEM 3. LEGAL PROCEEDINGS There is no pending litigation to which the Company is presently a party or to which the Company s property is subject and management is not aware of any litigation which may arise in the future.

It intends to use any future earnings for the expansion of its business. Any future determination of applicable dividends will be made at the discretion of the board of directors and will depend on the results of operations, financial condition, capital requirements and other factors deemed relevant.one.

As of December 31, 2021, our current liabilities were 111,247 which were comprised of 95,562 in accounts payable and accrued liabilities and 15,685 due to related party. The decrease in current liabilities is related to a decrease in accounts payable and accrued liabilities of 983 offset by an increase due to related party for paying operating and marketing expenses of 313 on behalf of the Company. As of December 31, 2022, our working capital deficit was 56,878. We had a working capital of 61,892 for the year ended December 31, 2021. Cash Flow Data: Year Ended December 31, December 31, 2022 2021 Cash used in operating activities (119,440 (98,787 Net cash provided by investing activities - - Cash provided by financing activities - 271,926 Net Change in Cash for period (119,440 173,139 10 Table of Contents Cash Flows from Operating Activities We have not generated positive cash flows from operating activities. For the year ended December 31, 2022, net cash flows used in operating activities was 119,440, consisting of a net loss of 118,770, increased by a decrease in accounts payable and accrued liabilities of 983 and reduced by an increase in expenses paid by a related party of 313.For the year ended December 31, 2021, net cash flows used in operating activities was 98,787, consisting of a net loss of 79,075, increased by a decrease in accounts payable and accrued liabilities of 32,259 and reduced by an increase in expenses paid by a related party of 12,547. Cash Flows from Investing Activities The Company did not use any funds for investing activities during the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021. Cash Flows from Financing Activities We have financed our operations from related party loans and stock subscriptions. For the year ended December 31, 2022, the Company did not receive any fund for financing activities. For the year ended December 31, 2021, we received 655 from advances from related party loans, 538 bank overdraft and 270,750 from stock subscriptions. During the year ended December 31, 2021, the Company repaid 17 of related party loans. Going Concern As of December 31, 2022, our company had a net loss of 118,770 and has earned no revenues. Our company intends to fund operations through equity financing arrangements, which may be insufficient to fund its capital expenditures, working capital and other cash requirements for the year ending December 31, 2023. The ability of our Company to emerge from the development stage is dependent upon, among other things, obtaining additional financing to continue operations, and development of our business plan. In response to these problems, management intends to raise additional funds through public or private placement offerings. These factors, among others, raise substantial doubt about our Company s ability to continue as a going concern. The accompanying financial statements do not include any adjustments that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty. Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates The discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with the accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. Preparing financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, and expenses. These estimates and assumptions are affected by management s application of accounting policies. We believe there are no material estimates or assumptions with levels of subjectivity and judgement necessary to be considered critical accounting policies. Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements We have no off-balance sheet arrangements that have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on our financial condition, changes in financial condition, revenues or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources that is material to stockholders.

Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. Our audit included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audit also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion. /s/ BF Borgers CPA PC Served as Auditor since 2020 March 29, 2023 F-2 Table of Contents Glacier Worldwide, Inc.

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements December 31, 2022 and 2021 during the year ended December 31, 2022 and has an accumulated deficit of as of December 31, 2022. In addition, the Company has a working capital deficit of as of December 31, 2022. Management intends to raise additional operating funds through equity and/or debt offerings. However, there can be no assurance management will be successful in its endeavours. There are no assurances that the Company will be able to either (1) achieve a level of revenues adequate to generate sufficient cash flow from operations; or (2) obtain additional financing through either private placement, shareholder loans, and/or bank financing necessary to support its working capital requirements. To the extent that funds generated from operations and any private placements, public offerings and/or bank financing are insufficient, the Company will have to raise additional working capital. No assurance can be given that additional financing will be available, or if available, will be on terms acceptable to the Company. If adequate working capital is not available to the Company, it may be required to curtail or cease its operations. Due to uncertainties related to these matters, there exists a substantial doubt about the ability of the Company to continue as a going concern. The accompanying consolidated financial statements do not include any adjustments related to the recoverability or classification of asset-carrying amounts or the amounts and classification of liabilities that may result should the Company be unable to continue as a going concern.

Changes in and Disagreements with Accountants on Accounting and Financial Disclosure. Not applicable. Item 9A. Controls and Procedures. Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures Management, our Chief Executive Officer and our Chief Financial Officer, evaluated the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures as of December 31, 2022. Disclosure controls and procedures, as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act, are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by a company in the reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is (i) recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the Securities and Exchange Commission s rules and forms and (ii) accumulated and communicated to the company s management, including its principal executive officer and principal financial officer, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. Based on the evaluation of our disclosure controls and procedures, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were ineffective as of December 31, 2022 at the reasonable assurance level. We did not have sufficient skilled accounting personnel that are qualified as certified public accountants. The Company s sole officer has little or limited experience with U.S. GAAP and he is not a certified public accountant. Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. All internal control systems, no matter how well designed, have inherent limitations. Therefore, even those systems determined to be effective can provide only reasonable assurance with respect to financial statement preparation and presentation. Management s Report on Internal Controls over Financial Reporting Our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting, as defined in Rule 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Exchange Act. Our management conducted an assessment of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2022 based on the criteria set forth in Internal Control-Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. Based on the assessment, our management has concluded that its internal control over financial reporting was ineffective as of December 31, 2022 to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles.
