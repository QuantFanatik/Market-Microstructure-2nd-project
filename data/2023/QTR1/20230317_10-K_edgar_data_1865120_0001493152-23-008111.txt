We

Units ), generating gross proceeds of 1,590,690 and the Company completed the additional private sale of 4,772 private units at
a purchase price of 10.00 per private placement unit, to the Company s sponsor generating gross proceeds to the Company of 47,720. 

In
connection with the closing and sale of the Over-Allotment Units and the additional private placement units (together, the Over-Allotment
Closing ), a total of 1,606,597 in proceeds from the Over-Allotment Closing (which amount includes 31,814 of the Underwriters 
deferred discount) was placed in a U.S.-based trust account established for the benefit of the Company s public stockholders, maintained
by Continental Stock Transfer Trust Company, acting as trustee CSTT ).

trading on the Nasdaq Capital Market. 

Our
Business 

We
have specifically formed a preeminent management team, board of directors and advisory board with significant experience to source, evaluate
and execute a merger with a company that would benefit from access to the public markets and the skills of our management team. We believe
that the principal technologies and sectors with massive potential include: zero emission propulsion technologies, artificial intelligence AI ), internet of things (IoT), UAS, AAM, etc. Applications will only be limited by imagination. From a geographic standpoint,
our target sectors are globally integrated, and we target to capture opportunities high growth markets such as North America and Asia
Pacific. 

8 

We
expect to utilize the benefits of new technologies in our target industries, such as in AI, as well as other evolving technologies. Our
team is composed of seasoned industry leaders and experienced capital investors, and it has a robust network in our target industries
and significant experience in the sourcing, due diligence, acquisition and execution of strategic investments. Further, our team has
a global, demonstrated track-record of executing investments and managing follow-on growth in our target industries, with transaction
sizes ranging from the hundreds of millions to multiple billions. 

We
intend to partner with the management and owners of one or more high-quality companies seeking an alternative to a traditional initial
public offering IPO ). We will use our management team s significant venture capital and private equity experience
in sourcing transactions and due diligence to identify and negotiate a combination with an enduring business. The traditional IPO process
entails significant preparation, commitment of time and resources and entails meaningful uncertainty. As a result, management and owners
are searching for viable public market alternatives. We believe that the combined experience of our management, members of our Board
and our advisors, represents a compelling alternative combined with the potential for long-term value creation. 

Over
the course of their careers, our management team, members of our Board and our advisors, have developed a broad network of contacts and
corporate relationships that we believe will serve as a useful source of opportunities. This network has been developed through both
investing and operating experience across a broad range of sectors, including diversified business services, technology, telecommunications,
media and entertainment, pharmaceutical and consumer healthcare, financial services and financial technology, consumer products, energy
and power, real estate including real estate services and related businesses, environmental services, mobility and electrification of
the transportation industry and insurance and insurance related services. We expect these networks will provide us with a robust flow
of opportunities for a potential business combination. 

We
have employed a pro-active acquisition strategy focused on identifying potential business combination targets, as seen with the Openmarkets
Merger. We believe strongly in our management team s ability to add value from both an operating and a financing perspective which
has been a key driver of past performance and we believe will continue to be central to its differentiated acquisition strategy. 

Our
Business Strategy 

Our
investment strategy will seek to promote responsible and purposeful business standards, and will be focused on the following three types
of companies: 

Businesses
 that contribute scalable solutions in the AI, machine learning or aviation space, which have positive fundamental growth drivers
 that deliver attractive financial returns and measurable impact when considering environmental, social, and corporate governance
 ESG factors; 

Best-in-class
 businesses that benefit all stakeholders, where we can leverage our impact management expertise to maximize the companies 
 positive impacts, build a stronger brand and value proposition, and drive financial return; and 

Businesses
 which do not currently have best-in-class impact management practices but where there is an opportunity to reorient and transform
 currently negative aspects of business operations to generate positive outcomes; and in doing so, build a more sustainable and resilient
 business model with a more attractive, less risky and more future-proofed financial return. 

While
we will not be limited to a particular industry segment or geographic region, as we believe our management and Board of Directors 
experience allows us to evaluate targets that have the potential to accelerate financial value creation while also having a measurable
net positive impact on the environment and society; provided however, we expressly disclaim any intent to and we will not pursue a business
combination with a target company (either directly or through any subsidiaries) in China, Hong Kong or Macau nor will we consummate a
business combination with any such entity. 

Our
management team s efforts to seek a suitable business combination target will be complemented by the experience and network of
our Board of Directors. In addition, our management team, Board of Directors and Advisory Board members will utilize their extensive
networks of seasoned industry operators and advisors to help us identify potential targets and effect the initial business combination
in a more efficient process. We believe that our team and vision will make us an attractive partner for founders and owners in the industries
in which we plan to pursue business combination targets. 

9 

We
intend to identify and complete our initial business combination with a company that can benefit from (i) the managerial and operational
experience of our management team, (ii) additional capital, and (iii) access to public securities markets. We plan to leverage our management
team s network of potential proprietary and public transaction sources where we believe a combination of our relationships, knowledge
and experience in the technology sector could effect a positive transformation or augmentation of existing businesses to improve their
overall value. We believe this approach will create long-term value for our stockholders. Our team has experience: 

operating
 and investing in AI, technology sectors or aviation; 

scaling
 high growth companies through organic and acquisition-based strategic investments; 

identifying
 and developing talented, high performing and resilient management teams; 

sourcing
 investment opportunities, structuring complex transactions, and acquiring and selling businesses; 

fostering
 relationships with sellers, capital providers and target management teams; and 

accessing
 public and private capital markets over multiple business cycles. 

We
believe that the way businesses and consumers operate, make decisions, and spend has forever been changed because of the pandemic. We
believe further that our relationships with a large pool of quality initial business combination targets looking for an opportunity to
create liquidity for current investors and currency to acquire other companies. This provides numerous opportunities, and we would be
well positioned given the difficulty in bridging technology and/or capital opportunities between the east and west. Further, we believe
that the management team and board member s extensive background, careers, reputations, and relationships in cross border business
experience gives us the insight and position to identify the ideal targets for a business combination that creates long-term opportunity
and value growth and to complete the business combination. 

Our
Acquisition Selection Criteria 

We
will seek to identify attractive business combination candidates that possess compelling growth potential and a combination of the characteristics
discussed herein. We will use these criteria and guidelines in identifying and evaluating acquisition opportunities, but we may decide
to enter our initial business combination with a target business that does not meet the following attributes: 

Large
 and growing market . We will focus on investments in industry segments that we believe demonstrate attractive long-term growth
 prospects and reasonable overall size or potential; 

Attractive,
 profitable business . We will seek to invest in companies that we believe possess not only attractive and sound business models
 but sustainable competitive advantages as well; 

Strong
 management teams . We will spend significant time assessing a company s leadership and personnel and evaluating what we
 can do to augment or upgrade the team over time if needed; 

Appropriate
 valuations. We will seek to identify businesses that we believe exhibit unrecognized value or other characteristics that we believe
 provide significant upside potential with limited downside risk. 

ESG
 and sustainability. Strong focus on ESG factors, which represents a strong value proposition for investors, is an integral part
 of our due diligence process since it is difficult to overstate the explosion of interest in investment with an ESG tilt. 

Network
 utilization . We will focus on companies that can utilize and leverage the extensive networks and insights that we, members of
 our management, Board and Advisory Board have built across a broad range of industries and sectors; 

10 

Value
 creation opportunities . We will seek to identify businesses that we believe are stable but at an inflection point and would benefit
 from our additional management expertise, ability to drive operational improvements, capital structure optimization, including by
 assisting the company in accessing the capital markets and any other financing sources; 

Differentiated
 products or services . We will focus on businesses whose products or services are differentiated or where we see an opportunity
 to create value by implementing best practices; and 

Unrecognized
 value . We will seek to identify businesses that we believe exhibit unrecognized value or other characteristics, desirable returns
 on capital, and a need for capital to achieve the company s growth strategy, or that we believe have been misevaluated by the
 marketplace based on our analysis and due diligence review. 

We
may use other criteria and guidelines as well. Any evaluation relating to the merits of a particular initial business combination may
be based on these general criteria and guidelines as well as other considerations, factors and criteria that our management may deem
relevant. In the event that we decide to enter into an initial business combination with a target business that does not meet the above
criteria and guidelines, we will disclose that fact in our stockholder communications related to the acquisition. As discussed elsewhere
in this prospectus, this would be in the form of proxy solicitation materials or tender offer documents that we would file with the SEC. 

Our
Acquisition Process 

In
evaluating a potential target business, we expect to conduct a comprehensive due diligence review to determine a target company s
quality and its intrinsic value. That due diligence review will encompass, among other things, financial statement analysis, detailed
document reviews, technology diligence, multiple meetings with incumbent management and employees, inspection of facilities, consultations
with relevant industry and academic experts, competitors, customers, and suppliers, as well as a review of operational, legal, and additional
information that we will seek to obtain as part of our analysis of a target company. We will also utilize our operational and capital
planning experience. 

We
expect to place significant emphasis on a business combination target s technology and intellectual property as part of our acquisition
evaluation process, consistent with the investment approach of our management team. This due diligence may include the engagement of
multiple technical experts across both industry and academia to review the technology, participation in joint due diligence meetings
with these technical experts and management, as well as detailed intellectual property due diligence, to determine the nature and quality
of a company s technology innovation. 

We
are not prohibited from pursuing an initial business combination with a company that is affiliated with our sponsor, officers or directors.
In the event we seek to complete our initial business combination with a company that is affiliated with our sponsor, officers or directors,
we, or a committee of independent directors, will obtain an opinion from an independent investment banking firm which is a member of
FINRA or an independent accounting firm that our initial business combination is fair to our company from a financial point of view. 

Members
of our management team, including our officers and directors, directly or indirectly own insider shares and may own rights following
this offering and, accordingly, may have a conflict of interest in determining whether a particular target company is an appropriate
business with which to effectuate our initial business combination. Further, each of our officers and directors, as well as our management
team, may have a conflict of interest with respect to evaluating a particular business combination, including if the retention or resignation
of any such officers, directors, and management team members was included by a target business as a condition to any agreement with respect
to such business combination. We have not selected any specific business combination target and we have not, nor has anyone on our behalf,
initiated any substantive discussions, directly or indirectly, with any business combination target. 

Each
of our directors and officers presently has and any of them in the future may have additional, fiduciary or contractual obligations to
other entities pursuant to which such officer or director is or will be required to present a business combination opportunity. Accordingly,
if any of our officers or directors becomes aware of a business combination opportunity which is suitable for an entity to which he or
she has then-current fiduciary or contractual obligations, he or she will honor his or her fiduciary or contractual obligations to present
such opportunity to such entity. We do not believe, however, that the fiduciary duties or contractual obligations of our officers or
directors will materially affect our ability to complete our initial business combination. 

11 

Status
as a Public Company 

We
believe our structure makes us an attractive business combination partner to target businesses, such as Openmarkets. As an existing public
company, we offer a target business an alternative to the traditional initial public offering through a merger or other business combination.
In this situation, the owners of the target business would exchange their shares of stock, shares or other equity interests in the target
business for our shares or for a combination of shares of our shares and cash, allowing us to tailor the consideration to the specific
needs of the sellers. See The Openmarkets Merger above for more information regarding such exchange in the Openmarkets
Merger. Although there are various costs and obligations associated with being a public company, we believe target businesses will find
this method a more certain and cost-effective method to becoming a public company than the typical initial public offering. In a typical
initial public offering, there are additional expenses incurred in marketing, road show and public reporting efforts that may not be
present to the same extent in connection with a business combination with us. 

Furthermore,
once a proposed business combination is completed, such as the Openmarkets Merger, the target business will have effectively become public,
whereas an initial public offering is always subject to the underwriters ability to complete the offering, as well as general
market conditions, which could delay or prevent the offering from occurring or could have negative valuation consequences. Once public,
we believe the target business would then have greater access to capital and an additional means of providing management incentives consistent
with stockholders interests. It can offer further benefits by augmenting a company s profile among potential new customers
and vendors and aid in attracting talented employees. 

Financial
Position 

With
funds available for an initial business combination presently in the amount of approximately 61,943,000 (as of March 15, 2023), we offer
a target business, such as Openmarkets, a variety of options to facilitate a business combination and fund future expansion and growth
of its business. Because we are able to consummate a business combination using the cash proceeds from our initial public offering, our
share capital, debt or a combination of the foregoing, we have the flexibility to use an efficient structure allowing us to tailor the
consideration to be paid to the target business to address the needs of the parties. However, if a business combination requires us to
use substantially all of our cash to pay for the purchase price, we may need to arrange third party financing to help fund our business
combination. Accordingly, our flexibility in structuring a business combination may be subject to these constraints. 

Effecting
our Initial Business Combination 

We
are not presently engaged in, and we will not engage in, any operations other than the pursuit of our initial business combination, for
an indefinite period of time. We intend to complete our initial business combination using cash from the proceeds of our initial public
offering and the private placement of the private placement units, our share capital debt or a combination of these as the consideration
to be paid in our initial business combination. We may seek to complete our initial business combination with a company or business that
may be financially unstable or in its early stages of development or growth, which would subject us to the numerous risks inherent in
such companies and businesses, although we will not be permitted to effectuate our initial business combination with another blank check
company or a similar company with nominal operations. 

If
our initial business combination is paid for using equity or debt securities, or not all of the funds released from the trust account
are used for payment of the consideration in connection with our business combination or used for redemptions of our public shares of
the Common Stock, we may apply the balance of the cash released to us from the trust account for general corporate purposes, including
for maintenance or expansion of operations of the post-transaction company, the payment of principal or interest due on indebtedness
incurred in completing our initial business combination, to fund the purchase of other assets, companies or for working capital. 

We
may seek to raise additional funds through a private offering of debt or equity securities in connection with the completion of our initial
business combination (which may include a specified future issuance), and we may complete our initial business combination using the
proceeds of such offering rather than using the amounts held in the trust account. Subject to compliance with applicable securities laws,
we would expect to complete such financing only simultaneously with the completion of our business combination. In the case of an initial
business combination funded with assets other than the trust account assets, our tender offer documents or proxy materials disclosing
the business combination would disclose the terms of the financing and, only if required by law, we would seek stockholder approval of
such financing. There are no prohibitions on our ability to raise funds privately, including pursuant to any specified future issuance,
or through loans in connection with our initial business combination. 

12 

The
time required to select and evaluate a target business and to structure and complete our initial business combination, and the costs
associated with this process, are not currently ascertainable with any degree of certainty. Any costs incurred with respect to the identification
and evaluation of a prospective target business with which our business combination is not ultimately completed will result in our incurring
losses and will reduce the funds we can use to complete another business combination. 

Sources
of Target Businesses 

We
receive proprietary transaction opportunities as a result of the business relationships, direct outreach, and deal sourcing activities
from the network built up by our management team and by the members of our Board. Target business candidates, such as Openmarkets, have
been brought to our attention from various unaffiliated sources, including investment banking firms, consultants, accounting firms, private
equity groups, large business enterprises, and other market participants. These sources introduce us to target businesses in which they
think we may be interested on an unsolicited basis, since many of these sources will have read the prospectus of our initial public offering
and know what types of businesses we are targeting. Some of our officers and directors may enter into employment or consulting agreements
with the post-transaction company following our initial business combination. The presence or absence of any such fees or arrangements
will not be used as a criterion in our selection process of an acquisition candidate. In no event will our sponsor or any of our existing
officers or directors, or any entity with which they are affiliated, be paid any finder s fee, consulting fee or other compensation
prior to, or for any services they render in order to effectuate, the completion of our initial business combination (regardless of the
type of transaction that it is). 

We
are not prohibited from pursuing an initial business combination with a business combination target that is affiliated with our sponsor,
officers or directors. In the event we seek to complete our initial business combination with a business combination target that is affiliated
with our sponsor, officers or directors, we, or a committee of independent directors, would obtain an opinion from an independent investment
banking firm which is a member of FINRA or an independent accounting firm that such an initial business combination is fair to our company
from a financial point of view. We are not required to obtain such an opinion in any other context. If any of our officers or directors
becomes aware of a business combination opportunity that falls within the line of business of any entity to which he or she has pre-existing
fiduciary or contractual obligations, he or she may be required to present such business combination opportunity to such entity prior
to presenting such business combination opportunity to us, subject to his or her fiduciary duties under Delaware law. Notwithstanding
the foregoing, Mr. Johann Tse has agreed that if he becomes aware of a business combination opportunity that might be suitable to the
Company s business or investment strategy through his directorship in another blank check company, he will recuse himself from
all discussions, deliberations, or decisions of the other blank check company with respect to such opportunity. 

Lack
of Business Diversification 

For
an indefinite period after the completion of our initial business combination, the prospects for our success may depend entirely on the
future performance of a single business. Unlike other entities that have the resources to complete business combinations with multiple
entities in one or several industries, it is probable that we will not have the resources to diversify our operations and mitigate the
risks of being in a single line of business. In addition, we are focusing our search for an initial business combination in a single
industry. By completing our business combination with only a single entity, our lack of diversification may: 

subject
 us to negative economic, competitive, and regulatory developments, any or all of which may have a substantial adverse impact on the
 particular industry in which we operate after our initial business combination, and 

cause
 us to depend on the marketing and sale of a single product or limited number of products or services. 

13 

Limited
Ability to Evaluate the Target s Management Team 

Although
we closely scrutinize the management of a prospective target business, including the Openmarkets management team, when evaluating the
desirability of effecting our business combination with that business and plan to continue to do so if the Openmarkets Merger is not
consummated and we seek other business combination opportunities, our assessment of the target business management may not prove
to be correct. In addition, the future management may not have the necessary skills, qualifications, or abilities to manage a public
company. Furthermore, the future role of members of our management team or of our board, if any, in the target business cannot presently
be stated with any certainty. While it is possible that one or more of our directors will remain associated in some capacity with us
following our business combination, including the Openmarkets Merger, it is presently unknown if any of them will devote their full efforts
to our affairs after our business combination. Moreover, we cannot assure you that members of our management team will have significant
experience or knowledge relating to the operations of the particular target business. The determination as to whether any members of
our board of directors will remain with the combined company will be made at the time of our initial business combination. 

Following
a business combination, to the extent that we deem it necessary, we may seek to recruit additional managers to supplement the incumbent
management team of the target business. We cannot assure you that we will have the ability to recruit additional managers, or that additional
managers will have the requisite skills, knowledge or experience necessary to enhance the incumbent management. 

Evaluation
of a Target Business and Structuring of our Initial Business Combination 

Nasdaq
rules require that we consummate an initial business combination with one or more operating businesses or assets with a fair market value
equal to at least 80 of the net assets held in the trust account (net of amounts disbursed to management for working capital purposes,
if permitted, and excluding the amount of any deferred underwriting commissions). The fair market value of our initial business combination
will be determined by our board of directors based upon one or more standards generally accepted by the financial community, such as
discounted cash flow valuation, a valuation based on trading multiples of comparable public businesses, or a valuation based on the financial
metrics of M A transactions of comparable businesses. 

In
evaluating a prospective target business, we have conducted and will continue conduct an extensive due diligence review which encompasses,
among other things, meetings with incumbent management and inspection of facilities, as well as review of financial and other information
which is made available to us. This due diligence review is conducted either by our management or by unaffiliated third parties we may
engage, although we have no current intention to engage any such third parties. 

The
time and costs required to select and evaluate a target business and to structure and complete the business combination cannot presently
be ascertained with any degree of certainty. Any costs incurred with respect to the identification and evaluation of a prospective target
business with which a business combination is not ultimately completed will result in a loss to us and reduce the amount of capital available
to otherwise complete a business combination. 

If
our board of directors is not able to independently determine the fair market value of our initial business combination (including with
the assistance of financial advisors), we will obtain an opinion from an independent investment banking firm or another independent entity
that commonly renders valuation opinions with respect to the satisfaction of such criteria. While we consider it unlikely that our board
of directors will not be able to make an independent determination of the fair market value of our initial business combination, it may
be unable to do so if it is less familiar or experienced with the business of a particular target or if there is a significant amount
of uncertainty as to the value of a target s assets or prospects. We do not intend to purchase multiple businesses in unrelated
industries in conjunction with our initial business combination. Subject to this requirement, our management will have virtually unrestricted
flexibility in identifying and selecting one or more prospective target businesses, although we will not be permitted to effectuate our
initial business combination with another blank check company or a similar company with nominal operation.

Stockholders
May Not Have the Ability to Approve our Initial Business Combination 

We
may conduct redemptions without a stockholder vote pursuant to the tender offer rules of the SEC subject to the provisions of our amended
and restated certificate of incorporation. However, we will seek stockholder approval if it is required by law or applicable stock exchange
rule, or we may decide to seek stockholder approval for business or other reasons.

Under
Nasdaq s listing rules, stockholder approval would be required for our initial business combination if, for example: 

we
 issue shares of common stock that will be equal to or in excess of 20 of the number of our shares of common stock then outstanding
 (other than in a public offering); 

any
 of our directors, officers or substantial stockholders (as defined by the Nasdaq rules) has a 5 or greater interest (or such persons
 collectively have a 10 or greater interest), directly or indirectly, in the target business or assets to be acquired or otherwise
 and the present or potential issuance of common stock could result in an increase in outstanding common stock or voting power of
 5 or more; or 

the
 issuance or potential issuance of common stock will result in our undergoing a change of control. 

The
decision as to whether we will seek stockholder approval of a proposed business combination in those instances in which stockholder approval
is not required by law will be made by us, solely in our discretion, and will be based on business and legal reasons, which include a
variety of factors, including, but not limited to: 

the
 timing of the transaction, including in the event we determine stockholder approval would require additional time and there is either
 not enough time to seek stockholder approval or doing so would place the Company at a disadvantage in the transaction or result in
 other additional burdens on the Company; 

the
 expected cost of holding a stockholder vote; 

the
 risk that the stockholders would fail to approve the proposed business combination; 

other
 time and budget constraints of the Company; and 

additional
 legal complexities of a proposed business combination that would be time-consuming and burdensome to present to stockholders. 

See
 The Openmarkets Merger above for more information regarding the requisite approvals needed for the Openmarkets Merger.

Ability
to Extend Time to Complete Business Combination 

The
stockholders of the Company approved the First Amendment to the Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation of the Company (the
 Charter Amendment at the January 10, 2023 Stockholders Meeting, changing the structure and cost of the Company s
right to extend the date (the Termination Date by which the Company (i) consummate a merger, capital stock exchange, asset
acquisition, stock purchase, reorganization or similar business combination involving the Company and one or more businesses, which we
refer to as a business combination, (ii) cease its operations if it fails to complete such business combination, and (iii)
redeem or repurchase 100 of the Company s common stock included as part of the units sold in the Company s initial public
offering that closed on January 13, 2022, which was currently January 13, 2023 but was amended by the Charter Amendment to extend the
Termination Date by up to nine (9) one-month extensions to October 13, 2023 provided that (i) the Sponsor (or its affiliates or permitted
designees) will deposit into the Trust Account an additional 0.0625 per share for each month until October 13, 2023, unless the closing
of the Company s initial business combination shall have occurred in exchange for a non-interest bearing, unsecured promissory
note payable upon consummation of a business combination and (ii) compliance with the procedures relating to any such extension, as set
forth in the Trust Agreement. 

Redemption
Rights for Public Stockholders upon Consummation of Our Initial Business Combination 

We
will provide our public stockholders with the opportunity to redeem all or a portion their shares upon the consummation of our initial
business combination, such as the Openmarkets Merger, at a per-share price, payable in cash, equal to the aggregate amount then on deposit
in the trust account, including interest (net of taxes payable), divided by the number of then outstanding public shares, subject to
the limitations described herein. Our initial stockholders have agreed to waive their right to receive liquidating distributions if we
fail to consummate our initial business combination within the requisite period. However, if our initial stockholders or any of our officers,
directors or affiliates acquires public shares in or after our initial public offering, they will be entitled to receive liquidating
distributions with respect to such public shares if we fail to consummate our initial business combination within the required period. 

Manner
of Conducting Redemptions 

We
will provide our public stockholders with the opportunity to redeem all or a portion of their public shares upon the completion of our
initial business combination either (i) in connection with a general meeting called to approve the business combination or (ii) by means
of a tender offer. We intend to hold a stockholder vote in connection with our business combination. In such case, we will: 

conduct
 the redemptions in conjunction with a proxy solicitation pursuant to Regulation 14A of the Exchange Act, which regulates the solicitation
 of proxies, and not pursuant to the tender offer rules, and 

file
 proxy materials with the SEC. 

If
we seek stockholder approval of our initial business combination, we will distribute proxy materials and, in connection therewith, provide
our public stockholders with the redemption rights described above upon consummation of the initial business combination. If we seek
stockholder approval, we will consummate our initial business combination only if we obtain the approval under Delaware law, which requires
the affirmative vote of a majority of the stockholders who attend and vote at a general meeting of the company. In such case, our initial
stockholders have agreed to vote their founder shares, private shares and any public shares purchased during or after the offering in
favor of our initial business combination and our officers and directors have also agreed to vote any public shares purchased during
or after the offering in favor of our initial business combination. Each public stockholder may elect to redeem their public shares irrespective
of whether they vote for or against the proposed transaction. In addition, our initial stockholders have agreed to waive their redemption
rights with respect to their founder shares, private shares and public shares in connection with the consummation of our initial business
combination. 

In
no event will we redeem our public shares in an amount that would cause our net tangible assets to be less than 5,000,001 prior to or
upon the consummation of our initial business combination. Furthermore, the redemption threshold may be further limited by the terms
and conditions of our initial business combination. If too many public stockholders exercise their redemption rights so that we cannot
satisfy the net tangible asset requirement or any net worth or cash requirements, we would not proceed with the redemption of our public
shares and the related business combination, and instead may search for an alternate business combination. 

16 

Notwithstanding
the foregoing, if we do not decide to hold a stockholder vote in conjunction with their initial business combination for business or
other legal reasons (so long as stockholder approval is not required by the rules of Nasdaq), we will conduct redemptions pursuant to
the tender offer rules of the SEC and our memorandum and articles of association. In such case, we will: 

offer
 to redeem our public shares pursuant to Rule 13e-4 and Regulation 14E of the Exchange Act, which regulate issuer tender offers, and 

file
 tender offer documents with the SEC prior to consummating our initial business combination which will contain substantially the same
 financial and other information about the initial business combination and the redemption rights as is required under Regulation
 14A of the Exchange Act, which regulates the solicitation of proxies, and we will not be permitted to consummate our initial business
 combination until the expiration of the tender offer period. 

In
the event we conduct redemptions pursuant to the tender offer rules, our offer to redeem shall remain open for at least 20 business days,
in accordance with Rule 14e-1(a) under the Exchange Act. In connection with the successful consummation of our business combination,
we may redeem pursuant to a tender offer up to that number of shares that would permit us to maintain net tangible assets of at least
 5,000,001 prior to or upon the consummation of our initial business combination. However, the redemption threshold may be further limited
by the terms and conditions of our proposed initial business combination. For example, the proposed business combination may require:
(i) cash consideration to be paid to the target or members of its management team, (ii) cash to be transferred to the target for working
capital or other general corporate purposes or (iii) the allocation of cash to satisfy other conditions in accordance with the terms
of the proposed business combination. In the event the aggregate cash consideration we would be required to pay for all shares that are
validly tendered plus any amount required to satisfy cash conditions pursuant to the terms of the proposed business combination exceed
the aggregate amount of cash available to us, we will not consummate the business combination, we will not purchase any shares pursuant
to the tender offer and all shares will be returned to the holders thereof following the expiration of the tender offer. Additionally,
since we are required to maintain net tangible assets of at least 5,000,001 prior to or upon the consummation of our initial business
combination (which may be substantially higher depending on the terms of our potential business combination), the chance that the holders
of our public shares of Common Stock electing to redeem in connection with a redemption conducted pursuant to the proxy rules will cause
us to fall below such minimum requirement is increased. 

When
we conduct a tender offer to redeem our public shares upon consummation of our initial business combination, to comply with the tender
offer rules, the offer will be made to all of our stockholders, not just our public stockholders. Our initial stockholders have agreed
to waive their redemption rights with respect to their founder shares, private shares and public shares in connection with any such tender
offer. 

Permitted
Purchases of Our Securities by Our Affiliates 

If
we seek stockholder approval of our business combination and we do not conduct redemptions in connection with our business combination
pursuant to the tender offer rules, our sponsor, directors, officers or their affiliates may purchase shares in privately negotiated
transactions or in the open market either prior to or following the consummation of our initial business combination. Such a purchase
would include a contractual acknowledgement that such stockholder, although still the record holder of our shares is no longer the beneficial
owner thereof and therefore agrees not to exercise its redemption rights. In the event that our sponsor, directors, officers or their
affiliates purchase shares in privately negotiated transactions from public stockholders who have already elected to exercise their redemption
rights, such selling stockholders would be required to revoke their prior elections to redeem their shares. Although very unlikely, our
initial stockholders, officers, directors and their affiliates could purchase sufficient shares so that the initial business combination
may be approved without the majority vote of public shares held by non-affiliates. It is intended that purchases will comply with Rule
10b-18 under the Exchange Act, which provides a safe harbor for purchases made under certain conditions, including with respect to timing,
pricing and volume of purchases. 

The
purpose of such purchases would be to (1) increase the likelihood of obtaining stockholder approval of the business combination or (2)
to satisfy a closing condition in an agreement with a target that requires us to have a minimum net worth or a certain amount of cash
at the closing of the business combination, where it appears that such requirement would otherwise not be met. This may result in the
consummation of an initial business combination that may not otherwise have been possible. 

As
a consequence of any such purchases, the public float of our public shares of Common Stock may be reduced and the number
of beneficial holders of our securities may be reduced, which may make it difficult to maintain the listing or trading of our securities
on a national securities exchange following consummation of a business combination. 

17 

Limitation
on Redemption upon Completion of Our Initial Business Combination If We Seek Stockholder Approval 

Notwithstanding
the foregoing, if we seek stockholder approval of our initial business combination and we do not conduct redemptions in connection with
our initial business combination pursuant to the tender offer rules, our amended and restated certificate of incorporation will provide
that a public stockholder, together with any affiliate of such stockholder or any other person with whom such stockholder is acting in
concert or as a group (as defined under Section 13 of the Exchange Act), will be restricted from seeking redemption rights
with respect to the Excess Shares. We believe this restriction will discourage stockholders from accumulating large blocks of shares,
and subsequent attempts by such holders to use their ability to exercise their redemption rights against a proposed business combination
as a means to force us or our management to purchase their shares at a significant premium to the then-current market price or on other
undesirable terms. 

Absent
this provision, a public stockholder holding more than an aggregate of 15 of the shares sold in this offering could threaten to exercise
its redemption rights if such holder s shares are not purchased by us, our sponsor or our management at a premium to the then-current
market price or on other undesirable terms. By limiting our stockholders ability to redeem no more than 15 of the shares sold
in this offering without our prior consent, we believe we will limit the ability of a small group of stockholders to unreasonably attempt
to block our ability to complete our initial business combination, particularly in connection with a business combination with a target
that requires as a closing condition that we have a minimum net worth or a certain amount of cash. However, we would not be restricting
our stockholders ability to vote all of their shares (including Excess Shares) for or against our initial business combination. 

Tendering
Stock Certificates in Connection with a Tender Offer or Redemption Rights 

Public
stockholders seeking to exercise their redemption rights, whether they are record holders or hold their shares in street name, 
will be required to either tender their certificates (if any) to our transfer agent prior to the date set forth in the proxy solicitation
or tender offer materials, as applicable, mailed to such holders, or to deliver their shares to the transfer agent electronically using
The Depository Trust Company s DWAC (Deposit/ Withdrawal At Custodian) System, at the holder s option, in each case up to
two business days prior to the initially scheduled vote to approve the initial business combination. The proxy solicitation or tender
offer materials, as applicable, that we will furnish to holders of our public shares in connection with our initial business combination
will indicate the applicable delivery requirements, which will include the requirement that a beneficial holder must identify itself
in order to validly redeem its shares. Accordingly, a public stockholder would have from the time we send out our tender offer materials
until the close of the tender offer period, or up to two days prior to the initial vote on the initial business combination if we distribute
proxy materials, as applicable, to tender its shares if it wishes to seek to exercise its redemption rights. Given the relatively short
period in which to exercise redemption rights, it is advisable for stockholders to use electronic delivery of their public shares. 

There
is a nominal cost associated with the above-referenced tendering process and the act of certificating the shares or delivering them through
the DWAC System. The transfer agent will typically charge the tendering broker a fee of approximately 80.00 and it would be up to the
broker whether to pass this cost on to the redeeming holder. However, this fee would be incurred regardless of whether we require holders
seeking to exercise redemption rights to tender their shares. The need to deliver shares is a requirement of exercising redemption rights
regardless of the timing of when such delivery must be effectuated. 

The
foregoing is different from the procedures used by many blank check companies. In order to perfect redemption rights in connection with
their business combinations, many blank check companies would distribute proxy materials for the stockholders vote on an initial
business combination, and a holder could simply vote against a proposed business combination and check a box on the proxy card indicating
such holder was seeking to exercise his or her redemption rights. After the initial business combination was approved, the Company would
contact such stockholder to arrange for him or her to deliver his or her certificate to verify ownership. As a result, the stockholder
then had an option window after the completion of the initial business combination during which he or she could monitor
the price of the Company s shares in the market. If the price rose above the redemption price, he or she could sell his or her
shares in the open market before actually delivering his or her shares to the Company for cancellation. As a result, the redemption rights,
to which stockholders were aware they needed to commit before the general meeting, would become option rights surviving
past the completion of the initial business combination until the redeeming holder delivered its certificate. The requirement for physical
or electronic delivery prior to the meeting ensures that a redeeming stockholder s election to redeem is irrevocable once the initial
business combination is approved. 

18 

Any
request to redeem such shares, once made, may be withdrawn at any time up to two business days prior to the vote on the proposal to approve
the initial business combination, unless otherwise agreed to by us. Furthermore, if a holder of a public share delivered its certificate
in connection with an election of redemption rights and subsequently decides prior to the applicable date not to elect to exercise such
rights, such holder may simply request that the transfer agent return the certificate (physically or electronically). It is anticipated
that the funds to be distributed to holders of our public shares electing to redeem their shares will be distributed promptly after the
completion of our initial business combination. 

If
our initial business combination is not approved or completed for any reason, then our public stockholders who elected to exercise their
redemption rights would not be entitled to redeem their shares for the applicable pro rata share of the trust account. In such case,
we will promptly return any certificates delivered by public holders who elected to redeem their shares. If our initial proposed business
combination is not completed, we may continue to try to complete a business combination with a different target until October 13, 2023
(or as extended as provided in our registration statement. Public stockholders will not be offered the opportunity to vote on or redeem
their shares in connection with any extension of the period to complete our initial business combination. 

Redemption
of Public Shares and Liquidation if no Initial Business Combination 

Our
Charter Amendment following the January 10, 2023 Stockholders Meeting provides that we will have up to nine (9) one-month Extensions
to October 13, 2023 provided that the Sponsor (or its affiliates or permitted designees) will deposit into the Trust Account an additional
 0.0625 per share for each month, or as extended by the Company s stockholders in accordance with our amended and restated certificate
of incorporation. If we are unable to complete our business combination by October 13, 2023 (or as otherwise extended), we will: (i)
cease all operations except for the purpose of winding up, (ii) as promptly as reasonably possible but not more than ten business days
thereafter, redeem the public shares, at a per-share price, payable in cash, equal to the aggregate amount then on deposit in the trust
account including interest earned on the funds held in the trust account and not previously released to us to pay our taxes (less up
to 100,000 of interest to pay dissolution expenses), divided by the number of then outstanding public shares, which redemption will
completely extinguish public stockholders rights as stockholders (including the right to receive further liquidating distributions,
if any), subject to applicable law, and (iii) as promptly as reasonably possible following such redemption, subject to the approval of
our remaining stockholders and our board of directors, dissolve and liquidate, subject in each case to our obligations under Delaware
law to provide for claims of creditors and the requirements of other applicable law. 

There
will be no redemption rights or liquidating distributions with respect to our rights, which will expire worthless if we fail to complete
our business combination by October 13, 2023 (or as otherwise extended by the Company s stockholders in accordance with our amended
and restated certificate of incorporation). Our stockholders have approved the issuance of the placement units upon conversion of such
notes, to the extent the holder wishes to so convert such notes at the time of the consummation of our initial business combination.
In the event that we receive notice from our sponsor five days prior to the applicable deadline of its intent to effect an extension,
we intend to issue a press release announcing such intention at least three days prior to the applicable deadline. In addition, we intend
to issue a press release the day after the applicable deadline announcing whether the funds had been timely deposited. Our sponsor is
not obligated to fund the trust account to extend the time for us to complete our initial business combination. The public stockholders
will not be able to vote on or redeem their public shares in connection with any such extensions. 

Our
sponsor, directors and each member of our management have entered into a letter agreement with us, pursuant to which they have waived
their rights to liquidating distributions from the trust account with respect to their insider shares if we do not complete an initial
business combination within the period to consummate the initial business combination including with respect to any shares obtained through
the placement units. However, if our sponsor, directors or members of our management team acquire public shares in or after this offering,
they will be entitled to liquidating distributions from the trust account with respect to such public shares if we do not complete an
initial business combination within the period to consummate the initial business combination. 

19 

Our
sponsor, executive officers and directors have agreed, pursuant to a written agreement with us, that they will not propose any amendment
to our amended and restated certificate of incorporation that would affect the substance or timing of our obligation to allow redemption
in connection with our initial business combination or to redeem 100 of our public shares if we do not complete an initial business
combination within the period to consummate the initial business combination, unless we provide our public stockholders with the opportunity
to redeem their public shares upon approval of any such amendment at a per-share price, payable in cash, equal to the aggregate amount
then on deposit in the trust account, including interest earned on the funds held in the trust account and not previously released to
us to pay our taxes, if any divided by the number of the then outstanding public shares. However, we may not redeem our public shares
in an amount that would cause our net tangible assets to be less than 5,000,001 (so that we are not subject to the SEC s penny
stock rules). If this optional redemption right is exercised with respect to an excessive number of public shares such that we
cannot satisfy the net tangible asset requirement, we would not proceed with the amendment or the related redemption of our public shares
at such time. This redemption right shall apply in the event of the approval of any such amendment, whether proposed by our sponsor,
any executive officer, director or director nominee, or any other person. 

We
expect that all costs and expenses associated with implementing our plan of dissolution, as well as payments to any creditors, will be
funded from amounts remaining out of the approximately 392,000 of proceeds held outside the trust account plus up to 100,000 of funds
from the interest on the trust account available to us to pay dissolution expenses, although we cannot assure you that there will be
sufficient funds for such purpose. 

If
we were to expend all of the net proceeds of this offering the sale of the placement rights, other than the proceeds deposited in the
trust account, and without taking into account interest, if any, earned on the trust account, the per-share redemption amount received
by stockholders upon our dissolution would be approximately 10.10. The proceeds deposited in the trust account could, however, become
subject to the claims of our creditors which would have higher priority than the claims of our public stockholders. We cannot assure
you that the actual per-share redemption amount received by stockholders will not be substantially less than 10.10. Under Section 281(b)
of the DGCL, our plan of dissolution must provide for all claims against us to be paid in full or make provision for payments to be made
in full, as applicable, if there are sufficient assets. These claims must be paid or provided for before we make any distribution of
our remaining assets to our stockholders. While we intend to pay such amounts, if any, we cannot assure you that we will have funds sufficient
to pay or provide for all creditors claims. 

Although
we will seek to have all vendors, service providers (other than our independent registered public accounting firm), prospective target
businesses and other entities with which we do business execute agreements with us waiving any right, title, interest or claim of any
kind in or to any monies held in the trust account for the benefit of our public stockholders, there is no guarantee that they will execute
such agreements or even if they execute such agreements that they would be prevented from bringing claims against the trust account including
but not limited to fraudulent inducement, breach of fiduciary responsibility or other similar claims, as well as claims challenging the
enforceability of the waiver, in each case in order to gain an advantage with respect to a claim against our assets, including the funds
held in the trust account. If any third party refuses to execute an agreement waiving such claims to the monies held in the trust account,
our management will perform an analysis of the alternatives available to it and will only enter into an agreement with a third party
that has not executed a waiver if management believes that such third party s engagement would be significantly more beneficial
to us than any alternative. Examples of possible instances where we may engage a third party that refuses to execute a waiver include
the engagement of a third-party consultant whose particular expertise or skills are believed by management to be significantly superior
to those of other consultants that would agree to execute a waiver or in cases where management is unable to find a service provider
willing to execute a waiver. 

The
underwriters will not execute agreements with us waiving such claims to the monies held in the trust account. In addition, there is no
guarantee that such entities will agree to waive any claims they may have in the future as a result of, or arising out of, any negotiations,
contracts or agreements with us and will not seek recourse against the trust account for any reason. In order to protect the amounts
held in the trust account, our sponsor has agreed that it will be liable to us if and to the extent any claims by a third party for services
rendered or products sold to us (other than our independent registered public accounting firm), or a prospective target business with
which we have discussed entering into a transaction agreement, reduce the amounts in the trust account to below the lesser of (i) 10.10
per public share and (ii) the actual amount per public share held in the trust account as of the date of the liquidation of the trust
account if less than 10.10 per unit, due to reductions in the value of the trust assets, in each case net of the interest that may be
withdrawn to pay our taxes, if any, provided that such liability will not apply to any claims by a third party or prospective target
business that executed a waiver of any and all rights to seek access to the trust account nor will it apply to any claims under our indemnity
of the underwriters of this offering against certain liabilities, including liabilities under the Securities Act. 

20 

In
the event that an executed waiver is deemed to be unenforceable against a third party, our sponsor will not be responsible to the extent
of any liability for such third-party claims. However, we have not asked our sponsor to reserve for such indemnification obligations,
nor have we independently verified whether our sponsor has sufficient funds to satisfy their indemnity obligations and we believe that
our sponsor s only assets are securities of our company. Therefore, we cannot assure you that our sponsor would be able to satisfy
those obligations. None of our officers or directors will indemnify us for claims by third parties including, without limitation, claims
by vendors and prospective target businesses. 

In
the event that the proceeds in the trust account are reduced below the lesser of (i) 10.10 per public share and (ii) the actual amount
per public share held in the trust account as of the date of the liquidation of the trust account if less than 10.10 per unit, due to
reductions in the value of the trust assets, in each case net of the interest which may be withdrawn to pay our taxes, if any, and our
sponsor asserts that they are unable to satisfy its indemnification obligations or that it has no indemnification obligations related
to a particular claim, our independent directors would determine whether to take legal action against our sponsor to enforce its indemnification
obligations. While we currently expect that our independent directors would take legal action on our behalf against our sponsor to enforce
its indemnification obligations to us, it is possible that our independent directors in exercising their business judgment may choose
not to do so in any particular instance. Accordingly, we cannot assure you that due to claims of creditors the actual value of the per-share
redemption price will not be less than 10.10 per unit. 

We
will seek to reduce the possibility that our sponsor will have to indemnify the trust account due to claims of creditors by endeavoring
to have all vendors, service providers (other than our independent registered public accounting firm), prospective target businesses
or other entities with which we do business execute agreements with us waiving any right, title, interest or claim of any kind in or
to monies held in the trust account. Our sponsor will also not be liable as to any claims under our indemnity of the underwriters of
this offering against certain liabilities, including liabilities under the Securities Act. We will have access to up to approximately
 392,000 from the proceeds of this offering and the sale of the placement units with which to pay any such potential claims (including
costs and expenses incurred in connection with our liquidation, currently estimated to be no more than approximately 25,000). 

In
the event that we liquidate, and it is subsequently determined that the reserve for claims and liabilities is insufficient, stockholders
who received funds from our trust account could be liable for claims made by creditors, however such liability will not be greater than
the amount of funds from our trust account received by any such stockholder. We have access to the amounts held outside the trust account 391,924 as of December 31, 2022) with which to pay any such potential claims (including costs and expenses incurred in connection with
our liquidation, currently estimated to be no more than approximately 100,000). If we liquidate, and it is subsequently determined that
the reserve for claims and liabilities is insufficient, stockholders who received funds from our trust account could be liable for claims
made by creditors, however such liability will not be greater than the amount of funds from our trust account received by any such stockholder. 

Under
the DGCL, stockholders may be held liable for claims by third parties against a corporation to the extent of distributions received by
them in a dissolution. The pro rata portion of our trust account distributed to our public stockholders upon the redemption of our public
shares in the event we do not complete our initial business combination within the period to consummate the initial business combination
may be considered a liquidating distribution under Delaware law. If the corporation complies with certain procedures set forth in Section
280 of the DGCL intended to ensure that it makes reasonable provision for all claims against it, including a 60-day notice period during
which any third-party claims can be brought against the corporation, a 90-day period during which the corporation may reject any claims
brought, and an additional 150-day waiting period before any liquidating distributions are made to stockholders, any liability of stockholders
with respect to a liquidating distribution is limited to the lesser of such stockholder s pro rata share of the claim or the amount
distributed to the stockholder, and any liability of the stockholder would be barred after the third anniversary of the dissolution. 

21 

Furthermore,
if the pro rata portion of our trust account distributed to our public stockholders upon the redemption of our public shares in the event
we do not complete our initial business combination within the period to consummate the initial business combination, is not considered
a liquidating distribution under Delaware law and such redemption distribution is deemed to be unlawful (potentially due to the imposition
of legal proceedings that a party may bring or due to other circumstances that are currently unknown), then pursuant to Section 174 of
the DGCL, the statute of limitations for claims of creditors could then be six years after the unlawful redemption distribution, instead
of three years, as in the case of a liquidating distribution. If we do not complete our initial business combination within the period
to consummate the initial business combination, we will: (i) cease all operations except for the purpose of winding up, (ii) as promptly
as reasonably possible but not more than ten business days thereafter, redeem the public shares, at a per-share price, payable in cash,
equal to the aggregate amount then on deposit in the trust account including interest earned on the funds held in the trust account that
may be released to us to pay our taxes, if any (less up to 100,000 of interest to pay taxes and if needed, dissolution expenses), divided
by the number of then outstanding public shares, which redemption will completely extinguish public stockholders rights as stockholders
(including the right to receive further liquidating distributions, if any) and (iii) as promptly as reasonably possible following such
redemption, subject to the approval of our remaining stockholders and our board of directors, dissolve and liquidate, subject in each
case to our obligations under Delaware law to provide for claims of creditors and the requirements of other applicable law. 

Because
we will not be complying with Section 280, Section 281(b) of the DGCL requires us to adopt a plan, based on facts known to us at such
time that will provide for our payment of all existing and pending claims or claims that may be potentially brought against us within
the subsequent ten years. However, because we are a blank check company, rather than an operating company, and our operations will be
limited to searching for prospective target businesses to acquire, the only likely claims to arise would be from our vendors (such as
lawyers, investment bankers, etc.) or prospective target businesses. As described above, pursuant to the obligation contained in our
underwriting agreement, we will seek to have all vendors, service providers, prospective target businesses or other entities with which
we do business execute agreements with us waiving any right, title, interest or claim of any kind in or to any monies held in the trust
account. As a result of this obligation, the claims that could be made against us are significantly limited and the likelihood that any
claim that would result in any liability extending to the trust account is remote. Further, our sponsor may be liable only to the extent
necessary to ensure that the amounts in the trust account are not reduced below (i) 10.10 per public share or (ii) such lesser amount
per public share held in the trust account as of the date of the liquidation of the trust account, due to reductions in value of the
trust assets, in each case net of the amount of interest withdrawn to pay taxes and will not be liable as to any claims under our indemnity
of the underwriters of this offering against certain liabilities, including liabilities under the Securities Act. In the event that an
executed waiver is deemed to be unenforceable against a third party, our sponsor will not be responsible to the extent of any liability
for such third-party claims. 

If
we file a bankruptcy or winding-up petition or an involuntary bankruptcy or winding-up petition is filed against us that is not dismissed,
the proceeds held in the trust account could be subject to applicable bankruptcy or insolvency law and may be included in our bankruptcy
estate and subject to the claims of third parties with priority over the claims of our stockholders. To the extent any bankruptcy claims
deplete the trust account, we cannot assure you we will be able to return 10.10 per unit to our public stockholders. Additionally, if
we file a bankruptcy or winding-up petition or an involuntary bankruptcy or winding-up petition is filed against us that is not dismissed,
any distributions received by stockholders could be viewed under applicable debtor/creditor and/or bankruptcy or insolvency laws as either
a preferential transfer or a fraudulent conveyance. As a result, a bankruptcy or insolvency court could seek
to recover some, or all amounts received by our stockholders. Furthermore, our board of directors may be viewed as having breached its
fiduciary duty to our creditors and/or may have acted in bad faith, and thereby exposing itself and our company to claims of punitive
damages, by paying public stockholders from the trust account prior to addressing the claims of creditors. We cannot assure you that
claims will not be brought against us for these reasons. 

Our
public stockholders will be entitled to receive funds from the trust account only (i) in the event of the redemption of our public shares
if we do not complete an initial business combination within the period to consummate the initial business combination, (ii) in connection
with a stockholder vote to amend our amended and restated certificate of incorporation (A) to modify the substance or timing of our obligation
to allow redemption in connection with our initial business combination or to redeem 100 of our public shares if we do not complete
an initial business combination within the period to consummate the initial business combination or (B) with respect to any other provisions
relating to the rights of holders of our common stock, or (iii) if they redeem their respective shares for cash upon the completion of
the initial business combination. 

22 

Public
stockholders who redeem their common stock in connection with a stockholder vote described in clause (ii) in the preceding sentence shall
not be entitled to funds from the trust account upon the subsequent completion of an initial business combination or liquidation if we
have not completed an initial business combination within the period to consummate the initial business combination, with respect to
such shares of our common stock so redeemed. In no other circumstances will a stockholder have any right or interest of any kind to or
in the trust account. In the event we seek stockholder approval in connection with our initial business combination, a stockholder s
voting in connection with the initial business combination alone will not result in a stockholder s redeeming its shares to us
for an applicable pro rata share of the trust account. Such stockholder must have also exercised its redemption rights described above.
These provisions of our amended and restated certificate of incorporation, like all provisions of our amended and restated certificate
of incorporation, may be amended with a stockholder vote. 

Competition 

In
identifying, evaluating and selecting a target business for our initial business combination, such as the Openmarkets Merger, we may
continue to encounter intense competition from other entities having a business objective similar to ours, including other blank check
companies, private equity groups, venture capital funds leveraged buyout funds, and operating businesses seeking strategic acquisitions.
Many of these entities are well established and have significant experience identifying and effecting business combinations directly
or through affiliates. Moreover, many of these competitors possess greater financial, technical, human and other resources than us. Our
ability to acquire larger target businesses will be limited by our available financial resources. This inherent limitation gives others
an advantage in pursuing the acquisition of a target business. Furthermore, the requirement that, so long as our securities are listed
on Nasdaq, we acquire a target business or businesses having a fair market value equal to at least 80 of the value of the trust account
(less taxes payable on interest earned and less any interest earned thereon that is released to us for taxes) at the time of the agreement
to enter into the business combination, our obligation to pay cash in connection with our public shareholders who exercise their redemption
rights, and our outstanding rights and warrants and the potential future dilution they represent, may not be viewed favorably by certain
target businesses. Any of these factors may place us at a competitive disadvantage in successfully negotiating our initial business combination 

Employees 

We
have two officers. These individuals are not obligated to devote any specific number of hours to our matters, but they devote as much
of their time as they deem necessary to our affairs until we have completed our initial business combination. The amount of time our
officers devote in any period varies based on the stage of the business combination process we are in. We do not intend to have any full-time
employees prior to the consummation of our initial business combination. 

Periodic
Reporting and Financial Information 

We
have registered our common stock and rights under the Exchange Act and have reporting obligations, including the requirement that we
file annual, quarterly and current reports with the SEC. In accordance with the requirements of the Exchange Act, our annual reports
will contain financial statements audited and reported on by our independent registered public accountants. 

We
will provide stockholders with audited financial statements of the prospective target business as part of the tender offer materials
or proxy solicitation materials sent to stockholders to assist them in assessing the target business. These financial statements must
be prepared in accordance with, or be reconciled to, GAAP, or IFRS and the historical financial statements must be audited in accordance
with the standards of PCAOB. These financial statement requirements may limit the pool of potential target businesses we may acquire
because some targets may be unable to provide such statements in time for us to disclose such statements in accordance with federal proxy
rules and consummate our initial business combination within the applicable time frame. 

We
are required to have our internal control procedures evaluated for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2022, as required by the Sarbanes-Oxley
Act. A target company may not be in compliance with the provisions of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act regarding adequacy of their internal controls.
The development of the internal controls of any such entity to achieve compliance with the Sarbanes-Oxley Act may increase the time and
costs necessary to complete any such acquisition. 

23 

We
have filed a Registration Statement on Form 8-A with the SEC to voluntarily register our securities under Section 12 of the Exchange
Act. As a result, we are subject to the rules and regulations promulgated under the Exchange Act. We have no current intention of filing
a Form 15 to suspend our reporting or other obligations under the Exchange Act prior or subsequent to the consummation of our initial
business combination. 

We
are an emerging growth company, as defined in Section 2(a) of the Securities Act, as modified by the JOBS Act. As such,
we are eligible to take advantage of certain exemptions from various reporting requirements that are applicable to other public companies
that are not emerging growth companies including, but not limited to, not being required to comply with the auditor attestation
requirements of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, reduced disclosure obligations regarding executive compensation in our periodic
reports and proxy statements, and exemptions from the requirements of holding a non-binding advisory vote on executive compensation and
stockholder approval of any golden parachute payments not previously approved. If some investors find our securities less attractive
as a result, there may be a less active trading market for our securities and the prices of our securities may be more volatile. 

In
addition, Section 107 of the JOBS Act also provides that an emerging growth company can take advantage of the extended
transition period provided in Section 7(a)(2)(B) of the Securities Act for complying with new or revised accounting standards. In other
words, an emerging growth company can delay the adoption of certain accounting standards until those standards would otherwise
apply to private companies. We intend to take advantage of the benefits of this extended transition period. 

We
will remain an emerging growth company until the earlier of (1) the last day of the fiscal year (a) following January 13,
2027, the fifth anniversary of the completion of our initial public offering, (b) in which we have total annual gross revenue of at least
 1.07 billion, or (c) in which we are deemed to be a large accelerated filer, which means the market value of our shares that are held
by non-affiliates exceeds 700 million on the last day of the second fiscal quarter of any given fiscal year, and (2) the date on which
we have issued more than 1.0 billion in non-convertible debt securities during the prior three-year period. 

Item
1A. Risk Factors 

As
a smaller reporting company, we are not required to include risk factors in this Report. However, below is a partial list of material
risks, uncertainties and other factors that could have a material effect on the Company and its operations: 

we
 may not be able to select an appropriate target business or businesses and complete our initial business combination in the prescribed
 time frame; 

our
 expectations around the performance of a prospective target business or businesses may not be realized; 

we
 may not be successful in retaining or recruiting required officers, key employees or directors following our initial business combination; 

we
 are a blank check Company with no revenue or basis to evaluate our ability to select a suitable business target; 

lack
 of opportunity to vote on our proposed business combination; 

lack
 of protections afforded to investors of blank check companies; 

issuance
 of equity and/or debt securities to complete a business combination; 

we
 may lack sufficient working capital; 

third-party
 claims reducing the per-share redemption price; 

negative
 interest rate for securities in which we invest the funds held in the trust account; 

our
 stockholders being held liable for claims by third parties against us; 

failure
 to enforce our sponsor s indemnification obligations; 

24 

the
 ability of rights holders to obtain a favorable judicial forum for disputes with our company; 

we
 have dependence on key personnel and our officers and directors may have difficulties allocating
 their time between the Company and other businesses and may potentially have conflicts of interest with our business or in approving
 our initial business combination; 

conflicts
 of interest of our sponsor, officers and directors and the representative; 

the
 delisting of our securities by Nasdaq may occur and an active market for our public securities 
 may not develop and you will have limited liquidity and trading ; 

dependence
 on a single target business with a limited number of products or services; 

shares
 being redeemed and rights and rights becoming worthless; 

our
 competitors with advantages over us in seeking business combinations; 

we
 may lack the ability to obtain additional financing and the availability to us of funds from interest income on the trust account
 balance may be insufficient to operate our business prior to the business combination; 

our
 initial stockholders controlling a substantial interest in us; 

rights 
 and insider shares adverse effect on the market price of our common stock; 

disadvantageous
 timing for redeeming rights; 

registration
 rights adverse effect on the market price of our common stock; 

impact
 of COVID-19 and related risks; 

business
 combination with a company located in a foreign jurisdiction; 

changes
 in laws or regulations; tax consequences to business combinations; and 

exclusive
 forum provisions in our amended and restated certificate of incorporation. 

our
 financial performance following a business combination with an entity may be negatively affected by their lack an established record
 of revenue, cash flows and experienced management 

there
 may be more competition to find an attractive target for an initial business combination, which could increase the costs associated
 with completing our initial business combination; 

changes
 in the market for directors and officers liability insurance could make it more difficult and more expensive for us to negotiate
 and complete an initial business combination; 

we
may engage one or more of our underwriters or one of their respective affiliates to provide additional services to us after the initial
public offering, which may include acting as a financial advisor in connection with an initial business combination or as placement agent
in connection with a related financing transaction; 

our
 underwriters are entitled to receive deferred underwriting commissions that will be released from the trust account only upon a completion
 of an initial business combination. These financial incentives may cause them to have potential conflicts of interest in rendering
 any such additional services to us after the initial public offering, including, for example, in connection with the sourcing and
 consummation of an initial business combination; 

25 

since
 our initial stockholders will lose their entire investment in us if our initial business combination is not completed (other than
 with respect to any public shares they may acquire during or after this offering), and because our sponsor, officers and directors
 may profit substantially even under circumstances in which our public stockholders would experience losses in connection with their
 investment, a conflict of interest may arise in determining whether a particular business combination target is appropriate for our
 initial business combination; 

changes
 in laws or regulations or how such laws or regulations are interpreted or applied, or a failure to comply with any laws or regulations,
 may adversely affect our business, including our ability to negotiate and complete our initial business combination, and results
 of operations; 

Nasdaq
 may delist our securities from trading on its exchange prior to an initial business combination, which could limit investors 
 ability to make transactions in our securities and subject it to additional trading restrictions; 

the
 SEC has recently issued proposed rules relating to certain activities of SPACs. Certain of the procedures that we, a potential business
 combination target, or others may determine to undertake in connection with such proposals may increase our costs and the time needed
 to complete our initial business combination and may constrain the circumstances under which we could complete an initial business
 combination. The need for compliance with such proposals may cause us to liquidate the funds in the trust account or liquidate the
 Company at an earlier time than we might otherwise choose; 

the
 value of the founder shares following completion of our initial business combination is likely to be substantially higher than the
 nominal price paid for them, even if the trading price of our ordinary shares at such time is substantially less than 10.00 per
 share; 

if
 we are deemed to be an investment company for purposes of the Investment Company Act, we would be required to institute burdensome
 compliance requirements and our activities would be severely restricted. As a result, in such circumstances, unless we can modify
 our activities so that we would not be deemed an investment company, we may abandon our efforts to complete an initial business combination
 and instead liquidate the Company; 

we
 may not be able to complete an initial business combination with certain potential target companies if a proposed transaction with
 the target company may be subject to review or approval by regulatory authorities pursuant to certain U.S. or foreign laws or regulations,
 including the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States; 

recent
 increases in inflation and interest rates in the United States and elsewhere could make it more difficult for us to consummate an
 initial business combination; 

military
 conflict in Ukraine or elsewhere may lead to increased price volatility for publicly traded securities, which could make it more
 difficult for us to consummate an initial business combination; 

we
 have identified a material weakness in our internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2022 related to complex financial
 instruments as well as the Company s controls over reconciliations for accrued expenses and prepaid expenses during the financial
 statement close and disclosure review process. If we are unable to develop and maintain an effective system of internal control over
 financial reporting, we may not be able to accurately report our financial results in a timely manner, which may adversely affect
 investor confidence in us and materially and adversely affect our business and operating results; 

there
 is substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern if we do not complete our initial business combination
 by October 13, 2023; and 

resources
 could be wasted in researching acquisitions that are not completed, which could materially adversely affect subsequent attempts to
 locate and acquire or merge with another business. If we have not completed our initial business combination within the required
 period, our public stockholders may receive only approximately 10.20 per share, or less than such amount in certain circumstances,
 on the liquidation of our trust account, and our rights and warrants will expire worthless.

Overview 

We
are a blank check company formed under the laws of the State of Delaware on April 16, 2021, for the purpose of effecting a merger, capital
stock exchange, asset acquisition, stock purchase, reorganization or other similar Business Combination with one or more businesses.
We intend to effectuate our Business Combination using cash from the proceeds of the IPO and the sale of the private placement, our capital
stock, debt or a combination of cash, stock and debt. 

All
activity through December 31, 2022, relates to our formation and preparation of our IPO, which closed on January 11, 2022, and our search
for an initial Business Combination. We expect to incur significant costs in the pursuit of our initial Business Combination. We cannot
assure you that our plans to raise capital or to complete our initial Business Combination will be successful. 

In
our IPO, we completed the sale of 10,000,000 units that consisted of one share of common stock, par value 0.000001 per share and one
right, with each right entitling the holder thereof to receive one-tenth (1/10) of a share of common stock upon consummation of our Business
Combination. Simultaneously with the closing of our IPO, we closed a private placement of an aggregate
of 446,358 units at a price of 10.00 per private placement unit, generating total gross proceeds of 4,463,580. On February 9,
2022, the underwriters partially exercised the Over-Allotment Option and purchased an additional 159,069 Units generating 1,590,690,
and the Company completed the private sale of 4,772 private units generating 47,720 for a total of 4,511,300 from the placement units.
In connection with the closing and sale of the Over-Allotment Units and the additional private placement units, 1,606,597 in proceeds
from the Over-Allotment Closing (including 31,814 of the Underwriters deferred discount) was placed in a U.S.-based trust account
maintained by Continental Stock Transfer Trust Company, acting as trustee. 

As
of December 31, 2022, we had marketable securities held in the Trust account for the benefit of the Company s public shareholders
of 104,162,029 (including 1,555,432 of interest earned since the IPO). The trust fund account is invested in interest-bearing U.S.
government securities and the income earned on those investments is also for the benefit of our public shareholders. 

Our
management has broad discretion with respect to the specific application of the net proceeds of IPO and the Private Placement, although
substantially all of the net proceeds are intended to be applied generally towards consummating a business combination. 

Results
of Operations 

We
have neither engaged in any operations nor generated any revenues to date. Our only activities since inception have been organizational
activities, those necessary to prepare for our Initial Public Offering and identifying a target company for our initial Business Combination.
We do not expect to generate any operating revenues until after completion of our initial Business Combination. We generate non-operating
income in the form of interest income on cash and cash equivalents held in the Trust Account. We incur expenses as a result of being
a public company (for legal, financial reporting, accounting and auditing compliance), as well as expenses as we conduct due diligence
on prospective Business Combination candidates. 

For
the year ended December 31, 2022, we had a net loss of 433,615 consisting of formation and operating costs of 1,508,247 and franchise
tax of 195,138 and income tax of 285,662 offset by interest earned on marketable securities held in Trust of 1,555,432. 

For
the year ended December 31, 2021, we had a net loss of 20,095 consisting of formation and operating costs of 20,095. 

Recent
Developments 

As
previously reported by the Company on its Current Report on Form 8-K filed on January 24, 2023, on January 18, 2023, the Company entered
into a definitive Agreement and Plan of Merger and Business Combination Agreement (the Openmarkets Merger Agreement or
 BCA with Openmarkets Group Pty Ltd, an Australian proprietary limited company (the Target ), BMYG OMG Pty
Ltd, an Australian proprietary limited company and Broad Capital LLC, solely in its capacity as the Company s sponsor. 

29 

Pursuant
to the Openmarkets Merger Agreement, prior to the closing (the Closing of the contemplated transactions (collectively,
the Business Combination ), the Parties will cause the Company to move its domicile from the State of Delaware to Australia
by merging a to-be-formed Delaware corporation Merger Sub ), which shall be wholly-owned by a to-be-formed Australian corporation
(the Purchaser with and into the Company, with the Company continuing as the surviving entity and a wholly-owned subsidiary
of the Purchaser (the Redomestication Merger ). 

As
a result of the Redomestication Merger, (i) each issued and outstanding share of the Company s common stock, par value 0.000001
per share (the Company Common Stock ), will convert into the right to receive one ordinary share of the Purchaser (the Purchaser
Shares (ii) each of the Company s units (the Company Units ), comprised of one share of Company Common Stock
and one right to receive one-tenth of one share of Company Common Stock upon the Closing (each a Company Right ), shall
convert into the right to receive one unit of the Purchaser, comprised of one Purchaser Share and one right to receive one-tenth of one
Purchaser Share upon the Closing (each a Purchaser Right and (iii) each Company Right shall be converted into the right
to receive one Purchaser Right. For more information on the Openmarkets Merger and the Openmarkets Merger Agreement, see Item
1. Business and please refer to our Current Report on Form 8-K, filed with the SEC on January
18, 2023. 

Liquidity
and Capital Resources 

As
of December 31, 2022, the Company had 391,924 of cash in its operating bank account. 

The
Company s liquidity needs prior to the consummation of the Initial Public Offering were satisfied through the payment of 25,000
from the Sponsor to cover for certain offering costs on the Company s behalf in exchange for issuance of the insider shares (as
defined in Note 4). Following the Initial Public Offering of the Company on January 13, 2022, a total of 133,533 under the promissory
note was repaid on January 19, 2022, and the Company s liquidity has been satisfied through the net proceeds from the consummation
of the Initial Public Offering and the Private Placement held outside of the Trust Account. In addition, to finance transaction costs
in connection with a Business Combination, the Sponsor or an affiliate of the Sponsor, or certain of the Company s officers and
directors may, but are not obligated to, provide the Company Working Capital Loans (as defined in Note 4). As of December 31, 2022, there
were no amounts outstanding under any Working Capital Loan. 

Based
on the foregoing, management believes that the Company will have sufficient working capital and borrowing capacity to meet its needs
through the earlier of the consummation of a Business Combination or one year from this filing. Over this period, the Company will be
using the funds held outside of the Trust Account for paying existing accounts payable, identifying and evaluating prospective initial
Business Combination candidates, performing due diligence on prospective target businesses, paying for travel expenditures, selecting
the target business to merge with or acquire, and structuring, negotiating and consummating the Business Combination. 

The
Company s Sponsor, officers and directors may, but are not obligated to, loan the Company funds from time to time or at any time,
in whatever amount they deem reasonable in their sole discretion, to meet the Company s working capital needs. Accordingly, the
Company may not be able to obtain additional financing if needed. If the Company is unable to raise additional capital, it may be required
to take additional measures to conserve liquidity, which could include, but not necessarily be limited to, curtailing operations, suspending
the pursuit of a potential transaction, and reducing overhead expenses. 

On
April 16, 2021, Broad Capital LLC agreed to loan us up to an aggregate amount of up to 300,000 to cover expenses related to our IPO
of our units. Following the closing of our IPO on January 13, 2022, a total of 133,533 under the promissory note was repaid on January
19, 2022. 

Contractual
obligations 

As
of December 31, 2022, w e do not have any long-term debt,
capital lease obligations, operating lease obligations or long-term liabilities, other than an agreement to pay an affiliate of our Sponsor
a monthly fee of 10,000 for office space, utilities and administrative support provided to the Company. We began incurring these fees
on January 13, 2022 and will continue to incur these fees monthly until the earlier of the completion of the initial Business Combination
and the Company s liquidation. For the period April 16, 2021 (inception) through December 31, 2022, 110,000 of expense was recorded
and included in formation and operating costs in the statement of operations. 

The
underwriter is entitled to deferred commissions of 3,555,674 from the Units sold in the Initial Public Offering. The deferred commissions
will become payable to the underwriter from the amounts held in the Trust Account solely if we complete a Business Combination, subject
to the terms of the underwriting agreement. 

30 

Critical
Accounting Policies 

The
preparation of financial statements and related disclosures in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United
States of America requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, disclosure
of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements, and income and expenses during the periods reported. Actual
results could materially differ from those estimates. We have not identified any critical accounting policies. 

Item
7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk 

Through
December 31, 2022, our efforts have been limited to organizational activities, activities relating to our initial public offering and
since the initial public offering, the search for a target business with which to consummate an initial business combination, such as
Openmarkets. We have engaged in limited operations and have not generated any revenues. We have not engaged in any hedging activities
since our inception on April 16, 2021. We do not expect to engage in any hedging activities with respect to the market risk to which
we are exposed. 

The
net proceeds of the initial public offering and the sale of the private placement rights held in the trust account at J.P. Morgan Securities
LLC, maintained by Continental , acting as trustee, have been invested in U.S. government treasury
bills with a maturity of 180 days or less or in money market funds meeting certain conditions under Rule 2a-7 under the Investment Company
Act which invest only in direct U.S. government treasury obligations. Due to the short-term nature of these investments, we believe there
will be no associated material exposure to interest rate risk.

Evaluation
of Disclosure Controls and Procedures 

Under
the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and our Chief Financial Officer (together,
the Certifying Officers ), we carried out an evaluation of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure
controls and procedures as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act. Based on the foregoing, our Certifying Officers
concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were not effective as of the end of the period covered by this Report. 

Disclosure
controls and procedures are controls and other procedures designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in our reports
filed or submitted under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC s
rules and forms. Disclosure controls and procedures include, without limitation, controls and procedures designed to ensure that information
required to be disclosed in our reports filed or submitted under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to management, including
our Certifying Officers, or persons performing similar functions, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. 

Management s
Report on Internal Controls over Financial Reporting 

As
required by SEC rules and regulations implementing Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, our management is responsible for establishing
and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting. Our internal control over financial reporting is designed to provide
reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of our consolidated financial statements for
external reporting purposes in accordance with GAAP. Our internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures
that: 

(1) 
 pertain
 to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the
 assets of our company, 

31 

(2) 
 provide
 reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of consolidated financial statements in accordance
 with GAAP, and that our receipts and expenditures are being made only in accordance with authorizations of our management and directors,
 and 

(3) 
 provide
 reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of our assets that
 could have a material effect on the consolidated financial statements. 

Because
of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect errors or misstatements in our consolidated
financial statements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may
become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree or compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.
Management assessed the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting on December 31, 2022. In making these assessments,
management used the criteria set forth by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO) in Internal Control
 Integrated Framework (2013). Based on our assessments and those criteria, management determined that we did not maintain effective
internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2022, due to the material weakness in our internal controls due to inadequate
segregation of duties within account processes due to limited personnel and insufficient written policies and procedures for accounting,
IT, and financial reporting and record keeping. 

Management
intends to implement remediation steps to improve our internal controls due to inadequate segregation of duties within account processes
due to limited personnel and insufficient written policies and procedures for accounting, IT, and financial reporting and record keeping.
We plan to further improve this process by enhancing the size and composition of our board upon the closing of the business and to identify
third-party professionals with whom to consult regarding complex accounting applications and consideration of additional staff with the
requisite experience and training to supplement existing accounting professionals and implemented additional layers of reviews in the
financial close process. 

This
Annual Report on Form 10-K does not include an attestation report of our independent registered public accounting firm due to our status
as an emerging growth company under the JOBS Act. 

Changes
in Internal Control over Financial Reporting 

There
were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting (as such term is defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) of the Exchange
Act) during the most recent fiscal quarter that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal
control over financial reporting.

Notwithstanding

other similar fees, will be paid to any of our existing stockholders, officers, directors or any of their respective affiliates, prior
to, or for any services they render in order to effectuate the consummation of an initial business combination. Accordingly, it is likely
that prior to the consummation of an initial business combination, the compensation committee will only be responsible for the review
and recommendation of any compensation arrangements to be entered into in connection with such initial business combination. 

The
charter also provides that the compensation committee may, in its sole discretion, retain or obtain the advice of a compensation consultant,
legal counsel or other adviser and will be directly responsible for the appointment, compensation and oversight of the work of any such

 a board of directors that is effective, collegial and responsive to our needs; and 

should
 demonstrate diversity of viewpoints, background, experience, and other demographics, and all aspects of diversity to enable the board
 of directors to perform its duties and responsibilities effectively, including candidates with a diversity of age, gender, nationality,
 race, ethnicity, and sexual orientation. 

Each
year in connection with the nomination of candidates for election to the board of directors, the corporate governance and nominating
committee will evaluate the background of each candidate, including candidates that may be submitted by our stockholders. 

Code
of Ethics 

We
have adopted a Code of Ethics applicable to our directors, officers and employees. We have filed a copy of our Code of Ethics and our
audit committee charter with the SEC. You can review these documents by accessing our public filings at the SEC s web site at www.sec.gov.
In addition, a copy of the Code of Ethics will be provided without charge upon request from us. We intend to disclose any amendments
to or waivers of certain provisions of our Code of Ethics in a Current Report on Form 8-K. 

Item
11. Executive Compensation. 

Compensation
Discussion and Analysis 

The
following disclosure concerns the compensation of the Company s officers and directors for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2022
(i.e., pre-Business Combination). 

39 

None
of our officers or directors has received any cash compensation for services rendered to us. We have agreed to pay our Sponsor a total
of 10,000 per month for office space, utilities and secretarial and administrative support. Upon completion of the Business Combination,
we will cease accruing for these monthly fees. No compensation of any kind, including finder s and consulting fees, has been or
will be paid to our Sponsor, officers and directors, or any of their respective affiliates, for services rendered prior to or in connection
with the completion of the Business Combination. However, these individuals will be reimbursed for any out-of-pocket expenses incurred
in connection with activities on our behalf such as identifying potential target businesses and performing due diligence on suitable
business combinations. Our audit committee reviews on a quarterly basis all payments that were made to our Sponsor, officers or directors,
or our or their affiliates . 

After
the completion of our initial business combination, such as the Openmarkets Merger, members of our management team who remain with us
may be paid consulting or management fees from the combined company. All of these fees will be fully disclosed to stockholders, to the
extent then known, in the proxy solicitation materials or tender offer materials furnished to our stockholders in connection with a proposed
business combination. We have not established any limit on the amount of such fees that may be paid by the combined company to our members
of management. It is unlikely the amount of such compensation will be known at the time of the proposed business combination because
the directors of the post-combination business will be responsible for determining executive officer and director compensation. Any compensation
to be paid to our executive officers will be determined, or recommended to the board of directors for determination, either by a compensation
committee constituted solely by independent directors or by a majority of the independent directors on our board of directors. 

We
do not intend to take any action to ensure that members of our management team maintain their positions with us after the completion
of our initial business combination, although it is possible that some or all of our executive officers and directors may negotiate employment
or consulting arrangements to remain with us after our initial business combination. The existence or terms of any such employment or
consulting arrangements to retain their positions with us may influence our management s motivation in identifying or selecting
a target business but we do not believe that the ability of our management to remain with us after the completion of our initial business
combination will be a determining factor in our decision to proceed with any potential business combination. We are not party to any
agreements with our executive officers and directors that provide for benefits upon termination of employment. 

The
compensation committee has reviewed and discussed this Compensation Discussion and Analysis with management and based upon its review
and discussions, the compensation committee recommended to the board of directors that the Compensation Discussion and Analysis be included
in this Report. 

Item
12. Security Ownership of Certain Beneficial Owners and Management and Related Stockholder Matters. 

The
following table sets forth information regarding the beneficial ownership of our common stock as of March 15, 2023, based
on information obtained from the persons named below, with respect to the beneficial ownership of common stock, by: 

each
 person known by us to be the beneficial owner of more than 5 of our outstanding shares of common stock; 

each
 of our executive officers and directors that beneficially owns shares of common stock; and 

all
 our executive officers and directors as a group. 

In
the table below, percentage ownership is based on 8,922,505 shares of our common stock, par value 0.000001 per share, issued and outstanding
(including 5,931,608 shares subject to possible redemption), as of March 15, 2023. On all matters to be voted upon, except for the election
of directors of the board, holders of the shares of common stock and shares of common stock vote together as a single class. Currently,
all of the shares of common stock are convertible into common stock on a one-for-one basis. 

40 

Unless
otherwise indicated, we believe that all persons named in the table have sole voting and investment power with respect to all shares
of common stock beneficially owned by them. The following table does not reflect record or beneficial ownership of the private placement
rights as these rights are not exercisable within 60 days of the date of this Report.

13. Certain Relationships and Related Transactions, and Director Independence. 

On
May 7, 2021, our sponsor paid an aggregate of 25,000, or approximately 0.004 per unit, in exchange for the issuance of 2,875,000 insider
shares, par value 0.000001. The number of insider shares issued was determined based on the expectation that such insider shares would
represent 20 of the outstanding shares upon completion of this offering (excluding the placement units and underlying securities). Up
to 375,000 insider shares held by our sponsor were subject to forfeiture by our sponsor depending on the extent to which the underwriters 
over-allotment option was exercised. A portion of the insider shares (335,233 shares of common stock) were forfeited since the underwriters
exercised the over-allotment option only in part. 

The
insider shares (including the common stock issuable upon exercise thereof) may not, subject to certain limited exceptions, be transferred,
assigned or sold by the holder. In addition, our sponsor has transferred 80,000 insider shares of common stock among our four independent
directors effective as of May 25, 2021. 

On
January 13, 2022, simultaneously with the closing of our initial public offering, our sponsor purchased an aggregate of 446,358
 placement units at a purchase price of 10.00 per unit in a private placement for an aggregate
purchase price of 4,463,580 . There will be no redemption rights or liquidating distributions from the trust account with respect
to the insider shares, placement shares or placement rights, which will expire worthless if we do not consummate a business combination
by October 13, 2023, provided the Company deposits 0.0625 per share for each Public Share outstanding
 each month. There will be no redemption rights or liquidating distributions from the trust
account with respect to the insider shares, placement shares, placement rights or placement rights, which will expire worthless if we
do not consummate a business combination by October 13, 2023, unless otherwise extended by our stockholders. 

No
compensation of any kind, including any finder s fee, reimbursement, consulting fee or monies in respect of any payment of a loan,
will be paid by us to our sponsor, officers or directors or any affiliate of our sponsor, officers or directors prior to, or in connection
with any services rendered in order to effectuate, the consummation of an initial business combination (regardless of the type of transaction
that it is). However, these individuals will be reimbursed for any out-of-pocket expenses incurred in connection with activities on our
behalf such as identifying potential target businesses and performing due diligence on suitable business combinations. Our audit committee
will review on a quarterly basis all payments that were made to our sponsor, officers, directors or our or their affiliates and will
determine which expenses and the amount of expenses that will be reimbursed. There is no cap or ceiling on the reimbursement of out-of-pocket
expenses incurred by such persons in connection with activities on our behalf. 

43 

In
addition, to finance transaction costs in connection with an intended initial business combination, our sponsor or an affiliate of our
CEO or certain of our officers and directors may, but are not obligated to, loan us funds on a non-interest-bearing basis as may be required.
If we complete an initial business combination, we will repay such loaned amounts. If the initial business combination does not close,
we may use a portion of the working capital held outside the trust account to repay such loaned amounts but no proceeds from our trust
account would be used for such repayment. Up to 1,500,000 of such loans may be convertible into units, at a price of 10.00 per unit
at the option of the lender, upon consummation of our initial business combination. The units would be identical to the placement units.
Other than as described above, the terms of such loans by our officers and directors, if any, have not been determined and no written
agreements exist with respect to such loans. 

We
do not expect to seek loans from parties other than our sponsor or an affiliate of our CEO as we do not believe third parties will be
willing to loan such funds and provide a waiver against any and all rights to seek access to funds in our trust account. We expect our
primary liquidity requirements to include approximately 390,000 for legal, accounting, due diligence, travel and other expenses associated
with structuring, negotiating and documenting successful business combinations; 60,000 for legal and accounting fees related to regulatory
reporting requirements; 180,000 for office space, utilities and secretarial and administrative support; and approximately 20,000 for
working capital that will be used for miscellaneous expenses and reserves. 

After
our initial business combination, such as the Openmarkets Merger, members of our management team who remain with us may be paid consulting,
management, or other fees from the combined company with any and all amounts being fully disclosed to our stockholders, to the extent
then known, in the tender offer or proxy solicitation materials, as applicable, furnished to our stockholders. It is unlikely the amount
of such compensation will be known at the time of distribution of such tender offer materials or at the time of a stockholder meeting
held to consider our initial business combination, as applicable, as it will be up to the directors of the post-combination business
to determine executive and director compensation. 

The
holders of the insider shares, representative shares, placement units, and units that may be issued upon conversion of working capital
loans (and in each case holders of their component securities, as applicable) have (or will have) registration rights to require us to
register a sale of any of our securities held by them pursuant to a registration rights agreement to be signed on January 13, 2022. These
holders are entitled to make up to three demands, excluding short form registration demands, that we register such securities for sale
under the Securities Act. In addition, these holders have piggy-back registration rights to include their securities in
other registration statements filed by us. 

We
have entered into agreements with our officers and directors to provide contractual indemnification in addition to the indemnification
provided for in our amended and restated certificate of incorporation. Our bylaws also permit us to secure insurance on behalf of any
officer, director or employee for any liability arising out of his or her actions, regardless of whether Delaware law would permit such
indemnification. We have purchased a policy of directors and officers liability insurance that insures our officers and
directors against the cost of defense, settlement or payment of a judgment in some circumstances and insures us against our obligations
to indemnify our officers and directors. 

44 

Registration
Rights 

We
have entered into the IPO Registration Rights Agreement with respect to the Founder Shares, Private Placement Units, the shares of common
stock and Private Placement Rights underlying the Private Placement Units, and the shares of common stock issuable upon conversion of
the Private Placement Rights. Pursuant to the IPO Registration Rights Agreement, the Company Restricted Stockholders and their permitted
transferees can demand that we register the Founder Shares. Holders of our Private Placement Units and their permitted transferees can
demand that we register the Private Placement Units, the shares of common stock and Private Placement Rights underlying the Private Placement
Units, and the shares of common stock issuable upon exercise of the Private Placement Rights. The holders of these securities are entitled
to make up to two demands, excluding short form demands, that the Company register such securities. In addition, the holders have certain
 piggy-back registration rights with respect to registration statements filed after the consummation of the initial business
combination. The Company will bear the expenses incurred in connection with the filing of any such registration statements. 

Office
Space and Related Support Services 

The
Company agreed, commencing on the date the Company Units are first listed on the Nasdaq, to pay the Sponsor, or an affiliate thereof,
a total of 10,000 per month for office space, utilities, and secretarial and administrative support for up to 18 months. Upon completion
of the Company s initial business combination or the Company s liquidation, the Company will cease paying these monthly fees.
The Company incurred 110,000 in fees related to this service during the year ended December 31, 2022. 

Related
Party Loans 

To
finance transaction costs in connection with a business combination, the Sponsor or an affiliate of the Sponsor, or certain of the Company s
officers and directors may, but are not obligated to, loan the Company funds as may be required. Such working capital loans would be
evidenced by promissory notes. The notes may be repaid upon completion of a Business Combination, without interest, or, at the lender s
discretion, up to 1,500,000 of the notes may be converted upon completion of a Business Combination into units at a price of 10.00
per unit. Such units would be identical to the Private Placement Units. If a Business Combination does not close, the Company may use
a portion of proceeds held outside the Trust Account to repay any working capital loans, but no proceeds held in the Trust Account would
be used to repay the working capital loans. As of December 31, 2022, there were no working capital loans outstanding. 

On
April 16, 2021, the Sponsor issued an unsecured promissory note to the Company, pursuant to which the Company may borrow up to an aggregate
principal amount of 300,000, to be used for payment of costs related to the Company s initial public offering. The note, as amended,
was non-interest bearing and payable on the earlier of (i) March 31, 2022, or (ii) the consummation of the Company s initial public
offering. The Company borrowed 133,357 under the promissory note with the Sponsor. Following the closing of the Company s initial
public offering on January 13, 2022, the Company repaid a total of 133,357 under the promissory note on January 19, 2022. 

Founders 
Letter Agreement 

On
January 10, 2022, the Company, the Sponsor, and each of the Company Restricted Stockholders entered into a letter agreement, pursuant
to which, each Company Restricted Stockholder party thereto agreed to waive certain of their redemption rights, transfer rights and liquidation
rights with respect to their Founder Shares subject to the conditions set forth therein. Additionally, the Company Restricted Stockholders
parties thereto agreed to waive their redemption rights with respect to any shares of common stock they may own. The Company Restricted
Stockholders agreed (i) to vote their Founder Shares in favor of the adoption of any proposed business combination and the accompanying
transaction and (ii) if the Company engages in a tender offer in connection with a proposed business combination, to not seek to sell
any shares of common stock to the Company in connection with such tender offer. Additionally, each Company Restricted Stockholder party
thereto has agreed to certain standstill obligations, in each case on terms and subject to the conditions set forth therein. 

The
letter agreement will terminate upon the earlier to occur of (x) the expiration of the Lock-Up periods or (y) the liquidation of the
Company. 

Stockholder
Communications 

Stockholders
and interested parties may communicate with the Company s Board, any committee chairperson or the non-management directors as a
group by writing to the Company s Board or committee chairperson at Broad Capital Acquisition Corp., 5345 Annabel Lane, Plano,
Texas 75093 (if sent before the Business Combination) or with OMG s board of directors or any committee chairperson or the non-management
directors as a group, Level 40, 225 George Street, Sydney NSW 2000 (if sent after the Business Combination). Each communication will
be forwarded, depending on the subject matter, to the applicable board, the appropriate committee chairperson or all non-management directors.

Director
Independence 

Nasdaq
listing standards require that a majority of our board of directors be independent. An independent director is defined
generally as a person other than an officer or employee of the company or its subsidiaries or any other individual having a relationship
which in the opinion of the company s board of directors, would interfere with the director s exercise of independent judgment
in carrying out the responsibilities of a director. Our board of directors has determined that each
of Keith Adams, Wayne Trimmer, Nicholas Shao and Teck-Yong Heng is an independent
director, as defined in the Nasdaq listing standards and applicable SEC rules. Our independent directors will have regularly scheduled
meetings at which only independent directors are present. 

Item
14. Principal Accounting Fees and Services. 

The
following is a summary of fees paid or to be paid to MaloneBailey,
LLP , for services rendered. 

Audit
Fees . Audit fees consist of fees billed for professional services rendered for the audit of our year-end financial statements and
services that are normally provided by MaloneBailey, LLP in connection with regulatory filings. The aggregate fees billed by MaloneBailey,
LLP for professional services rendered for the audit of our annual financial statements, and other required filings with the SEC for

 80,500. The above amounts include interim procedures and audit fees, as well as attendance at audit committee meetings. 

Audit-Related
Fees . Audit-related services consist of fees billed for assurance and related services that are reasonably related to performance
of the audit or review of our financial statements and are not reported under Audit Fees. These services include attest
services that are not required by statute or regulation and consultations concerning financial accounting and reporting standards. We
did not pay MaloneBailey, LLP for consultations concerning financial accounting and reporting standards for the period from April 16,

REPORT
OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM 

To
the Shareholders and Board of Directors of 

 Broad
Capital Acquisition Corp. 

Opinion
on the Financial Statements 

We
have audited the accompanying balance sheets of Broad Capital Acquisition Corp. (the Company as of December 31, 2022 and
2021, and the related statements of operations, stockholders deficit, and cash flows for the year ended December 31, 2022 and
the period from April 16, 2021 (inception) through December 31, 2021, and the related notes (collectively referred to as the financial
statements ). In our opinion, the financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the
Company as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for the year ended December 31, 2022 and
the period from April 16, 2021 (inception) through December 31, 2021, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in
the United States of America. 

Going
Concern Matter 

The
accompanying financial statements have been prepared assuming that the Company will continue as a going concern. As more fully described
in Note 1 to the financial statements, the Company s business plan is dependent on the completion of a business combination within
a prescribed period of time and if not completed will cease all operations except for the purpose of liquidating. The date for mandatory
liquidation and subsequent dissolution raise substantial doubt about the Company s ability to continue as a going concern. Management s
plans in regard to these matters are also described in Note 1. The financial statements do not include any adjustments that might result
from the outcome of this uncertainty. 

Basis
for Opinion 

These
financial statements are the responsibility of the Company s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company s
financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board
(United States) PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal
securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. 

We
conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audits to obtain
reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. The Company
is not required to have, nor were we engaged to perform, an audit of its internal control over financial reporting. As part of our audits
we are required to obtain an understanding of internal control over financial reporting but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion
on the effectiveness of the Company s internal control over financial reporting. Accordingly, we express no such opinion. 

Our
audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error
or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding
the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant
estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe that our audits
provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.

Units being offered, the Public Shares ), at per Unit, generating gross proceeds of (the Initial
Public Offering ), and incurring transaction costs of , of which was for deferred underwriting commissions
(see Note 6). The Company granted the underwriter a 45-day option to purchase up to Units at the Initial Public Offering price
to cover over-allotments, if any. On February 9, 2022, the Underwriters partially exercised the over-allotment option and on February
10, 2022, purchased an additional Units from the Company (the Over-Allotment Units ), generating gross proceeds
of , and forfeited the remainder of the option. 

Simultaneously
with the consummation of the closing of the Initial Public Offering, the Company consummated the private placement of an aggregate of
 units (the Placement Units to the Sponsor at a price of per Placement Unit, generating total gross proceeds
of (the Private Placement (see Note 4). With the exercise of the Over-Allotment Units, the Company consummated
the Private Placement of Placement Units to the Sponsor generating gross proceeds of . 

On
February 9, 2022, the underwriters partially exercised the over-allotment option and purchased an additional Units, generating
gross proceeds of and forfeited the remainder of the option, which is shares of common stock. In connection with the
closing and sale of the Over-Allotment Units and the additional Placement Units (together, the Over-Allotment Closing ),
a total of in proceeds from the Over-Allotment Closing (which amount includes of the Underwriters deferred
discount) was placed in a U.S.-based trust account established for the benefit of the Company s public stockholders, maintained
by Continental Stock Transfer Trust Company, acting as trustee. 

Following
the closing of the Initial Public Offering on January 13, 2022, an amount of per Unit) from the net proceeds of
the sale of the Units in the Initial Public Offering and a portion of the proceeds from the sale of the Placement Units was placed in
a trust account (the Trust Account ), located in the United States and held as cash items or may be invested in U.S. government
securities, within the meaning set forth in Section 2(a)(16) of the Investment Company Act, with a maturity of 185 days or less, or in
any open-ended investment company that holds itself out as a money market fund meeting the conditions of Rule 2a-7 of the Investment
Company Act, as determined by the Company, until the earlier of: (i) the consummation of a Business Combination or (ii) the distribution
of the funds in the Trust Account to the Company s stockholders, as described below. 

Trust
Account 

The
Company s management has broad discretion with respect to the specific application of the net proceeds of the Initial Public Offering
and the sale of Placement Units, although substantially all of the net proceeds are intended to be applied generally toward consummating
a Business Combination. There is no assurance that the Company will be able to complete a Business Combination successfully. The Company
must complete one or more initial Business Combinations with one or more operating businesses or assets with a fair market value equal
to at least of the value of the net assets held in the Trust Account (as defined below) (excluding the deferred underwriting commissions
and taxes payable on the interest earned on the Trust Account). . 

Upon
the closing of the Initial Public Offering, management has agreed that an amount equal to at least per Unit sold in the Initial
Public Offering, including proceeds of the Placement Units, will be held in a trust account Trust Account ), located in
the United States and invested only in U.S. government securities, within the meaning set forth in Section 2(a)(16) of the Investment
Company Act, with a maturity of 185 days or less or in any open-ended investment company that holds itself out as a money market fund
selected by the Company meeting certain conditions of Rule 2a-7 of the Investment Company Act, as determined by the Company, until the
earlier of: (i) the completion of a Business Combination and (ii) the distribution of the funds held in the Trust Account, as described
below. 

Redemption
Option 

The
Company will provide the holders of the outstanding Public Shares (the Public Stockholders with the opportunity to redeem
all or a portion of their Public Shares either (i) in connection with a stockholders meeting called to approve the Business Combination
or (ii) by means of a tender offer in connection with the Business Combination. The decision as to whether the Company will seek stockholder
approval of a Business Combination or conduct a tender offer will be made by the Company. The Public Stockholders will be entitled to
redeem their Public Shares for a pro rata portion of the amount then in the Trust Account (initially anticipated to be per Public
Share, plus any pro rata interest then in the Trust Account, net of taxes payable). The Public Shares subject to redemption will be recorded
at a redemption value and classified as temporary equity upon the completion of the Initial Public Offering in accordance with the Accounting
Standards Codification ASC Topic 480 Distinguishing Liabilities from Equity . 

The
Company will not redeem Public Shares in an amount that would cause its net tangible assets to be less than (so that it does
not then become subject to the SEC s penny stock rules) or any greater net tangible asset or cash requirement which
may be contained in the agreement relating to the Business Combination. If the Company seeks stockholder approval of the Business Combination,
the Company will proceed with a Business Combination if a majority of the outstanding shares voted are voted in favor of the Business
Combination, or such other vote as required by law or stock exchange rule. If a stockholder vote is not required by applicable law or
stock exchange listing requirements and the Company does not decide to hold a stockholder vote for business or other reasons, the Company
will, pursuant to its second amended and restated certificate of incorporation (the Certificate of Incorporation ), conduct
the redemptions pursuant to the tender offer rules of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission SEC and file tender
offer documents with the SEC prior to completing a Business Combination. 

Stockholder
Approval 

If,
however, stockholder approval of the transaction is required by applicable law or stock exchange listing requirements, or the Company
decides to obtain stockholder approval for business or other reasons, the Company will offer to redeem shares in conjunction with a proxy
solicitation pursuant to the proxy rules and not pursuant to the tender offer rules. If the Company seeks stockholder approval in connection
with a Business Combination, the Sponsor has agreed to vote its Insider shares (as defined in Note 5) and any Public Shares purchased
during or after the Public Offering in favor of approving a Business Combination. Additionally, each Public Stockholder may elect to
redeem their Public Shares without voting, and if they do vote, irrespective of whether they vote for or against the proposed transaction. 

Notwithstanding
the foregoing, if the Company seeks stockholder approval of a Business Combination and it does not conduct redemptions pursuant to the
tender offer rules, the Certificate of Incorporation will provide that a Public Stockholder, together with any affiliate of such stockholder
or any other person with whom such stockholder is acting in concert or as a group (as defined under Section 13 of the Securities
Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the Exchange Act )), will be restricted from redeeming its shares with respect to more
than an aggregate of 20 of the Public Shares, without the prior consent of the Company. 

The
holders of the Insider Shares have agreed (a) to waive their redemption rights with respect to the Insider Shares and Public Shares held
by them in connection with the completion of a Business Combination and (b) not to propose an amendment to the Certificate of Incorporation
(i) to modify the substance or timing of the Company s obligation to allow redemptions in connection with a Business Combination
or to redeem of its Public Shares if the Company does not complete a Business Combination within the Combination Period (as defined
below) or (ii) with respect to any other provision relating to stockholders rights or pre-business combination activity, unless
the Company provides the Public Stockholders with the opportunity to redeem their Public Shares in conjunction with any such amendment. 

Openmarkets
Merger Agreement 

On
January 18, 2023, the Company entered into an Agreement and Plan of Merger and Business Combination Agreement (the Openmarkets
 Merger Agreement or BCA with Openmarkets Group Pty Ltd., an Australian
proprietary limited company Openmarkets or the Target ), BMYG OMG Pty Ltd., an Australian proprietary limited
company and Broad Capital LLC, solely as the Company s sponsor (collectively, the Parties ). Pursuant to the Openmarkets
Merger Agreement, prior to the closing (the Closing of the contemplated transactions (collectively, the Business
Combination ), the Parties will cause the Company to move its domicile from the State of Delaware to Australia by merging a to-be-formed
Delaware corporation Merger Sub ), which shall be wholly-owned by a to-be-formed Australian corporation (the Purchaser with and into the Company, with the Company continuing as the surviving entity and a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Purchaser (the Redomestication
Merger ). 

As
a result of the Redomestication Merger, (i) each issued and outstanding share of the Company s common stock, par value 
per share (the Company Common Stock ), will convert into the right to receive one ordinary share of the Purchaser (the Purchaser
Shares (ii) each of the Company s units (the Company Units ), comprised of one share of Company Common Stock
and one right to receive one-tenth of one share of Company Common Stock upon the Closing (each a Company Right ), shall
convert into the right to receive one unit of the Purchaser, comprised of one Purchaser Share and one right to receive one-tenth of one
Purchaser Share upon the Closing (each a Purchaser Right and (iii) each Company Right shall be converted into the right
to receive one Purchaser Right. 

Following
the Redomestication Merger, the Company will liquidate and all assets of the Company shall be transferred to the Purchaser and all liabilities
of the Company are, or shall be, assumed by the Purchaser (the Liquidation ). Additionally, the Company will cause all of
its contracts to be assigned to and assumed by the Purchaser. Also following the Redomestication Merger and the Liquidation, the Stockholder
will contribute all of the issued and outstanding ordinary shares of the Target to the Purchaser in exchange for Purchaser
Shares (the Exchange Consideration ). The Purchaser Shares shall have a deemed value of per share for the purposes
of all calculations and adjustments under the BCA, with such Exchange Consideration subject to adjustment based on the Target s
net indebtedness, working capital, and indemnification obligations following the Closing as detailed in the BCA (the Acquisition
Contribution and Exchange ). 

Any
adjustments to the Exchange Consideration shall be made from Purchaser Shares placed in escrow pursuant to an escrow agreement (the Escrow
Shares ), which Escrow Shares shall be released to either the Purchaser or the Stockholder based on the nature of the adjustment
to the Exchange Consideration. Additionally, in the event the Target s net working capital at the Closing (the Net Working
Capital exceeds the Target s pre-Closing estimated net working capital (the Estimated Net Working Capital ),
the Stockholder will receive additional Purchaser Shares in an amount equal to the difference between the Net Working Capital and the
Estimated Net Working Capital (the Adjustment Exchange Consideration ). Further, in addition to the Escrow Shares and the
Adjustment Exchange Consideration, an additional Purchaser Shares may be paid to the Stockholder based on certain performance
benchmarks following the Closing as detailed in the BCA (the Earnout ). 

Charter
Amendment and Termination Date 

If
the Company has not completed a Business Combination as provided by the First Amendment to the Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation
of the Company (the Charter Amendment executed following the January 10, 2023 Stockholders Meeting, changing the structure
and cost of the Company s right to extend the date (the Termination Date by which the Company (i) may consummate
a merger, capital stock exchange, asset acquisition, stock purchase, reorganization or similar business combination involving the Company
and one or more businesses, which we refer to as a business combination, (ii) cease its operations if it fails to complete
such business combination, and (iii) redeem or repurchase 100 of the Company s common stock included as part of the units sold
in the Company s initial public offering that closed on January 13, 2022, which is currently October 13, 2023 (provided the Company
funds the monthly extension payments to the Trust Account) unless extended, the Company will (a) cease all operations except for the
purpose of winding up, (b) as promptly as reasonably possible but not more than ten business days thereafter, redeem the Public Shares,
at a per-share price, payable in cash, equal to the aggregate amount then on deposit in the Trust Account, including interest earned
on the funds held in the Trust Account and not previously released to pay taxes (less up to of interest to pay dissolution expenses),
divided by the number of then outstanding Public Shares, which redemption will completely extinguish Public Stockholders rights
as stockholders (including the right to receive further liquidating distributions, if any), and (c) as promptly as reasonably possible
following such redemption, subject to the approval of the Company s remaining stockholders and the Company s board of directors,
dissolve and liquidate, subject in each case to the Company s obligations under Delaware law to provide for claims of creditors
and the requirements of other applicable law. 

The
holders of the Insider Shares have agreed to waive their liquidation rights with respect to the Insider shares if the Company fails to
complete a Business Combination within the Combination Period. However, if the holders of Insider shares acquire Public Shares in or
after the Initial Public Offering, such Public Shares will be entitled to liquidating distributions from the Trust Account if the Company
fails to complete a Business Combination within the Combination Period. The underwriters have agreed to waive their rights to their deferred
underwriting commission (see Note 6) held in the Trust Account in the event the Company does not complete a Business Combination within
the Combination Period, and, in such event, such amounts will be included with the other funds held in the Trust Account that will be
available to fund the redemption of the Public Shares. 

The Company will seek to reduce the possibility that the Sponsor will have to indemnify the Trust Account due to claims of creditors
by endeavoring to have all vendors, service providers (except for the Company s independent registered accounting firm), prospective
target businesses and other entities with which the Company does business, execute agreements with the Company waiving any right, title,
interest or claim of any kind in or to monies held in the Trust Account. 

Liquidity
and Capital Resources 

As
of December 31, 2022, the Company had of cash in its operating bank account. 

The
Company s liquidity needs prior to the consummation of the Initial Public Offering were satisfied through the payment of 
from the Sponsor to cover for certain offering costs on the Company s behalf in exchange for issuance of Insider shares (as defined
in Note 4). Following the Initial Public Offering of the Company on January 13, 2022, a total of under the promissory note was
repaid on January 19, 2022. After the consummation of the Initial Public Offering, the Company s liquidity has been satisfied through
the net proceeds from the consummation of the Initial Public Offering and the Private Placement held outside of the Trust Account. In
addition, to finance transaction costs in connection with a Business Combination, the Sponsor or an affiliate of the Sponsor, or certain
of the Company s officers and directors may, but are not obligated to, provide the Company Working Capital Loans (as defined in
Note 4). As of December 31, 2022, there were no amounts outstanding under any Working Capital Loan. 

Based
on the foregoing, management believes that the Company will have sufficient working capital and borrowing capacity to meet its needs
through the earlier of the consummation of a Business Combination or one year from this filing. Over this period, the Company will be
using the funds held outside of the Trust Account for paying existing accounts payable, identifying and evaluating prospective initial
Business Combination candidates, performing due diligence on prospective target businesses, paying for travel expenditures, selecting
the target business to merge with or acquire, and structuring, negotiating and consummating the Business Combination. 

Going
Concern Consideration 

The
Company expects to incur significant costs in pursuit of its financing and acquisition plans. In connection with the Company s
assessment of going concern considerations in accordance with Accounting Standards Update ASU 2014-15, Disclosures
of Uncertainties about an Entity s Ability to Continue as a Going Concern, management has determined that if the Company
is unsuccessful in consummating an initial business combination within the prescribed period of time from the closing of the Initial
Public Offering, the requirement that the Company cease all operations, redeem the public shares and thereafter liquidate and dissolve
raises substantial doubt about the ability to continue as a going concern. The balance sheet does not include any adjustments that might
result from the outcome of this uncertainty. Management has determined that the Company has funds that are sufficient to fund the working
capital needs of the Company until the consummation of an initial business combination or the winding up of the Company as stipulated
in the Company s amended and restated memorandum of association. The accompanying financial statement has been prepared in conformity
with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States of America GAAP ), which contemplate continuation of
the Company as a going concern.

As
of December 31, 2022, the Company had of U.S. federal and state net operating loss carryovers available to offset future taxable income.

In
assessing the realization of the deferred tax assets, management considers whether it is more likely than not that some portion of all
of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. The ultimate realization of deferred tax assets is dependent upon the generation of
future taxable income during the periods in which temporary differences representing net future deductible amounts become deductible.
Management considers the scheduled reversal of deferred tax liabilities, projected future taxable income and tax planning strategies
in making this assessment. After consideration of all of the information available, management believes that significant uncertainty
exists with respect to future realization of deferred tax assets and therefore established a full valuation allowance of as of December 31, 2022.

The
Company s effective tax rates for the periods presented differ from the expected (statutory) rates due to the recording of full
valuation allowances on deferred tax assets. 

The
Company files income tax returns in the U.S. federal jurisdiction and is subject to examination by the various taxing authorities. The
Company s tax returns since inception remain open to examination by the taxing authorities. There were unrecognized tax benefits
as of December 31, 2022. amounts were accrued for the payment of interest and penalties as of December 31, 2022. The Company is currently
not aware of any issues under review that could result in significant payments, accruals, or material deviation from its position. The

The
proceeds from the sale of the Placement Units were added to the net proceeds from the Initial Public Offering held in the Trust Account.
The Placement Units are identical to the Units sold in the Initial Public Offering. If the Company does not complete a Business Combination
within the Combination Period, the proceeds from the sale of the Placement Units will be used to fund the redemption of the Public Shares

shares held by our Sponsor. 

Due
to the over-allotment option being partially exercised by the underwriter on February 10, 2022 (see note 6), the Sponsor forfeited 
insider shares. As of December 31, 2022, there were insider shares issued and outstanding and further insider shares are
subject to forfeiture.

Note Related Party 

On
April 16, 2021, the Sponsor issued an unsecured promissory note to the Company, pursuant to which the Company may borrow up to an aggregate

and payable on the earlier of (i) March 31, 2022, or (ii) the consummation of the Initial Public Offering pursuant to an Amendment
to Promissory Note effective September 30, 2021. The Company had borrowed under the promissory note with the Sponsor. Following
the closing of the Initial Public Offering on January 13, 2022, the Company repaid a total of under the promissory note on January

Related
Party Loans 

In
order to finance transaction costs in connection with a Business Combination, the Sponsor or an affiliate of the Sponsor, or certain
of the Company s officers and directors may, but are not obligated to, loan the Company funds as may be required Working
Capital Loans ). Such Working Capital Loans would be evidenced by promissory notes. The notes may be repaid upon completion of
a Business Combination, without interest, or, at the lender s discretion, up to of the notes may be converted upon completion
of a Business Combination into units at a price of per unit. Such units would be identical to the Placement Units. If a Business
Combination does not close, the Company may use a portion of proceeds held outside the Trust Account to repay the Working Capital Loans,
but no proceeds held in the Trust Account would be used to repay the Working Capital Loans. As of December 31, 2022, there were amounts
outstanding under the Working Capital Loans. 

No
compensation of any kind, including any finder s fee, reimbursement, consulting fee or monies in respect of any payment of a loan,
will be paid by us to our sponsor, officers or directors or any affiliate of our sponsor, officers or directors prior to, or in connection
with any services rendered in order to effectuate, the consummation of an initial business combination (regardless of the type of transaction
that it is). However, these individuals will be reimbursed for any out-of-pocket expenses incurred in connection with activities on our
behalf such as identifying potential target businesses and performing due diligence on suitable business combinations. Our audit committee
will review on a quarterly basis all payments that were made to our sponsor, officers, directors or our or their affiliates and will
determine which expenses and the amount of expenses that will be reimbursed. There is no cap or ceiling on the reimbursement of out-of-pocket
expenses incurred by such persons in connection with activities on our behalf.

ITEM
2. MANAGEMENT S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS 

The
following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with the financial statements and related notes of the Company included
elsewhere in this proxy statement/prospectus. This discussion contains forward-looking statements reflecting our current expectations,
estimates and assumptions concerning events and financial trends that may affect our future operating results or financial position.
Actual results and timing of events may differ materially from those contained in these forward-looking statements due to a number of
factors, including those discussed in the sections entitled Risk Factors and Cautionary Note Regarding Forward-Looking
Statements. Unless otherwise indicated or the context otherwise requires, references in this section to the Company, 
 we, us, our, and other similar terms refer to the Company. 

Overview 

We
are a blank check company incorporated as a Delaware corporation and formed for the purpose of effecting a merger, capital stock exchange,
asset acquisition, stock purchase, reorganization or similar business combination Business Combination with one or more
businesses. We intend to effectuate our initial Business Combination using cash from the proceeds our initial public offering Initial
Public Offering and the private placement of the placement units Placement Units ), the proceeds of the sale of
our shares in connection with our initial Business Combination (pursuant to backstop agreements we may enter into), shares issued to
the owners of the target, debt issued to banks or other lenders or the owners of the target, or a combination of the foregoing. 

The
issuance of additional shares of common stock in connection with an initial Business Combination to the owners of the target or other
investors: 

may significantly dilute
 the equity interest of investors in our Initial Public Offering, which dilution would increase if the anti-dilution provisions in
 the insider shares resulted in the issuance of common stock on a greater than one-to-one basis; 

may subordinate the rights
 of holders of our common stock if preferred stock is issued with rights senior to those afforded our common stock; 

could cause a change in
 control if a substantial number of shares of our common stock is issued, which may affect, among other things, our ability to use
 our net operating loss carry forwards, if any, and could result in the resignation or removal of our present officers and directors; 

may have the effect of
 delaying or preventing a change of control of us by diluting the stock ownership or voting rights of a person seeking to obtain control
 of us; and 

may adversely affect prevailing
 market prices for our common stock and/or rights. 

Similarly,
if we issue debt securities or otherwise incur significant debt to banks or other lenders or the owners of a target, it could result
in: 

default and foreclosure
 on our assets if our operating revenues after an initial Business Combination are insufficient to repay our debt obligations; 

acceleration of our obligations
 to repay the indebtedness even if we make all principal and interest payments when due if we breach certain covenants that require
 the maintenance of certain financial ratios or reserves without a waiver or renegotiation of that covenant; 

our immediate payment of
 all principal and accrued interest, if any, if the debt security is payable on demand; 

our inability to obtain
 necessary additional financing if the debt security contains covenants restricting our ability to obtain such financing while the
 debt security is outstanding; 

our inability to pay dividends
 on our common stock; 

using a substantial portion
 of our cash flow to pay principal and interest on our debt, which will reduce the funds available for dividends on our common stock
 if declared, our ability to pay expenses, make capital expenditures and acquisitions, and fund other general corporate purposes; 

limitations on our flexibility
 in planning for and reacting to changes in our business and in the industry in which we operate; 

increased vulnerability
 to adverse changes in general economic, industry and competitive conditions and adverse changes in government regulation; 

limitations on our ability
 to borrow additional amounts for expenses, capital expenditures, acquisitions, debt service requirements, and execution of our strategy;
 and 

other purposes and other
 disadvantages compared to our competitors who have less debt. 

We
expect to continue to incur significant costs in the pursuit of our acquisition plans. We cannot assure you that our plans to complete
our initial Business Combination will be successful. 

F- 18 

Results
of Operations 

We
have neither engaged in any operations nor generated any revenues to date. Our only activities since inception have been organizational
activities and those necessary to prepare for our Initial Public Offering, described below, and identifying a target for our initial
Business Combination. We do not expect to generate any operating revenues until after completion of our initial Business Combination.
We generated non-operating income in the form of interest income on marketable securities held in the Trust Account of 1,555,432 for
the year ended December 31, 2022. We incur expenses as a result of being a public company (for legal, financial reporting, accounting
and auditing compliance), as well as for due diligence expenses in connection with completing our initial Business Combination and have
a net loss of 433,615 for the year ended December 31, 2022. 

Liquidity
and Capital Resources 

On
January 13, 2022, we consummated our Initial Public Offering of 10,000,000 Units at 10.00 per Unit, generating gross proceeds of 10,000,000
and incurring transaction costs of 6,917,226, of which 3,500,000 was for deferred underwriting commissions. On February 9, 2022, the
Underwriters partially exercised the over-allotment option and on February 10, 2022, purchased an additional 159,069 Units from the Company
(the Over-Allotment Units ), generating gross proceeds of 1,590,690, and forfeited the remainder of the option. 

Simultaneously
with the consummation of the closing of the Initial Public Offering, the Company consummated the private placement of an aggregate of
446,358 units (the Placement Units to the Sponsor at a price of 10.00 per Placement Unit, generating total gross proceeds
of 4,463,580 (the Private Placement ). With the exercise of the overallotment, the Company consummated the Private Placement
of an additional 4,772 Placement Units to Broad Capital LLC, a Delaware limited liability company (the Sponsor ), generating
gross proceeds of 47,720. 

We
intend to use substantially all of the funds held in the trust account, including any amounts representing interest earned on the trust
account (less deferred underwriting commissions), to complete our initial business combination. We may withdraw interest to pay taxes.
We estimate our annual franchise tax obligations, based on the number of shares of our common stock currently authorized and outstanding,
to be 195,138, which is the maximum amount of annual franchise taxes payable by us as a Delaware corporation per annum, which we may
pay from funds from this IPO held outside of the trust account or from interest earned on the funds held in our trust account and released
to us for this purpose. Our annual income tax obligations will depend on the amount of interest and other income earned on the amounts
held in the trust account. We expect the interest earned on the amount in the trust account will be sufficient to pay our income taxes.
To the extent that our capital stock or debt is used, in whole or in part, as consideration to complete our initial business combination,
the remaining proceeds held in the trust account will be used as working capital to finance the operations of the target business or
businesses, make other acquisitions and pursue our growth strategies. 

As
of December 31, 2022, we had cash and marketable securities held in the Trust Account of 104,162,029. As of March 15, 2023, we had cash
and marketable securities held in the Trust Account of 61,943,000 following the redemptions by
holders of 4,227,461 of the Company s public shares for cash at an approximate price of 10.25 per share, for an aggregate of approximately
 43.35 million plus the addition of three extension payments of 370,725.50 deposited in the Trust Account . We intend to use substantially
all of the funds held in the trust account, including any amounts representing interest earned on the Trust Account, excluding deferred
underwriting commissions, to complete our business combination. We may withdraw interest from the trust account to pay taxes, if any.
To the extent that our share capital or debt is used, in whole or in part, as consideration to complete our business combination, the
remaining proceeds held in the Trust Account will be used as working capital to finance the operations of the target business or businesses,
make other acquisitions and pursue our growth strategies. 

As
of December 31, 2022, we had cash of 391,924 outside of the Trust Account. To the extent we do not complete the Business Combination
with the Target, we intend to use the funds held outside the Trust Account primarily to identify and evaluate target businesses, perform
business due diligence on prospective target businesses, travel to and from the offices, plants or similar locations of prospective target
businesses or their representatives or owners, review corporate documents and material agreements of prospective target businesses, structure,
negotiate and complete a business combination. 

In
order to fund working capital deficiencies or finance transaction costs in connection with an intended initial business combination,
our sponsor or an affiliate of our chief executive officer or certain of our officers and directors may, but are not obligated to, loan
us funds on a non-interest-bearing basis as may be required. If we complete our initial business combination, we will repay such loaned
amounts. In the event that our initial business combination does not close, we may use a portion of the working capital held outside
the trust account to repay such loaned amounts but no proceeds from our trust account would be used for such repayment. 

Up
to 1,500,000 of such loans may be convertible into units, at a price of 10.00 per unit at the option of the lender, upon consummation
of our initial business combination. The units would be identical to the placement units. Other than as described above, the terms of
such loans by our officers and directors, if any, have not been determined and no written agreements exist with respect to such loans.
We do not expect to seek loans from parties other than our sponsor or an affiliate of our CEO as we do not believe third parties will
be willing to loan such funds and provide a waiver against any and all rights to seek access to funds in our trust account. 

We
expect our primary liquidity requirements during the 18-month period subsequent to our IPO to include approximately 390,000 for legal,
accounting, due diligence, travel and other expenses associated with structuring, negotiating and documenting successful business combinations;
 60,000 for legal and accounting fees related to regulatory reporting requirements; 180,000 for office space, utilities and secretarial
and administrative support; and approximately 20,000 for working capital that will be used for miscellaneous expenses and reserves. 

These
amounts are estimates and may differ materially from our actual expenses. In addition, we could use a portion of the funds not being
placed in trust to pay commitment fees for financing, fees to consultants to assist us with our search for a target business or as a
down payment or to fund a no-shop provision (a provision designed to keep target businesses from shopping 
around for transactions with other companies or investors on terms more favorable to such target businesses) with respect to a particular
proposed initial business combination, although we do not have any current intention to do so. If we entered into an agreement where
we paid for the right to receive exclusivity from a target business, the amount that would be used as a down payment or to fund a no-shop 
provision would be determined based on the terms of the specific business combination and the amount of our available funds at the time.
Our forfeiture of such funds (whether as a result of our breach or otherwise) could result in our not having sufficient funds to continue
searching for, or conducting due diligence with respect to, prospective target businesses. 

F- 19 

We
do not believe we will need to raise additional funds in order to meet the expenditures required for operating our business. However,
if our estimates of the costs of identifying a target business, undertaking in-depth due diligence and negotiating an initial business
combination are less than the actual amount necessary to do so, we may have insufficient funds available to operate our business prior
to our initial business combination. Moreover, we may need to obtain additional financing either to complete our initial business combination
or because we become obligated to redeem a significant number of our public shares upon completion of our initial business combination,
in which case we may issue additional securities or incur debt in connection with such business combination. In addition, we intend to
target businesses larger than we could acquire with the net proceeds of the IPO and the sale of the placement units and may as a result
be required to seek additional financing to complete such proposed initial business combination. Subject to compliance with applicable
securities laws, we would only complete such financing simultaneously with the completion of our initial business combination. 

If
we are unable to raise such additional capital, we may be required to take additional measures to conserve liquidity, which could include,
but not necessarily be limited to, curtailing operations, suspending the pursuit of a potential transaction, and reducing overhead expenses.
We cannot provide any assurance that new financing will be available to us on commercially acceptable terms, if at all. These conditions
raise substantial doubt about the Company s ability to continue as a going concern for a reasonable period of time, which is considered
to be one year from the issuance date of the financial statements. 

Going
Concern 

In
connection with our assessment of going concern considerations in accordance with Financial Accounting Standard Board s Accounting
Standards Update ASU 2014-15, Disclosures of Uncertainties about an Entity s Ability to Continue as a Going
Concern, we have until October 13, 2023 to consummate a Business Combination p rovided that
the Sponsor (or its affiliates or permitted designees) will deposit into the Trust Account an additional 0.0625 per share for each month
until October 13, 2023 . It is uncertain that we will be able to consummate a Business Combination by this time. If a Business
Combination is not consummated by this date, there will be a mandatory liquidation and subsequent dissolution. Management has determined
that the mandatory liquidation, should a Business Combination not occur, and potential subsequent dissolution raises substantial doubt
about our ability to continue as a going concern. 

Off-Balance
Sheet Financing Arrangements 

We
have no obligations, assets or liabilities, which would be considered off-balance sheet arrangements as of December 31, 2022. We do not
participate in transactions that create relationships with unconsolidated entities or financial partnerships, often referred to as variable
interest entities, which would have been established for the purpose of facilitating off-balance sheet arrangements. We have not entered
into any off-balance sheet financing arrangements, established any special purpose entities, guaranteed any debt or commitments of other
entities, or purchased any non-financial assets. 

Contractual
Obligations 

We
do not have any long-term debt, capital lease obligations, operating lease obligations or long-term liabilities, other than an agreement
to pay an affiliate of our Sponsor a monthly fee of 10,000 for office space, utilities and administrative support provided to the Company.
We began incurring these fees on January 13, 2022 and will continue to incur these fees monthly until the earlier of the completion of
the initial Business Combination and the Company s liquidation. For the period April 16, 2021 (inception) through December 31,
2022, 110,000 of expense was recorded and included in formation and operating costs in the statement of operations. 

The
underwriter is entitled to deferred commissions of 3,555,674 from the Units sold in the Initial Public Offering. The deferred commissions
will become payable to the underwriter from the amounts held in the Trust Account solely in the event that we complete a Business Combination,
subject to the terms of the underwriting agreement. 

F- 20 

Recent
Accounting Pronouncements 

Management
does not believe that any recently issued, but not yet effective, accounting pronouncements, if currently adopted, would have a material
effect on our condensed financial statements. 

JOBS
Act 

The
JOBS Act contains provisions that, among other things, relax certain reporting requirements for qualifying public companies. We will
qualify as an emerging growth company and under the JOBS Act will be allowed to comply with new or revised accounting pronouncements
based on the effective date for private (not publicly traded) companies. We are electing to delay the adoption of new or revised accounting
standards, and as a result, we may not comply with new or revised accounting standards on the relevant dates on which adoption of such
standards is required for non-emerging growth companies. As a result, our financial statements may not be comparable to companies that
comply with new or revised accounting pronouncements as of public company effective dates. 

Subject
to certain conditions set forth in the JOBS Act, if, as an emerging growth company, we choose to rely on such exemptions
we may not be required to, among other things, (i) provide an auditor s attestation report on our system of internal controls over
financial reporting pursuant to Section 404, (ii) provide all of the compensation disclosure that may be required of non-emerging growth
public companies under the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act, (iii) comply with any requirement that may be adopted
by the PCAOB regarding mandatory audit firm rotation or a supplement to the auditor s report providing additional information about
the audit and the financial statements (auditor discussion and analysis) and (iv) disclose certain executive compensation related items
such as the correlation between executive compensation and performance and comparisons of the CEO s compensation to median employee
compensation. These exemptions will apply for a period of five years following the completion of our IPO or until we are no longer an
 emerging growth company, whichever is earlier. 

Quantitative
and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk 

As
of December 31, 2022, we were not subject to any market or interest rate risk. Following the consummation of our initial public offering,
the net proceeds received into the Trust Account, have been invested in U.S. government treasury bills, notes or bonds with a maturity
of 185 days or less or in certain money market funds that invest solely in U.S. treasuries. Due to the short-term nature of these investments,
we believe there will be no associated material exposure to interest rate risk.

Exhibit
4.5 

DESCRIPTION
OF THE REGISTRANT S SECURITIES REGISTERED PURSUANT TO SECTION 12 

 OF
THE SECURITIES EXCHANGE ACT OF 1934, AS AMENDED 

As
of December 31, 2022, Broad Capital Acquisition Corp. we, our, us or the Company had the following three classes of securities registered under Section 12 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the Exchange
Act ): (i) its units, consisting of one share of common stock (as defined below) and one right (as defined below) (the units ),
(ii) its common stock, 0.000001 par value per share common stock ), and (iii) its public rights, entitling the holder
thereof to receive one-tenth (1/10) of a share of common stock upon consummation of our initial business combination (the rights ). 

Pursuant
to our first amended and restated certificate of incorporation, our authorized capital stock consists of 100,000,000 shares of common
stock, 0.000001 par value, and 1,000,000 shares of undesignated preferred stock, 0.000001 par value. The following description summarizes
the material terms of our capital stock and does not purport to be complete. It is subject to, and qualified in its entirety by reference
to, our amended and restated certificate of incorporation, our bylaws and our Rights Agreement, each of which is incorporated by reference
as an exhibit to our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2022 (the Report of which this Exhibit
4.5 is a part. 

Defined
terms used herein but not otherwise defined shall have the meaning ascribed to such terms in the Report. 

Units 

Each
unit consists of one share of common stock and one right. Pursuant to the Rights Agreement, the holder of a right is entitled to receive
one-tenth (1/10) of a share of common stock upon consummation of our initial business combination. 

Common
Stock 

Voting
Power 

Common
stockholders of record are entitled to one vote for each share held on all matters to be voted on by stockholders. Holders of the common
stock will vote together as one class on all matters submitted to a vote of the Company s stockholders, except as required by law.
There is no cumulative voting with respect to the election of directors, with the result that the holders of more than 50 of the shares
voted for the election of directors can elect all of the directors. 

Dividends 

The
Company s stockholders are entitled to receive ratable dividends when, as and if declared by the Company s board of directors
out of funds legally available therefor. The Company has not paid any cash dividends on its shares of Company Common Stock to date. 

The
payment of cash dividends in the future will be dependent upon the Company s revenues and earnings, if any, capital requirements,
and general financial condition subsequent to completion of a business combination. The payment of any cash dividends subsequent to a
business combination will be within the discretion of the Company s board of directors at such time. In addition, the Company s
board of directors is not currently contemplating and does not anticipate declaring any stock dividends in the foreseeable future. Further,
if the Company incurs any indebtedness, its ability to declare dividends may be limited by restrictive covenants the Company may agree
to in connection therewith. 

Preemptive
or Other Rights 

The
Company s stockholders have no preemptive or other similar rights. 

Redemption
Rights 

The
Company will provide its stockholders with the opportunity to redeem all or a portion of their public shares upon the completion of the
Company s initial business combination at a per-share price, payable in cash, equal to the aggregate amount then on deposit in
the trust account as of two business days prior to the consummation of the initial business combination including interest earned on
the funds held in the trust account and not previously released to the Company to pay its taxes, divided by the number of then outstanding
public shares, subject to the limitations described herein. The Sponsor and the Company s officers and directors have entered into
a letter agreement with the Company, pursuant to which they have agreed to waive their redemption rights with respect to any shares of
Company Common Stock held by them in connection with the completion of the Company s initial business combination. 

If
the Company seeks stockholder approval of its initial business combination and it does not conduct redemptions in connection with its
initial business combination pursuant to the tender offer rules, the Company s amended and restated certificate of incorporation
provides that a public stockholder, together with any affiliate of such stockholder or any other person with whom such stockholder is
acting in concert or as a group (as defined under Section 13 of the Exchange Act), will be restricted from redeeming its
shares of Company Common Stock with respect to more than an aggregate of 15 of the shares of Company Common Stock sold in the Company s
initial public offering (referred to herein as the Excess Shares ). However, the Company would not be restricting its stockholders 
ability to vote all of their shares (including Excess Shares) for or against the Company s initial business combination. The Company s
stockholders inability to redeem the Excess Shares will reduce their influence over the Company s ability to complete its
initial business combination, and such stockholders could suffer a material loss in their investment if they sell such Excess Shares
on the open market. Additionally, such stockholders will not receive redemption distributions with respect to the Excess Shares if the
Company completes an initial business combination. And, as a result, such stockholders will continue to hold that number of shares exceeding
15 and, in order to dispose of such shares, would be required to sell their stock in open market transactions, potentially at a loss. 

Rights
upon Liquidation, Dissolution, or Winding Up 

In
the event of a liquidation, dissolution or winding up of the Company following an initial business combination, the Company s stockholders
are entitled to share ratably in all assets remaining available for distribution to them after payment of liabilities and after provision
is made for each class of stock, if any, having preference over the Company Common Stock. There are no sinking fund provisions applicable
to the Company Common Stock, except that the Company will provide its stockholders with the opportunity to redeem their public shares
for cash equal to their pro rata share of the aggregate amount then on deposit in the trust account, upon the completion of the Company s
initial business combination, subject to the limitations described in the Report. 

Preferred
Stock 

The
Company s First Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation provides that shares of preferred stock may be issued from time
to time in one or more series. The Company s board of directors is authorized to fix the voting rights, if any, designations, powers,
preferences and relative, participating, optional, special and other rights, if any, and any qualifications, limitations and restrictions
thereof, applicable to the shares of each series. The Company s board of directors is able, without stockholder approval, to issue
preferred stock with voting and other rights that could adversely affect the voting power and other rights of the holders of the Company
Common Stock and could have anti-takeover effects. The ability of the Company s board of directors to issue preferred stock without
stockholder approval could have the effect of delaying, deferring or preventing a change of control of the Company or the removal of
existing management. The Company has no preferred stock outstanding at the date hereof. Although the Company does not currently intend
to issue any shares of preferred stock, it cannot assure you that it will not do so in the future. 

Rights 

Each
holder of a right will receive one-tenth (1/10) of one share of our common stock upon consummation of our initial business combination,
even if the holder of such right redeemed all common stock held by it in connection with the initial business combination. No additional
consideration will be required to be paid by a holder of rights in order to receive its additional shares upon consummation of an initial
business combination, as the consideration related thereto has been included in the unit purchase price paid for by investors in our
initial public offering. If we enter into a definitive agreement for a business combination in which we will not be the surviving entity,
the definitive agreement will provide for the holders of rights to receive the same per share consideration the holders of our common
stock will receive in the transaction, and each holder of a right will be required to affirmatively convert its rights in order to receive
the 1/10 share underlying each right (without paying any additional consideration) upon consummation of the business combination. More
specifically, the right holder will be required to indicate its election to convert the rights into underlying shares as well as to return
the original rights certificates to us. 

If
we are unable to complete an initial business combination within the required time period and we liquidate the funds held in the trust
account, holders of rights will not receive any such funds with respect to their rights, nor will they receive any distribution from
our assets held outside of the trust account with respect to such rights, and the rights will expire worthless. 

As
soon as practicable upon the consummation of our initial business combination, we will direct registered holders of the rights to return
their rights to our rights agent. Upon receipt of the rights, the rights agent will issue to the registered holder of such rights the
number of full common stock to which it is entitled. We will notify registered holders of the rights to deliver their rights to the rights
agent promptly upon consummation of such business combination and have been informed by the rights agent that the process of exchanging
their rights for common stock should take no more than a matter of days. The foregoing exchange of rights is solely ministerial in nature
and is not intended to provide us with any means of avoiding our obligation to issue the shares underlying the rights upon consummation
of our initial business combination. Other than confirming that the rights delivered by a registered holder are valid, we will have no
ability to avoid delivery of the shares underlying the rights. Nevertheless, there are no contractual penalties for failure to deliver
securities to the holders of the rights upon consummation of an initial business combination. 

The
shares issuable upon conversion of the rights will be freely tradable (except to the extent held by affiliates of ours). We will not
issue fractional shares upon conversion of the rights. Fractional shares will be rounded down to the nearest whole share. As a result,
you must hold rights in multiples of 10 in order to receive shares for all of your rights upon closing of a business combination. If
we are unable to complete an initial business combination within the required period and we liquidate the funds held in the trust account,
holders of rights will not receive any of such funds with respect to their rights, nor will they receive any distribution from our assets
held outside of the trust account with respect to such rights, and the rights will expire worthless. Further, there are no contractual
penalties for failure to deliver securities to the holders of the rights upon consummation of an initial business combination. Accordingly,
the rights may expire worthless. 

Listing
of Securities 

The
Company s units, shares of common stock, and rights are currently listed on Nasdaq, under the symbols BRACU, BRAC, 
and BRACR, respectively. The Company intends to apply to list the Purchaser Shares pursuant to the Openmarkets
Merger on the Nasdaq Capital Market under the symbol OMG, upon the closing of the Business Combination. All Purchaser
Rights under the BCA will convert into Purchaser Shares at the closing of the Business Combination and thus the Purchaser will
not have Purchaser Units or Purchaser Rights following the closing of the Business Combination. 

Transfer
Agent and Registrar and Rights Agent 

The
transfer agent and registrar for the Company Shares is, and for the Purchaser Shares under the BCA is expected to be, Continental Stock
Transfer Trust Company. The rights agent for the Company Rights is Continental Stock Transfer Trust Company. 

Certain
Anti-Takeover Provisions of Delaware Law and the Company s Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation and Bylaws 

The
Company is subject to the provisions of Section 203 of the DGCL regulating corporate takeovers. This statute prevents certain Delaware
corporations, under certain circumstances, from engaging in a business combination with: 

A stockholder who owns
 10 or more of the Company s outstanding voting stock (otherwise known as an interested stockholder ); 

an affiliate of an interested
 stockholder; or 

an associate of an interested
 stockholder, for three years following the date that the stockholder became an interested stockholder. 

A
 business combination includes a merger or sale of more than 10 of the Company s assets. However, the above provisions
of Section 203 do not apply if: 

the Company s board
 of directors approves the transaction that made the stockholder an interested stockholder, prior to the date of the
 transaction; 

the completion of the transaction
 that resulted in the stockholder becoming an interested stockholder, that stockholder owned at least 85 of the Company s voting
 stock outstanding at the time the transaction commenced, other than statutorily excluded shares of the Company common stock; 

or subsequent to the date
 of the transaction, the Company s initial business combination is approved by its board of directors and authorized at a meeting
 of its stockholders, and not by written consent, by an affirmative vote of at least two-thirds of the outstanding voting stock not
 owned by the interested stockholder. 

The
Company s first amended and restated certificate of incorporation provides that its board of directors will be classified into
three classes of directors. As a result, in most circumstances, a person can gain control of the Company s board of directors only
by successfully engaging in a proxy contest at two or more annual meetings. The Company s amended and restated certificate of incorporation
provides that, prior to the initial business combination, only holders of the Founder Shares will have the right to vote on the appointment
of directors. Holders of public shares of Company Common Stock will not be entitled to vote on the appointment of directors during such
time. In addition, prior to the completion of an initial business combination, holders of a majority of the Founder Shares may remove
a member of the board of directors for any reason. 

The
Company s authorized but unissued common stock and preferred stock will be available for future issuances without stockholder approval
and could be utilized for a variety of corporate purposes, including future offerings to raise additional capital, acquisitions and employee
benefit plans. The existence of authorized but unissued and unreserved common stock and preferred stock could render more difficult or
discourage an attempt to obtain control of the Company by means of a proxy contest, tender offer, merger, or otherwise. 

Exclusive
Forum for Certain Lawsuits 

The
Company s first amended and restated certificate of incorporation will require, to the fullest extent permitted by law, that derivative
actions brought in its name, actions against directors, officers and employees for breach of fiduciary duty and certain other actions
may be brought only in the Court of Chancery in the State of Delaware, except any action (A) as to which the Court of Chancery in the
State of Delaware determines that there is an indispensable party not subject to the jurisdiction of the Court of Chancery (and the indispensable
party does not consent to the personal jurisdiction of the Court of Chancery within ten days following such determination), (B) which
is vested in the exclusive jurisdiction of a court or forum other than the Court of Chancery or (C) for which the Court of Chancery does
not have subject matter jurisdiction. If an action is brought outside of Delaware, the stockholder bringing the suit will be deemed to
have consented to service of process on such stockholder s counsel. Although the Company believes this provision benefits the Company
by providing increased consistency in the application of law in the types of lawsuits to which it applies, a court may determine that
this provision is unenforceable, and to the extent it is enforceable, the provision may have the effect of discouraging lawsuits against
the Company s directors and officers. 

The
Company s amended and restated certificate of incorporation provides that the exclusive forum provision will be applicable to the
fullest extent permitted by applicable law, subject to certain exceptions. Section 27 of the Exchange Act creates exclusive federal jurisdiction
over all suits brought to enforce any duty or liability created by the Exchange Act or the rules and regulations thereunder. As a result,
the exclusive forum provision will not apply to suits brought to enforce any duty or liability created by the Exchange Act or any other
claim for which the federal courts have exclusive jurisdiction. In addition, the exclusive forum provision will not apply to actions
brought under the Securities Act, or the rules and regulations thereunder. 

Special
Meetings of Stockholders 

The
Company s bylaws provide that any special meetings of its stockholders may be called only by resolution of the board of directors,
or by the Company s Chairman or President. 

Advance
Notice Requirements for Stockholder Proposals and Director Nominations 

The
Company s bylaws provide that any stockholders seeking to bring business before the Company s annual meeting of stockholders,
or to nominate candidates for election as directors at its annual meeting of stockholders must provide timely notice of their intent
in writing. To be timely, a stockholder s notice will need to be delivered to the Company s principal executive offices not
later than the close of business on the 90th day nor earlier than the opening of business on the 120th day prior to the scheduled date
of the annual meeting of stockholders. The Company s bylaws also specify certain requirements as to the form and content of a stockholders 
meeting. These provisions may preclude the Company s stockholders from bringing matters before its annual meeting of stockholders
or from making nominations for directors at its annual meeting of stockholders. 

Action
by Written Consent 

Any
action required or permitted to be taken by the Company s stockholders must be effected by a duly called annual or special meetings
of such stockholders and may not be effected by written consent of the stockholders other than with respect to the Founder Shares. 

Classified
Board of Directors 

The
Company s board of directors is divided into three classes, Class I, Class II and Class III, with members of each class serving
staggered three-year terms. The Company s amended and restated certificate of incorporation provides that the authorized number
of directors may be changed only by resolution of the board of directors. Subject to the terms of any preferred stock, any or all of
the directors may be removed from office at any time, but only for cause and only by the affirmative vote of holders of a majority of
the voting power of all then outstanding shares of the Company s capital stock entitled to vote generally in the election of directors,
voting together as a single class. Any vacancy on the board of directors, including a vacancy resulting from an enlargement of the board
of directors, may be filled only by vote of a majority of the directors then in office. 

Changes
in Anti-Takeover Provisions under the Australian Companies Act and the Proposed Constitution 

Following
the Closing of the Business Combination, the Purchaser under the Openmarkets Merger will be subject to the takeover provisions in Chapter
6 of the Australian Companies Act instead of Section 203 of the DGCL. The Australian Companies Act restricts acquisitions of shares in
listed companies, and unlisted companies with more than 50 members, if the acquirer s (or another party s) voting shares
would increase to above 20 or would increase from a starting point that is above 20 and below 90 , unless certain exceptions apply. 

In
addition, the exclusive forum provision in the Company s Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation will be removed and
will not be part of the Constitution 

Rule
144 

Rule
144 is not available for the resale of securities initially issued by shell companies (other than business combination related shell
companies) or issuers that have been at any time previously a shell company. However, Rule 144 also includes an important exception to
this prohibition if the following conditions are met: 

the issuer of the securities that was formerly a shell company
has ceased to be a shell company; 

the issuer of the securities is subject to the reporting requirements
of Section 13 or 15(d) of the Exchange Act; 

the issuer of the securities has filed all Exchange Act reports
and material required to be filed, as applicable, during the preceding 12 months (or such shorter period that the issuer was required
to file such reports and materials), other than Form 8-K reports; and 

at least one year has elapsed from the time that the issuer
filed current Form 10 type information with the SEC reflecting its status as an entity that is not a shell company. 

As
a result, the Sponsor and any other holder of Founder Shares, Private Placement Units, Private Placement Shares, and Private Placement
Rights, as applicable will be able to sell their private placement securities pursuant to Rule 144 without registration one year after
the Company has completed its initial business combination, assuming the Company otherwise complies with the conditions set forth above. 

The
Company anticipates that following the consummation of the Business Combination, it will no longer be a shell company, and so, once the
conditions set forth in the exceptions listed above are satisfied, Rule 144 will become available for the resale of the above noted restricted
securities.
