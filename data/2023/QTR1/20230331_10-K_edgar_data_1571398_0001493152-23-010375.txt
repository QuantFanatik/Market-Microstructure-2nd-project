This Annual Report on Form
10-K Annual Reort contains forward-looking statements, which can be identified by the use of words such as estimate, 
 project, believe, intend, anticipate, plan, seek, 
 expect, will, may and words of similar meaning. These forward-looking statements include, but
are not limited to: 

statements
 of our goals, intentions and expectations; 

statements
 regarding our business plans, prospects, growth and operating strategies; 

statements
 regarding the asset quality of our loan and investment portfolios; and 

estimates
 of our risks and future costs and benefits. 

These
forward-looking statements are based on our current beliefs and expectations and are inherently subject to significant business, economic
and competitive uncertainties and contingencies, many of which are beyond our control. In addition, these forward-looking statements
are subject to assumptions with respect to future business strategies and decisions that are subject to change. We are under no duty
to and do not take any obligation to update any forward-looking statements after the date of this annual report. 

The
following factors, among others, could cause actual results to differ materially from the anticipated results or other expectations expressed
in the forward-looking statements: 

interest rate, liquidity, economic, market, credit, operational and inflation risks associated with our business, including the speed
and predictability of changes in these risks; 

our ability to retain deposits and attract new deposits and loans and the composition and terms of such deposits and loans; 

business and economic conditions generally and in the financial services industry, nationally and within our current and future geographic
markets, including the tight labor market, ineffective management of the U.S. Federal budget or debt or turbulence or uncertainty in
domestic or foreign financial markets; 

increased competition among depository and other financial institutions; 

economic
 and/or policy changes related to the COVID-19 pandemic; 

adverse
 changes in the securities markets; 

changes
 in laws or government regulations or policies affecting financial institutions, including changes in regulatory fees and capital
 requirements; 

our
 ability to enter new markets successfully and capitalize on growth opportunities; 

our
 ability to execute on our business strategy to increase commercial real estate and multi-family lending and commercial lending; 

2 

changes
 in consumer spending, borrowing and savings habits; 

changes
 in accounting policies and practices, as may be adopted by the bank regulatory agencies, the Financial Accounting Standards Board,
 the Securities and Exchange Commission (the SEC and the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board; 

climate
change, including any enhanced regulatory, compliance, credit and reputational risks and costs; 

geopolitical conditions, including acts or threats of terrorism,
actions taken by the U.S. or other governments in response to acts or threats of terrorism and/or military conflicts, including the war
between Russia and Ukraine, which could impact business and economic conditions in the U.S. and abroad; 

natural disasters, earthquakes, fires, and severe weather; 

changes
 in our organization, compensation and benefit plans; and 

changes
 in the financial condition, results of operations or future prospects of issuers of securities that we own. 

Because
of these and a wide variety of other uncertainties, our actual future results may be materially different from the results indicated
by these forward-looking statements. 

If one or more of the factors affecting our forward-looking information
and statements proves incorrect, then our actual results, performance, or achievements could differ materially from those expressed in,
or implied by, forward-looking information and statements contained in this Annual Report and other reports filed by us with the SEC.
Therefore, we caution you not to place undue reliance on our forward-looking information and statements. We will not update the forward-looking
information and statements to reflect actual results or changes in the factors affecting the forward-looking information and statements. 

Forward-looking information and statements should not be viewed as predictions,
and should not be the primary basis upon which investors evaluate us. Any investor in our common stock should consider all risks and uncertainties
disclosed in our filings with the SEC, all of which are accessible on the SEC s website at http://www.sec.gov.

Sunnyside
Federal Savings and Loan Association of Irvington 

Sunnyside
Federal is a federal savings association that was founded in 1930. In July 2013, we completed our mutual to stock conversion thereby
becoming a stock savings association and becoming the wholly owned subsidiary of Vecta Inc. Sunnyside Federal conducts business from
its full-service banking office located in Irvington, New York which is located in Westchester County, New York approximately 25 miles
north of New York City. We consider our deposit market area to be the Westchester County, New York towns of Irvington, Tarrytown, Sleepy
Hollow, Hastings, Dobbs Ferry and Ardsley-on-Hudson, and consider our lending area to be primarily Westchester, Putnam and Rockland Counties,
New York. 

Our business consists primarily of taking deposits from the general public
and investing those deposits, together with funds generated from operations, in commercial and multi-family real estate loans, one- to
four-family residential real estate loans, Small Business Administration SBA loans, and to a limited extent, commercial
loans, home equity lines of credit, student loans and other loans (consisting primarily of loans secured by deposits and marketable securities).
At December 31, 2022, 16.4 million, or 55.2 of our total loan portfolio, was comprised of commercial real estate and multi-family mortgage
loans, 9.7 million, or 32.5 of our total loan portfolio was comprised of owner-occupied, one- to four-family residential real estate
loans, 2.4 million, or 7.8 of our total loan portfolio, was comprised of student loans, 1.3 million, or 4.5 of our total loan portfolio,
was comprised of commercial, home equity and passbook loans. 

4 

We
also invest in securities, which consist primarily of U.S. government agency obligations and mortgage-backed securities and to a lesser
extent, securities of states, counties and political subdivisions. 

We
offer a variety of deposit accounts, including certificate of deposit accounts, money market accounts, savings accounts, NOW accounts
and individual retirement accounts. We can also borrow from the Federal Home Loan Bank of New York FHLB and the Federal
Reserve Bank FRB of New York. There were no borrowings outstanding at December 31, 2022. 

Our
current business strategy includes diversifying our loan portfolio to increase our jumbo residential and non-residential lending, including
commercial and multi-family real estate lending, construction and commercial lending and increasing our non-interest income, as ways
to improve our profitability in future periods. 

Sunnyside Federal is subject
to comprehensive regulation and examination by the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (the OCC ). Our executive and
administrative office is located at 56 Main Street, Irvington, New York 10533, and our telephone number at this address is (914) 591-8000.
Our website address is www.sunnysidefederal.com . Information on our website or in any websites linked
by our website should not be considered a part of this Annual Report. 

Market
Area and Competition 

We
conduct our operations from our full-service banking office located in Irvington, Westchester County, New York, which is located
approximately 25 miles north of New York City. Our primary deposit market area includes Irvington and the contiguous towns of
Tarrytown, Sleepy Hollow, Hastings, Dobbs Ferry and Ardsley-on-Hudson, all of which are located in Westchester County, New York. Our
primary lending market area includes Westchester, Putnam and Rockland counties, New York. We will, on occasion, make loans secured
by properties located outside of our primary lending market, especially to borrowers with whom we have an existing relationship and
who have a presence within our primary lending area. 

At
December 31, 2022, 9.7 million, or 32.5 , of our total loan portfolio was comprised of owner-occupied, one-to four family residential
real estate loans. Accordingly, a downturn in the residential real estate market in Westchester, Putnam, or Rockland Counties could significantly
affect our results of operations. 

Westchester
County is primarily a suburban community and is the second wealthiest county in the State of New York. Some key statistics, according
to the US Census Bureau, on Westchester County for the period of 2017 through 2021 are provided below: 

The
 homeownership rate in Westchester County was 61.6 , compared to 54.4 in the State of New York; 

The
 median home value in Westchester County was 559,900, compared to 340,600 in the State of New York; 

5 

The
 median household income in Westchester County was 105,387 compared to 75,157 in the State of New York; 

Approximately
 50.6 of the population of Westchester County held a bachelor s degree or higher, compared to 38.1 in the State of New York;
 and 

Approximately
 9.4 of the population of Westchester County had incomes below poverty level, compared to 13.9 in the State of New York. 

Sunnyside
Federal also makes loans on a regular basis to residents of Putnam and Rockland Counties, New York. Below are some key statistics, according
to the US Census Bureau, on the economic outlook of Putnam and Rockland Counties for the period of 2017 through 2021: 

The
 homeownership rate in Putnam County and Rockland County was 83.3 and 68.1 , respectively, compared to 54.4 in the State of New
 York; 

The
 median home value in Putnam County and Rockland County was 377,800 and 465,200, respectively, compared to 340,600 in the State
 of New York; 

The
 median household income in Putnam County and Rockland County was 111,617 and 99,707, respectively, compared to 75,157 in the State
 of New York; 

Approximately
 41.5 and 42.0 of the population of Putnam County and Rockland County, respectively, held a bachelor s degree or higher, compared
 to 38.1 in the State of New York; and 

Approximately
 6.6 and 15.2 of the population of Putnam County and Rockland County, respectively, had incomes below poverty level, compared to
 13.9 in the State of New York. 

We
face significant competition within our market both in making loans and attracting deposits. Our market area has a high concentration
of financial institutions, including large money center and regional banks, community banks and credit unions. Some of our competitors
offer products and services that we currently do not offer, such as trust services and private banking. Our competition for loans and
deposits comes principally from commercial banks, savings institutions, mortgage banking firms, consumer finance companies and credit
unions. We face additional competition for deposits from short-term money market funds, brokerage firms, mutual funds and insurance companies.
Our primary focus is to build and develop profitable customer relationships across all lines of business while maintaining our position
as a community bank. 

We
are a small community savings institution and as of June 30, 2022 (the latest date for which information is available), our market share
was 0.03 of total FDIC-insured deposits in Westchester, making us the 28th largest out of 32 financial institutions in Westchester County
based upon deposit share as of that date. 

6 

Business
Strategy 

Our
current business strategy is to operate as a community bank dedicated to serving the needs of our consumer and business customers and
emphasizing personalized and efficient customer service. Highlights of our current business strategy include: 

growing
 our assets and liabilities by increasing our presence in the communities we serve and expanding our service delivery channels; 

utilizing
 our management s commercial banking experience by diversifying our lending operations to increase our emphasis on commercial
 and multi-family real estate lending, commercial and construction lending; 

maintaining
 our strong asset quality profile through conservative loan underwriting; 

managing
 interest rate risk by emphasizing the origination of shorter-term loans for retention in our portfolio; 

continuing
 to attract and retain customers in our market area and build our core deposits consisting of demand, NOW, savings and
 money market accounts; and 

opportunistically
 seek to purchase or sell loans in the future including whole or participations in one to four-family residential real estate loans,
 commercial and multi-family real estate loans and student loans. 

Lending
Activities 

General.
 Historically, our principal lending activity has been the origination, for retention in our portfolio, of mortgage loans collateralized
by one- to four-family residential real estate located within our primary market area, and at December 31, 2022, 9.7 million, or 32.5 ,
of our total loan portfolio was comprised of one- to four-family residential real estate loans. We also offer commercial
real estate and multi-family real estate loans, which we retain in our portfolio, including non-owner occupied one - to four-family residential
real estate loans. At December 31, 2022, 16.4 million, or 55.2 of our total loan portfolio was comprised of commercial and multi-family
real estate loans. We intend to grow our commercial and multi-family real estate loan portfolio, subject to favorable market conditions. 

We
also offer commercial loans that are not real estate secured, home equity lines of credit and other loans. At December 31, 2022, 3.7
million, or 12.3 , of our total loan portfolio was comprised of commercial loans, home equity and other loans. We have, on occasion,
purchased loans, including commercial real estate, one- to four-family residential real estate loans and student loans, and at December
31, 2022 purchased loans accounted for 3.0 million of our total loan portfolio. We will opportunistically seek to purchase whole or
participations in one- to four-family residential real estate loans and commercial and multi-family real estate loans in the future.

One-
to Four-Family Residential Real Estate Lending . The focus of our lending program has historically been the origination and retention
in our portfolio of one- to four-family residential real estate loans. At December 31, 2022, 9.7 million, or 32.5 of our total loan
portfolio, consisted of one- to four-family residential real estate loans. 

We
originate both fixed-rate and adjustable-rate one- to four-family residential real estate loans. At December 31, 2022, 82.5 of our one-
to four-family residential real estate loans were fixed-rate loans, and 17.5 were adjustable-rate loans. 

Because
we have not historically sold any of the one- to four-family residential real estate loans that we have originated, we have not originated
these loans in conformance with either Fannie Mae or Freddie Mac underwriting guidelines. We may consider selling certain newly originated,
longer-term (15 years or greater), one- to four-family residential real estate loans, in an effort to generate fee income and manage
interest rate risk. It is expected that these loans will be underwritten according to Freddie Mac guidelines, and we will refer to loans
that conform to such guidelines as conforming loans. We could originate both fixed- and adjustable-rate mortgage loans
conforming to Fannie Mae guidelines in amounts up to the maximum conforming loan limits as established by the Federal Housing Finance
Agency for Freddie Mac, which as of January 1, 2023 was generally 726,200 for single-family homes in our market area. We may also originate
loans above the lending limit for conforming loans, which we will refer to as jumbo loans. 

Virtually
all of our one- to four-family residential real estate loans are secured by properties located in our primary lending area, which we
define as the New York Counties of Westchester, Putnam and Rockland. 

We
generally limit the loan-to-value ratios of our mortgage loans to 80 of the sales price or appraised value, whichever is lower. 

9 

Our
fixed-rate one- to four-family residential real estate loans typically have terms of 15 or 30 years. 

Our
adjustable-rate one- to four-family residential real estate loans generally have fixed rates for initial terms of three, five or seven
years, and adjust annually thereafter at a margin, which in recent years has been 2.50 over the weekly average yield on U.S. treasury
securities adjusted to a constant maturity of one year. The maximum amount by which the interest rate may be increased or decreased is
generally 2 per adjustment period and the lifetime interest rate cap is generally 6 over the initial interest rate of the loan. Our
adjustable-rate loans carry terms to maturity of up to 30 years. Certain of our adjustable-rate loans which were originated prior to
2010 can be adjusted upward but cannot be adjusted below the initial interest rate of the loan. 

Although
adjustable-rate mortgage loans may reduce to an extent our vulnerability to changes in market interest rates because they periodically
reprice, as interest rates increase the required payments due from the borrower also increase (subject to rate caps), increasing the
potential for default by the borrower. At the same time, the ability of the borrower to repay the loan and the marketability of the underlying
collateral may be adversely affected by higher interest rates. Upward adjustments of the contractual interest rate are also limited by
the maximum periodic and lifetime rate adjustments permitted by our loan documents. As a result, the effectiveness of adjustable-rate
mortgage loans in compensating for changes in general interest rates may be limited during periods of rapidly rising interest rates. 

We
do not offer interest only mortgage loans on permanent one- to four-family residential real estate loans (where the borrower
pays interest for an initial period, after which the loan converts to a fully amortizing loan). We also do not offer loans that provide
for negative amortization of principal, such as Option ARM loans, where the borrower can pay less than the interest owed
on the loan, resulting in an increased principal balance during the life of the loan. We do not offer subprime loans on
one-to four- family residential real estate loans i.e. , loans that generally target borrowers with weakened credit histories
typically characterized by payment delinquencies, previous charge-offs, judgments, bankruptcies, or borrowers with questionable repayment
capacity as evidenced by low credit scores or high debt-burden ratios), or Alt-A i.e. , loans that generally target
borrowers with better credit scores who borrow with alternative documentation such as little or no verification of income). 

Commercial
and Multi-Family Real Estate Lending . Consistent with our strategy to expand our loan products and to enhance the yield and reduce
the term to maturity of our loan portfolio, we offer commercial and multi-family real estate loans. At December 31, 2022, we had 16.4
million in commercial and multi-family real estate loans, representing 55.2 of our total loan portfolio. Subject to future economic,
market and regulatory conditions, we will continue to increase our emphasis on originations and purchases of commercial and multi-family
real estate loans. 

Generally,
our commercial real estate and multi-family loans have terms of up to 10 years and amortize for a period of up to 25 years. Interest
rates may be fixed or adjustable, and if adjustable then they are generally based upon a 5 year Treasury or Federal Home Loan Bank index
or the Prime rate of interest. 

10 

Almost
all of our commercial and multi-family real estate loans are collateralized by office buildings, mixed-use properties and multi-family
real estate located in our market area. 

We
consider a number of factors in originating commercial and multi-family real estate loans, including non-owner occupied, one- to four-family
residential real estate loans. We evaluate the qualifications and financial condition of the borrower, including credit history, profitability
and expertise, as well as the value and condition of the property securing the loan. When evaluating the qualifications of the borrower,
we consider the financial resources of the borrower, the borrower s experience in owning or managing similar property and the borrower s
payment history with us and other financial institutions. In evaluating the property securing the loan, the factors we consider include
the net operating income of the mortgaged property before debt service and depreciation, the ratio of the loan amount to the appraised
value of the mortgaged property and the debt service coverage ratio (the ratio of net operating income to debt service). All commercial
and multi-family real estate loans are appraised by outside independent appraisers who are approved by the board of directors on an annual
basis. Personal guarantees are generally obtained from the principals of commercial and multi-family real estate loans. 

Commercial
and multi-family real estate loans, including non-owner occupied, one- to four-family residential real estate loans, entail greater credit
risks compared to owner-occupied one- to four-family residential real estate loans because they typically involve larger loan balances
concentrated with single borrowers or groups of related borrowers. In addition, the payment of loans secured by income-producing properties
typically depends on the successful operation of the property, as repayment of the loan generally is dependent, in large part, on sufficient
income from the property to cover operating expenses and debt service. Changes in economic conditions that are not in the control of
the borrower or lender could affect the value of the collateral for the loan or the future cash flow of the property. Additionally, any
decline in real estate values may be more pronounced for commercial and multi-family real estate than residential properties. 

Our
loans-to-one borrower limit is 15 of Sunnyside Federal s unimpaired capital, which limit was 1.7 million at December 31,
2022. We generally target commercial and multi-family real estate loans with balances of up to the lesser of 1.5 million or our
legal lending limit. At December 31, 2022, our average commercial real estate and multi-family loan had a balance of 567,000. At
that same date, our largest commercial real estate relationship totaled 1.7 million and was performing in accordance with its
repayment terms. 

Student
Loans. We underwrite and purchase private student loans setting maximum debt-to-income ratios, minimum income and minimum FICO
scores. The underwritten loans are typically variable rate loans for students who are pursuing undergraduate or post-undergraduate studies.
These loans totaled 2.3 million at December 31, 2022 and have repayment terms up to 20 years. Our purchased portfolio is generally for
consolidation student loans with repayment terms that do not exceed 10 years. These loans totaled 408,000 at December 31, 2022. At December
31, 2022, student loans totaled 2.3 million and represented 7.8 of our loan portfolio. 

11 

Management
believes that offering student loans and other loan products helps expand and create stronger ties to our existing customer base by increasing
the number of customer relationships and providing cross-marketing opportunities. 

Student
loans and other loans generally have greater risk compared to longer-term loans secured by one- to four-family residential real estate
loans. 

Commercial
Loans and Other. To a lesser extent, we offer commercial loans that are not real estate secured as well as passbook loans. At
December 31, 2022, commercial and other loans totaled 1.2 million, or 3.9 of our loan portfolio. 

Home
Equity Lines of Credit. We offer home equity lines of credit secured by a first or second mortgage on residential property. Home
equity lines of credit are made with adjustable rates, and with combined loan-to-value ratios of up to 80 on an owner-occupied principal
residence. 

Home
equity lines of credit are generally underwritten using the same criteria that we use to underwrite one- to four-family residential real
estate loans. Home equity lines of credit may be underwritten with a loan-to-value ratio of up to 80 when combined with the principal
balance of the existing first mortgage loan. Generally, our home equity lines of credit are originated with adjustable-rates based on
the floating prime rate of interest and require interest paid monthly during the first five years and principal and interest for an additional
10 years. Home equity lines of credit are available in amounts of up to 250,000. 

Home
equity lines of credit have greater risk than one- to four-family residential real estate loans secured by first mortgages. We face the
risk that the collateral will be insufficient to compensate us for loan losses and costs of foreclosure. When customers default on their
loans, we attempt to foreclose on the property and resell the property as soon as possible to minimize foreclosure and carrying costs.
However, the value of the collateral may not be sufficient to compensate us for the amount of the unpaid loan and we may be unsuccessful
in recovering the remaining balance from those customers. Decreases in real estate values could adversely affect the value of property
used as collateral for our loans. 

At
December 31, 2022, our home equity lines of credit totaled 170,000 and were performing in accordance with their repayment terms. 

Loan
Originations, Purchases and Sales. Our loan originations are generated by our loan personnel operating at our banking office.
All loans we originate are underwritten pursuant to our policies and procedures. While we originate both fixed-rate and adjustable-rate
loans, our ability to generate each type of loan depends upon relative borrower demand and the pricing levels as set in the local marketplace
by competing banks, thrifts, credit unions, and mortgage banking companies. Our volume of real estate loan originations is influenced
significantly by market interest rates, and, accordingly, the volume of our real estate loan originations can vary from period to period.

12 

We
have historically retained all of our loans in portfolio, but we may, subject to favorable market conditions, consider selling certain
longer-term (15 years or greater), fixed-rate one-to-four family residential real estate loans. 

We
have, on occasion, purchased commercial real estate and one- to four-family residential real estate loans, and in recent years, student
loans. At December 31, 2022, these types of purchased loans accounted for 3.0 million of our total loan portfolio. We will opportunistically
seek to purchase loans in the future including whole or participations in one to four-family residential real estate loans, commercial
and multi-family real estate loans and student loans.

Loan
Approval Procedures and Authority . Pursuant to applicable law, the aggregate amount of loans that we are permitted to make to
any one borrower or a group of related borrowers is generally limited to 15 of Sunnyside Federal s unimpaired capital and surplus
(25 if the amount in excess of 15 is secured by readily marketable collateral or 30 for certain residential development
loans). At December 31, 2022, our largest credit relationship totaled 1.7 million and was secured by commercial real estate. At December
31, 2022, this relationship was performing in accordance with its repayment terms. Our second largest relationship at this date was a
 1.5 million loan secured by commercial real estate that was performing in accordance with its repayment terms. 

Our
lending is subject to written underwriting standards and origination procedures. Decisions on loan applications are made on the basis
of detailed applications submitted by the prospective borrower and property valuations (consistent with our appraisal policy) prepared
by outside independent licensed appraisers approved by our board of directors as well as internal evaluations, where permitted by regulations.
The loan applications are designed primarily to determine the borrower s ability to repay the requested loan, and the more significant
items on the application are verified through use of credit reports, financial statements and tax returns. 

All commercial and multi-family real estate loans require approval from
our Board of Directors. 

Generally,
we require title insurance on our mortgage loans as well as fire and extended coverage casualty insurance in amounts at least equal to
the principal amount of the loan or the value of improvements on the property, depending on the type of loan. We also require flood insurance
if the improved property is determined to be in a flood zone area. 

Collection
Procedures. When a residential mortgage borrower fails to make required payments on a loan, we take a number of steps to induce
the borrower to cure the delinquency and restore the loan to current status. With respect to residential real estate loans, we generally
send a written notice of non-payment to the borrower 15, 30, 60 and 90 days after a loan is first past due. When a loan becomes 90 days
past due, the loan is turned over to our attorneys to ensure that further collection activities are conducted in accordance with applicable
laws and regulations. All loans past due 90 days are put on non-accrual and reported to the board of directors monthly. If our attorneys
do not receive a response from the borrower, or if the terms of any payment plan established are not followed, then foreclosure proceedings
will be implemented. Management submits an Asset Classification Report detailing delinquencies to the board of directors on a monthly
basis.

Classified
Assets . Federal regulations require that each insured savings institution classify its assets on a regular basis. In addition,
in connection with examinations of insured institutions, federal examiners have authority to identify problem assets and, if appropriate,
classify them. There are three classifications for problem assets: substandard, doubtful and loss. 
Substandard assets have one or more defined weaknesses and are characterized by the distinct possibility that the insured institution
will sustain some loss if the deficiencies are not corrected. Doubtful assets have the weaknesses of substandard assets with the additional
characteristic that the weaknesses make collection or liquidation in full on the basis of currently existing facts, conditions and values
questionable, and there is a higher possibility of loss. An asset classified as a loss is considered uncollectible and of such little
value that continuance as an asset of the institution is not warranted. Another category designated special mention also
may be established and maintained for assets which do not currently expose an insured institution to a sufficient degree of risk to warrant
classification as substandard, doubtful or loss. If a classified asset is deemed to be impaired with measurement of loss, Sunnyside Federal
will establish a charge-off of the loan pursuant to Accounting Standards Codification Topic 310, Receivables.

following table sets forth information regarding classified assets and special mention assets at December 31, 2022.

Potential
problem loans are loans that are currently performing and are not included in non-accrual loans above, but may be delinquent. These loans
require an increased level of management attention, because we have serious doubts as to the ability of the borrower to comply with the
present loan repayment terms and as a result such loans may be included at a later date in non-accrual loans. At December 31, 2022, we
had no potential problem loans that are not accounted for above under Classified Assets. Please see Non-Performing
Assets above for a discussion of our special mention loans at December 31, 2022. 

Allowance
for Loan Losses . We maintain the allowance through provisions for loan losses that we charge to income. We charge losses on loans
against the allowance for loan losses when we believe the collection of loan principal is unlikely. Recoveries on loans charged-off are
restored to the allowance for loan losses. The allowance for loan losses is maintained at a level believed, to the best of management s
knowledge, to cover all known and inherent losses in the portfolio both probable and reasonable to estimate at each reporting date. 

16 

The
level of allowance for loan losses is based on management s periodic review of the collectability of the loans principally in light
of our historical experience, augmented by the nature and volume of the loan portfolio, adverse situations that may affect the borrower s
ability to repay, estimated value of any underlying collateral and current and anticipated economic conditions in the primary lending
area. We evaluate our allowance for loan losses quarterly. We will continue to monitor all items involved in the allowance calculation
closely. 

In
addition, the regulatory agencies, as an integral part of their examination and review process, periodically review our loan portfolios
and the related allowance for loan losses. Regulatory agencies may require us to increase the allowance for loan losses based on their
judgments of information available to them at the time of their examination, thereby adversely affecting our results of operations. 

For
the seven months ended December 31, 2022, we recorded a provision of 69,000. As a result of the Merger, we recorded a credit mark of
 895,000, of which, 774,000 is remaining at December 31, 2022. The allowance for loan losses was 79,000 at December 31, 2022. The combined
credit mark and allowance for loan losses totaled 853,000 at December 31, 2022 and represented 2.86 of gross loans outstanding. The
level of our allowance reflects management s view of the risks inherent in the loan portfolio. Consistent with our business strategy,
we intend to increase our originations of commercial and multi-family real estate and commercial loans. These types of loans generally
bear higher risk than our one- to four-family residential real estate loans. Accordingly we would expect to increase our allowance for
loans losses in the future as the balance of these types of loans increase in our portfolio. 

Effective
January 1, 2023, we will adopt the CECL standard for determining the amount of our allowance for credit losses, which could increase
our allowance for loan and lease losses upon adoption and cause our historic allowance for loan and lease losses not to be indicative
of how we will maintain our allowance for credit losses beginning January 1, 2023.

General .
 Our investment policy is established by the Board of Directors. The objectives of the policy are to: (i) ensure adequate liquidity
for loan demand and deposit fluctuations, and to allow us to alter our liquidity position to meet both day-to-day and long-term changes
in assets and liabilities; (ii) manage interest rate risk in accordance with our interest rate risk policy; (iii) provide collateral
for pledging requirements; (iv) maximize return on our investments; and (v) maintain a balance of high quality diversified investments
to minimize risk.

Our
investment committee, consisting of our Chief Executive Officer, our President and our Chief Financial Officer is responsible for implementing
our investment policy, including approval of investment strategies and monitoring investment performance. Our Chief Executive Officer,
our President and our Chief Financial Officer are each authorized to execute purchases or sales of securities of up to 2.0 million.
The Board of Directors regularly reviews our investment strategies and the market value of our investment portfolio. 

We
account for investment and mortgage-backed securities in accordance with Accounting Standards Codification Topic 320, Investments
- Debt and Equity Securities. Accounting Standards Codification 320 requires that investments be categorized as held-to maturity,
trading, or available for sale. Our decision to classify certain of our securities as available-for-sale is based on our need to meet
daily liquidity needs and to take advantage of profits that may occur from time to time. 

Federally chartered savings institutions have
authority to invest in various types of assets, including government-sponsored enterprise obligations, securities of various federal agencies,
residential and commercial mortgage-backed securities, certain certificates of deposit of insured financial institutions, overnight and
short-term loans to other banks, corporate debt instruments, debt instruments of municipalities and Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac equity
securities. At December 31, 2022, our investment portfolio consisted of securities, mortgage-backed securities issued by U.S. Government
agencies or U.S. Government-sponsored enterprises, commercial mortgage-backed securities not issued by the U.S. Government agencies and
state and political subdivisions as well as insured bank certificates of deposit. Additionally, as a member of the FHLB, we are required
to purchase stock in the FHLB and at December 31, 2022, we owned 54,100 in FHLB stock.

Sources
of Funds 

General.
 Deposits, scheduled amortization and prepayments of loan principal, maturities and calls of securities and funds provided by
operations are our primary sources of funds for use in lending, investing and for other general purposes. We can also borrow from the
FHLB to fund our operations and we had no borrowings at December 31, 2022. 

Deposits.
 We offer deposit products having a range of interest rates and terms. We currently offer statement savings accounts, NOW accounts,
noninterest-bearing demand accounts, money market accounts and certificates of deposit. Our strategic plan includes a greater emphasis
on developing commercial business activities, both deposit and lending customer relationships. 

Deposit
flows are significantly influenced by general and local economic conditions, changes in prevailing interest rates, internal pricing decisions
and competition. Our deposits are primarily obtained from areas surrounding our branch office. In order to attract and retain deposits
we rely on paying competitive interest rates and providing quality service. 

Based
on our experience, we believe that our deposits are relatively stable. However, the ability to attract and maintain deposits and the
rates paid on these deposits, has been and will continue to be significantly affected by market conditions. At December 31, 2022, 20.7
million, or 27.7 of our total deposit accounts were certificates of deposit, of which 15.7 million had maturities of one year or less.

REGULATION
AND SUPERVISION 

General 

As a federal savings association, Sunnyside
Federal is subject to examination and regulation by the OCC , and is also subject to examination by the Federal Deposit Insurance
Corporation FDIC ). The federal system of regulation and supervision establishes a comprehensive framework of activities
in which Sunnyside Federal may engage and is intended primarily for the protection of depositors and the FDIC s Deposit Insurance
Fund. 

Sunnyside Federal also is regulated to a lesser
extent by the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System(the Federal Reserve Board ), which governs the reserves to
be maintained against deposits and other matters. In addition, Sunnyside Federal is a member of and owns stock in the Federal Home Loan
Bank of New York, which is one of the twelve regional banks in the Federal Home Loan Bank System. Sunnyside Federal s relationship
with its depositors and borrowers also is regulated to a great extent by federal law and, to a lesser extent, state law, including in
matters concerning the ownership of deposit accounts and the form and content of Sunnyside Federal s loan documents. 

As a savings and loan holding company, Vecta
Inc. is subject to examination and supervision by, and is required to file certain reports with, the Federal Reserve Board. Vecta Inc.
is also subject to the rules and regulations of the SEC under the federal securities laws. 

Set forth below are certain material regulatory requirements that are applicable
to Sunnyside Federal and Vecta Inc. This description of statutes and regulations is not intended to be a complete description of such
statutes and regulations and their effects on Sunnyside Federal and Vecta Inc. Any change in these laws or regulations, whether by Congress
or the applicable regulatory agencies, could have a material adverse impact on Vecta Inc., Sunnyside Federal and their operations. 

Federal
Banking Regulation 

Business
Activities. A federal savings association derives its lending and investment powers from the Home Owners Loan Act, as
amended, and applicable federal regulations. Under these laws and regulations, Sunnyside Federal may invest in mortgage loans secured
by residential and commercial real estate, commercial business and consumer loans, certain types of debt securities and certain other
assets, subject to applicable limits. Sunnyside Federal may also establish subsidiaries that may engage in certain activities not otherwise
permissible for Sunnyside Federal, including real estate investment and securities and insurance brokerage. 

Capital
Requirements. Federal regulations require FDIC-insured depository institutions, including federal savings associations, to meet
several minimum capital standards: a common equity Tier 1 capital to risk-based assets ratio of 4.5 , a Tier 1 capital to risk-based
assets ratio of 6.0 , a total capital to risk-based assets of 8.0 , and a 4.0 Tier 1 capital to adjusted average total assets leverage
ratio. These capital requirements were effective January 1, 2015 and are the result of a final rule implementing regulatory amendments
based on recommendations of the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision and certain requirements of the Dodd-Frank Act. 

Common
equity Tier 1 capital is generally defined as common stockholders equity and retained earnings. Tier 1 capital is generally defined
as common equity Tier 1 and Additional Tier 1 capital. Additional Tier 1 capital generally includes certain noncumulative perpetual preferred
stock and related surplus and minority interests in equity accounts of consolidated subsidiaries. Total capital includes Tier 1 capital
(common equity Tier 1 capital plus Additional Tier 1 capital) and Tier 2 capital. Tier 2 capital is comprised of capital instruments
and related surplus meeting specified requirements, and may include cumulative preferred stock and long-term perpetual preferred stock,
mandatory convertible securities, intermediate preferred stock and subordinated debt. Also included in Tier 2 capital is the allowance
for loan and lease losses limited to a maximum of 1.25 of risk-weighted assets and, for institutions that have exercised an opt-out
election regarding the treatment of Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income AOCI ), up to 45 of net unrealized gains on
available-for-sale equity securities with readily determinable fair market values. Institutions that have not exercised the AOCI opt-out
have AOCI incorporated into common equity Tier 1 capital (including unrealized gains and losses on available-for-sale-securities). Sunnyside
Federal has exercised the opt-out and therefore does not include AOCI in its regulatory capital determinations. Calculation of all types
of regulatory capital is subject to deductions and adjustments specified in the regulations. 

25 

In
determining the amount of risk-weighted assets for purposes of calculating risk-based capital ratios, an institution s assets,
including certain off-balance sheet assets (e.g., recourse obligations, direct credit substitutes, residual interests), are multiplied
by a risk weight factor assigned by the regulations based on the risk deemed inherent in the type of asset. Higher levels of capital
are required for asset categories believed to present greater risk. For example, a risk weight of 0 is assigned to cash and U.S. government
securities, a risk weight of 50 is generally assigned to prudently underwritten first lien one to four-family residential mortgages,
a risk weight of 100 is assigned to commercial and consumer loans, a risk weight of 150 is assigned to certain past due loans and a
risk weight of between 0 to 600 is assigned to permissible equity interests, depending on certain specified factors. 

In
addition to establishing the minimum regulatory capital requirements, the regulations limit capital distributions and certain discretionary
bonus payments to management if the institution does not hold a capital conservation buffer consisting of 2.5 of common
equity Tier 1 capital to risk-weighted assets above the amount necessary to meet its minimum risk-based capital requirements. The capital
conservation buffer requirement was phased in beginning January 1, 2016 at 0.625 of risk-weighted assets and increased each year until
it was fully implemented at 2.5 on January 1, 2019. 

Federal
law required the federal banking agencies, including the OCC, to establish a community bank leverage ratio of between 8 
and 10 for institutions with total consolidated assets of less than 10 billion. Institutions with capital complying with the ratio
and otherwise meeting the specified requirements and electing the alternative framework are considered to comply with the applicable
regulatory capital requirements, including the risk-based requirements. The community bank leverage ratio was established at 9 Tier
1 capital to total average assets, effective January 1, 2020. A qualifying institution may opt in and out of the community bank leverage
ratio framework on its quarterly call report. An institution that temporarily ceases to meet any qualifying criteria is provided with
a two-quarter grace period to regain compliance. Failure to meet the qualifying criteria within the grace period or maintain a leverage
ratio of 8 or greater requires the institution to comply with the generally applicable regulatory capital requirements. 

At
December 31, 2022, Sunnyside Federal s capital exceeded all applicable requirements. 

Prompt
Corrective Action . Under the federal Prompt Corrective Action statute, the OCC is required to take supervisory actions against
undercapitalized institutions under its jurisdiction, the severity of which depends upon the institution s level of capital. An
institution that has a total risk-based capital ratio of less than 8.0 , a Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio of less than 6.0 , a common
equity Tier 1 ratio of less than 4.5 or a leverage ratio of less than 4 is considered to be undercapitalized. A savings
institution that has total risk-based capital of less than 6.0 , a Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio of less than 4.0 , a common equity
Tier 1 ratio of less than 3.0 or a leverage ratio that is less than 3.0 is considered to be significantly undercapitalized. 
A savings institution that has a tangible capital to assets ratio equal to or less than 2.0 is deemed to be critically undercapitalized. 

Generally,
the OCC is required to appoint a receiver or conservator for a federal savings association that becomes critically undercapitalized 
within specific time frames. The regulations also provide that a capital restoration plan must be filed with the OCC within 45 days of
the date that a federal savings association is deemed to have received notice that it is undercapitalized, significantly
undercapitalized or critically undercapitalized. Any holding company of a federal savings association that is required
to submit a capital restoration plan must guarantee performance under the plan in an amount of up to the lesser of 5.0 of the savings
association s assets at the time it was deemed to be undercapitalized by the OCC or the amount necessary to restore the savings
association to adequately capitalized status. This guarantee remains in place until the OCC notifies the savings association that it
has maintained adequately capitalized status for each of four consecutive calendar quarters. Institutions that are undercapitalized become
subject to certain mandatory measures such as restrictions on capital distributions and asset growth. The OCC may also take any one of
a number of discretionary supervisory actions against undercapitalized federal savings associations, including the issuance of a capital
directive and the replacement of senior executive officers and directors. 

26 

At
December 31, 2022, Sunnyside Federal met the criteria for being considered well capitalized, which means that its total
risk-based capital ratio exceeded 10 , its Tier 1 risk-based ratio exceeded 8.0 , its common equity Tier 1 ratio exceeded 6.5 and its
leverage ratio exceeded 5.0 . 

Loans-to-One
Borrower. Generally, a federal savings association may not make a loan or extend credit to a single or related group of borrowers
in excess of 15 of unimpaired capital and surplus. An additional amount may be loaned, equal to 10 of unimpaired capital and surplus,
if the loan is secured by readily marketable collateral, which generally does not include real estate. As of December 31, 2022, Sunnyside
Federal was in compliance with the loans-to-one borrower limitations. 

Qualified
Thrift Lender Test. As a federal savings association, Sunnyside Federal must satisfy the qualified thrift lender, or QTL, 
test. Under the QTL test, Sunnyside Federal must maintain at least 65 of its portfolio assets in qualified thrift
investments (primarily residential mortgages and related investments, including mortgage-backed securities) in at least nine months
of the most recent 12-month period. Portfolio assets generally means total assets of a savings association, less the sum
of specified liquid assets up to 20 of total assets, goodwill and other intangible assets, and the value of property used in the conduct
of the savings association s business. 

Sunnyside
Federal also may satisfy the QTL test by qualifying as a domestic building and loan association as defined in the Internal
Revenue Code of 1986, as amended. 

A
savings association that fails the qualified thrift lender test must operate under specified restrictions set forth in the Home Owners 
Loan Act. The Dodd-Frank Act made noncompliance with the QTL test subject to agency enforcement action for a violation of law. At December
31, 2022, Sunnyside Federal satisfied the QTL test. 

Capital
Distributions. Federal regulations govern capital distributions by a federal savings association, which include cash dividends,
stock repurchases and other transactions charged to the savings association s capital account. A federal savings association must
file an application for approval of a capital distribution if: 

the
 total capital distributions for the applicable calendar year exceed the sum of the savings association s net income for that
 year to date plus the savings association s retained net income for the preceding two years; 

the
 savings association would not be at least adequately capitalized following the distribution; 

the
 distribution would violate any applicable statute, regulation, agreement or regulatory condition; or 

the
 savings association is not eligible for expedited treatment of its filings. 

Even
if an application is not otherwise required, every savings association that is a subsidiary of a savings and loan holding company, such
as Sunnyside Federal, must still file a notice with the Federal Reserve Board at least 30 days before the board of directors declares
a dividend or approves a capital distribution. 

A
notice or application related to a capital distribution may be disapproved if: 

the
 federal savings association would be undercapitalized following the distribution; 

the
 proposed capital distribution raises safety and soundness concerns; or 

the
 capital distribution would violate a prohibition contained in any statute, regulation or agreement. 

27 

In
addition, the Federal Deposit Insurance Act provides that an insured depository institution shall not make any capital distribution if,
after making such distribution, the institution would fail to meet any applicable regulatory capital requirement. A federal savings association
also may not make a capital distribution that would reduce its regulatory capital below the amount required for the liquidation account
established in connection with its conversion to stock form. 

Community
Reinvestment Act and Fair Lending Laws. All federal savings associations have a responsibility under the Community Reinvestment
Act and related regulations to help meet the credit needs of their communities, including low- and moderate-income borrowers. In connection
with its examination of a federal savings association, the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency is required to assess the federal
savings association s record of compliance with the Community Reinvestment Act. A savings association s failure to comply
with the provisions of the Community Reinvestment Act could, at a minimum, result in denial of certain corporate applications such as
branches or mergers, or in restrictions on its activities. In addition, the Equal Credit Opportunity Act and the Fair Housing Act prohibit
lenders from discriminating in their lending practices on the basis of characteristics specified in those statutes. The failure to comply
with the Equal Credit Opportunity Act and the Fair Housing Act could result in enforcement actions by the Office of the Comptroller of
the Currency, as well as other federal regulatory agencies and the Department of Justice. 

In
June 2020, the OCC issued a final rule clarifying and expanding the activities that qualify for Community Reinvestment Act credit and,
according to the agency, seeking to create a more consistent and objective method for evaluating Community Reinvestment Act performance.
The final rule was effective October 1, 2020, but compliance with certain of the revised requirements is not mandatory until January
1, 2024 for institutions of Sunnyside Federal s asset size. 

The
Community Reinvestment Act requires all institutions insured by the FDIC to publicly disclose their rating. Sunnyside Federal received
a satisfactory Community Reinvestment Act rating in its most recent federal examination. 

Transactions
with Related Parties. A federal savings association s authority to engage in transactions with its affiliates is limited
by Sections 23A and 23B of the Federal Reserve Act and federal regulation. An affiliate is generally a company that controls, or is under
common control with an insured depository institution such as Sunnyside Federal. Vecta Inc. is an affiliate of Sunnyside Federal because
of its control of Sunnyside Federal. In general, transactions between an insured depository institution and its affiliates are subject
to certain quantitative limits and collateral requirements. In addition, federal regulations prohibit a savings association from lending
to any of its affiliates that are engaged in activities that are not permissible for bank holding companies and from purchasing the securities
of any affiliate, other than a subsidiary. Finally, transactions with affiliates must be consistent with safe and sound banking practices,
not involve the purchase of low-quality assets and be on terms that are as favorable to the institution as comparable transactions with
non-affiliates. Federal regulations require savings associations to maintain detailed records of all transactions with affiliates. 

Sunnyside
Federal s authority to extend credit to its directors, executive officers and 10 stockholders, as well as to entities controlled
by such persons, is currently governed by the requirements of Sections 22(g) and 22(h) of the Federal Reserve Act and Regulation O of
the Federal Reserve Board. Among other things, these provisions generally require that extensions of credit to insiders: 

be
 made on terms that are substantially the same as, and follow credit underwriting procedures that are not less stringent than, those
 prevailing for comparable transactions with unaffiliated persons and that do not involve more than the normal risk of repayment or
 present other unfavorable features; and 

not
 exceed certain limitations on the amount of credit extended to such persons, individually and in the aggregate, which limits are
 based, in part, on the amount of Sunnyside Federal s capital. 

28 

In
addition, extensions of credit in excess of certain limits must be approved by Sunnyside Federal s board of directors. Extensions
of credit to executive officers are subject to additional limits based on the type of extension involved. 

Enforcement.
 The OCC has primary enforcement responsibility over federal savings associations and has authority to bring enforcement action
against all institution-affiliated parties, including directors, officers, stockholders, attorneys, appraisers and accountants
who knowingly or recklessly participate in wrongful action likely to have an adverse effect on a federal savings association. Formal
enforcement action by the OCC may range from the issuance of a capital directive or cease and desist order to removal of officers and/or
directors of the institution and the appointment of a receiver or conservator. Civil penalties cover a wide range of violations and actions,
and range up to 25,000 per day, unless a finding of reckless disregard is made, in which case penalties may be as high as 1 million
per day. The FDIC also has the authority to terminate deposit insurance or recommend to the OCC that enforcement action be taken with
respect to a particular savings association. If such action is not taken, the FDIC has authority to take the action under specified circumstances. 

Standards
for Safety and Soundness. Federal law requires each federal banking agency to prescribe certain standards for all insured depository
institutions. These standards relate to, among other things, internal controls, information systems and audit systems, loan documentation,
credit underwriting, interest rate risk exposure, asset growth, compensation and other operational and managerial standards as the agency
deems appropriate. Interagency guidelines set forth the safety and soundness standards that the federal banking agencies use to identify
and address problems at insured depository institutions before capital becomes impaired. If the appropriate federal banking agency determines
that an institution fails to meet any standard prescribed by the guidelines, the agency may require the institution to submit to the
agency an acceptable plan to achieve compliance with the standard. If an institution fails to meet these standards, the appropriate federal
banking agency may require the institution to implement an acceptable compliance plan. Failure to implement such a plan can result in
further enforcement action, including the issuance of a cease and desist order or the imposition of civil money penalties. 

Insurance
of Deposit Accounts. Sunnyside Federal is a member of the Deposit Insurance Fund, which is administered by the FDIC. Deposit
accounts in Sunnyside Federal are insured up to a maximum of 250,000 for each separately insured depositor. 

Under
the FDIC s risk-based assessment system, institutions deemed less risky of failure pay lower assessments. Assessments for institutions
of less than 10 billion of assets are based on financial measures and supervisory ratings derived from statistical modeling estimating
the probability of an institution s failure within three years. 

The
FDIC has authority to increase insurance assessments. A significant increase in insurance premiums would likely have an adverse effect
on the operating expenses and results of operations of Sunnyside Federal. Future insurance assessment rates cannot be predicted. 

Insurance
of deposits may be terminated by the FDIC upon a finding that the institution has engaged in unsafe or unsound practices, is in an unsafe
or unsound condition to continue operations or has violated any applicable law, regulation, rule order or regulatory condition imposed
in writing. We do not know of any practice, condition or violation that might lead to termination of deposit insurance. 

29 

Other
Regulations 

Interest
and other charges collected or contracted for by Sunnyside Federal are subject to state usury laws and federal laws concerning interest
rates. Sunnyside Federal s operations are also subject to federal laws applicable to credit transactions, such as the: 

Truth-In-Lending
 Act, governing disclosures of credit terms to consumer borrowers; 

Home
 Mortgage Disclosure Act, requiring financial institutions to provide information to enable the public and public officials to determine
 whether a financial institution is fulfilling its obligation to help meet the housing needs of the community it serves; 

Equal
 Credit Opportunity Act, prohibiting discrimination on the basis of race, creed or other prohibited factors in extending credit; 

Fair
 Credit Reporting Act, governing the use and provision of information to credit reporting agencies; 

Fair
 Debt Collection Act, governing the manner in which consumer debts may be collected by collection agencies; 

Truth
 in Savings Act; and 

rules
 and regulations of the various federal agencies charged with the responsibility of implementing such federal laws. 

The operations of Sunnyside Federal also are subject to the: 

Right
 to Financial Privacy Act, which imposes a duty to maintain confidentiality of consumer financial records and prescribes procedures
 for complying with administrative subpoenas of financial records; 

Electronic
 Funds Transfer Act and Regulation E promulgated thereunder, which govern automatic deposits to and withdrawals from deposit accounts
 and customers rights and liabilities arising from the use of automated teller machines and other electronic banking services; 

Check
 Clearing for the 21st Century Act (also known as Check 21 ), which gives substitute checks, such as digital
 check images and copies made from that image, the same legal standing as the original paper check; 

The
 USA PATRIOT Act, which requires savings associations to, among other things, establish broadened anti-money laundering compliance
 programs, and due diligence policies and controls to ensure the detection and reporting of money laundering. Such required compliance
 programs are intended to supplement existing compliance requirements that also apply to financial institutions under the Bank Secrecy
 Act and the Office of Foreign Assets Control regulations; and 

The
 Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act, which places limitations on the sharing of consumer financial information by financial institutions with
 unaffiliated third parties. Specifically, the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act requires all financial institutions offering financial products
 or services to retail customers to provide such customers with the financial institution s privacy policy and provide such
 customers the opportunity to opt out of the sharing of certain personal financial information with unaffiliated third
 parties. 

30 

Prohibitions
Against Tying Arrangements . Federal savings associations are prohibited, subject to some exceptions, from extending credit to
or offering any other service, or fixing or varying the consideration for such extension of credit or service, on the condition that
the customer obtain some additional service from the institution or its affiliates or not obtain services of a competitor of the institution. 

Federal
Home Loan Bank System. Sunnyside Federal is a member of the Federal Home Loan Bank System, which consists of 12 regional Federal
Home Loan Banks. The Federal Home Loan Bank System provides a central credit facility primarily for member institutions as well as other
entities involved in home mortgage lending. As a member of the Federal Home Loan Bank of New York, Sunnyside Federal is required to acquire
and hold shares of capital stock in the Federal Home Loan Bank. As of December 31, 2022, Sunnyside Federal was in compliance with this
requirement. 

Qualified
Mortgages and Retention of Credit Risk. The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau has issued a rule designed to clarify for lenders
how they can avoid legal liability under the Dodd-Frank Act, which would hold lenders accountable for ensuring a borrower s ability
to repay a mortgage. Loans that meet this qualified mortgage definition will be presumed to have complied with the new
ability-to-repay standard. Under the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau s rule, a qualified mortgage loan must
not contain certain specified features, including: 

excessive
 upfront points and fees (those exceeding 3 of the total loan amount, less bona fide discount points for prime loans); 

interest-only
 payments; 

negative-amortization;
 and 

terms
 longer than 30 years. 

Also,
to qualify as a qualified mortgage, a borrower s total monthly debt-to-income ratio may not exceed 43 . Lenders must
also verify and document the income and financial resources relied upon to qualify the borrower for the loan and underwrite the loan
based on a fully amortizing payment schedule and maximum interest rate during the first five years, taking into account all applicable
taxes, insurance and assessments. The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau s rule on qualified mortgages could limit our ability
or desire to make certain types of loans or loans to certain borrowers, or could make it more expensive/and or time consuming to make
these loans, which could limit our growth or profitability. 

In
addition, the Dodd-Frank Act requires the regulatory agencies to issue regulations that require securitizers of loans to retain not less
than 5 of the credit risk for any asset that is not a qualified residential mortgage. The regulatory agencies have issued
a proposed rule to implement this requirement. The Dodd-Frank Act provides that the definition of qualified residential mortgage 
can be no broader than the definition of qualified mortgage issued by the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau for purposes
of its regulations (as described above). Although the final rule with respect to the retention of credit risk has not yet been issued,
the final rule could have a significant effect on the secondary market for loans and the types of loans we originate, and restrict our
ability to make loans. 

Holding
Company Regulation 

General .
 Vecta Inc. is a non-diversified savings and loan holding company within the meaning of the Home Owners Loan Act. As such,
Vecta Inc. is registered with the Federal Reserve Board and is subject to regulations, examinations, supervision and reporting requirements
applicable to savings and loan holding companies. In addition, the Federal Reserve Board has enforcement authority over Vecta Inc. and
its non-savings institution subsidiaries. Among other things, this authority permits the Federal Reserve Board to restrict or prohibit
activities that are determined to be a serious risk to the subsidiary savings institution. 

31 

Permissible
Activities. The business activities of Vecta Inc. are generally limited to those activities permissible for financial holding
companies under Section 4(k) of the Bank Holding Company Act of 1956, as amended, provided certain conditions are met, or for multiple
savings and loan holding companies. A financial holding company may engage in activities that are financial in nature, including underwriting
equity securities and insurance as well as activities that are incidental to financial activities or complementary to a financial activity.
A multiple savings and loan holding company is generally limited to activities permissible for bank holding companies under Section 4(c)(8)
of the Bank Holding Company Act, subject to regulatory approval, and certain additional activities authorized by federal regulations. 

Federal
law prohibits a savings and loan holding company, including Vecta Inc., directly or indirectly, or through one or more subsidiaries,
from acquiring more than 5 of another savings institution or holding company thereof, without prior regulatory approval. It also prohibits
the acquisition or retention of, with certain exceptions, more than 5 of a non-subsidiary company engaged in activities that are not
closely related to banking or financial in nature, or acquiring or retaining control of an institution that is not federally insured.
In evaluating applications by holding companies to acquire savings institutions, the Federal Reserve Board must consider the financial
and managerial resources, future prospects of the company and institution involved, the effect of the acquisition on the risk to the
federal deposit insurance fund, the convenience and needs of the community and competitive factors. 

The
Federal Reserve Board is prohibited from approving any acquisition that would result in a multiple savings and loan holding company controlling
savings institutions in more than one state, subject to two exceptions: 

the
 approval of interstate supervisory acquisitions by savings and loan holding companies; and 

the
 acquisition of a savings institution in another state if the laws of the state of the target savings institution specifically permit
 such acquisition. 

The
states vary in the extent to which they permit interstate savings and loan holding company acquisitions. 

Capital.
 Savings and loan holding companies of under 3 billion in consolidated assets remain exempt from consolidated regulatory capital
requirements, unless the Federal Reserve determines otherwise in particular cases. 

Source
of Strength. The Dodd-Frank Act extended the source of strength doctrine to savings and loan holding companies.
The regulatory agencies must issue regulations requiring that all Association and savings and loan holding companies serve as a source
of strength to their subsidiary depository institutions by providing capital, liquidity and other support in times of financial stress. 

Dividends.
 Sunnyside Federal is required to notify the Federal Reserve Board thirty days before declaring any dividend to Vecta Inc. The
financial impact of a holding company on its subsidiary institution is a matter that is evaluated by the regulator and the agency has
authority to order cessation of activities or divestiture of subsidiaries deemed to pose a threat to the safety and soundness of the
institution. 

32 

Acquisition.
 Under the Change in Bank Control Act, no person may acquire control of a savings and loan holding company, such as Vecta Inc.,
unless the Federal Reserve Board has been given 60 days prior written notice and has not issued a notice disapproving the proposed
acquisition, taking into consideration certain factors, including the financial and managerial resources of the acquirer and the competitive
effects of the acquisition. Control, as defined under federal law, means ownership, control of or holding irrevocable proxies representing
more than 25 of any class of voting stock, control in any manner of the election of a majority of the institution s directors,
or a determination by the regulator that the acquirer has the power, directly or indirectly, to exercise a controlling influence over
the management or policies of the institution. There is a presumption of control upon the acquisition of 10 or more of a class of voting
stock under certain circumstances, such as where the holding company involved has its shares registered under the Securities Exchange
Act of 1934, as amended (the Exchange Act ). 

Federal
Securities Laws 

Vecta Inc. s common stock is registered with
the SEC under the Exchange Act. Vecta Inc. is subject to the information, proxy solicitation, insider trading restrictions and other requirements
under the Exchange Act. 

TAXATION 

Federal
Taxation 

General.
 Vecta Inc. and Sunnyside Federal are subject to federal income taxation in the same general manner as other corporations, with
some exceptions discussed below. The following discussion of federal taxation is intended only to summarize material federal income tax
matters and is not a comprehensive description of the tax rules applicable to Vecta Inc. and Sunnyside Federal. 

Method
of Accounting. For federal income tax purposes, Sunnyside Federal currently reports its income and expenses on the accrual method
of accounting and uses a tax year ending December 31 st for filing its federal income tax returns. The Small Business Protection
Act of 1996 eliminated the use of the reserve method of accounting for bad debt reserves by large savings institutions, effective for
taxable years beginning after 1995. Since Sunnyside Federal is not a large savings institution, the reserve method is still used. 

Minimum
Tax. The Internal Revenue Code imposes an alternative minimum tax at a rate of 20 on a base of regular taxable income plus certain
tax preferences, less an exemption amount, referred to as alternative minimum taxable income. The alternative minimum tax
is payable to the extent tax computed this way exceeds tax computed by applying the regular tax rates to regular taxable income. Net
operating losses can, in general, offset no more than 90 of alternative minimum taxable income. Certain payments of alternative minimum
tax may be used as credits against regular tax liabilities in future years. The Tax Cuts and Jobs Act repealed the alternative minimum
tax for income generated after January 1, 2018. At December 31, 2022, we had no minimum tax credit carryforward. 

Net
Operating Loss Carryovers. Prior to 2020, a corporation could carry forward net operating losses NOLs generated
in tax years beginning after December 31, 2017 indefinitely and could offset up to 80 of taxable income. NOLs generated in
taxable years beginning before 2018 could be carried forward 20 years . The New York NOL
carryforward period is 20 years. At December 31, 2022, Sunnyside Federal had 5.1 million of federal NOL carry-forwards and 7.4
million of New York State NOL carry-forwards available for future use. As a result of the merger as discussed in Note 1 to the
financial statements usage of the federal NOL and 6,000,000 of the New York State NOL is limited in accordance with Internal
Revenue Code Section 382 to 379,000 annually on a cumulative basis. (Portions of the 379,000 not used in a particular tax year may
be added to subsequent usage.) 

The Company recorded a valuation allowance on its entire federal deferred
tax asset as of December 31, 2022. The amount of the impact on our future tax expense will be affected by any changes in our operations,
structure, or profitability. 

33 

Capital
Loss Carryovers. Generally, a financial institution may carry back capital losses to the preceding three taxable years and forward
to the succeeding five taxable years. Any capital loss carryback or carryover is treated as a short-term capital loss for the year to
which it is carried. As such, it is grouped with any other capital losses for the year to which carried and is used to offset any capital
gains. Any non-deducted loss remaining after the five year carryover period is not deductible. 

Corporate
Dividends. We may generally exclude from our income 100 of dividends received from Sunnyside Federal as a member of the same
affiliated group of corporations. 

Audit
of Tax Returns. Sunnyside Federal s federal income tax returns have been audited for the years ended December 31, 2011
and 2012. Audit results concluded that no changes were proposed to the filed returns for each of the two years noted. 

New
York State Taxation 

Vecta Inc. and Sunnyside Federal report their combined
income on a calendar year basis to New York State. New York State franchise tax on corporations with income under 5.0 million is imposed
in an amount equal to the greater of: (i) 6.50 of entire net income allocable to New York State; (ii) 0.1875 of the capital
base; or (iii) nominal minimum tax. Entire net income is based on federal taxable income, subject to certain modifications. 

In
addition, the companies are subject to a Metropolitan Transportation Business Tax surcharge equal to 30.0 of New York franchise tax,
as calculated with certain adjustments. 

In
March 2014, tax legislation was enacted that changed the manner in which financial institutions and their affiliates are taxed in New
York State. The most significant changes affecting the Company is that thrift
 institutions that maintain a qualified residential loan portfolio are entitled to a specially computed modification that reduces
 the income taxable to New York State. 

The Company
recorded a valuation allowance on its entire New York deferred tax asset as of December 31, 2022. The amount of
the impact on our future tax expense will be affected by any changes in our operations, structure, or profitability. 

Sunnyside
Federal s state income tax returns have not been audited in the most recent five-year period.

Vecta
Inc. does not currently pay cash dividends on its common stock. Dividend payments by Vecta Inc. are dependent, in part, on dividends it
receives from Sunnyside Federal, because Vecta Inc. has no source of income other than dividends from Sunnyside Federal and interest payments
with respect to our loan to the Employee Stock Ownership Plan. 

The Federal Reserve Board has
issued supervisory policies providing that dividends should be paid only out of current earnings and only if our prospective rate of earnings
retention is consistent with our capital needs, asset quality and overall financial condition. Federal Reserve Board guidance also provides
for prior regulatory consultation with respect to capital distributions in certain circumstances such as where the holding company s
net income for the past four quarters, net of dividends previously paid over that period, is insufficient to fully fund the dividend or
the holding company s overall rate or earnings retention is inconsistent with its capital needs and overall financial condition.
In addition, Sunnyside Federal s ability to pay dividends will be limited if it does not have the capital conservation buffer required
by the new capital rules, which may limit our ability to pay dividends to stockholders. No assurances can be given that any dividends
will be paid or that, if paid, will not be reduced or eliminated in the future. Special cash dividends, stock dividends or returns of
capital, to the extent permitted by regulations and policies of the Federal Reserve Board and the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency,
may be paid in addition to, or in lieu of, regular cash dividends.

This section should be read in conjunction with
the consolidated financial statements and notes to the consolidated financial statements that appear in Item 8 of this Annual Report. 

Overview 

Vecta Inc. Acquisition
by Vecta Partners 

Vecta Inc. was incorporated in the
State of Maryland in March 2013 for the purpose of becoming the savings and loan holding company for Sunnyside Federal Savings and Loan
Association of Irvington, a federally-chartered savings and loan association and the wholly-owned subsidiary of Vecta Inc. Sunnyside
Federal or the Bank ), upon consummation of Sunnyside Federal s mutual to stock conversion. The conversion was
consummated in July 2013 at which time Sunnyside Bancorp became the registered savings and loan holding company of the Bank. Prior to
the Closing Date (as referenced below) of the Merger (as referenced below), other than holding all of the issued and outstanding stock
of Sunnyside Federal and making a loan to the Sunnyside Federal s employee stock ownership plan, Vecta Inc. has not engaged in any
material business. 

As further disclosed in Note 2 (Business
Combination) to the consolidated financial statements in Item 8 to this Annual Report, on June 1, 2022 (the Closing Date ),
Vecta Partners LLC (formerly known as Rhodium BA Holdings LLC), a Delaware limited liability company Vecta Partners ), completed
its acquisition of Vecta Inc., pursuant to the Agreement and Plan of Merger, dated as of June 16, 2021, as amended on August 26, 2021
(the Merger Agreement ), by and among Vecta Partners, Rhodium BA Merger Sub, Inc., a Maryland corporation Merger
Sub ), Mark Silber, Vecta Inc. and Sunnyside Federal. Pursuant to the Merger Agreement and subject to the terms and conditions thereof,
on the Closing Date, Merger Sub merged with and into Vecta Inc. (the Merger ), with Vecta Inc continuing as the surviving
corporation and a wholly-owned subsidiary of Vecta Partners. 

37 

Under
the terms of the Merger Agreement, Vecta Partners acquired all of the outstanding common stock of Vecta Inc. at a price of 20.25 per
share in cash. The aggregate value of the merger consideration was approximately 15.3 million. Vecta Partners incurred approximately
 6.1 million in merger related acquisition costs. 

The
Merger was accounted for under the acquisition method of accounting and accordingly the results of Vecta Inc. s operations have
been included in Vecta Inc. s December 31, 2022 consolidated financial statements from the date of acquisition, or June 1, 2022. 

On
June 1, 2022, the Board of Directors of Vecta Inc. authorized and approved a 15-for-1 stock dividend to the existing shareholders of
Vecta Inc. The 15-for-1 stock dividend was consummated on July 18, 2022. 

On
June 29, 2022, Vecta Partners made an additional capital contribution of 4.5 million to Vecta Inc. in exchange for 222,222 shares of
Vecta Inc. s common stock. 

Vecta
Inc. has been informed by Vecta Partners, that Vecta Partners intends to divest some of his ownership in Vecta Inc. through private sales,
however, Vecta Partners intends to maintain majority ownership of Vecta Inc. 

On July 18, 2022, Vecta Inc. also increased its authorized shares of common
stock to 100,000,000 par value 0.01, and increased its authorized shares of preferred stock to 2,000,000 par value 0.01. As of December
31, 2022, Vecta Inc. had 15,930,976 shares of common stock outstanding and no shares of preferred stock outstanding. 

On
July 18, 2022, Vecta Inc. amended its Articles of Incorporation to change its name from Sunnyside Bancorp, Inc. to Vecta
Inc. The name change was effected pursuant to the filing of Articles of Amendment to Vecta Inc. s Articles of Incorporation with
the Maryland State Department of Assessments and Taxation. 

Vecta
Inc. operates as the savings and loan holding company for its only present subsidiary Sunnyside Federal, which offers various banking
products and services and has no other present business operations. The Sunnyside Federal conducts business from its full-service banking
office located in Irvington, New York. Sunnyside Federal considers its deposit market area to be the areas of Westchester County, New
York towns of Irvington, Tarrytown, Sleepy Hollow, Hastings, Dobbs Ferry and Ardsley-on-Hudson, and considers its lending area to be
primarily Westchester, Putnam and Rockland counties, New York. 

Vecta
Inc. s proposed future goals are to increase the capital available to Sunnyside Federal, expand the current business lines offered
by Sunnyside Federal, and to analyze and address new business lines, products and services that management feels would be beneficial
to Vecta Inc. and Sunnyside Federal. 

As of the Closing Date of the Merger, Sunnyside Federal had approximately
ten employees, all of whom work from Sunnyside Federal s sole branch in Irvington, New York. Sunnyside Federal recently hired a
new lending team and expects to become a preferred small business lender with the SBA in the next twelve to eighteen months. Sunnyside
Federal now has eighteen full time equivalent employees.

Anticipated
Growth Plans and Strategies 

Provided
below is a brief overview of Vecta Inc. s anticipated growth plans and strategies. 

In
connection with Vecta Inc. s anticipated growth plans, which are discussed in more detail immediately below, Vecta Inc. will consider
strategic acquisition opportunities and, more specifically, will evaluate underperforming bank and non-bank organizations in key markets
with the intent to transform them into profitable and valuable components of Vecta Inc. s corporate group. 

Some
of Vecta Inc. s anticipated growth plans and strategies may require regulatory approval prior to Vecta Inc. or the Bank engaging
in such activities. As such, there is no guarantee that Vecta Inc. s intended growth plans and strategies will be successful in
obtaining regulatory approval or commercially successful. 

40 

Goals
and operational strategy for Vecta Inc. and the Bank: 

Consider
 acquisitions of financial organizations using clearly defined, specific acquisition parameters. 

Consider
 acquisitions of value-added Neo Bank Platforms as well as the internal development of similar technology. 

Develop
 significant non-interest revenues through origination and sale of government insured or guaranteed assets, including, residential
 mortgage and small business lending. 

Build
 a strong and integrated corporate culture that is guided by a clear mission and fully articulated with a reinforced value system. 

Embrace
 the highest standards of corporate governance and risk management to minimize loss and reduce execution risk. 

Build
 an integrated operations framework that maximizes efficiencies and enhances earnings. 

Focus
 on highly scalable business lines in which the new management has expertise, such as Multi-Family housing. 

Become
 a leader among community banks by providing outsourced services which they could not otherwise afford to implement on their own due
 to lack of capital, scale, or know-how. 

Provide
 diversified products and services that are uniquely designed to meet the needs of our communities and client base. 

Vecta
Inc. and the Bank intend to provide various services to other community banks, credit unions and specialty lenders for both mortgage
and small business lending. Some of these services may include the following: 

Back-office
 Loan Platform Services 

White-label
 loan origination services, including loan processing, documents, packaging, closing and post-closing services. 

Loans
 will typically be closed in the client s name, not requiring balance sheet capacity / liquidity or representing credit risk
 of or to the Bank. 

Vecta
 may receive revenue in the form of origination and processing fees and may share in the profits should its clients desire Vecta to
 assist with secondary market loan sales. 

Loan
 Syndication, Loan Participation and Asset-based Loan Program Administrator 

The
 Bank intends to originate, syndicate or participate in loans with other financial institutions that are too large to hold in its
 portfolio. 

Vecta
 may also function as a loan program administrator for other loan portfolio investors. 

Revenue
 will be captured in the form of gains from sales (or profits from sales of loans), servicing or excess servicing. 

Neo
 Bank Platform 

The
 Bank intends on using an API based core technology operating system to provide third party marketing platforms with the ability to
 originate and syndicate asset and liability component production into the banking system. 

The
 Bank intends to utilize multi-family bridge lending as an essential platform to drive profitability and achieve targeted goals. 

The
 Bank intends to leverage its lending experience by focusing on strong sponsor relationships that are well known to executive management
 and have the depth of experience from multiple economic cycles. 

Multi-Family
 Bridge Loan lending will support housing, localized services and investment within the communities the Bank serves. Lending will
 include individual facilities for Multi-Family and related projects (which will also fulfill the Bank s CRA requirements). 

The
 Bank intends to limit speculative risk in the Multi-Family bridge product by securing an agency takeout lender prior to origination. 

Multi-Family
 Lending Policies will be determined by the Bank s board and will include guidance to limit market, interest rate, and concentration
 risks. 

The
 Bank intends to establish and maintain Multi-Family portfolio standards for monitoring and reporting. 

Diversification
 of credit risk is an important and desirable attribute of the Bank s real estate portfolio. The Bank intends to seek portfolio
 diversification based on lending product, geographic region and collateral type. Certain risks may be mitigated by the short-term
 nature and guaranteed take-out refinancing of these loans by a HUD or a FNMA DUS lender. 

Typical
 loan terms are expected to be less than 18 months with a floating interest rate tied to the Prime Rate. 

Management
 intends to service all loans originated for its portfolio. The Bank anticipates utilizing best-in-class software and servicing platforms
 to administer and manage the portfolio. With demonstrated success, the Bank expects to offer loan servicing as a service to other
 small to medium sized banks looking to gain operational efficiencies.

Critical
Accounting Policies 

The discussion and analysis of the financial
condition and results of operations are based on our financial statements, which are prepared in conformity with generally accepted accounting
principles used in the United States of America U.S. GAAP ). The preparation of these financial statements requires management
to make estimates and assumptions affecting the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities,
and the reported amounts of income and expenses. We consider the accounting policies discussed below to be critical accounting policies.
The estimates and assumptions that we use are based on historical experience and various other factors and are believed to be reasonable
under the circumstances. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions, resulting in a change
that could have a material impact on the carrying value of our assets and liabilities and our results of operations. 

The
following represent our critical accounting policies: 

Allowance
for Loan Losses. The allowance for loan losses is the estimated amount considered necessary to cover inherent, but unconfirmed,
credit losses in the loan portfolio at the balance sheet date. The allowance is established through the provision for losses on loans
which is charged against income. In determining the allowance for loan losses, management makes significant estimates and has identified
this policy as one of our most critical accounting policies. 

Management
performs a quarterly evaluation of the allowance for loan losses. Consideration is given to a variety of factors in establishing this
estimate including, but not limited to, current economic conditions, delinquency statistics, geographic and industry concentrations,
the adequacy of the underlying collateral, the financial strength of the borrower, results of internal loan reviews and other relevant
factors. This evaluation is inherently subjective as it requires material estimates that may be susceptible to significant change. 

The analysis has two components, specific and
general allocations. Specific percentage allocations can be made for unconfirmed losses related to loans that are determined to be impaired.
Impairment is measured by determining the present value of expected future cash flows or, for collateral-dependent loans, the fair value
of the collateral adjusted for market conditions and selling expenses. If the fair value of the loan is less than the loan s carrying
value, a charge is recorded for the difference. The general allocation is determined by segregating the remaining loans by type of loan,
risk weighting (if applicable) and payment history. We also analyze historical loss experience, delinquency trends, general economic conditions
and geographic and industry concentrations. This analysis establishes factors that are applied to the loan groups to determine the amount
of the general reserve. Actual loan losses may be significantly more than the allowances we have established which could result in a material
negative effect on our financial results. Effective January 1, 2023, we will adopt the Current Expected Credit Losses CECL methodology standard for determining the amount of our allowance for credit losses, which could increase our allowance for loan and lease
losses upon adoption and cause our historic allowance for loan and lease losses not to be indicative of how we will maintain our allowance
for credit losses beginning January 1, 2023. 

Securities
Valuation and Impairment . We classify our investments in debt and equity securities as either held-to-maturity or available-for-sale.
Securities classified as held-to maturity are recorded at cost or amortized cost. Available-for-sale securities are carried at fair value.
We obtain our fair values from a third party service. This service s fair value calculations are based on quoted market prices
when such prices are available. If quoted market prices are not available, estimates of fair value are computed using a variety of techniques,
including extrapolation from the quoted prices of similar instruments or recent trades for thinly traded securities, fundamental analysis,
or through obtaining purchase quotes. Due to the subjective nature of the valuation process, it is possible that the actual fair values
of these investments could differ from the estimated amounts, thereby affecting our financial position, results of operations and cash
flows. If the estimated value of investments is less than the cost or amortized cost, we evaluate whether an event or change in circumstances
has occurred that may have a significant adverse effect on the fair value of the investment. If such an event or change has occurred
and we determine that the impairment is other-than-temporary, we expense the impairment of the investment in the period in which the
event or change occurred. We also consider how long a security has been in a loss position in determining if it is other than temporarily
impaired. Management also assesses the nature of the unrealized losses taking into consideration factors such as changes in risk-free
interest rates, general credit spread widening, market supply and demand, creditworthiness of the issuer, and quality of the underlying
collateral. At December 31, 2022, 72.2 of our securities were issued by U.S. government agencies or U.S. government-sponsored enterprises.

Comparison
of Financial Condition at December 31, 2022 and December 31, 2021 

Total
assets decreased 2.5 million, or 2.7 , to 91.9 million at December 31, 2022 from 94.4 million at December 31, 2021. The decrease
was primarily the result of a decrease in investment securities, loans, and deferred income taxes partly offset by increases in cash
and cash equivalents, premises and equipment, goodwill, and core deposit intangible. 

Securities
available for sale decreased 19.7 million, or 36.8 , to 33.7 million at December 31, 2022 from 53.4 million at December 31, 2021. The decrease
in securities available for sale was primarily due to maturities and pay-downs of government and mortgage-backed securities. 

Net loans receivable decreased 3.1 million,
or 9.7 , to 28.6 million at December 31, 2022 from 31.6 million at December 31, 2021. The decrease in loans receivable during 2022
was primarily due to a decrease of 2.4 million, or 100.0 in loans originated under the Paycheck Protection Program, a decrease of 1.5
million, or 13.1 , in residential one-to-four family loans and a 523,000, or 18.3 decrease in student loans partly offset by a 2.0
million, or 13.9 increase in commercial real estate and multi-family loans. 

Cash and cash equivalents increased 9.8 million,
or 282.9 to 13.3 million at December 31, 2022 compared to 3.5 million at December 31, 2021. 

Maturities and principal payments of securities
available for sale resulted in a decrease of 19.7 million. There were no purchases of securities in 2022 as the Company strategically
avoided purchasing securities in a rising interest rate environment. 

Premises and equipment increased 4.4 million,
or 460.3 as a result of the Merger. 

At
December 31, 2022, our investment in bank-owned life insurance was 2.6 million, an increase of 67,000 or 2.7 from 2.5 million at
December 31, 2021. We invest in bank-owned life insurance to provide us with a funding offset for our benefit plan obligations. Bank-owned
life insurance also generally provides us noninterest income that is non-taxable. Federal regulations generally limit our investment
in bank-owned life insurance to 25 of our Tier 1 capital plus our allowance for loan losses, and we have not made any additional contributions
to our bank-owned life insurance since 2002. 

Goodwill
and core deposit intangible increased 5.6 million and 1.3 million, respectively as a result of the merger. 

45 

Net
deferred tax assets decreased 923,000, or 100.0 , to 0.00 at December 31, 2022 from 923,000 at December 31, 2021. The
decrease resulted from the recording of a valuation allowance on the total deferred tax asset at the time of the merger. 

Total
deposits decreased 8.3 million, or 10.0 , to 74.6 million at December 31, 2022 from 82.9 million at December 31, 2021. The decrease
was primarily due to lower certificates of deposit and NOW balances partly offset by higher savings balances. Certificates of deposit
and NOW balances decreased 8.4 million, or 29.0 and 1.6 million, or 10.4 , respectively, while Savings deposits increased 2.5 million
or 9.1 . 

We
had no Federal Home Loan Bank advances outstanding at December 31, 2022 compared to 1.0 million at December 31, 2021. At December 31,
2022, we had the ability to borrow approximately 27.8 million from the Federal Home Loan Bank of New York, subject to our pledging sufficient
assets. Additionally, at December 31, 2022, we had the ability to borrow up to 2.0 million on a Fed Funds line of credit with Atlantic
Community Bankers Bank. 

Total
equity increased 6.7 million, or 69.9 , to 16.3 million at December 31, 2022 compared to 9.6 million at December 31, 2021 primarily
due to the merger as well as an additional 4.5 million capital contribution shortly after the merger was consummated.

of Operating Results for the Years Ended December 31, 2022 and 2021 

General. 

For
the year ended December 31, 2022, the Company recorded a net loss of 1.6 million compared to a net loss of 1.3 million in 2021.
The increase in net loss was primarily due to an increase of 1.3 million of non-interest expense mainly as a result of change in
control payments related to the Company s Merger, partly offset by a decrease in merger related expenses and an
increase in net interest income. 

Our
current business strategy includes increasing the Bank s asset size, diversifying our loan portfolio to increase our non-residential
lending, including commercial and multi-family real estate lending and commercial lending and increasing our non-interest income, as
ways to improve our profitability in future periods. 

Our
ability to achieve profitability depends upon a number of factors, including general economic conditions, competition with other financial
institutions, changes to the interest rate environment that may reduce our profit margins or impair our business strategy, adverse changes
in the securities markets, changes in laws or government regulations, changes in consumer spending, borrowing, or saving, and changes
in accounting policies. 

Net
Interest Income. Net interest income increased 602,000, or 26.9 , to 2.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2022 from
 2.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2021. The increase in net interest income was primarily due to a 473,000, or 18.3 increase
in interest income and a 129,000, or 36.5 reduction in interest expense. 

46 

Interest
income on loans decreased 223,000, or 13.4 , primarily due to decreases in the loan balances partly offset by higher yields. Interest
income on investment securities increased 207,000 or 78.7 , primarily due to higher balances and an increase in rates. Interest income
on mortgage-backed securities increased 332,000 or 51.6 , primarily due to an increase in yields partly offset by lower balances. Interest
income on federal funds sold and other interest-earning assets increased 156,000, or 770.0 due to higher rates and balances.
The average yield on our loans increased 75 basis points, while average balances decreased 9.7 million. The average yield on our mortgage-backed
securities increased 173 basis points while average balances decreased 4.4 million. The average yield on investment securities increased
76 basis points, while the average balance increased 3.2 million during 2022. Our net interest rate spread increased 100 basis points
to 3.46 for the year ended December 31, 2022 from 2.46 for the year ended December 31, 2021, and our net interest margin increased
97 basis points to 3.49 for 2022 from 2.52 for 2021. 

Interest
and Dividend Income. Interest and dividend income increased 473,000 to 3.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2022 from
 2.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2021. Interest on mortgage-backed securities, investment securities and interest on federal
funds sold and other earning assets increased 332,000, or 51.6 , 207,000, or 78.7 , and 156,000, or 770.0 , respectively, but was
partly offset by a decrease in loan interest income of 223,000 or 13.4 compared to 2021. 

Interest
income on loans decreased 223,000, or 13.4 , to 1.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2022 from 1.7 million for the year ended
December 31, 2021. The decrease resulted primarily from a decrease of 9.7 million in average loan balances to 27.8 million in 2022
from 37.5 million in 2021, partly offset by a 75 basis point increase in the yield to 5.18 in 2022 from 4.43 in 2021 primarily resulting
from an increase in the prime rate. 

Interest
income on mortgage-backed securities increased 332,000 to 976,000 primarily due to a 173 basis point increase in yield to 3.94 in
2022 from 2.21 in 2021, partly offset by a decrease of 4.4 million in average balances. Interest on investment securities increased
 207,000 to 470,000 primarily due to an increase of 76 basis points in yield from 1.48 in 2021 to 2.24 in 2022 and an increase of
 3.2 million in average balances. Interest and dividend income of federal funds sold and other earning assets increased 156,000 to 177,000
mainly due to a 181 basis point increase in yield from 0.47 in 2021 to 2.28 in 2022 and an increase in the average balance of 3.5 million. 

Interest
Expense. Interest expense, consisting of the cost of interest-bearing deposits and borrowings, decreased 129,000 to 225,000
for the year ended December 31, 2022 from 354,000 for the year ended December 31, 2021. The cost of interest-bearing deposits and borrowings
decreased 15 basis points to 0.31 for 2022 compared to 0.46 for 2021, mainly reflecting a decrease in rates on certificates of deposit. 

Provision
for Loan Losses. We establish provisions for loan losses that are charged to operations in order to maintain the allowance
for loan losses at a level believed, to the best of management s knowledge, to cover all known and inherent losses in the
portfolio both probable and reasonable to estimate at each reporting date. We recorded a provision for loan losses of 82,000 for
the year ended December 31, 2022 compared to 146,000 for the year ended December 31, 2021. The decrease was mainly due to lower
provisions for the student loan portfolio. The allowance for loan losses was 79,000 at December 31, 2022 compared to 364,000 at
December 31, 2021. As a result of the Company s Merger, the allowance for loan losses was reduced to zero at June 1, 2022 and
a credit mark of 895,000 was established. The balance in this credit mark was 774,000 at December 31, 2022 as a result of
charge-offs and amortization. 

We had 303,000 in non-performing loans at December
31, 2022 and 580,000 at December 31, 2021. During the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021 we had loan charge-offs of 68,000 and 193,000,
respectively. There were 126,000 and 10,000 of recoveries in 2022 and 2021, respectively. Effective January 1, 2023, we adopted the
CECL standard for determining the amount of our allowance for credit losses, which could increase our allowance for loan and lease losses
upon adoption and cause our historic allowance for loan and lease losses not to be indicative of how we will maintain our allowance for
credit losses beginning January 1, 2023. 

47 

Noninterest
Income. Noninterest income decreased 2,000, or 1.3 to 141,000 for the year ended December 31, 2022 from 143,000 for the year
ended December 31, 2021. The decrease was primarily due to lower fees and service charges collected. 

Noninterest Expense. Noninterest
expense increased 1.3 million, or 35.4 , to 4.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2022 from 3.6 million for the year ended December
31, 2021. This increase was primarily due to change of control payments and professional fees as a result of the Company s Merger
as well as amortization of core deposit intangible, partly offset by a decrease in merger legal fees incurred in 2022 compared to 2021. 

Compensation and benefits increased 1.7 million,
or 155.7 primarily due to change of control payments made in connection with the Company s Merger. Core deposit intangible amortization
was 82,000 in 2022 compared to 0 in 2021 as a result of the Merger. Other expenses increased 145,000, or 72.0 in 2022 compared to
2021 primarily due to recording Director and Officer tail insurance as a result of the merger as well as higher cost of insurance and
training expenses. Partly offsetting these expenses was a decrease in merger-related expenses of 915,000 primarily due to lower legal
and investment banking expenses. 

Income Tax Expense. We recorded an income
tax benefit of 295,000 for the year ended December 31, 2022 based on a loss before taxes of 1.9 million. In 2021, we recorded an income
tax benefit of 34,000 based on a loss before taxes of 1.3 million. The increase in tax benefit in 2022 was primarily due to non-deductible
merger related expenses in 2021 partially offset by a valuation allowance against the deferred tax asset. 

Analysis
of Net Interest Income. The following table sets forth average balance sheets, average yields and costs, and certain other information
for the periods indicated. All average balances are daily average balances and include non-accrual loans. The yields set forth below

Rate/Volume
Analysis 

The
following table presents the effects of changing rates and volumes on our net interest income for the fiscal years indicated. The rate
column shows the effects attributable to changes in rate (changes in rate multiplied by prior volume). The volume column shows the effects
attributable to changes in volume (changes in volume multiplied by prior rate). The net column represents the sum of the prior columns.
For purposes of this table, changes attributable to both rate and volume, which cannot be segregated, have been allocated proportionately,
based on the changes due to rate and the changes due to volume.

Management of Market
Risk 

General .
 Our most significant form of market risk is interest rate risk. As a financial institution, the majority of our assets and liabilities
are sensitive to changes in interest rates. Therefore, a principal part of our operations is to manage interest rate risk and limit the
exposure of our financial condition and results of operations to changes in market interest rates. Our Asset-Liability Committee is responsible
for evaluating the interest rate risk inherent in our assets and liabilities, for determining the level of risk that is appropriate,
given our business strategy, operating environment, capital, liquidity and performance objectives, and for managing this risk consistent
with the policy and guidelines approved by our board of directors. 

Historically, we have operated as a traditional
thrift institution. A significant portion of our assets consist of longer-term, fixed-rate, one- to four-family residential real estate
loans and securities, which we have funded primarily with deposits. Historically we have retained in our portfolio all of the one- to
four-family residential real estate loans that we have originated. We have revised our business strategy with an increased emphasis on
the origination of commercial and multi-family real estate loans, student loans and commercial loans. Such loans generally have shorter
maturities than one- to four-family residential real estate loans. Additionally, subject to favorable market conditions, we will consider
the sale or brokerage of certain newly originated longer-term (terms of 15 years or greater), one- to four-family residential real estate
loans rather than retain all of such loans in portfolio as we have done in the past. Additionally, we have implemented a SBA lending program
and we will consider selling the government-guaranteed portions of such loans to generate additional fee income and manage interest rate
risk. We are an SBA-approved lender. 

49 

Net
Interest Income Analysis. We analyze our sensitivity to changes in interest rates through our net interest income simulation
model which is provided to us by an independent third party. Net interest income is the difference between the interest income we earn
on our interest-earning assets, such as loans and securities, and the interest we pay on our interest-bearing liabilities, such as deposits
and borrowings. We estimate what our net interest income would be for a one-year period based on current interest rates. We then calculate
what the net interest income would be for the same period under different interest rate assumptions. We also estimate the impact over
a five year time horizon. The following table shows the estimated impact on net interest income for the one-year period beginning December
31, 2022 resulting from potential changes in interest rates. These estimates require certain assumptions to be made, including loan and
mortgage-related investment prepayment speeds, reinvestment rates, and deposit maturities and decay rates. These assumptions are inherently
uncertain. As a result, no simulation model can precisely predict the impact of changes in interest rates on our net interest income.
Although the net interest income table below provides an indication of our interest rate risk exposure at a particular point in time,
such estimates are not intended to, and do not, provide a precise forecast of the effect of changes in market interest rates on our net
interest income and will differ from actual results.

(1) The
 calculated changes assume an immediate shock of the static yield curve. 

Certain
shortcomings are inherent in the methodology used in the above interest rate risk measurement. Modeling changes in net portfolio value
requires making certain assumptions that may or may not reflect the manner in which actual yields and costs respond to changes in market
interest rates. In this regard, the tables presented assume that the composition of our interest-sensitive assets and liabilities existing
at the beginning of a period remains constant over the period being measured and assumes that a particular change in interest rates is
reflected uniformly across the yield curve regardless of the duration or repricing of specific assets and liabilities. The tables also
do not measure the changes in credit and liquidity risk that may occur as a result of changes in general interest rates. Accordingly,
although the tables provide an indication of our interest rate risk exposure at a particular point in time, such measurements are not
intended to and do not provide a precise forecast of the effect of changes in market interest rates on our economic value of equity and
will differ from actual results. 

We
do not engage in hedging activities, such as investing in futures, options or swap transactions, or investing in high-risk mortgage derivatives,
such as collateralized mortgage obligation residual interests, real estate mortgage investment conduit residual interests or stripped
mortgage backed securities. 

Liquidity
and Capital Resources 

Liquidity
describes our ability to meet the financial obligations that arise in the ordinary course of business. Liquidity is primarily needed
to meet the borrowing and deposit withdrawal requirements of our customers and to fund current and planned expenditures. Our primary
sources of funds are deposits, scheduled amortization and prepayments of loan principal and mortgage-backed securities, maturities and
calls of investment securities and funds provided by our operations. In addition, we have the ability to borrow from the Federal Home
Loan Bank of New York and the Federal Reserve Bank of New York. At December 31, 2022, we had the capacity to borrow 27.8
million from the Federal Home Loan Bank of New York, subject to our pledging sufficient assets. Additionally, at December 31, 2022, we
had the ability to borrow up to 2 million on a Fed Funds line of credit with Atlantic Community Bankers Bank. At December 31, 2022,
we had no outstanding advances from the FHLB. 

50 

Loan
repayments and maturing securities are a relatively predictable source of funds. However, deposit flows, calls of securities and prepayments
of loans and mortgage-backed securities are strongly influenced by interest rates, general and local economic conditions and competition
in the marketplace. These factors reduce the predictability of these sources of funds. 

Our
primary investing activities are the origination or purchase of one- to four-family real estate loans and commercial and multi-family
real estate loans and the purchase of securities. For the year ended December 31, 2022, loan originations totaled 4.1 million compared
to originations of 5.8 million, for the year ended December 31, 2021. Purchases of investments, mortgage-backed securities and bank
certificates of deposit totaled 7.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2022 and 65.1 million for the year ended December 31,
2021. 

Total
deposits decreased 8.3 million during the year ended December 31, 2022, while total deposits increased 4.6 million during the year
ended December 31, 2021. Deposit flows are affected by the level of interest rates, the interest rates and products offered by competitors
and other factors. At December 31, 2022, certificates of deposit scheduled to mature within one year totaled 15.7 million. Our ability
to retain these deposits will be determined in part by the interest rates we are willing to pay on such deposits. 

We
are committed to maintaining a strong liquidity position. We monitor our liquidity position on a daily basis. We anticipate that we will
have sufficient funds to meet our current funding commitments. Based on our deposit retention experience and current pricing strategy,
we anticipate that a significant portion of maturing time deposits will be retained. 

At
December 31, 2022 and 2021, our capital ratios were all above the minimum levels required for it to be considered a well capitalized 
financial institution under prompt corrective action regulations. In order to be classified as well-capitalized 
under federal banking regulations, we were required to have Tier I and total risked-based capital ratios of 8.0 and 10.0 , respectively,
as of December 31, 2022. Our Tier 1 and total risked-based capital was 11.3 million and 11.4 million, respectively, or 24.44 and 24.61 
of total risk weighted assets at December 31, 2022. At December 31, 2021, our Tier 1 and total risked-based capital was 10.0 million
and 10.4 million, respectively, or 20.63 and 21.38 of risk weighted assets. 

Off-Balance
Sheet Arrangements and Aggregate Contractual Obligations 

Commitments.
 As a financial services provider, we routinely are a party to various financial instruments with off-balance-sheet risks, such
as commitments to extend credit and unused lines of credit. While these contractual obligations represent our future cash requirements,
a significant portion of commitments to extend credit may expire without being drawn upon. Such commitments are subject to the same credit
policies and approval process accorded to loans we make. 

Contractual
Obligations. In the ordinary course of our operations, we enter into certain contractual obligations. Such obligations include
data processing services, operating leases for premises and equipment, agreements with respect to borrowed funds and deposit liabilities. 

Recent
Accounting Pronouncements 

Please see Note 1 to our consolidated financial
statements in Item 8 of this Annual Report. 

Impact
of Inflation and Changing Price 

Our
financial statements and related notes have been prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP. U.S. GAAP generally requires the measurement
of financial position and operating results in terms of historical dollars without consideration of changes in the relative purchasing
power of money over time due to inflation. The impact of inflation is reflected in the increased cost of our operations. Unlike industrial
companies, our assets and liabilities are primarily monetary in nature. As a result, changes in market interest rates have a greater
impact on performance than the effects of inflation.

9A Controls and Procedures 

(a) Evaluation
of disclosure controls and procedures. An evaluation was performed under the supervision and with the participation of the
Company s management, including the Chief Executive Officer and the Chief Financial Officer, of the effectiveness of the
design and operation of the Company s disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) promulgated under the
Exchange Act as of December 31, 2022. Based on that evaluation, the Company s management, including the Chief Executive
Officer and the Chief Financial Officer, concluded that the Company s disclosure controls and procedures were effective. 

Changes in internal control over financial reporting.
During the quarter ended December 31, 2022, there have been no changes in the Company s internal control over financial reporting
that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, the Company s internal control over financial reporting. 

(b)
Management s annual report on internal control over financial reporting. 

Management
of the Company is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting. 

The Company s internal control over financial
reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of
financial statements for external purposes in accordance U.S. GAAP. The Company s internal control over financial reporting includes
those policies and procedures that (i) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect
the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the Company; (ii) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary
to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America,
and that receipts and expenditures of the Company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of
the Company; and (iii) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition
of the Company s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements. 

Because
of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of
any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions,
or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. 

52 

Management, including the Chief Executive Officer and
Chief Financial Officer, assessed the effectiveness of the Company s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31,
2022, based on the criteria set forth by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission COSO in
 Internal Control-Integrated Framework (2013). Based on such assessment, management believes that the Company s internal
control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2022 is effective. 

This Annual Report does not include an attestation
report of the Company s independent registered public accounting firm regarding internal control over financial reporting. Management s
report was not subject to attestation by the Company s independent registered public accounting firm pursuant to provisions of the
Dodd-Frank Act that permit the Company to provide only management s report in this Annual Report.

REPORT
OF Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm 

To
the Board of Directors 

 Vecta
Inc. and Subsidiary 

 New
York, New York 

Opinion
on the Consolidated Financial Statements 

I
have audited the accompanying consolidated statements of financial condition of Vecta Inc. and Subsidiary (the Company as of December 31, 2022, and the related consolidated statements of operations, comprehensive (loss), stockholders equity, and
cash flows for the seven months then ended, and the related notes (collectively, the consolidated financial statements ).
In my opinion, the consolidated financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company
as of December 31, 2022, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for the seven months then ended, in conformity with U.S.
generally accepted accounting principles. 

Basis
for Opinion 

These
consolidated financial statements are the responsibility of the Company s management. My responsibility is to express an opinion
on these consolidated financial statements based on my audit. Fontanella Associates LLC is a public accounting firm registered with the
Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB) and is required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance
with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. 

I
conducted my audit in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that I plan and perform the audit to obtain
reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud.
The Company is not required to have, nor was I engaged to perform, an audit of its internal control over financial reporting. As part
of my audit, I am required to obtain an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, but not for the purpose of expressing
an opinion on the effectiveness of the Company s internal control over financial reporting. Accordingly, I express no such opinion. 

My
audit included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements, whether due
to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence
regarding the amounts and disclosures in the consolidated financial statements. My audit also included evaluating the accounting principles
used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the consolidated financial statements.
I believe that my audit provides a reasonable basis for my opinion. 

Critical
Audit Matter 

The
critical audit matter communicated below is a matter arising from the current period audit of the consolidated financial statements that
was communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that: (1) related to accounts or disclosures that are material
to the consolidated financial statements and (2) involved especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgements. The communication
of critical audit matters does not alter in any way my opinion on the consolidated financial statements, taken as a whole, and I am not,
by communicating the critical audit matter below, providing separate opinions on the critical audit matter or on the accounts or disclosures
to which it related. 

Allowance
for Loan Losses 

As
discussed in Notes 1 and 6 to the consolidated financial statements, the allowance for loan losses is established through a provision
for loan losses and represents an amount, which, in management s judgment, will be adequate to absorb losses in the loan portfolio.
The Company s allowance for loan losses was 79,000 at December 31, 2022 and consists of a general allowance only as of that date.
Management develops the general component based on historical loan loss experience adjusted for qualitative factors not reflected in
the historical loss experience. Historical loss ratios are measured using the average charge-off ratio for the previous three-year period,
depending on loan type. The qualitative factors used by the Company include factors such as national and local economic conditions, levels
of and trends in delinquency rates and nonaccrual loans, trends in volumes and terms of loans, changes in lending policies and procedures,
lending personnel, and collateral, as well as concentrations in loan types, industry and geography. The adjustments for qualitative factors
require a significant amount of judgement by management and involve a high degree of estimation uncertainty. 

I
identified the qualitative factor component of the allowance for loan losses as a critical audit matter as auditing the underlying qualitative
factors required significant auditor judgement as amounts determined by management rely on analysis that is highly subjective and includes
significant estimation uncertainty. 

My
audit procedures related to the qualitative factor component of the allowance for loan losses included the following, among others: 

Obtaining
 an understanding of the relevant controls related to the allowance for loan losses, including
 controls related to management s establishment, review, an approval of the qualitative
 factors, and the completeness and accuracy of the data used in determining qualitative factors. 

Evaluation
 of the appropriateness of management s methodology for estimating the allowance for
 loan losses. 

Testing
 the completeness and accuracy of data used by management in determining qualitative factor
 adjustments by agreeing them to internal and external source data. 

Testing
 management s conclusions regarding the appropriateness of the qualitative factor adjustments
 and agreement of any changes therein to the allowance for loan losses calculation.

SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (Cont d) 

A
material estimate that is particularly susceptible to significant change relates to the determination of the allowance for loan losses.
Management believes that the allowance for loan losses is adequate. While management uses available information to recognize losses on
loans, future additions to the allowance for loan losses may be necessary based on changes in economic conditions in the Company s
market area. 

In
addition, various regulatory agencies, as an integral part of their examination process, periodically review the Company s allowance
for loan losses. Such agencies may require the Company to recognize additions to the allowance based on their judgments about information
available to them at the time of their examination. 

1.
SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (Cont d) 

A
loan evaluated for impairment is deemed to be impaired when, based on current information and events, it is probable that the Company
will be unable to collect all amounts due according to the contractual terms of the loan agreement. An insignificant payment delay, which
is defined as up to ninety days by the Company, will not cause a loan to be classified as impaired. A loan is not impaired during a period
of delay in payment if the Company expects to collect all amounts due, including interest accrued at the contractual interest rate for
the period of delay. The amount of loan impairment is measured based on the present value of expected future cash flows discounted at
the loan s effective interest rate or, as a practical expedient, at the loan s observable market price or the fair value
of the collateral if the loan is collateral dependent. All loans identified as impaired are evaluated independently. The Company does
not aggregate such loans for evaluation purposes. Payments received on impaired loans are applied first to accrued interest receivable
and then to principal.

Equity
Incentive Plan: 

The
Company maintains an equity incentive plan the Stock Incentive Plan ). Stock options and restricted stock may be granted
to directors, officers and other employees of the Company. The maximum number of shares which may be issued upon exercise of the options
under the plan cannot exceed shares. The maximum number of shares of stock that may be issued as restricted stock awards cannot
exceed .

Recent
Accounting Pronouncements (Cont d) 

In
February 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-02, Leases (Topic 842) . Under the new guidance, lessees will be required to recognize
the following for all leases (with the exception of short-term leases) at the commencement date: (i) a lease liability, which is a lessee s
obligation to make lease payments arising from a lease, measured on a discounted basis; and (ii) a right-of-use asset, which is an asset
that represents the lessee s right to use, or control the use of, a specified asset for the lease term. Under the new guidance,
lessor accounting is largely unchanged. Lessees (for capital and operating leases) and lessors (for sales-type, direct financing, and
operating leases) must apply a modified retrospective transition approach for leases existing at, or entered into after, the beginning
of the earliest comparative period presented in the financial statements. In June 2020, the FASB issued ASU 2020-05, Effective
Dates for Certain Entities . The amendments in this update defer the effective date for one year for small reporting companies
that have not yet issued financial statements reflecting the adoption of Leases . Therefore, Leases is effective,
for the Company, for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2021. The adoption of this guidance in 2022 did not have a material effect
on the Company s consolidated financial statements.

The
Merger was accounted for under the acquisition method of accounting and accordingly the results of the Company s consolidated
operations have been included in the Company s December 31, 2022 consolidated financial statements from the Closing Date of the
Merger, or June 1, 2022.

The
determination of the fair value of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed required management to make estimates about discount rates,
future expected cash flows, market conditions, and other future events that are highly subjective in nature and subject to change. The
fair value estimates are subject to change for up to one year after the closing date of the transaction if additional information (existing
at the date of closing) relative to closing date fair values becomes available. 

Fair
Value Measurement of Assets Acquired and Liabilities Assumed: 

Described
below are the methods used to determine the fair values of the significant assets acquired and liabilities assumed in this acquisition. 

Cash
and cash equivalents - The estimated fair values of cash and cash equivalents approximate their stated face amounts, as these
financial instruments are either due on demand or have short-term maturities. 

Investment
securities - The investment securities acquired were classified as either available for sale or held to maturity 
based on the Company s intent at the acquisition date. The estimated fair values of the investment securities were calculated utilizing
Level 2 inputs similar to the valuation techniques used for Vecta s investment portfolios detailed in Note 16. 

2.
 Business combination (Cont d) 

Loans
- The fair value of the performing loan portfolio includes both a yield component and a credit component. The yield component utilizes
a discounted cash flow analysis, including prepayment speed assumptions, to compare the difference between the present values of projected
cash flows of the loan portfolio at portfolio rates versus cash flows at current market rates. The yield component reflected a pre-tax
discount of , which will be accreted as a net increase in interest income over the lives of the related loans. For purposes of
the credit adjustment, the loan portfolio was segregated into performing and non-performing loans. The credit component of total loans
reflected an aggregate pre-tax discount of , comprised of adjustments to the loans based on Sunnyside Federal s historical
charge-off history, charge-off statistics by type of loan published by the FDIC,
Sunnyside Federal s internal allowance for loan and lease losses ALLL analysis and the level of allowances for
loan losses maintained by public New York-based financial institutions with assets less than million, all of which provide indications
of an estimated fair value adjustment a purchaser would apply to reflect the expected aggregate credit losses. 

Core
Deposit Intangible - Core deposit intangibles (CDI) are measures of the value of non-maturity checking, savings, NOW and money market
customer deposits that are acquired in a business combination. The fair value for CDI was estimated based on a discounted cash flow methodology
that gave appropriate consideration to expected customer attrition rates, net maintenance cost of the deposit base, alternative costs
of funds, and the interest costs associated with the customer deposits. The CDI is amortized over an estimated useful life of years
to approximate the existing deposit relationships acquired. 

Premises
and equipment- The fair value of the office building and land was based on an appraisal using the income approach. 

Deposits
- The fair values of deposit liabilities with no stated maturity (i.e., non-interest bearing accounts and savings, NOW and money market
accounts) are equal to the carrying amounts payable on demand. The fair values of certificates of deposit represent contractual cash
flows, discounted to present value using interest rates currently offered on deposits with similar characteristics and remaining maturities.

The

Actual maturities may differ from these amounts because certain debt security issuers have the right to call or redeem their obligations
prior to contractual maturity. In addition, mortgage backed securities that amortize monthly are listed in the period the security is

The
unrealized losses are primarily due to changes in market interest rates subsequent to purchase. A total of 45 securities were in an unrealized
loss position at December 31, 2022. The Company generally purchases securities issued by Government Sponsored Enterprises (GSE). Accordingly,
it is expected that the GSE securities would not be settled at a price less than the Company s amortized cost basis. The Company
does not consider these investments to be other-than-temporarily impaired at December 31, 2022 since the decline in market value is attributable
to changes in interest rates and not credit quality and the Company has the intent and ability to hold these investments until there
is a full recovery of the unrealized loss, which may be at maturity.

In
the ordinary course of business, the Company makes loans to its directors, executive officers, and their associates (related parties)
on the same terms as those prevailing at the time of origination for comparable loans with other borrowers. The unpaid principal balances
of related party loans were approximately at December 31, 2022. 

As
a result of the acquisition of Sunnyside Federal, the loan portfolio was segregated into performing and non-performing loans to determine
the credit adjustment. The credit component of total loans reflected an aggregate original pre-tax discount of , comprised of
adjustments to the loans based on Sunnyside Federal s historical charge-off history, charge-off statistics by type of loan published
by the FDIC, Sunnyside Federal s internal allowance for loan and lease losses ALLL analysis and the level of allowances for loan losses maintained by public New York-based financial institutions
with assets less than million, all of which provide indications of an estimated fair value adjustment a purchaser would apply to
reflect the expected aggregate credit losses.

In
addition to the above credit adjustment, the Company will maintain an allowance for loan losses for new loans originated and for qualitative
and other changes in the loan portfolio that existed as of the acquisition date. 

Recoveries 

Balance at end of period 

The
allowance for loan losses consists of specific, general and unallocated components. The specific component relates to loans that are
classified as impaired. For loans that are classified as impaired, an allowance is established when the discounted cash flows (or collateral
value or observable market price) of the impaired loan is lower than the carrying value of that loan. There are no specific allowances
as of December 31, 2022. The general component covers pools of loans by loan class not considered impaired, as well as smaller balance
homogeneous loans, such as one-to-four family real estate, home equity lines of credit and other consumer loans. These pools of loans
are evaluated for loss exposure based upon historical loss rates for each of these categories of loans, adjusted for qualitative factors.
These qualitative risk factors include: 

1. 
 Lending
 policies and procedures, including underwriting standards and collection, charge-off, and recovery practices. 

2. 
 National,
 regional, and local economic and business conditions including the value of underlying collateral for collateral dependent loans. 

3. 
 Nature
 and volume of the portfolio and terms of loans. 

4. 
 Experience,
 ability, and depth of lending management and staff and the quality of the Company s loan review system.

 and severity of past due, classified and nonaccrual loans. 

6. 
 Existence
 and effect of any concentrations of credit and changes in the level of such concentrations. 

7. 
 Effect
 of external factors, such as competition and legal and regulatory requirements. 

Each
factor is assigned a value to reflect improving, stable or declining conditions based on management s best judgment using relevant
information available at the time of the evaluation. Adjustments to the factors are supported through documentation of changes in conditions
in a narrative accompanying the allowance for loan loss calculation. 

An
unallocated component is maintained to cover uncertainties that could affect management s estimate of probable losses. The unallocated
component of the allowance reflects the margin of imprecision inherent in the underlying assumptions used in the methodologies for estimating
specific and general losses in the portfolio. 

The
allowance calculation methodology includes further segregation of loan classes into risk rating categories. The borrower s
overall financial condition, repayment sources, guarantors and value of collateral, if appropriate, are evaluated when credit
deficiencies arise, such as delinquent loan payments. Credit quality risk ratings include regulatory classifications of pass,
special mention, substandard, doubtful and loss. 

Loan
classifications are defined as follows: 

Pass
 These loans are well protected by the current net worth and paying capacity of the obligor (or guarantors, if any) or by
 the fair value, less cost to acquire and sell, of any underlying collateral in a timely manner. 

Special
 Mention These loans have potential weaknesses that deserve management s close attention. If left uncorrected, these
 potential weaknesses may result in deterioration of repayment prospects. 

Substandard
 These loans are inadequately protected by the current net worth and paying capacity of the obligor or by the collateral pledged,
 if any. Assets so classified must have a well-defined weakness, or weaknesses that jeopardize the liquidation of the debt. They are
 characterized by the distinct possibility that the Company will sustain some loss if the deficiencies are not corrected. 

Doubtful
 These loans have all the weaknesses inherent in a loan classified substandard with the added characteristic that the weaknesses
 make the full recovery of our principal balance highly questionable and improbable on the basis of currently known facts, conditions,
 and values. The likelihood of a loss on an asset or portion of an asset classified as doubtful is high. Its classification as Loss
 is not appropriate, however, because pending events are expected to materially affect the amount of loss. 

Loss
 These loans are considered uncollectible and of such little value that a charge-off is warranted. This classification does
 not necessarily mean that an asset has no recovery or salvage value; but rather, there is much doubt about whether, how much, or
 when the recovery will occur.

A
loan is defined as impaired when, based on current information and events, it is probable that a creditor will be unable to collect all
amounts due under the contractual terms of the loan agreement. The Company considers one-to four-family mortgage loans and consumer installment
loans to be homogeneous and, therefore, does not generally evaluate them for impairment, unless they are considered troubled debt restructurings.
All other loans are evaluated on an individual basis. 

The
Company did not have any troubled debt restructurings at or during the seven months ended December 31, 2022.

At December 31, 2022, the Company had a federal net operating loss carryover
of and a New York state net operating loss carryover of available to offset future taxable income. As a result of
the merger as discussed in Note 1, usage of the federal NOL and of the New York State NOL is limited in accordance with Internal
Revenue Code Section 382 to annually on a cumulative basis. (Portions of the not used in a particular tax year may be
added to subsequent usage.) 

In
assessing the realizability of deferred tax assets, management considers whether it is more likely than not that some portion or all
of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. Management considers the scheduled reversal of deferred tax liabilities, projected future
taxable income, and tax planning strategies in making this assessment. As a result, a valuation allowance of has been established
on the entire net deferred tax asset. 

Sunnyside
Federal qualifies as a savings and loan association under the provisions of the Internal Revenue Code and, therefore, was permitted,
prior to January 1, 1996, to deduct from federal taxable income an allowance for bad debts based on eight percent of taxable income before
such deduction less certain adjustments, subject to certain limitations. Beginning January 1, 1996, the Sunnyside Federal, for federal
income tax purposes, must calculate its bad debt deduction using either the experience or the specific charge off method. Retained earnings

Trust Retirement Institutional Services Company acts as Trustee for the Plan. The Plan assets are managed by Pinnacle Associates,
Ltd. 

The
long-term investment objectives are to maintain plan assets at a level that will sufficiently cover long-term obligations and to generate
a return on plan assets that will meet or exceed the rate at which long-term obligations will grow. A broadly diversified combination
of equity and fixed income portfolios and various risk management techniques are used to help achieve these objectives. 

Allowable
investments include common stocks, preferred stocks, fixed income securities, depository receipts, money market funds, real estate investment
trusts, and publicly traded limited partnerships with the following limitations:

BENEFIT PLANS (Cont d) 

The
 account will be a balanced account, with a target of equity securities and fixed income securities ratio which may vary based
 on the portfolio manager s discretion. 

The
 account will generally not invest more than of its net assets in cash and cash equivalents. 

The
 account will invest, under normal circumstances, between to of its net assets in fixed income securities. 

The
 account will invest, under normal circumstances, between to of its net assets in equity securities. The equities will be
 mostly of a large capitalization nature. 

The
 account will generally hold between to equity securities. 

The
 maximum equity position size will be limited to of net assets at the time of purchase. 

For
 equities, each significant economic sector will be considered for the investment. 

The
 account may invest up to of its net assets in companies incorporated outside of the United States, at the time of purchase. 

The
 account will not sell securities short. Any short transactions in futures, swaps, structured products, and call options will apply
 to this limit. 

The
investment goal is to achieve investment results that will contribute to the proper funding of the pension plan by exceeding the rate
of inflation over the long term. 

Determination
of Long-Term Rate-of-Return 

The
long-term rate-of-return-on-assets assumption was set based on historical returns earned by equities and fixed income securities, adjusted
to reflect expectations of future returns as applied to the plan s target allocation of asset classes. Equities and fixed income
securities were assumed to earn real rates of return in the ranges of - and - , respectively. The long-term inflation rate was estimated
to be . When these overall return expectations are applied to the plan s target allocation, the result is an expected rate of
return of to .

Other
Retirement Benefits 

Prior
to the acquisition date, the Company entered into salary continuation agreements with certain of its, now retired, officers effective
June 2002. The agreements provide for specified benefit payments for life, -year period certain commencing at normal retirement, as
well as payments upon early retirement, disability and death. The amounts payable under the agreements vest at an annual rate of over
 years and are computed as a specified percentage of a defined total compensation base, less (i) benefits under the Company s
pension plan, 401(k) plan and deferred compensation agreements, and (ii) a portion of social security benefits. The Association also
entered into agreements providing for split-dollar life insurance death benefits based on each officer s total compensation, as
defined. The salary continuation and split-dollar agreements are unfunded, non-qualified benefits plans. However, the Company has purchased
life insurance policies held by a Rabbi Trust in consideration of its obligations under the salary continuation agreements and certain
prior deferred compensation agreements. During 2009, certain of these obligations were renegotiated by the Company with the purchase
of annuity contracts. At December 31, 2022, recorded obligations of , are included in other liabilities with respect to these
agreements. The related life insurance policies are reported as assets at their cash surrender values of at December 31, 2022.

FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS AND DISCLOSURES (Cont d) 

A.
Fair Value Measurements (Cont d) 

Level
 2 Valuation is based upon quoted prices for similar instruments in active markets, quoted prices for identical or similar
 instruments in markets that are not active and model-based valuation techniques for which all significant assumptions are observable
 in the market. 

Level
 3 Valuation is generated from model-based techniques that use significant assumptions not observable in the market. These
 unobservable assumptions reflect the Company s own estimates of assumptions that market participants would use in pricing the
 asset or liability. Valuation techniques include the use of option pricing models, discounted cash flow models and similar techniques.
 The results cannot be determined with precision and may not be realized in an actual sale or immediate settlement of the asset or
 liability. 

The
Company bases its fair values on the price that would be received to sell an asset in an orderly transaction between market participants
at the measurement date. ASC Topic 820 requires the Company to maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable
inputs when measuring fair value. 

Assets
that are measured on a recurring basis are limited to the available-for-sale securities portfolio. The available-for-sale portfolio is
carried at estimated fair value with any unrealized gains and losses, net of taxes, reported as accumulated other comprehensive income
or loss in stockholders equity. Substantially all of the available-for-sale portfolio consists of investment securities issued
by government-sponsored enterprises. The fair values for substantially all of these securities are obtained from an independent securities
broker. Based on the nature of the securities, the securities broker provides the Company with prices which are categorized as Level
2 since quoted prices in active markets for identical assets are generally not available for the majority of securities in the portfolio.

There
were no assets measured at fair value on a non-recurring basis at December 31, 2022. 

B.
Fair Value Disclosures 

The
following methods and assumptions were used by the Company in estimating fair values of financial instruments as disclosed herein. 

Cash
and Cash Equivalents 

For
cash and due from banks and federal funds sold, the carrying amount approximates the fair value (Level 1). 

Securities 

The
fair value of securities is estimated based on bid quotations received from securities dealers, if available (Level 1). If a quoted market
price was not available, fair value was estimated using quoted market prices of similar instruments, adjusted for differences between
the quoted instruments and the instruments being valued (Level 2). 

16.
FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS AND DISCLOSURES (Cont d) 

B.
Fair Value Disclosures (Cont d) 

FHLB
and other stock, at cost 

The
fair value for FHLB and other stock, at cost is its carrying value, since this is the amount for which it could be redeemed. There is
no active market for this stock, and the Company is required to maintain a minimum balance based upon the unpaid principal of home mortgage
loans (Level 2). 

Loans
Receivable 

Fair
values are estimated for portfolios of loans with similar financial characteristics. Loans are segregated by type such as residential
mortgage, commercial, and consumer. Each loan category is further segmented into fixed and adjustable rate interest terms and by performing
and nonperforming categories (Level 3). 

Deposits 

The
fair value of deposits with no stated maturity, such as non-interest-bearing demand deposits, savings, and NOW and money market accounts,
is equal to the amount payable on demand (Level 1). The fair value of certificates of deposit is based on the discounted value of contractual
cash flows. The discount rate is estimated using the rates currently offered for deposits with similar remaining maturities (Level 2). 

Short-Term
Borrowings 

The
carrying amounts of federal funds purchased, and other short-term borrowings maturing within 90 days approximate their fair values. Fair
values of other short-term borrowings are estimated using discounted cash flow analyses based on the Company s current incremental
borrowing rates for similar types of borrowing arrangements (Level 1). 

Long-Term
Borrowings 

The
fair value of long-term borrowings is estimated using discounted cash flow analysis based on the current incremental borrowing rates
for similar types of borrowing arrangements (Level 2). 

Off-Balance-Sheet
Instruments 

In
the ordinary course of business the Company has entered into off-balance-sheet financial instruments consisting of commitments to extend
credit. Such financial instruments are recorded in the financial statements when they are funded. Their fair value would approximate
fees currently charged to enter into similar agreements. For further information on these financial instruments, see Note 14.

The
fair value estimates are made at a discrete point in time based on relevant market information and information about the financial instruments.
Fair value estimates are based on judgments regarding future expected loss experience, current economic conditions, risk characteristics
of various financial instruments, and other factors. These estimates are subjective in nature and involve uncertainties and matters of
significant judgment and, therefore, cannot be determined with precision. Changes in assumptions could significantly affect the estimates.
Further, the foregoing estimates may not reflect the actual amount that could be realized if all or substantially all of the financial
instruments were offered for sale. 

In
addition, the fair value estimates were based on existing on-and-off balance sheet financial instruments without attempting to value
the anticipated future business and the value of assets and liabilities that are not considered financial instruments. Other significant
assets and liabilities that are not considered financial assets and liabilities include premises and equipment and advances from borrowers
for taxes and insurance. In addition, the tax ramifications related to the realization of the unrealized gains and losses have a significant
effect on fair value estimates and have not been considered in any of the estimates. 

Finally,
reasonable comparability between financial institutions may not be likely due to the wide range of permitted valuation techniques and
numerous estimates which must be made given the absence of active secondary markets for many of the financial instruments. The lack of
uniform valuation methodologies introduces a greater degree of subjectivity to these estimated fair values.
