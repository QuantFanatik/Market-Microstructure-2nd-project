 Me rcer 
 General 
 We are a global forest products company with two reportable operating segments being pulp and solid wood. 
 We have approximately 3,320 employees and consolidated annual production capacity of approximately: 
 2.3 million ADMTs of kraft pulp; 

960 MMfbm of lumber; 

140,000 m 3 of cross-laminated timber, or CLT 

17 million pallets; 

230,000 metric tonnes of biofuels (wood pellets and briquettes); and 

431.5 MW of electrical generation. 

Pulp Segment 
 Our pulp segment consists of the manufacture, sale and distribution of pulp, electricity and chemicals at our pulp mills. 
 We are one of the world s largest producers of market NBSK pulp, which is pulp that is sold on the open market. Our size provides us increased presence, better industry information in our markets and close customer relationships with many large pulp consumers. 
 We operate four modern and highly efficient pulp mills. These include NBSK mills in Eastern Germany and one NBSK mill and a swing kraft mill in Western Canada which produces both NBSK and NBHK. 
 3 
 
 We are the sole NBSK producer, and the only significant market pulp producer in Germany, which is the largest pulp import market in Europe. We supply the growing pulp demand in China both through our Canadian mills ready access to the Port of Vancouver and through our Stendal mill s existing logistics arrangements. 
 In addition, as a result of the significant investments made in cogeneration equipment, all of our mills generate and sell a significant amount of surplus green energy. We also produce and sell tall oil from black liquor, a by-product of our production process, which is used as both a chemical additive and as a green energy source. 
 Of our consolidated annual production capacity of approximately 2.3 million ADMTs of kraft pulp, approximately 2.0 million ADMTs or 88 is NBSK and the balance is NBHK. 
 Key operating details for each of our pulp mills are as follows: 
 Stendal mill . Our Stendal mill is a modern, efficient, single line, ISO 9001, 14001, 38200 and 50001 certified NBSK pulp mill that has an annual production capacity of approximately 740,000 ADMTs and 148 MW of electrical generation. The Stendal mill is located near the town of Arneburg, Germany, approximately 80 miles west of Berlin. 

Rosenthal mill . Our Rosenthal mill is a modern, efficient ISO 9001, 14001, 38200 and 50001 certified NBSK pulp mill that has an annual production capacity of approximately 360,000 ADMTs and 57 MW of electrical generation. The Rosenthal mill is located in the town of Rosenthal am Rennsteig, Germany, approximately 185 miles south of Berlin. 

Celgar mill . Our Celgar mill is a modern, efficient ISO 9001 and 14001 certified NBSK pulp mill that has an annual production capacity of approximately 520,000 ADMTs and 100 MW of electrical generation. The Celgar mill is located near the city of Castlegar, British Columbia, Canada, approximately 375 miles east of Vancouver. 

Peace River mill . Our Peace River mill is a modern, efficient ISO 9001 and 14001 certified mill that produces both NBSK and NBHK pulp and has an annual production capacity of approximately 475,000 ADMTs and 70 MW of electrical generation. The Peace River mill is located near the town of Peace River, Alberta, Canada, approximately 305 miles north of Edmonton. Peace River also holds two 20-year renewable governmental forest management agreements and three deciduous timber allocations in Alberta with an aggregate allowable annual cut of approximately 2.9 million m 3 of hardwood and softwood allocations totaling 375,000 m 3 . Through our Peace River mill, we have a 50 proportionate share of the annual production capacity of the Cariboo mill, with our share of its annual production capacity being approximately 170,000 ADMTs and 28.5 MW of electrical generation and is located in Quesnel, British Columbia, Canada. 

Our pulp mills are some of the newer and more modern pulp mills in Europe and North America. We believe the relative age, production capacity and electrical generation capacity of our mills provide us with certain manufacturing cost and other advantages over many of our competitors. We believe our competitors older mills do not have the equipment or capacity to produce or sell surplus power or chemicals in a meaningful amount. In addition, as a result of the relative age of our mills, they benefit from lower maintenance capital requirements and higher efficiency relative to many of our competitors mills. 
 The following table sets out our pulp production and pulp revenues for the periods indicated:

We serve pulp customers in Europe, Asia and North America. We primarily work directly with customers to capitalize on our geographic diversity, coordinate sales and enhance customer relationships. We believe our ability to deliver high-quality pulp on a timely basis and our customer service makes us a preferred supplier for many customers. 
 4 
 
 Our pulp mills generate and sell surplus electricity, providing us with a stable revenue source unrelated to pulp prices. Our German pulp mills also generate tall oil from black liquor, which is sold to third parties for use in numerous applications, including biofuels. Since our energy and chemical production are by-products of our pulp production process, there are minimal incremental costs and our surplus energy and chemical sales are highly profitable. All of our mills generate and sell surplus energy to regional utilities or the regional electrical market. Our German mills can sell energy at market prices and our Stendal mill has the option to sell energy pursuant to a special tariff under Germany s Renewable Energy Sources Act , or the Renewable Energy Act . However, in 2022, as a result of higher energy prices resulting from the war in Ukraine, Stendal primarily sold energy at market prices which were generally higher. Both the European Union and Germany have enacted or proposed legislation related to energy supply shortages and high energy prices, including the institution of a tax on sales in excess of certain price caps. See Item 1A. Risk Factors . 
 Our Peace River mill sells surplus energy to its regional electrical market. Our Celgar mill is party to a fixed electricity purchase agreement with the regional public utility provider for the sale of surplus power which runs until October 2030. 
 The following table sets out the amount of surplus energy we produced and sold and revenues from the sale of such surplus energy and chemicals in our pulp segment for the periods indicated:

Solid Wood Segment 
 Our solid wood segment consists of the manufacture, sale and distribution of lumber, manufactured products (including CLT and finger joint lumber), wood pallets, electricity, biofuels and wood residuals from our sawmills and other facilities located in Germany and the United States. 
 Since entering into the solid wood segment with the acquisition of Mercer Timber Products GmbH, which owns the Friesau mill, in 2017, we have expanded our solid wood activities and product mix through the acquisition of the Mercer Mass Timber facility in 2021 and the Torgau facility in 2022. 
 Our solid wood segment has an aggregate capacity of approximately 960 MMfbm of lumber, 140,000 m 3 of CLT, 17 million pallets, 230,000 metric tonnes of biofuels and 28 MW of electrical generation. 
 The following is a description of the mills and facilities comprising our solid wood segment: 
 Friesau mill - Our Friesau mill is ISO 50001 and 38200 certified and has an annual production capacity of approximately 550 MMfbm of lumber and 13 MW of electrical generation. The mill is located in Friesau, Germany, approximately 185 miles south of Berlin and 10 miles west of our Rosenthal mill and is one of the Rosenthal mill s largest fiber suppliers. The mill has a diverse product line ranging from custom rough green and dry lumber for the European market to kiln-dried, dimension lumber for the United States, Japan, United Kingdom and other export markets. 

Torgau facility Our Torgau facility is ISO 50001 certified and is an integrated sawmill and value-add pallet production facility, with an annual production capacity of approximately 410 MMfbm of lumber, 17 million pallets and 15 MW of electrical generation. The Torgau facility can also produce up to 230,000 metric tonnes of biofuels, consisting of wood pellets and briquettes, used to generate electricity and thermal energy. The Torgau facility is currently one of the world s largest producers of Euro-pallets, the standard European shipping pallet. The Torgau facility is located in Torgau, Germany, approximately 70 miles south of Berlin. 

5 
 
 Mercer Mass Timber facility The Mercer Mass Timber facility is a 253,000 square foot facility that has an annual production capacity of 140,000 m 3 of CLT. We believe that the facility is one of the largest CLT facilities in North America and that it currently represents approximately 20 of North American CLT capacity. CLT is a wood panel product, made from adhering layers of sawn lumber and is used as a more sustainable alternative to steel and concrete in building projects. Historically, we included the Mercer Mass Timber facility in our corporate and other segment. However, with our acquisition of the Torgau facility on September 30, 2022, we now include the Mercer Mass Timber facility within our solid wood segment, which has been reflected retroactively. 

The European and U.S. lumber markets are very different. In the European market, lumber is generally customized in terms of dimensions and finishing. The U.S. market is driven primarily by demand from new housing starts and home renovation activities and dimensions and finishing are generally standardized. Additionally, lumber production and sales in Europe are commonly measured in m 3 , whereas in the U.S. they are measured in Mfbm.

The Friesau mill and Torgau facility generate electricity for minimal incremental costs, all of which is sold, providing a stable revenue source unrelated to lumber prices. Both the Friesau mill and Torgau facility can sell surplus electricity at market prices or pursuant to special tariffs under the Renewable Energy Act. In 2022, as a result of higher energy prices, the Friesau mill primarily sold energy at market prices which were generally higher. After its acquisition, the Torgau facility also moved to predominantly selling its energy at market prices.

 The Pulp Industry 
 General 
 Pulp is used in the production of paper, tissues and paper-related products. Pulp is generally classified according to its fiber type, production process and degree of bleaching. Kraft pulp, a type of chemical pulp, is produced through a sulphate chemical process in which lignin, the component of wood which binds individual fibers, is dissolved in a chemical reaction. Chemically prepared pulp allows the wood s fiber to retain its length and flexibility, resulting in stronger paper products. Kraft pulp can be bleached to increase its brightness. Softwood kraft pulp is noted for its strength, brightness and absorption properties and is used to produce a variety of products, including lightweight publication grades of paper, tissues and other paper-related products. 
 Bleached kraft pulp is comprised of either softwood kraft made from coniferous trees and hardwood kraft made from deciduous trees. Softwood species generally have long, flexible fibers which add strength to paper while fibers from species of hardwood contain shorter fibers which lend bulk and opacity. 
 We primarily produce and sell NBSK pulp manufactured using northern softwood which is considered a premium grade because of its strength. It generally obtains the highest price relative to other kraft pulps. Our Peace River mill produces both NBSK and NBHK pulp. 
 Most paper users of market kraft pulp use a mix of softwood and hardwood grades to optimize production and product qualities. In 2022, market kraft pulp consumption was approximately 58 hardwood bleached kraft and 37 softwood bleached kraft, with the remainder comprised of unbleached pulp. Over the last several years, production of hardwood pulp, based on fast growing plantation fiber primarily from Asia and South America, has increased much more rapidly than that of softwood grades, because of longer growth cycles. Hardwood kraft generally has a cost advantage over softwood kraft as a result of lower fiber costs, higher wood yields and, for newer hardwood mills, economies of scale. As a result of this growth in supply and lower costs, kraft pulp customers have substituted some of the pulp content in their products to hardwood pulp. 
 However, the requirement for strength and formation characteristics in finished goods counters customers ability to substitute cheaper hardwood pulp for NBSK. Paper and tissue makers focus on larger paper machines with higher speeds and lower basis weights for certain papers which require the strength characteristics of softwood pulp. Additionally, where paper products are lightweight or specialty papers such as premium tissue or magazine paper, or where strength or absorbency are important, softwood kraft forms a significant proportion of the fiber used. As a result, we believe that the ability of kraft pulp users to further substitute hardwood for softwood pulp is limited by such requirements. 
 Kraft pulp can be made in different grades, with varying technical specifications, for different end uses. Softwood kraft pulp is an important ingredient for tissue manufacturing and tissue demand tends to increase with living standards in developing countries. Softwood kraft pulp is also valued for its reinforcing role in mechanical printing papers and is sought after by producers of paper for the publishing industry, primarily for magazines and advertising materials. 
 Markets 
 We believe that over 150 million ADMTs of chemical pulp are converted annually into tissues, printing and writing papers, carton boards and other specialty grades of paper and paperboard around the world. We also believe that approximately 43 of this pulp is sold on the open market as market pulp, while the remainder is produced for internal purposes by integrated paper and paperboard manufacturers. 
 The pulp business is highly cyclical in nature and markets are characterized by periods of supply and demand imbalance, which in turn affect prices. Pulp markets are highly competitive and are sensitive to cyclical changes in the global economy, industry capacity and foreign exchange rates, all of which can have a significant influence on selling prices and our operating results. The length and magnitude of industry cycles have varied over time but generally reflect changes in macro-economic conditions and levels of industry capacity. Pulp is a commodity that is generally available from other producers. As commodity products have few distinguishing qualities from producer to producer, competition is generally based upon price, which is generally determined by supply relative to demand. 
 8 
 
 Between 2013 and 2022, worldwide demand for chemical market pulp overall grew at an average rate of approximately 2 annually, with worldwide demand for bleached softwood kraft market pulp generally flat over the same time period. 
 NBSK pulp demand is significantly impacted by global macro-economic trends. Certain of such trends have had a positive effect on pulp demand while others have had a negative impact. 
 A major long-term macro trend has been the increase in demand from emerging markets, and in particular China. In China alone, tissue production capacity has increased by approximately 7.8 million ADMTs over the last five years. In China, imports of chemical softwood market pulp grew overall by approximately 5 per annum for the period from 2013 to 2022 and it is a key driver of pulp demand and consumption. In 2022, market pulp demand in China weakened as a result of reduced economic activity due to shutdown measures and other restrictions instituted by the government in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. 
 We believe that emerging markets now account for approximately 56 of total global demand for bleached softwood kraft market pulp and China itself now accounts for approximately 30 of such global demand. 
 Two other macro trends positively affecting pulp demand have been the increase in usage and demand for tissue and hygiene products, particularly in China and emerging markets generally and the global reliance on online delivery of products which has increased demand for packaging and specialty products. 
 Two macro-economic trends that have negatively impacted pulp demand are: 
 the material decline in graphic and printing and writing paper demand in recent years, a material portion of which decline will not return; and 

paper demand in the historically mature markets of North America, Europe and Japan has been declining or stagnating, which has resulted in Western Europe currently accounting for approximately 22 of global bleached softwood kraft market pulp demand compared to approximately 28 in 2013. 

The trends and changes in NBSK pulp demand by end use are reflected in the following chart which compares worldwide NBSK pulp demand by end use for the periods indicated: 
 NBSK Pulp Demand by End Use 
 
 We believe 2022 NBSK demand by end use was generally consistent with the trend in the chart above. 
 In 2022, there was a net increase in pulp capacity of 0.4 million ADMTs, primarily of hardwood kraft pulp. Currently, we are aware of 2.7 million ADMTs of announced net capacity increases primarily of hardwood kraft pulp scheduled to come online in 2023.

 NBSK Pulp Pricing 
 Kraft pulp is a globally traded commodity and prices are highly cyclical. Kraft pulp prices are generally quoted in dollars. Pricing is primarily influenced by the balance between supply and demand, as affected by global macro-economic conditions, changes in consumption and capacity, the level of customer and producer inventories and fluctuations in exchange rates. Generally, we and other producers consider global NBSK pulp supply and demand to be evenly balanced when world inventory levels are at about 34 days supply. 
 As the majority of market NBSK pulp is produced and sold by Canadian and Northern European producers, while the price of NBSK pulp is generally quoted in dollars, pricing is often affected by fluctuations in the currency exchange rates for the dollar versus the euro and the Canadian dollar. As NBSK pulp producers generally incur costs in their local currency, while pulp is quoted in dollars, a dollar strengthening generally benefits producers businesses and operating margins. Conversely, a weakening of the dollar versus the local currency of producers generally adversely affects producers businesses and operating margins. 
 As a corollary to changes in exchange rates between the dollar and the euro and Canadian dollar, a stronger dollar generally increases costs to customers of NBSK pulp producers and results in downward pressure on prices. Conversely, a weakening dollar generally supports higher pulp pricing. However, there is invariably a time lag between changes in currency exchange rates and pulp prices. This lag can vary and is not predictable with any certainty. 
 Although China is now the largest market globally for pulp, Europe has also historically been a significant market. As NBSK pulp is a premium grade of pulp, the European market NBSK list price is at times used by the industry as a benchmark reference price. The third party industry quoted average European list prices for NBSK pulp since 2013 have fluctuated between a low of approximately 790 per ADMT in 2016 and a high of 1,500 per ADMT in 2022. 
 Our pulp sales realizations in Europe and North America are third party industry quoted list prices, net of customer discounts, rebates and other selling concessions. Our sales to China and Asia generally are closer to a net price with significantly lower or little discounts and rebates. As a result, our net sales realizations in China are generally similar to other markets. 
 The following table sets out third party industry quoted list prices (before discounts and rebates) for NBSK pulp in Europe and North America and net prices for NBSK pulp in China as of the dates indicated:

Seasonality 
 We are exposed to fluctuations in quarterly sales volumes and expenses due to seasonal factors. These factors are common in the kraft pulp industry. We generally have weaker pulp demand in China in the period relating to the lunar new year and in Europe during the summer holiday months. We typically have a seasonal build-up in raw material inventories in the early winter months as our mills build up their fiber supply for the winter when there is reduced availability. 
 Competition 
 The pulp market is highly fragmented and competitive with many producers competing globally. Producers ranging from small independent manufacturers to large integrated companies produce pulp worldwide. In recent years there has been a trend for industry consolidation and the creation of larger competitors. Pulp is generally a commodity product and our pulp competes with similar products manufactured and distributed by many other producers. While many factors influence our competitive position, particularly in weak economic times, a primary factor is price. Other factors include quality, service, access to reasonably priced fiber and convenience of location. Some of our competitors are larger than we are in certain markets and have substantially greater financial resources. These resources may afford 
 10 
 
 those competitors more purchasing power, increased financial flexibility, more capital resources for expansion and improvement and enable them to compete more effectively. 
 Our key NBSK pulp competitors are principally located in Northern Europe and Canada and include Mets Fibre, S dra Cell, Ilim, Paper Excellence, UPM, Stora Enso, Canfor Pulp and SCA. 
 Solid Wo od Industry 
 General 
 Our solid wood segment consists of the manufacture, sale and distribution of lumber, manufactured products (including CLT and finger joint lumber), wood pallets, electricity, biofuels and wood residuals from our sawmills and other facilities, two of which are located in Germany and one in the United States. 
 Solid Wood Products and Markets 
 Our Friesau mill has two high-volume Linck sawlines and has the ability to produce both rough and planed products. The sawmill principally manufactures finished sawn lumber milled from spruce and pine, including European metric and specialty lumber, U.S. dimensional lumber and J-grade lumber, in various sizes and grades. 
 The Torgau facility is an integrated sawmill and value-add pallet production facility. The facility produces, among other products, lumber, wood pallets and biofuels. 
 Demand for lumber is cyclical and influenced by factors that affect consumer confidence and drive demand for residential construction, such as interest rates, disposable income, unemployment rates, perceived job security and other indicators of general economic conditions. Demand is also affected by the availability of skilled construction trades and construction finishing products, transportation costs, exchange rates, government tariffs and the competitiveness of substitute products. Demand can vary from region to region within a country and seasonal factors that determine optimal building conditions can also affect demand. 
 The process for manufacturing lumber results in a significant percentage of each sawlog ending up as by-products or residuals such as wood chips, trim blocks, sawdust shavings and bark. Due to the close proximity of the German pulp mills to the Friesau sawmill and Torgau facility, we are able to achieve fiber utilization and fiber logistics synergies. By-products at the Friesau mill are typically used as fuel for our cogeneration power plant or sold to a wide variety of customers. In addition, we utilize a significant portion of the chips from the Friesau mill at our Rosenthal pulp mill. At the Torgau facility sawmill residuals are used by our pulp mills or used to produce heating pellets and briquettes. Bark is used to generate electricity and thermal energy. 
 The main markets for our lumber products are in the United States, Europe and the Far East. 
 Our Friesau mill and Torgau facility lumber sales are to a diverse customer base. Customers include national and regional distributors, large construction firms, secondary manufacturers, retail yards and home centers. 
 Our Torgau facility also sells pallets and biofuels to a diverse customer base that is primarily located within a 300 kilometer range of the facility. The facility is one of the world s largest producers of Euro-pallets, the standard European shipping pallet. 
 The Mercer Mass Timber facility produces CLT, a wood panel product, made from adhering layers of sawn lumber that is used as a more sustainable alternative to steel and concrete in building projects. We believe the mill currently represents approximately 20 of North American CLT capacity. The facility s customers are mainly building contractors or property owners. 
 Competition 
 The markets for our lumber products are highly competitive with many producers competing globally. Producers range from small independent mills to very large global producers, including integrated forest products companies. In recent years, there has been significant consolidation in the solid wood industry that has resulted in the creation of even larger 
 11 
 
 global competitors. Producers compete generally on price, quality and service. With respect to lumber and certain solid wood products, these are commodities with few distinguishing features and producers primarily compete based on delivered price. Factors influencing our competitive position include, among others, the availability, quality and cost of raw materials, including fiber, energy and labor, the efficiency and productivity of our facilities and our ability to utilize or sell by-products from the lumber manufacturing process. The Friesau mill and Torgau facility lumber sales also compete in international markets subject to currency fluctuations and global business conditions. Our key competitors in the segment include West Fraser, Canfor, Interfor, Resolute Forest Products, Weyerhaeuser, Binderholz, Stora Enso and Ilim. 
 The Torgau facility s pallets compete with other European pallet producers. The German pallet market is dominated by wood pallet producers. Since most pallets are standardized, there is limited room for product differentiation, implying that logistical organization, production capacity, and the ability to meet just-in-time demand form regional competitive advantages. 
 Mercer Mass Timber competes with other producers of CLT and other building materials such as concrete and steel. These building alternatives can be competitive on a cost basis, and have the added benefit of being in wide use for multiple years, as opposed to CLT which is relatively new in its North American adoption. These alternatives, however, lack the environmental attributes of CLT, in addition to its aesthetic appearance. 
 Generation and Sales of Green En ergy and Chemicals 
 General 
 Our pulp mills are large scale bio-refineries that, in addition to pulp, also produce surplus carbon neutral or green energy. As part of the pulp production process, our mills generate green energy using carbon neutral biofuels such as black liquor and wood waste in a cogeneration process. Through the incineration of biofuels in the recovery and power boilers, our mills produce sufficient steam to cover all of our steam requirements and allow us to produce surplus electricity which we sell to third-party utilities or into the regional electricity market. As a result, we have benefited from green energy legislation, incentives and commercialization that have developed over the last decades in Europe and Canada along with strong electricity prices. In addition, in recent years we have applied considerable resources to increasing our capacity to produce and sell chemicals, primarily tall oil for use in numerous applications including biofuels. 
 Our Friesau mill and Torgau facility also generate and sell green energy produced from their biomass cogeneration power plants. 
 Our surplus energy and chemical sales provide us with a stable revenue source unrelated to pulp or lumber prices. Since our energy and chemical production are by-products of our production processes, there are minimal incremental costs resulting in our surplus energy and chemical sales being highly profitable. We believe that this revenue source gives our mills a competitive advantage over other older mills which do not have the equipment or capacity to produce and/or sell surplus power and/or chemicals in a meaningful amount.

 Germany 
 Certain of our German mills have the option to sell their surplus electricity at special tariffs under the Renewable Energy Act. The special tariff for our Stendal mill is in effect until 2024, for our Friesau mill until 2029 and for our Torgau facility's four cogeneration power plants range from 2029 to 2034. 
 However, in 2022, as a result of higher energy prices resulting from the war in Ukraine, our German mills primarily sold energy at market prices. 
 In 2022, energy sales for our German mills were approximately 168.2 million or 694,124 MWh. 
 In connection with our focus on the growing bio-energy market, we sell tall oil, a by-product of our pulp production process which is used as both a chemical additive and as a green energy source. In 2022, we generated approximately 12.2 million from the sale of tall oil and other chemicals from our pulp segment. 
 Canada 
 Our Celgar mill is party to an electricity sales agreement with the provincial energy utility for a ten-year term that expires in October 2030. Pursuant to the agreement, the mill agreed to supply a maximum of approximately 127,000 MWh of surplus electrical energy annually to the utility. We are pursuing market sales and other strategic initiatives with respect to the remainder of the mill s surplus power. 
 Our Peace River mill sells its surplus electricity into the Alberta market at market prices. 
 In 2022, our Canadian mills sold approximately 167,178 MWh of renewable electricity for proceeds of approximately 25.0 million. 
 Producti on Costs 
 Our major costs of pulp production are fiber, labor, chemicals and energy. 
 Fiber 
 General 
 Fiber, comprised of wood chips and pulp logs, is our most significant operating expense for our pulp segment, representing about 50 of our pulp cash production costs in 2022. Further, fiber, in the form of sawlogs, represents about 75 of lumber cash production costs in 2022. 
 Given the significance of fiber to our total operating expenses and our limited ability to control its cost compared with our other operating costs, volatility in fiber costs can materially affect our margins and results of operations. 
 Our mills are situated in regions which generally provide a relatively stable supply of fiber. The fiber consumed by our pulp mills consists of wood chips produced by sawmills as a by-product of the sawmilling process and pulp logs. Wood chips are small pieces of wood used to make pulp and are either wood residuals from the sawmilling process or pulp logs chipped especially for this purpose. Pulp logs consist of lower quality logs not used in the production of lumber. 
 The Friesau mill and Torgau facility consume sawlogs and waste wood. The Mercer Mass Timber facility consumes lumber. Sawlogs, waste wood and lumber are all cyclical in both price and supply. 
 Generally, the cost of wood chips, pulp logs and sawlogs is primarily affected by the supply and demand for lumber. Additionally, regional factors including harvesting levels, weather conditions and insect infestations can also have a material effect on the supply, demand and price for fiber. 
 14 
 
 While fiber costs and supply are subject to cyclical changes, we generally expect that we will be able to continue to obtain an adequate supply of fiber on reasonably satisfactory terms for our mills due to their locations and our long-term relationships with suppliers. 
 During the past few years, certain customers have endeavored to purchase pulp that is produced using fiber that meets certain recognized wood certification requirements from forest certification agencies like the Forest Stewardship Council (FSC), the Programme for the Endorsement of Forest Certification (PEFC), the Sustainable Forestry Initiative (SFI) and the Canadian Standards Association (CSA). If the fiber we purchase does not meet certain wood certifications required by customers, it may make it more difficult to, or prevent us from, selling our pulp to such customers. The chain of custody wood certification process is a voluntary process which allows a company to demonstrate that they use forest resources in accordance with strict principles and standards in the areas of sustainable forest management practices and environmental management. In an effort to procure wood only from sustainably managed sources, we employ an FSC Chain of Custody protocol and PEFC certification, which requires tracking of fiber origins and preparing risk based assessments regarding the region and operator. In the areas where we operate, we are actively engaged in the further development of certification processes. However, there is competition among private certification systems along with efforts by supporters to further these systems by having customers of forest products require products to be certified to their preferred system. Such wood certification standards continue to evolve and are not consistent from jurisdiction to jurisdiction or in how they are interpreted and applied. We currently do not expect certification requirements to have a material adverse impact on our fiber procurement and sales. However, if sufficient marketplace demand requires wood raw materials to be sourced from standards that are inconsistent with those in our fiber supply regions, it could increase our operating costs and reduce available harvest levels. 
 Germany 
 With approximately 3.7 billion m 3 , Germany has the largest timber reserves in Europe. The principal species are spruce, pine, beech and oak. Many of the German forest areas have been certified according to PEFC or FSC standards. 
 We believe we are the largest consumer of wood chips and pulp logs in Germany and often provide the best long-term economic outlet for the sale of wood chips in Eastern Germany. We coordinate the wood procurement activities for our German mills to reduce overall personnel and administrative costs, provide greater purchasing power and coordinate buying and trading activities. This coordination and integration of fiber flows also allows us to optimize transportation costs, and the species and fiber mix for our mills. We are also party to joint wood purchasing arrangements with one of the largest wood consumers in Europe. 
 In 2022, our German pulp mills consumed an aggregate of approximately 4.7 million m 3 of fiber. Approximately 58 was in the form of pulp logs and approximately 42 was in the form of sawmill wood chips. 
 In 2022, our pulp segment per unit fiber costs in Germany increased compared to 2021, primarily as a result of stronger demand from other wood consumers, particularly heating pellet producers. 
 The core wood supply region for the Stendal mill includes most of Northeastern and Western Germany, primarily within an approximate 400 kilometer radius of the mill. We also purchase wood chips from Southwestern and Southern Germany as well as the Baltic Sea region. The fiber consumed by the Stendal mill consisted of approximately 67 spruce, 31 pine and 2 other species in 2022. The Stendal mill has sufficient chipping capacity to almost fully operate solely using pulp logs, if required. We source pulp logs from private and municipal forest owners and from state forest agencies. Our Stendal mill has historically also imported fiber from Poland and the Baltic Sea region. 
 Our Rosenthal mill sources wood chips from approximately 29 sawmills located primarily in the German states of Bavaria, Baden-W rttemberg and Thuringia and primarily within a 300 kilometer radius of the Rosenthal mill. Within this radius, the Rosenthal mill is the largest consumer of wood chips. Given its location and size, the Rosenthal mill is often the best economic outlet for the sale of wood chips in the area. In 2022, approximately 94 of the fiber consumed by the Rosenthal mill was spruce and the remainder was pine. Wood chips for the Rosenthal mill are normally sourced from sawmills under one-year contracts with quarterly adjustments for market pricing. Substantially all of our chip supply is sourced from suppliers with which we have long-standing relationships. Pulp logs are sourced from the state forest agencies in Thuringia, Saxony and Bavaria and from private and municipal forest owners. In addition, the Rosenthal mill buys relevant volumes via imports from the Czech Republic. 
 15 
 
 Our Friesau mill and Torgau facility are each dependent on the consistent supply of sawlog fiber. Wood fiber is the single largest input cost and accounts for about 75 of our cash costs of producing lumber in 2022. Our Friesau mill is located in an area where there is a significant amount of high-quality fiber within economic reach. The wood fiber requirements of the Friesau mill and Torgau facility are met primarily through open market purchases and contract purchases from state forestry agencies and private and municipal forest owners. 
 In Germany, over the last several years, the price and supply of wood chips has been affected from time to time by increasing demand from alternative or renewable energy producers and government initiatives for carbon neutral energy. In 2022, increasing energy prices as a result of energy supply shortages caused by the war in Ukraine increased the demand for wood chips and industrial logs for energy production. 
 Additionally, over the last few years until 2022, there was a material increase in the availability of harvestable wood as a result of beetle infestation of German forests. Generally, beetle-infested wood is harvested more rapidly so as to be useable before deterioration makes the wood unsuitable for its intended purposes. However, most of such beetle-infested wood has now been harvested and processed. 
 While such beetle-infested wood increased fiber supply and led to lower prices in the short-term, such increased harvest levels can lead to challenges in maintaining a sustainable harvest level over the long-term and can lead to periods of reduced harvest levels in the future. 
 North America 
 In 2022, our Celgar and Peace River mills consumed approximately 4.3 million m 3 of fiber. Approximately 47 of such fiber was in the form of sawmill wood chips and the remaining 53 came from pulp logs processed through their woodrooms or chipped by a third-party. Our Canadian mills woodrooms are able to process about 21 of their fiber needs. The source of fiber at the mill is characterized by a mixture of species (aspen, spruce, pine, hemlock, douglas fir and cedar) and the mills source fiber from a number of Canadian and U.S. suppliers. 
 In British Columbia, a combination of high harvesting rates during a past beetle endemic, subsequent governmental initiatives to reduce harvest levels and weaker lumber prices in 2022 resulted in lower sawlog availability and sawmill activity. This resulted in lower wood chip availability which increased fiber costs in British Columbia. In 2022, our Canadian pulp mills per unit fiber costs increased compared to 2021, due to strong demand in the mills' fiber baskets and for the Celgar mill in the second half of 2022 fiber supply was negatively impacted by regional sawmill curtailments. 
 The availability of fiber for our mills is in large part influenced by the strength of the lumber market. Lumber markets are primarily driven by U.S. housing starts, home renovation activities and, to a lesser degree, demand from China. 
 In 2022, our Canadian mills had access to approximately 30 different chip suppliers, most of whom are in Canada and, in the case of the Celgar mill, are also in the United States. Chips are purchased in Canada and the United States in accordance with chip purchase agreements. Generally, pricing is reviewed and adjusted periodically to reflect market conditions. The contracts for the Celgar mill are generally for one year with quarterly adjustments or on three-month terms. The chip contracts for Peace River are generally for three to five years with monthly adjustments indexed to the average pulp price. 
 To secure the volume of pulp logs required by its woodroom and field chippers, the Celgar mill has entered into pulp log supply agreements. Such agreements can range from three-month to one-year terms, with a number of different suppliers, many of whom are also contract chip suppliers for the mill. All of the pulp log agreements can be terminated by either party for any reason, upon seven days written notice. The Celgar mill also bids on British Columbia timber sales from time to time. 
 Peace River holds two 20-year renewable governmental forest management agreements and three deciduous timber allocations in Alberta with an aggregate allowable annual cut of approximately 2.9 million m 3 of hardwood, of which it currently harvests approximately 44 , and 375,000 m 3 of softwood, which it sells or trades to sawmills surrounding the Peace River mill in exchange for wood chips. The forest management agreements were last renewed for a 20-year term expiring in 2029. While our Peace River mill can satisfy all of its hardwood fiber requirements from its forest management agreements and timber allocations, in order to optimize its fiber flow, it satisfies a small portion of its 
 16 
 
 needs from third-party owned timberlands. Softwood fiber supply is from residual sawmill chips from local surrounding sawmills. 
 Mercer Mass Timber primarily sources lumber through open market purchases or short-term contracts with regional producers in the U.S. Pacific Northwest, Western Canada and the U.S. South. 
 Labor 
 Our labor costs have increased over time due to inflation in wages and health care costs. 
 Energy 
 Our energy is primarily generated from renewable carbon neutral sources, such as black liquor and wood waste. Our mills produce all of our electrical energy requirements and generate excess energy which we sell to third-party utilities and to regional markets. We utilize fossil fuels, such as natural gas, primarily in our lime kilns and we use a limited amount for start-up and shut-down operations. Additionally, from time to time, mill process disruptions occur and we consume small quantities of purchased electricity and fossil fuels to maintain operations. As a result, all of our mills are subject to fluctuations in the prices for fossil fuels. 
 Chemicals 
 Our pulp mills use certain chemicals which are generally available from several suppliers and sourcing is primarily based upon pricing and location. Our chemical costs have increased in recent years. 
 Sales, Marketing and Distribution 
 Our global sales and marketing group is responsible for conducting all sales and marketing of the pulp produced at our mills and currently has approximately 20 employees. This group largely handles all European and North American sales directly. Sales to Asia are made directly or through commission agents overseen by our sales group. The global sales and marketing group handles sales to over 260 customers. We coordinate and integrate the sales and marketing activities of our German mills to realize on a number of synergies between them. These include reduced overall administrative and personnel costs and coordinated selling, marketing and transportation activities. We also coordinate pulp sales across our mills on a global basis, thereby providing our larger customers with seamless service across all major geographies. In marketing our pulp, we seek to establish long-term relationships by providing a competitively priced, high-quality, consistent product and excellent service. In accordance with customary practice, we maintain long-standing relationships with our customers, pursuant to which we periodically reach agreements on specific volumes and prices. 
 Our solid wood segment sales are handled by our sales teams in Germany and Vancouver. We also sell lumber through commissioned agents in certain markets.

 The following charts set out the geographic distribution of our solid wood segment revenues as a percentage of our total solid wood segment revenues for the periods indicated: 
 
 Our pulp segment and solid wood segment sales are on customary industry terms. As of December 31, 2022, we had no material payment delinquencies. In 2022 and 2021, no customer accounted for 10 or more of our revenues. We do not believe our pulp segment or solid wood segment sales are dependent upon the activities of any single customer and the loss of any single customer would not have a material adverse effect on us. 
 Transpor tation 
 We transport our pulp and solid wood products generally by rail, ocean carrier and truck through third-party carriers. We have a small fleet of trucks in Germany that deliver some of our German mills pulp. In Germany, we also lease a significant number of railcars - both for inbound transport of fiber and outbound shipping of products. 
 Our German pulp mills are currently the only market kraft pulp producers in Germany, which is the largest import market for kraft pulp in Europe. We therefore have a competitive transportation cost advantage compared to Canadian and Northern European pulp producers when shipping to customers in Europe. Due to the location of our German mills, we are able to deliver pulp to many of our customers primarily by rail and truck. 
 Our Canadian mills pulp is transported to customers by truck, rail and ocean carrier through third-party carriers. The majority of our Canadian mills pulp for overseas markets is initially delivered primarily by rail to the Port of Vancouver for shipment overseas by ocean carrier. Based in Western Canada, our Canadian mills are well positioned to service Asian customers. The majority of our Canadian mills pulp for domestic markets is shipped by rail directly to the customer or to third-party warehouses in the United States. We also operate a logistics and reload center near Trail, British Columbia to provide us with additional warehouse space and greater transportation flexibility in terms of access to rail and trucking options. 
 The Friesau mill s lumber is transported to customers by rail, ocean carrier and truck through third-party carriers. 
 The Torgau and Mercer Mass Timber facilities products are primarily transported by truck. 
 In both 2022 and 2021, outbound transportation costs comprised approximately 12 of our total consolidated costs and expenses. 
 Capital Exp enditures 
 We have continued to make capital investments designed to increase pulp, green energy and chemical production, reduce costs and improve efficiency and environmental performance at our pulp mills. The improvements made over 
 19 
 
 the years have increased the competitive position of our pulp segment. Since its acquisition, we have also made capital investments to optimize sawmill production at the Friesau mill.

In our pulp segment, capital investments at the Stendal mill in 2022 primarily related to capacity expansion projects, initial costs to rebuild the wood chip conveying systems that were damaged by fire and maintenance projects. In 2021, they primarily related to capacity expansion projects. 
 Capital investments at our Rosenthal mill in 2022 primarily related to the construction of a lignin production and research and development plant and maintenance projects. In 2021, they primarily related to wastewater improvement and maintenance projects. 
 Capital investments at the Celgar mill in 2022 and 2021 primarily related to woodroom upgrades and maintenance projects. 
 Capital investments at the Peace River mill in 2022 primarily related to woodroom upgrades. In 2021, they primarily related to the recovery boiler rebuild which was financed by insurance proceeds, of which 21.5 million was received in 2021, and upgrades to the woodroom. 
 In our solid wood segment, in 2022, we completed the majority of the Friesau mill's sorter line upgrades and other production improvement and maintenance projects. In 2021, they were related to expansion and optimization projects at the Friesau mill to, among other things, increase annual lumber production and improve production grading capabilities. 
 Qualifying capital investments at industrial facilities in Germany that reduce pollutants in the effluent discharge can be used to offset wastewater fees that would otherwise be required to be paid. For more information about our environmental capital expenditures, see Environmental . 
 In 2023, excluding amounts being financed through government grants and expected insurance proceeds, we currently expect our total capital expenditures to be approximately 175.0 million to 200.0 million. 
 In 2023, we currently expect our capital expenditures in our pulp segment to be principally comprised of completing the upgrades to the woodrooms at our Canadian mills, completion of the lignin production and research and development plant at the Rosenthal mill and completion of the replacement of the fire damaged wood chip conveying system at the Stendal mill. 
 In 2023, we currently expect capital expenditures in our solid wood segment to be strategic projects at the Torgau mill to realize on the acquisition synergies, projects to expand the product offerings, increase production and lower costs at the Mercer Mass Timber facility and further upgrades to our Friesau mill including improvements to the sorter lines and an additional kiln. 
 20 
 
 Innova tion 
 We utilize our expertise with wood, its processing and by-products to expand our product mix. As a result, we seek to develop new products based on our expertise in wood processing and working with derivatives of the kraft pulping process. Currently these processes are focused on: 
 the production and sale of CLT and other value-added wood products like finger joint products at our Mercer Mass Timber facility; 

the further refinement of materials contained in black liquor, the extractive chemical and lignin containing compounds that are a result of the kraft pulping process; 

the further refinement of cellulose materials that are currently the basis of pulp; and 

higher use products that may be derived from wood and plant processing and harvesting including oils from sandalwood trees and plants. 

We are working on some of these initiatives on our own, with others and in conjunction with industry associations or joint venture partners. We are also researching potential higher use products that may be derived from processing different species of trees and plants. 
 In an effort to further grow our chemical sales and bring additional value to our by-product stream, we are investing in a pilot lignin plant at our Rosenthal mill. This plant will allow us to research the commercial opportunities of this product. Lignin has many potential uses in the manufacture of green alternative products such as adhesives and carbon black. 
 Environ mental 
 Our operations are subject to a wide range of environmental laws and regulations, dealing primarily with: 
 air, water and land; 

solid and hazardous waste management; 

waste disposal; 

remediation and contaminated sites; and 

chemical usage. 

Compliance with these laws and regulations generally involves capital expenditures as well as additional operating costs. We cannot easily quantify the future amounts of capital expenditures we might have to make to comply with these laws and regulations or the effects on our operating costs because in some instances compliance standards have not been developed, have not become final or definitive or may be amended in the future. In addition, it is difficult to isolate the environmental component of most manufacturing capital projects. 
 We devote significant management and financial resources to comply with all applicable environmental laws and regulations. In particular, the operation of our plants is subject to permits, authorizations and approvals and we must comply with prescribed emission limits. Compliance with these requirements is monitored by local authorities and non-compliance may result in administrative orders, fines or closures of the non-compliant mill. Our total capital expenditures on environmental projects at our mills were approximately 4.8 million in 2022 and approximately 8.4 million in 2021. In 2023, capital expenditures for environmental projects are expected to be approximately 13.8 million. 
 Environmental responsibility is a priority for our operations. To ensure compliance with environmental laws and regulations, we regularly monitor emissions at our mills and periodically perform environmental audits of operational sites and procedures both with our internal personnel and outside consultants. These audits identify opportunities for improvement and allow us to take proactive measures at the mills as considered appropriate. 
 21 
 
 We believe we have obtained all required environmental permits, authorizations and approvals for our operations. We believe our operations are currently in material compliance with the requirements of all applicable environmental laws and regulations and our respective operating permits. 
 Under German state environmental rules relating to effluent discharges, industrial users are required to pay wastewater fees based upon the amount of pollutants they discharge in their effluent. These rules also provide that an industrial user who undertakes environmental capital expenditures and lowers certain effluent pollutants to prescribed levels may offset the amount of these expenditures against the wastewater fees that they would otherwise be required to pay. We expect capital investment programs and other environmental initiatives at our German mills will offset the wastewater fees that are payable if we demonstrate the reduced wastewater emissions and we believe they will ensure that our operations continue in substantial compliance with prescribed standards. 
 In Canada, in addition to existing provincial air quality regulations, an air quality management system, referred to as AQMS , outlines a comprehensive national approach for improving air quality in Canada. Under the AQMS, all levels of government are to work collaboratively to respond to different air quality challenges across the country. The AQMS includes four elements: 
 Canadian Ambient Air Quality Standards (CAAQS), meant to drive local air quality improvements. They provide the basis for provincial territorial governments to determine the level of action needed. 

A framework for regional and local air quality management through air zones and regional airsheds. 

Base-level Industrial Emissions Requirements (BLIERs) for certain major industries. 

Improved intergovernmental collaboration to reduce emissions from the transportation sector. 

In 2016, Environment Canada released the Pan-Canadian Framework on Clean Growth and Climate Change. The framework put in place a national, sector-based greenhouse gas reduction program applicable to a number of industries. In addition, the various provincial governments, including British Columbia and Alberta, have introduced legislation with the intention of reducing greenhouse gas emissions. 
 British Columbia has, for example, introduced a carbon tax and low-carbon fuel standards. British Columbia has also implemented performance standards, such as greenhouse gas emissions benchmarks for select industrial facilities and sectors, and new greenhouse gas emissions reporting regulations for certain industrial operations. British Columbia has also established greenhouse gas emissions offset projects. 
 In 2019, the Canadian federal government began phasing in a federal carbon tax pricing system in provinces and territories without a provincial carbon tax program that meets the minimum national stringency requirements. The federal carbon tax pricing system has two parts: a regulatory charge on fossil fuels like gasoline and natural gas (the fuel charge and a performance-based system for industries (the OBPS ). As of January 1, 2023, the federal fuel charge applies to Ontario, Manitoba, Saskatchewan and Alberta, as well as the territories of Nunavut and the Yukon, while the OBPS applies to Manitoba and Prince Edward Island, as well as the territories of Nunavut and the Yukon. 
 We believe that these water and air emission measures in Germany and Canada have not had, and in 2023 will not have, a significant effect on our operations. Although these measures could have a material adverse effect on our operations in the future, we expect that we will not be disproportionately affected by these measures as compared with owners of comparable operations. We also expect that these measures will not significantly disrupt our planned operations. 
 Future regulations or permits may place lower limits on allowable types of emissions, including air, water, waste and hazardous materials, and may increase the financial consequences of maintaining compliance with environmental laws and regulations or conducting remediation. Our ongoing monitoring and policies have enabled us to develop and implement effective measures to maintain emissions in substantial compliance with environmental laws and regulations to date in a cost-effective manner. However, there can be no assurance that this will be the case in the future.

 Climate Change 
 Changing weather patterns and climatic conditions due to natural and man-made causes have added to the unpredictability and frequency of natural disasters, such as hurricanes, wildfires and wind, rain, hail, snow and ice storms. Such changes and resulting conditions can adversely affect our operations, including as a result of variations in the cost and availability of raw materials, such as fiber, unplanned downtime, changes in operating rates and disruptions in transportation and logistics. 
 As there is uncertainty about the severity, extent and speed at which climate change is occurring, we are unable to identify and predict all of the consequences of climate change and the timing of the same on our business and operations. 
 The actual and perceived effects of climate change and social and governmental responses have created both opportunities and negative consequences for our business. 
 The focus on climate change has generated a substantial increase in demand and in legislative requirements for carbon neutral or green energy. Pulp mills consume wood residuals, being wood chips and pulp logs, as the base raw material for their production process. Wood chips are residuals left over from lumber production and pulp logs are generally lower quality logs left over from logging that are unsuitable for the production of lumber. Sawmills consume sawlogs and residuals, like wood chips, are generally sold to other industrial consumers like pulp and pellet producers. 
 As part of their production process, our pulp mills take wood residuals and process them through a digester where cellulose is separated from the wood to be used in pulp production and the remaining residuals, called black liquor, are used for green energy production. As a result of their use of wood residuals and because our mills generate combined heat and power in a process known as cogeneration, they are efficient producers of energy. Our Friesau mill and Torgau facility utilize residual bark and shavings from consumed logs to produce energy. This energy is carbon neutral and produced from a renewable source. Our relatively modern mills generate a substantial amount of energy that is surplus to their operational requirements. 
 These factors, along with governmental initiatives in respect of renewable or green energy legislation, have provided business opportunities for us to enhance our generation and sales of green energy to regional utilities. 
 We are constantly exploring other initiatives to enhance our generation and sales of surplus green energy and chemical by-products. Other potential opportunities that may result from climate change include: 
 greater demand for sustainable energy and cellulosic biomass fuels; 

the expansion of softwood forests and increased growth rates for such forests; 

more intensive forestry practices and timber salvaging versus harvesting standing timber; 

additional governmental incentives or requirements to enhance biomass energy production; and 

additional social or investor focus or demand for biomass, green energy or sustainability initiatives. 

Additionally, increased focus on climate change at the governmental level has generally led to increased demand in alternative building solutions such as CLT. 
 Historically, the principal driver behind reducing the effects of climate change and moving to a carbon neutral economy primarily resulted from initiatives from governmental or international bodies, including the United Nations and international treaties amongst various countries. However, over the last few years, there has been a significant push and focus on climate change and carbon reduction by private institutions including, among others, institutional investors, ratings agencies, shareholders, communities, other stakeholders and the public generally. This has resulted in, among other things, a significant amount of capital being provided for green or carbon neutral initiatives, on favorable terms, some of which are referred to as green bonds . The demand for renewable energy services has recently been further increased as a result of the war in Ukraine. 
 We cannot currently predict which, if any, of these potential opportunities will be realized by us or their economic effect on our business. 
 23 
 
 While not all of the specific consequences to our business from climate change are predictable, one of the most significant adverse consequences is that the focus on renewable energy has created greater demand and competition for wood residuals or fiber from renewable energy producers like the pellet industry in Germany. 
 In Europe, the price and supply of wood residuals has been periodically affected by an increasing demand from alternative or renewable energy producers and governmental initiatives for carbon neutral energy. In 2022, in particular there was increasing demand for wood residuals and lower quality industrial logs from energy and heating pellet manufacturers as a result of energy shortages caused by the war in Ukraine. 
 Additionally, the growing interest and focus in British Columbia on renewable green energy has created additional competition for such fiber. Such additional demand for wood residuals may increase the competition and prices for wood residuals used by our mills over time. 
 In response to climate change risks, there have been governmental initiatives and legislation on the international, national, state and local levels. Such governmental action or legislation can have an important effect on the demand and prices for fiber. As governments pursue green energy initiatives, they risk creating incentives and demand for wood residuals from renewable energy producers that cannibalizes or adversely affects traditional users, such as lumber and pulp and paper producers. We are continually engaged in dialogue with governments to educate and try to ensure potential initiatives recognize the traditional and continuing role of our mills in the overall usage of forestry resources and the economies of local communities. 
 Other potential negative consequences from climate change that can affect our business include: 
 a greater susceptibility of northern forests to disease, fire and insect infestation; 

the disruption of transportation systems and power supply lines due to more severe storms; 

the loss of fresh water transportation for logs and pulp due to lower water levels; 

decreases in the quantity and quality of processed water for our mill operations; 

the loss of northern forests in areas in sufficient proximity to our mills to competitively acquire fiber; and 

lower harvest levels decreasing the supply of harvestable timber and, as a consequence, wood residuals. 

Well-publicized events have been attributed at least in part to climate change, including a beetle infestation that has damaged significant amounts of forest lands and harvestable timber in Western Canada and more recently over the last few years in Germany. Beetle infestation of forest lands has both short-term and long-term consequences for our business. In the short-term, there is often a material increase in harvest levels of infested forests as parties seek to utilize such wood before it deteriorates too much to be useable for its intended purposes. As a result, there can be a material increase in fiber availability and lower fiber prices resulting both from such increased supply and the lower quality of such infested fiber. Over the last few years until 2022, our German mills benefited from such lower fiber prices. However, infestation and increased harvest levels resulting therefrom can create over-harvesting and challenges for maintaining sustainable harvest levels over the long-term and can result in lower harvest levels in future periods. 
 Changes in climate conditions have also been attributed at least in part to increasingly frequent and severe wildfires in the interior of Western Canada and portions of the Western United States and Europe. We cannot currently predict whether such climate-affected conditions will continue, or the frequency or severity of the same in the future. 
 Human C apital 
 We believe the strength of our workforce is one of the significant contributors to our success as a global company. All our employees contribute to our success and help us drive strong financial performance. Attracting, developing and retaining global talent with the right skills to drive our business is central to our purpose, mission and long-term growth strategy. 
 24 
 
 As of December 31, 2022, we employ approximately 3,320 people, of which approximately 2,315 of whom work in our German operations, approximately 910 of whom work in our Canadian operations and approximately 60 work in our U.S. operations. Our pulp segment employs approximately 1,806 people and our solid wood segment employs approximately 1,429 people. The majority of our employees in both segments are bound by collective agreements. We consider the relationships with our employees and the unions and works councils which represent them, to be good. Collaborative labor management relations are fundamental to our operations. Accordingly, we recognize and work cooperatively with the unions and works councils to ensure we build and maintain superior working conditions, a supportive work environment, training and growth opportunities and fair compensation and benefits packages. 
 We employ a collaborative group of skilled, dedicated, resourceful and innovative individuals who support our core purpose and reflect our values every day. Investment in our people drives our excellence and accordingly, we are committed to attracting, retaining and developing quality personnel. By the nature of the industries in which we operate, many of our employees are professionals who require specialized knowledge and skills and include various categories of engineers and licensed trade persons and equipment operators. Our senior managers and directors have extensive experience in the forest products industry, and we have experienced managers at all of our mills. Our management has a proven track record of implementing new initiatives and capital projects in order to increase production and efficiency, reduce costs and harness new revenue opportunities. 
 We aim to support our employees with a competitive compensation package, fulfilling career opportunities and a balanced and secure future accompanied by time away from work. All of our employees are provided competitive benefits packages that provide pension, medical, dental, and vision care benefits. Employees are also able to access specialized assistance such as physiotherapy and counselling services. We provide a diversity of training activities and programs to help our people grow and be more effective in their current and future roles. 
 We conduct confidential engagement surveys of our workforce that are administered and analyzed by an independent third party. Aggregate survey results are reviewed by executive officers and the board of directors. We create action plans at global, operational and managerial levels. By acting on results both at an aggregate enterprise level and an operational level, we believe we have been able to enhance our culture and improve our overall engagement. 
 Maintaining a robust pipeline of talent is crucial to our ongoing success and is a key aspect of succession planning efforts across the organization. Our leadership and human resources teams are responsible for attracting and retaining top talent by facilitating an environment where employees feel supported and encouraged in their professional and personal development. Specifically, we promote employee development by reviewing strategic positions regularly and identifying potential internal candidates to fill those roles, evaluating job skill sets to identify competency gaps and creating developmental plans to facilitate employee professional growth. We invest in our employees through training and development programs, on the job experiences and coaching. We provide technical and leadership programs across the organization that enable colleagues to grow skills and capabilities to become more successful. We also have dedicated talent programs that support and accelerate leadership development and strengthen our succession plans. Additionally, we understand the importance of maintaining competitive compensation, benefits and appropriate training that provides growth, developmental opportunities and multiple career paths for our employees. 
 Health and Safety 
 Safety is a core value of our company. The industries in which we operate have their own particular set of risks including hazards from our complex industrial manufacturing facilities such as manufacturing processes, mobile equipment, heavy and complex equipment, high pressure boilers, energy production, and the use and recovery of chemicals. Accordingly, there is no initiative that attracts a higher degree of focus for our management team than our Road to Zero health and safety program, which is a company-wide initiative designed to create healthy, safe and productive work environments with a goal of zero workplace incidents. 
 We have developed tools to analyze potential and incurred incidents and we have resources to develop prevention initiatives. In particular, we focus on modelling responses to eliminate the risk, where possible, by using the hierarchy of controls adopted by many of the world s leading health and safety organizations. Our priority is the elimination of hazards, followed by safe administrative practices and appropriate personal protective equipment. We identify, monitor, educate, and take a data-driven approach to drive workplace safety improvements. Many of our programs revolve around education, hazard identification, and risk mitigation strategies. These proactive initiatives bring safety to the forefront of our work practices. Our teams of safety professionals are dedicated to finding and utilizing the right 
 25 
 
 tools to prevent all workplace injuries. The Senior Safety Leadership Committee, referred to as the SSLC , provides governance and high level support to the programs. The SSLC meets on a regular basis to review performance, learn from experience and share best practices. Our team of safety professionals are dedicated to supporting line management and embedded safety committees who lead safety on a daily basis. We analyze all incidents carefully and adjust our prevention efforts accordingly. 
 We closely monitored the health and safety issues related to the COVID-19 pandemic. In 2022, many governments reduced restrictions and response measures to the pandemic. We continue to take precautionary measures to reduce the potential for transmission amongst our personnel. 
 Diversity, Equity and Inclusion 
 We believe that a culture of diversity and inclusion is critical in making the best decisions for our people and achieving sustainable business success. While gender is only one aspect under diversity, a number of our top management positions were and continue to be held by women. We continue to effect changes to our recruiting and training processes to make our workplaces even more reflective of the diversity that exists in our communities. We believe that making our workplace more equal and inclusive will make us a stronger, more resilient and more sustainable business over the long-term. 
 We have adopted an enterprise wide diversity management program. Its goal is to respond to the particular conditions at each of our operations to develop diversity within our teams. One of the first objectives of the program has been to enhance equal opportunities for women in our business. This is a key goal, not just to improve diversity but also to address demographic changes and potential shortages of skilled workers in the future by inspiring more women to take up technical positions in our industry. 
 Currently, women comprise 30 of our board of directors, about 25 of our 100 senior management positions and about 18 of our total workforce. Our goal is to improve our recruitment of women so that they comprise 30 of our new hires by 2030. 
 In Canada, our operations work closely and partner with regional First Nations groups to foster mutually-beneficial economic activities and beneficial relationships. We are party to a logging joint venture with one First Nations group and are working to expand the scope and size of the business and to include other regional groups. We are also pursuing additional joint business or venture opportunities with First Nations groups. Additionally, we have programs to provide training and job skills to regional First Nations groups. 
 We have an extensive apprenticeship program and outreach events for prospective employees. We believe that these programs and events, among other things, help us to reach out and attract new employees, including more female employees who perhaps in the past had not considered technical or operating employment opportunities at our mills or the forest products industry generally. 
 We have partnered with a global management consulting company that works to create Change that Matters . Their long-standing commitment to advancing gender parity, diversity, and inclusion in business aligns with our values and goals. We are working together to create a custom strategy to assist us in becoming the employer of choice, both locally and globally, for future employees. 
 We do not employ nor do we contract with any parties that employ people who are subjected to unsafe conditions. The vast majority of our employees are part of a union or are represented by a works council with whom we have worked to design conditions that are safe from harassment and discrimination. In addition, as a supportive workplace, we do our best to accommodate the distinct circumstances of our employees that may require modified workplaces. We have also adopted a written Code of Business Conduct and Ethics and other corporate policies to support a corporate culture which, among other things, promotes a work environment that prohibits intimidation and harassment and encourages and promotes diversity and inclusion. 
 26 
 
 Community I nvolvement 
 We make donations to community groups and charitable organizations in the communities in which we operate and live. We believe this commitment and engagement with local communities helps us to attract and retain employees and enhances our social license in such communities. 
 Commitment to S ustainability 
 We manage and operate our business, including the natural resources under our care or direction, with a long-term view and focus on sustainability. We believe by doing so we will be able to deliver value to our customers, employees, shareholders, communities and other stakeholders. We strive to maintain the highest environmental, social and governance standards. We believe that by caring for the health and safety of our workers, maintaining the environmental quality of our operations and being part of and actively engaged in the communities in which we operate we enhance the value for all of our various stakeholders and our social license to operate. We work to build all of these values and goals into our corporate culture or what we refer to as the Mercer Way . We believe that focusing on sustainability as a key driver in all of our operations and business will enhance our decision-making, our business and our relationships with our various stakeholders and communities in which we operate. We believe all of the foregoing elements are inter-connected and are vital to our long-term future, success and sustainability. 
 We focus significant attention on minimizing our environmental impact with the goal of reducing the environmental footprint of our existing operations to make them sustainable over the long-term, to ensure we have a social license to operate and to offset or reduce the impact of our operations. We endeavor to adapt to emerging trends, support new technologies and foster environmental stewardship in the areas in which we operate. We are signatory to the UN Global Compact that helps align our endeavors with the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals and other key environmental standards in the areas of low carbon transition, water stewardship, waste, forestry, air emissions, recycling, sourcing and biodiversity. 
 As part of our commitment and focus on sustainability, we have, among other things: 
 increased our focus on sustainability including improved management, goal setting and recording capabilities that will be communicated with stakeholders to ensure proper acknowledgment of our sustainability accomplishments and initiatives; 

conducted a thorough materiality assessment to further understand both the topics that are important for our stakeholders as well as those material to our business; 

validated our greenhouse gas reduction targets with the Science Based Target Initiative to support our climate change ambition in line with a trajectory well-below a 2 degrees Celsius increase for earth; 

conducted our second climate change scenario analysis to evaluate the risks and opportunities of climate change as part of our adoption of the Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosure recommendations. In doing so, we partnered with a global non-profit organization focused on sustainability to develop a series of climate change scenarios for 2030. The models were developed by the Network for Greening the Financial System with extensive input from the climate community, and augmented with industry trends and climate projections. The scenarios were then analyzed and used to identify and assess the potential impacts of climate change-related risks and opportunities on the Company. As a result of this process, we identified three areas of our strategy that may incur risks and opportunities across the scenarios: (i) shifting market demand; (ii) wood and fiber supply; and (iii) supply chain resilience. Further information on the key parameters and assumptions used to develop the various models is available on our website; 

conducted a biodiversity workshop with our global team to understand how we impact and depend on nature and our management practices to manage these biodiversity risks as part of our commitment to report using the Task Force on Nature-related Financial Disclosure recommendations; 

entered into the New German Facility which is sustainability linked whereby the interest rate margin is subject to upward or downward adjustments of up to 0.05 per annum based upon meeting certain specified sustainability targets; 

27 
 
 published our inaugural sustainability report; 

enhanced our environmental tracking, measuring and reporting system for both water and air parameters at all of our facilities; and 

spent considerable time with our stakeholders including governments and First Nations to expand our relationships in all areas of our business.

 ITEM 1A. RI SK FACTORS 
 The statements in this Risk Factors section describe material risks to our business and should be considered carefully. You should review carefully the risk factors listed below, as well as those factors listed in other documents we file with the SEC. In addition, these statements constitute our cautionary statements under the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 . Our disclosure and analysis in this annual report on Form 10-K and in our annual report to shareholders contain some forward-looking statements that set forth anticipated results based on management's current plans and assumptions. If any of the risks and uncertainties described in the cautionary factors described below actually occur or continue to occur, our business, financial condition and results of operations and the trading price of our common stock could be materially and adversely affected. Moreover, the risks below are not the only risks we face and additional risks not currently known to us or that we presently deem immaterial may emerge or become material at any time and may negatively impact our business, reputation, financial condition, results of operations or the trading price of our common stock. 
 Risks Rela ted to our Business 
 Our business is highly cyclical in nature. 
 The forest products industry is highly cyclical in nature and markets are characterized by periods of supply and demand imbalance, which in turn can cause material fluctuations in prices. The markets for our principal products, being pulp and lumber, are sensitive to cyclical changes in the global economy, industry capacity and foreign exchange rates, all of which can have a significant influence on selling prices and our operating results. The length and magnitude of industry cycles have varied over time but generally reflect changes in macro-economic conditions and levels of industry capacity. Pulp and lumber are commodities that are generally available from other producers. Because commodity products have few distinguishing qualities from producer to producer, competition is generally based upon price, which is generally determined by supply relative to demand. 
 Industry capacity can fluctuate as changing industry conditions can influence producers to idle production capacity or permanently close mills. In addition, to avoid substantial cash costs in idling or closing a mill, some producers will choose to operate at a loss, sometimes even a cash loss, which can prolong weak pricing environments due to oversupply. Oversupply of our products can also result from producers introducing new capacity in response to favorable pricing trends. Certain integrated pulp and paper producers have the ability to discontinue paper production by idling their paper machines and selling their pulp production on the market, if market conditions, prices and trends warrant such actions. 
 Currently, we are aware of 2.7 million ADMTs of announced net pulp production capacity increases, primarily of hardwood kraft pulp in 2023. However, we cannot predict whether new capacity will be announced or will come online in the future. If any new capacity, particularly for NBSK pulp, is not absorbed in the market or offset by curtailments or closures of older, high-cost pulp mills, the increase could put downward pressure on pulp prices and materially adversely affect our results of operations, margin and profitability. Additionally, while NBHK pulp is not 
 30 
 
 a direct competitor to NBSK pulp, if any future increases in pulp supply are not absorbed by demand growth, such supply could put downward pressure on NBSK pulp prices as well. 
 Demand for each of pulp and lumber has historically been determined primarily by general global macro-economic conditions and has been closely tied to overall business activity. Both pulp and lumber prices have been and are likely to continue to be volatile and can fluctuate widely over time. Demand for CLT products is primarily driven by commercial and industrial construction demand and customers desire to take advantage of the characteristics and environmental attributes of CLT products. 
 A pulp producer's actual sales realizations are third party industry quoted list prices net of customer discounts, rebates and other selling concessions. Our sales realizations may also be affected by price movements between the order and shipment dates. 
 Global pulp and lumber markets have historically been characterized by considerable swings in prices which have and will result in variability in our earnings. Prices for pulp and lumber are driven by many factors outside our control. We have little influence over the timing and extent of price changes. Because market conditions beyond our control determine the prices for pulp and lumber, prices may fall below our cash production costs, requiring us to either incur short-term losses on product sales or reduce or cease production at one or more of our mills. Therefore, our profitability depends on managing our cost structure, particularly raw materials which represent a significant component of our operating costs and can fluctuate based upon factors beyond our control. If the prices of our products decline, or if prices for our raw materials increase, or both, our results of operations and cash flows could be materially adversely affected. 
 Cyclical fluctuations in the price and supply of our raw materials, particularly fiber, could adversely affect our business. 
 Our main raw material is fiber in the form of wood chips, pulp logs and sawlogs. Fiber represented approximately 50 of our pulp cash production costs and approximately 75 of our lumber cash production costs in 2022. Fiber is a commodity and both prices and supply are cyclical. Fiber pricing is subject to regional market influences and our costs of fiber may increase in a region as a result of local market shifts. The cost of wood chips, pulp logs and sawlogs is primarily affected by the supply and demand for lumber. Demand for these raw materials is generally determined by the volume of pulp and paper products and solid wood products produced globally and regionally. 
 Governmental regulations related to the environment, forest stewardship and green or renewable energy can also affect the supply of fiber. In Europe, governmental initiatives to increase the supply of renewable energy have led to more renewable energy projects, including in Germany. Demand for wood residuals from such energy producers has generally put upward pressure on prices for wood residuals. In addition, the reduction in natural gas supply and increase in energy prices in Germany resulting from the Ukraine war has also increased both the demand and prices for wood chips and residuals. This has resulted in higher per unit fiber costs for our German mills. 
 Strong lumber markets in North America and particularly in the United States resulting from a recovery in U.S. housing starts and a robust home renovations market over the last few years resulted in increased sawmilling activity. This increased the supply of wood chips which are generally a lower cost than pulp logs. However, the lumber industry is highly cyclical and the slowdown in sawmilling activities in the last fiscal year has reduced the availability of both wood chips and pulp logs and put upward pressure on fiber costs. There is no assurance that sawmill activity will stabilize or not decline further or that fiber prices will not increase in the future. 
 Since 2016 and the expiry of a softwood lumber trade agreement, the United States and Canada have renewed a long standing trade dispute regarding lumber exports from Canada to the United States. In November 2016, a petition was filed by a coalition of U.S. lumber producers to the U.S. Department of Commerce and the U.S. International Trade Commission requesting an investigation into alleged subsidies provided to Canadian lumber producers. Since then, the U.S. Department of Commerce announced various countervailing and anti-dumping duty rates on Canadian softwood lumber and the United States and Canada have engaged in proceedings under the North American Free Trade Agreement and through the World Trade Organization. In August 2022, the U.S. Department of Commerce announced the results of its third administrative review, lowering the countervailing duty to 3.83 and the anti-dumping rate to 4.76 , for combined final duty rates of 8.59 for all other Canadian lumber producers. In January 2023, the U.S. Department of Commerce released the preliminary results of its fourth administrative review which 
 31 
 
 indicated a further marginal reduction in the duty rate for all other Canadian lumber producers. It is uncertain when or if the United States and Canada may settle a new agreement and what terms or restrictions it may contain. Duties or other restrictions imposed on Canadian softwood lumber exports by the United States can negatively impact Canadian sawmill production in our Canadian pulp mills' supply area and result in reduced availability and increased costs for wood chips for our Canadian mills. While we believe this may be partially offset by increased wood chip supply from U.S. sawmills and pulp log availability, we cannot currently predict the effect on our Canadian mills' overall fiber costs. 
 Availability of fiber may be further limited by adverse responses to and prevention of wildfires, weather, insect infestation, disease, ice storms, wind storms, flooding and other natural causes. In addition, the quantity, quality and price of fiber we receive could be affected by man-made causes such as those resulting from industrial disputes, material curtailments or shut-down of operations by suppliers, government orders and legislation (including new taxes or tariffs). Any or a combination of these can affect fiber prices in a region. 
 The cyclical nature of pricing for fiber represents a potential risk to our profit margins if pulp and lumber producers are unable to pass along price increases to their customers or we cannot offset such costs through higher prices for our surplus energy. 
 Other than the renewable forest licenses of our Peace River mill, we do not own any timberlands or have any material long-term governmental timber concessions. We also currently have few long-term fiber contracts at our German operations. Fiber is available from a number of suppliers and prices are cyclical. Our fiber requirements have increased and may continue to do so as we expand capacity through capital projects, other efficiency measures at our mills and acquisitions. As a result, we may not be able to purchase sufficient quantities of fiber to meet our production requirements at prices acceptable to us during times of tight supply. An insufficient supply of fiber or reduction in the quality of fiber we receive would materially adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. 
 In addition to the supply of fiber, we are, to a lesser extent, dependent on the supply of certain chemicals and other inputs used in our production facilities. Any disruption in the supply of these chemicals or other inputs could affect our ability to meet customer demand in a timely manner and could harm our reputation. Any material increase in the cost of these chemicals or other inputs could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows. 
 Our business, financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected by disruptions in the global and European economies caused by Russia's invasion of Ukraine. 
 The global economy has been negatively impacted by increasing tension, uncertainty and tragedy resulting from Russia's invasion of Ukraine. The adverse and uncertain economic conditions resulting therefrom have and may further negatively impact global demand, cause supply chain disruptions and increase costs for transportation, energy and other raw materials. Furthermore, governments in the United States, the European Union, the United Kingdom, Canada and others have imposed financial and economic sanctions on certain industry segments and various parties in Russia. We are monitoring the conflict including the potential impact of financial and economic sanctions on the global economy and particularly the economies of Europe. Increased trade barriers, sanctions and other restrictions on global or regional trade could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. Although we have no operations in Russia or Ukraine, the destabilizing effects of Russia's invasion of Ukraine could have other adverse effects on our business, including transportation, logistics, fiber supply and energy availability. Further escalation of geopolitical tensions related to this military conflict and/or its expansion could result in loss of property, expropriation, cyberattacks, supply disruptions, plant closures and an inability to obtain key supplies and materials, as well as adversely affect both our and our customers supply chains and logistics, particularly in Europe. 
 In many cases, both our German operations and those of European customers depend on the availability of natural gas for use in their manufacturing operations. A very significant proportion of Germany's natural gas supply historically originated from Russia. There have been significant reductions in and disruptions to the natural gas supply to Europe and in particular Germany, resulting from sanctions, counter-measures by Russia, including restricting supply, other restrictions, damage to infrastructure, logistics and other factors related to the war. The Ukraine military conflict has had a destabilizing effect and materially and adversely impacted European and global natural gas and oil markets. Such material disruptions to the natural gas supply of Germany could adversely affect its availability to industry and 
 32 
 
 our ability to operate our German pulp and lumber mills in the ordinary course which could adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition. 
 Additionally, both the European Union and Germany have adopted or proposed legislation in response to energy supply shortages and high energy prices, including price caps and windfall taxes on energy sales resulting from the war in Ukraine. 
 In addition, the effects of such military conflict could heighten and increase many of the other risks described in this Item 1A. 
 Inflation or a sustained increase in our key production and other costs would lead to higher manufacturing costs which could reduce our margins. 
 Our key production input costs are for fiber, chemicals and energy. Other material costs in our business include labor and transportation. The prices for fiber and energy can be volatile, are affected by inflation and can change rapidly. Additionally, our costs for chemicals and transportation are also subject to inflationary pressure. Also, our costs for service providers, contractors and labor may increase due to inflation and shortages of skilled labor. 
 Continued inflationary pressures would increase our manufacturing costs. If we are unable to pass along such operating costs increases to our customers, it could reduce our margins, contribute to earnings volatility and adversely affect our results of operations. 
 The ongoing COVID-19 pandemic could materially adversely affect our business, financial position and results of operations. 
 Since its initial outbreak in late 2019, the COVID-19 pandemic has resulted in significant and widespread global infections and fatalities. During the pandemic, various levels of governments globally have from time to time taken emergency and other measures to attempt to contain the virus, including travel restrictions, quarantines, business closures, shelter in place orders and other shutdowns and restrictions. 
 The impact of the pandemic and the global response thereto has, among other things, significantly disrupted global economic activity, negatively impacted gross domestic product, disrupted supply chains and caused volatility in financial markets. Various countries have suffered declines in gross domestic product growth, business activity and increases in unemployment. 
 The widespread roll-out of vaccines to aid in the prevention and spread of the COVID-19 virus has generally resulted in a reopening of most economies and a general discussion of whether to treat the COVID-19 virus as endemic and learn to live with it. However, certain countries, including China in particular have continued to impose selected quarantines and closures to try to stop the spread of the virus. The effect of such measures has been reduced economic activity both in China and globally as a result of the size of China's economy. Further, China is also an important market for pulp producers, including ourselves. 
 As demand for our products has principally historically been determined by general global macro-economic activities, demand and prices for our products have historically decreased substantially during economic slowdowns. A significant economic downturn may adversely affect our sales and profitability and may also adversely affect our customers and suppliers. Additionally, significant disruptions and volatility in financial markets could have a negative impact on our ability to access capital in the future. 
 Our products are an important constituent of many pandemic related high demand goods such as tissue and cleaning products and certain personal protective equipment. However, our mills could experience disruptions, downtime and closures in the future as a result of changes to existing government response measures, outbreaks of the virus among our employees or operations or disruptions to raw material supplies or access to logistics networks. 
 The magnitude and duration of the disruption and resulting decline in business activity that may result from the ongoing pandemic, new variants and/or resurgences is currently uncertain. The extent to which the pandemic impacts our business, operations and financial results will depend on numerous evolving factors that we may not be able to accurately predict. 
 33 
 
 We face intense competition in the forest products industry. 
 We compete with numerous forest products companies, some of which have greater financial resources. The trend toward consolidation in the forest products industry has led to the formation of sizable global producers that have greater flexibility in pricing and financial resources for marketing, investment, research and development, innovation, and expansion. Additionally, certain of our competitors are fully or more vertically integrated than we are and may have different priorities when operating their respective businesses. Because the markets for our products are highly competitive, actions by competitors can affect our ability to compete and the volatility of prices at which our products are sold. 
 The forest products industry is also capital intensive, and we require significant investment to remain competitive. Some of our competitors may be lower-cost producers in some of the businesses in which we operate. For example, the sizable low-cost hardwood grade pulp capacity in South America, which continues to grow as a result of ongoing investment and whose costs are thought to be very competitive, and the actions those mills take to gain market share, could continue to adversely affect our competitive position in similar grades. Failure to compete effectively could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations. 
 Our business is subject to risks associated with climate change and social and government responses thereto. 
 Our operations and those of our suppliers are subject to climate change variations which can impact the productivity of forests, the abundance of species, harvest levels and fiber supply. Further, over the last few years, changing weather patterns and climate conditions due to natural and man-made causes have added to the frequency and unpredictability of natural disasters like wildfires, insect infestation of softwood forests, floods, rain, wind, snow and ice storms. One or a combination of these factors could adversely affect our fiber supply which is our largest cash production cost. There are differing scientific studies and opinions relating to the severity, extent and speed at which climate change is or may be occurring around the world. As a result, we are currently unable to identify and predict all of the specific consequences of climate change on our business and operations. 
 Further, governmental initiatives and social focus in response to climate change also have an impact on operations. Their demand for carbon neutral green energy has created greater demand and competition for the wood residuals and fiber that is consumed by our pulp mills as part of their production processes. This can drive up the cost of fiber for our mills. 
 If our fiber costs increase and we cannot pass on these costs to our customers or offset them through higher prices for our sales of surplus energy, it will negatively affect our operating margins, results of operations and financial position. If we cannot obtain the fiber required to operate our mills, we may have to curtail and/or shut down production. This could have a material adverse effect on our operations, financial results and financial position. 
 Other risks to our business from climate change include: 
 a greater susceptibility of northern forests to disease, fire and insect infestation, which could diminish fiber availability; 

the disruption of transportation systems and power supply lines due to more severe storms; 

the loss of fresh water transportation for logs and pulp due to lower water levels; 

decreases in the quantity and quality of processed water for our mill operations; 

the loss of northern forests in areas in sufficient proximity to our mills to competitively acquire fiber; and 

lower harvest levels decreasing the supply of harvestable timber and, as a consequence, wood residuals. 

Any of these natural disasters could also affect woodlands or cause variations in the cost of raw materials, such as fiber or restrict or negatively impact our logistics and transportation of goods and materials. Changes in precipitation could make wildfires more frequent or more severe, and could adversely affect timber harvesting and the supply of fiber to our operations. The effects of global, regional, and local weather conditions, and climate change, including 
 34 
 
 the costs of complying with evolving climate change regulations and transition costs relating to a low carbon economy could also adversely impact our results of operations. 
 If we are unable to offer products certified to globally recognized forestry management and chain of custody standards or meet customers product specifications, it could adversely affect our ability to compete. 
 We market and sell pulp, lumber and other solid wood products with specific designations to certain globally recognized forest management and chain of custody standards as well as product specifications to meet customers requirements. Our ability to conform to new or existing guidelines for certification depends on a number of factors, many of which are beyond our control, such as: changes to the standards or the interpretation or the application of the standards; the collaboration of our suppliers in the timely sharing of product information; the adequacy of government-implemented conservation measures; and in Canada the existence of or potential territorial disputes between First Nations peoples and governments. If we are unable to offer certified products, or to meet commitments to supply certified product or meet the product specifications of our customers, it could adversely affect the marketability of our products and our ability to compete with other producers. 
 Our operations require substantial capital and we may be unable to maintain adequate capital resources to provide for such capital requirements. 
 Our business is capital intensive and requires that we regularly incur capital expenditures to maintain our equipment, improve efficiencies and, as a result of changes to environmental regulations that require capital expenditures, bring our operations into compliance with such regulations. In addition, we may approve projects in the future that will require significant capital expenditures. Increased capital expenditures could have a material adverse effect on our cash flow and our ability to satisfy our debt obligations. If our available cash resources and cash generated from operations are not sufficient to fund our operating needs and capital expenditures, we would have to obtain additional funds from borrowings or other available sources or reduce or delay our capital expenditures. Our indebtedness could adversely limit or impair our ability to raise additional capital. We may not be able to obtain additional funds on favorable terms or at all. If we cannot maintain or upgrade our equipment as may be required from time to time, we may become unable to manufacture products that compete effectively. An inability to make required capital expenditures in a timely fashion could have a material adverse effect on our growth, business, financial condition or results of operations. 
 Trends in non-print media and changes in consumer habits regarding the use of paper have and are expected to continue to adversely affect the demand for market pulp. 
 Trends in non-print media are expected to continue to adversely affect demand for traditional print media, including for printing, writing and graphic papers. Neither the timing nor the extent of these trends can be predicted with certainty. Our paper, magazine, book and catalog publishing customers could increase their use of, and compete with, non-print media, including multimedia technologies, electronic storage and communication platforms which could further reduce their consumption of papers and in turn their demand for market pulp. The demand for such paper products has weakened significantly over the last several years and has accelerated since the COVID-19 pandemic as confinement and work from home has altered consumer habits, which could become permanent and further negatively impact the demand for market pulp. 
 Fluctuations in prices and demand for lumber could adversely affect our business. 
 The financial performance of the Friesau mill and Torgau facility depends on the demand for and selling price of lumber, which is subject to significant fluctuations. The markets for lumber are highly volatile and are affected by economic conditions in Europe, Asia and the United States, the strength of housing markets and the home renovations activity in such regions, the growing importance of the Asian market, changes in industry production capacity, changes in inventory levels and other factors beyond our control. Additionally, interest rates have a significant impact on residential construction and renovation activity, which in turn influence the demand for and price of lumber. 
 35 
 
 Our solid wood segment lumber products are vulnerable to declines in demand due to competing technologies or materials. 
 Our lumber products may compete with alternative products. For example, plastic, wood/plastic or composite materials may be used by builders as alternatives to the lumber products produced by our solid wood segment. Changes in the prices for oil, chemicals and other products can change the competitive position of our solid wood segment lumber products relative to available alternatives and could increase substitution of those products for our solid wood segment products. If use of these alternative products grows, demand for and pricing of our solid wood segment products could be adversely affected. 
 We may experience material disruptions to our production. 
 A material disruption at one of our manufacturing facilities could prevent us from meeting customer demand, reduce our pulp, lumber and energy sales and/or negatively impact our results of operations. Any of our mills could cease operations unexpectedly due to a number of events, including: 
 unscheduled maintenance outages; 

prolonged power failures; 

equipment failures; 

employee errors or failures; 

design error or contractor error; 

chemical spill or release or industrial fire; 

explosion of a boiler; 

disruptions in the transportation infrastructure, including roads, bridges, railway tracks, tunnels, canals and ports; 

fires, floods, earthquakes, windstorms, pest infestations, severe weather conditions or other natural catastrophes affecting our production of goods or the supply of raw materials like fiber; 

prolonged supply disruption of major inputs; 

labor difficulties; 

capital projects that require temporary cost increases or curtailment of production; and 

other operational problems. 

Any such downtime or facility damage could prevent us from meeting customer demand for our products and/or require us to make unplanned capital expenditures. If any of our facilities were to incur significant downtime, our ability to meet our production capacity targets and satisfy customer requirements would be impaired and could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. 
 Acquisitions may result in additional risks and uncertainties in our business. 
 In order to grow our business, we may seek to acquire additional assets or companies. For example, on September 30, 2022, we acquired the Torgau facility for approximately 263.2 million. Our ability to pursue selective and accretive acquisitions, including the Torgau facility, is dependent on management's ability to identify, acquire and develop suitable acquisition targets in both new and existing markets. In pursuing acquisition and investment opportunities, we face competition from other companies having similar growth strategies, many of which may have substantially greater resources than us. Competition for these acquisitions or investment targets could result in increased acquisition or investment prices, higher risks and a diminished pool of businesses or assets available for acquisition. 
 Acquisitions also frequently result in recording of goodwill and other intangible assets, which are subject to potential impairments in the future that could have a material adverse effect on our operating results. Furthermore, the costs of integrating acquired businesses (including restructuring charges associated with the acquisitions, as well as other 
 36 
 
 acquisition costs, such as accounting fees, legal fees and investment banking fees) could significantly impact our operating results. 
 Although we perform diligence on the businesses we purchase, in light of the circumstances of each transaction, an unavoidable level of risk remains regarding the actual condition of these businesses. We may not be able to ascertain the value or understand the potential liabilities of the acquired businesses and their operations until we assume operating control of the assets and operations of these businesses. 
 Furthermore, acquisitions could entail a number of risks, including: 
 diversion of management's attention from our ongoing business; 

difficulty integrating the operations, including financial and accounting functions, sales and marketing procedures, technology and other corporate administrative functions of the combined operations; 

increased operating costs; 

exposure to substantial unanticipated liabilities; 

difficulty in realizing projected synergies, efficiencies and cost savings; 

exposure to facilities with different health and safety standards than ours and difficulty in integrating their practices to our standards; 

difficulty maintaining relationships with present and potential customers, distributors and suppliers due to uncertainties regarding service, production quality and prices; and 

problems retaining key employees. 

If we are unable to address any of these risks, our results of operations and financial condition could be materially adversely affected. 
 We are subject to risks related to our employees. 
 The majority of our employees are unionized and we have collective agreements in place with our employees at all of our mills, other than the Peace River mill, Mercer Mass Timber facility and Torgau facility, which are non-union. Although we have not experienced any material work stoppages in the past, there can be no assurance that we will be able to negotiate acceptable collective agreements or other satisfactory arrangements with our employees upon the expiration of our collective agreements. This could result in a strike or work stoppage by the affected workers. The registration or renewal of the collective agreements or the outcome of our wage negotiations could result in higher wages or benefits paid to union members. Many of the employment positions in our operations require technical or other operating training and/or experience. Changing demographics may make it more difficult for us to recruit skilled employees in the future. Accordingly, we could experience a significant disruption of our operations or higher ongoing labor costs, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. In addition, whenever we seek to reduce the workforce at any of our mills, the affected mill's labor force could seek to hinder or delay such actions, we could incur material severance or other costs and our operations could be disrupted. 
 We are dependent on key personnel. 
 Our future success depends, to a large extent, on the efforts and abilities of our executive and senior mill operating officers. Such officers are industry professionals, many of whom have operated through multiple business cycles. The loss of one or more of our officers could make us less competitive, which could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. We do not maintain key person life insurance for any of our executive or senior mill operating officers. 
 In addition, by nature of the industries in which we operate, many of our employees are professionals who require specialized knowledge and skills, including various categories of engineers and licensed trade persons and equipment operators. Any inability to attract, train and retain such employees could adversely affect our business and results of operations. 
 37 
 
 If our long-lived assets become impaired, we may be required to record non-cash impairment charges that could have a material impact on our results of operations. 
 We review the carrying value of long-lived assets for impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the assets may not be recoverable. Should the markets for our products deteriorate or should we decide to invest capital differently or should other cash flow assumptions change, it is possible that we will be required to record non-cash impairment charges in the future that could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations. 
 Our insurance coverage may not be adequate. 
 We have obtained insurance coverage that we believe would ordinarily be maintained by an operator of facilities similar to our mills. Our insurance is subject to various limits and exclusions. Damage or destruction to our facilities could result in claims that are excluded by, or exceed the limits of, our insurance coverage. Additionally, the weak global and financial markets have also reduced the availability and extent of credit insurance for our customers. If we cannot obtain adequate credit insurance for our customers, we may be forced to amend or curtail our planned operations which could negatively impact our sales revenues, results of operations and financial position. 
 We rely on third parties for transportation services. 
 Our business primarily relies upon third parties for the transportation of products to our customers, as well as for the delivery of our raw materials to our mills. Our products and raw materials are principally transported by truck, barge, rail and sea-going vessels, all of which are highly regulated. Increases in transportation rates can also materially adversely affect our results of operations. 
 Further, if our transportation providers fail to deliver our products in a timely manner, it could negatively impact our customer relationships and we may be unable to manufacture pulp or lumber in response to customer orders or sell them at full value. Also, if any of our transportation providers were to cease operations, we may be unable to replace them at a reasonable cost. The occurrence of any of the foregoing events could materially adversely affect our results of operations. 
 Failures or security breaches of our information technology systems could disrupt our operations and negatively impact our business. 
 We use information technologies to manage our operations and various business functions. We rely on various technologies to process, store and report on our business and to communicate electronically between our facilities, personnel, customers and suppliers as well as for administrative functions and many of such technology systems are dependent on one another for their functionality. We also use information technologies to process financial information and results of operations for internal reporting purposes and to comply with regulatory, legal and tax requirements. We rely on third party providers for some of these information technologies and support. Our ability to effectively manage our business and coordinate the production, distribution and sale of our products is highly dependent on our technology systems. Despite our security design and controls and other operational safeguards, and those of our third party providers, our information technology systems may be vulnerable to a variety of interruptions, including during the process of upgrading or replacing hardware, software, databases or components thereof, natural disasters, terrorist attacks, telecommunications failures, computer viruses, cyberattacks, hackers, unauthorized access attempts and other security issues or may be breached due to employee error, malfeasance or other disruptions. Any such interruption or breach could result in operational disruptions or the misappropriation of sensitive data that could subject us to civil and criminal penalties, litigation or have a negative impact on our reputation. There can be no assurance that such disruptions or misappropriations and the resulting repercussions will not negatively impact our cash flows and materially affect our results of operations or financial condition. 
 In addition, many of our information technology systems, such as those we use for administrative functions, including human resources, payroll, accounting and internal and external communications, as well as the information technology systems of our third-party business partners and service providers, whether cloud-based or hosted in proprietary servers, contain personal, financial or other information that is entrusted to us by our customers and personnel. Many of our information technology systems also contain proprietary and other confidential information related to our business, such as business plans and research and development initiatives. To the extent we or a third party were to 
 38 
 
 experience a material breach of our or such third party's information technology systems that results in the unauthorized access, theft, use, destruction or other compromises of our customers or personnel s data or confidential information stored in such systems, including through cyberattacks or other external or internal methods, it could result in a violation of applicable privacy and other laws, and subject us to litigation and governmental investigations and proceedings, any of which could result in our exposure to material liability. 
 We have limited control over the operations of the Cariboo mill. 
 Our 50 ownership interest in the Cariboo mill is through an unincorporated joint venture partnership. The ownership and operation of such mill is subject to an underlying agreement and its day-to-day operations are principally conducted by our joint venture partner. Joint venture partnerships generally involve special risks, including that the business and strategic interests of the joint venture partner and ourselves may not coincide or that the joint venture partner may be unable to meet its economic or other obligations thereunder. We have limited control over the actions of the joint venture partner in respect of the Cariboo mill, including any non-performance, default or bankruptcy of such party. Any non-performance by our joint venture partner or other actions taken by the joint venture partner in connection with the day-to-day operation of the Cariboo mill may adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition. 
 Risks Related to ou r Debt 
 Our level of indebtedness could negatively impact our financial condition, results of operations and liquidity. 
 As of December 31, 2022, we had approximately 1,346.5 million of indebtedness outstanding. We may also incur additional indebtedness in the future. Our high debt levels may have important consequences for us, including, but not limited to the following: 
 our ability to obtain additional financing for working capital, capital expenditures, general corporate and other purposes or to fund future operations may not be available on terms favorable to us or at all; 

a significant amount of our operating cash flow is dedicated to the payment of interest and principal on our indebtedness, thereby diminishing funds that would otherwise be available for our operations and for other purposes; 

increasing our vulnerability to current and future adverse economic and industry conditions; 

a substantial decrease in net operating cash flows or increase in our expenses could make it more difficult for us to meet our debt service requirements, which could force us to modify our operations; 

our leveraged capital structure may place us at a competitive disadvantage by hindering our ability to adjust rapidly to changing market conditions or by making us vulnerable to a downturn in our business or the economy in general; 

causing us to offer debt or equity securities on terms that may not be favorable to us or our shareholders; 

limiting our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes and opportunities in our business and our industry; and 

our level of indebtedness increases the possibility that we may be unable to generate cash sufficient to pay the principal or interest due in respect of our indebtedness. 

The indentures that govern our Senior Notes, and our credit facilities contain restrictive covenants which impose operating and other restrictions on us and our subsidiaries. These restrictions will affect, and in many respects will limit or prohibit, our ability to, among other things, incur or guarantee additional indebtedness, pay dividends or make distributions on capital stock or redeem or repurchase capital stock, make investments or acquisitions, create liens and enter into mergers, consolidations or transactions with affiliates. The terms of our indebtedness also restrict our ability to sell certain assets, apply the proceeds of such sales and reinvest in our business. 
 39 
 
 Certain of the agreements governing our indebtedness have covenants that require us to maintain prescribed financial ratios and tests. Failure to comply with such covenants could result in events of default and could have a material adverse effect on our liquidity, results of operations and financial condition. 
 Our ability to repay or refinance our indebtedness will depend on our future financial and operating performance. Our performance, in turn, will be subject to prevailing economic and competitive conditions, as well as financial, business, legislative, regulatory, industry and other factors, many of which are beyond our control. Our ability to meet our future debt service and other obligations may depend in significant part on the extent to which we can successfully implement our business strategy. We cannot assure you that we will be able to implement our strategy fully or that the anticipated results of our strategy will be realized. Over the next several years, we will require financing to refinance maturing debt obligations (unless extended), and such refinancing may not be available on favorable terms or at all. 
 Changes in credit ratings issued by nationally recognized statistical rating organizations could adversely affect our cost of financing and have an adverse effect on the market price of our securities. 
 Credit rating agencies rate our debt securities on factors that include our operating results, actions that we take, their view of the general outlook for our industry and their view of the general outlook for the economy. Actions taken by the rating agencies can include maintaining, upgrading or downgrading the current rating or placing the company on a watch list for possible future downgrading. Downgrading the credit rating of our debt securities or placing us on a watch list for possible future downgrading could limit our access to credit markets, increase our cost of financing and have an adverse effect on the market price of our securities, including our Senior Notes. 
 We are exposed to interest rate fluctuations. 
 Interest on borrowings under our revolving credit facilities are at floating rates. As a result, increases in interest rates will increase our costs of borrowing and reduce our operating margins. 
 Risks Related to M acro-eco n omic Conditions 
 A weakening of the global economy, including capital and credit markets, could adversely affect our business and financial results and have a material adverse effect on our liquidity and capital resources. 
 As demand for our products has principally historically been determined by general global macro-economic activities, demand and prices for our products have historically decreased substantially during economic slowdowns. A significant economic downturn may affect our sales and profitability. Further, our suppliers and customers may also be adversely affected by an economic downturn. Additionally, restricted credit and capital availability restrains our customers ability or willingness to purchase our products, resulting in lower revenues. Depending on the severity and duration, the effects and consequences of a global economic downturn could have a material adverse effect on our liquidity and capital resources, including our ability to raise capital, if needed, and otherwise negatively impact our business and financial results. 
 In addition, financial uncertainties and other events in our major international markets, including inflation and other market factors, may negatively impact the global economy and consequently, our results of operations. 
 We are exposed to currency exchange rate fluctuations. 
 We have manufacturing operations in Germany, Canada and the United States. Most of the operating costs and expenses of our German mills are incurred in euros and those of our Canadian mills in Canadian dollars. However, the majority of our sales are in products quoted in dollars. Our results of operations and financial condition are reported in dollars. As a result, our costs generally benefit from a strengthening dollar but are adversely affected by a decrease in the value of the dollar relative to the euro and to the Canadian dollar. Such declines in the dollar relative to the euro and the Canadian dollar reduce our operating margins and the cash flow available to fund our operations and to service our debt. This could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. 
 40 
 
 Further, while a strengthening dollar generally lowers our costs and expenses in Germany and Canada, it increases the cost of pulp to our customers and generally puts downward pressure on pulp prices and reduces our energy, chemical, pallet, biofuel, wood residual and European lumber sales revenues as they are sold in euros and Canadian dollars. 
 Although we report in dollars, we hold certain assets and liabilities, including our mills, in euros and Canadian dollars. We translate foreign denominated assets and liabilities into dollars at the rate of exchange on the balance sheet date. Equity accounts are translated using historical exchange rates. Unrealized gains or losses from these translations are recognized in other comprehensive income (loss) and do not affect our net earnings, operating income or Operating EBITDA. 
 Certain intercompany dollar advances between Mercer Inc. and its foreign subsidiaries are held in euros and Canadian dollars. Mercer Inc. holds some cash in foreign currencies and certain foreign subsidiaries hold some cash and other balances in dollars. When such advances, cash and other balances are translated into the applicable local currency at the end of each reporting period, the gains or losses thereon are reflected in net earnings. 
 Globally, central banks have raised interest rates in response to high inflation rates which could dampen macro-economic conditions and business activity which could reduce demand for our products. 
 As a result of higher than acceptable rates of inflation, many central banks globally have raised interest rates through 2022 and may continue to do so in the future to reduce the rate of inflation. 
 Such interest rate increases can, among other things, dampen macro-economic conditions and business activity and lead to a recession. Such weakened economic activity could reduce demand and prices for our products which could reduce our margins and adversely affect our results of operations. 
 In addition, the effects of rising interest rates and a weakening of global economic activity could heighten and increase many of the other risks described in this Item 1A. 
 Political uncertainty, an increase in trade protectionism or geo-political conflict could have a material adverse effect on global macro-economic activities and trade and adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition. 
 The rise of economic nationalist sentiments, trade protectionism and geo-political security has led to increasing political uncertainty and unpredictability throughout the world. Additionally, there can be no assurance that additional or new trade tensions and tariffs will not arise between various trade partners. These potential developments, market perceptions concerning these and related issues and the attendant regulatory uncertainty regarding, for example, the posture of governments with respect to international trade or national security issues, could have a material adverse effect on global trade and economic growth which, in turn, can adversely affect our business, results of operation and financial condition. 
 Increased trade protectionism could materially adversely affect our business. If the current global economy or outlook is undermined by downside risks and there is a prolonged economic downturn, governments may resort to new or enhanced trade barriers to protect their domestic industries against imports, thereby depressing demand. Changes in the trade policies of the U.S. and other countries, such as the announcement of unilateral tariffs on imported products, have already triggered retaliatory actions from affected countries, resulting in trade wars that could have a material adverse effect on global trade and economic growth. 
 International security issues and adverse developments in respect thereof such as the current Russian invasion of Ukraine and potentially western security alliances could materially adversely affect global trade and economic activity. 
 Protectionist developments or adverse international political tensions or developments, or the perception they may occur, may have a material adverse effect on global economic conditions, and may significantly reduce global trade. Increasing trade protectionism in the markets could increase the risks associated with exporting goods to such markets. These developments could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. 
 41 
 
 We may incur losses as a result of unforeseen or catastrophic events, including the emergence of a new pandemic, terrorist attacks or natural disasters. 
 The occurrence of unforeseen or catastrophic events, including the emergence of a new pandemic or other widespread health emergency (or concerns over the possibility of such an emergency), terrorist attacks or natural disasters, could create economic and financial disruptions and could lead to operational difficulties (including travel limitations) that could impair our ability to manage or operate our business and adversely affect our results of operations. 
 Legal and R egulatory Risks 
 We are subject to extensive environmental regulation and we could incur substantial costs as a result of compliance with, violations of or liabilities under applicable environmental laws and regulations. 
 Our operations are subject to numerous environmental laws and regulations as well as permits, guidelines and policies relating to the protection of the environment. These laws, regulations, permits, guidelines and policies govern, among other things: 
 discharges to land, air, water and sewers; 

waste collection, storage, transportation and disposal; 

hazardous waste; 

dangerous goods and hazardous materials and the collection, storage, transportation and disposal of such substances; 

the clean-up of unlawful discharges; 

land use planning; 

municipal zoning; and 

employee health and safety. 

In addition, as a result of our operations, we may be subject to remediation, clean-up or other administrative orders or amendments to our operating permits, and we may be involved from time to time in administrative and judicial proceedings or inquiries. Future orders, proceedings or inquiries could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. Environmental laws and land use laws and regulations are constantly changing. New regulations or the increased enforcement of existing laws could have a material adverse effect on our business and financial condition. In addition, compliance with regulatory requirements is expensive, at times requiring the replacement, enhancement or modification of equipment, facilities or operations. There can be no assurance that we will be able to maintain our profitability by offsetting any increased costs of complying with future regulatory requirements. 
 We are subject to liability for environmental damage at the facilities that we own or operate, including damage to neighboring landowners, residents or employees, particularly as a result of the contamination of soil, groundwater or surface water and especially drinking water. The costs of such liabilities can be substantial. Our potential liability may include damages resulting from conditions existing before we purchased or operated these facilities. We may also be subject to liability for any offsite environmental contamination caused by pollutants or hazardous substances that we or our predecessors arranged to transport, treat or dispose of at other locations. In addition, we may be held legally responsible for liabilities as a successor owner of businesses that we acquire or have acquired. Except for Stendal and the Mercer Mass Timber facility, our facilities have been operating for decades and we have not done invasive testing to determine whether or to what extent any such environmental contamination exists. As a result, these businesses may have liabilities for conditions that we discover or that become apparent, including liabilities arising from non-compliance with environmental laws by prior owners. Because of the limited availability of insurance coverage for environmental liability, any substantial liability for environmental damage could materially adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition. 
 We have incurred, and we expect to continue to incur, significant capital, operating and other expenditures as a result of complying with applicable environmental laws and regulations. 
 42 
 
 Further, enactment of new environmental laws or regulations, changes in existing laws or regulations or the interpretation of these laws and regulations might require significant capital expenditures. We may be unable to generate sufficient funds or access other sources of capital to fund unforeseen environmental liabilities or expenditures. 
 We sell surplus green energy in Germany and are subject to changing energy legislation in response to high prices and energy shortages resulting from the war in Ukraine. 
 In Germany, our mills sell surplus green energy at market prices or certain of our mills have the option to sell at fixed prices or tariffs pursuant to the Renewable Energy Act. However, in our last fiscal year all of our German mills primarily sold their surplus green energy at market prices in order to realize upon favorable market pricing. The fixed price tariff for our Stendal mill expires in 2024, for our Friesau mill expires in 2029 and for our Torgau facility's four cogeneration power plants range from 2029 to 2034. 
 In October 2022, the Council of the European Union formally adopted emergency measures to address high energy prices resulting from the war in Ukraine. The Council implemented a Regulation containing temporary measures including a mandatory cap on market revenues at 180 per MWh hour for inframarginal generators such as renewables, nuclear and lignite producers. This cap applies to both electricity traded in a centralized marketplace, as well as electricity traded bilaterally. 
 On December 16, 2022, the German government approved a windfall profits tax on energy producers to take effect from December 1, 2022 until June 30, 2023, with a possible extension until April 30, 2024. The windfall profits tax is equivalent to 90 of the revenue above a baseline threshold for energy producers. The windfall profits tax was approved by the European Union on December 21, 2022 and was published in Germany's Federal Law Gazette on December 23, 2022. 
 The effect of the foregoing legislation will reduce our revenues and after tax income for surplus green energy sales during the applicable periods. 
 Further, we cannot predict if either Germany or the European Union will adopt further legal measures in response to the energy shortages and high prices resulting from the Ukraine conflict in the future. 
 Further, the availability of tariffs and other incentives for our green energy production activities is dependent, to a large extent, on political and policy developments relating to environmental concerns in the regions in which we operate. We cannot currently predict the scope of any such measures, whether they will provide similar economic incentives as under the tariffs, when, if at all, they will be implemented or their potential application and impact on the expiry of their existing tariffs for certain of our German mills. 
 Our international sales and operations are subject to applicable laws relating to trade, export controls, foreign corrupt practices and competition laws, the violation of which could adversely affect our operations. 
 As a result of our international sales and operations, we are subject to trade and economic sanctions and other restrictions imposed by the United States, Canada and other governments or organizations, including prohibitions in the United States against foreign competitors (including our operating subsidiaries) receipt of certain unlawful foreign governmental benefits. We are also subject to the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act of 1977 , the Canadian Corruption of Foreign Public Officials Act and other anti-bribery laws that generally bar bribes or unreasonable gifts to governments or officials. Changes in trade sanction laws could restrict our business practices, including cessation of business activities in sanctioned countries or with sanctioned entities, and may result in modifications to compliance programs. Violations of these laws or regulations could result in sanctions including fines, loss of authorizations needed to conduct our international business, the imposition of tariffs or duties and other penalties, which could adversely impact our business, operating results and financial condition. 
 In 2021, the European Commission commenced a cartel investigation into the wood pulp sector in Europe to investigate if there was an infringement of European Union competition law. In October 2021, the Commission conducted inspections of several European pulp producers, including our German operations. The matter is currently in the investigation stage and we are cooperating with the investigation and expect to engage with the European Commission if the investigation continues. We are unable to predict the timing of, and what further actions, if any, 
 43 
 
 the Commission may pursue. If the Commission were to pursue actions against such European pulp producers, including our German operations, and ultimately there was a non-appealable determination of an infringement of European competition law, it could impose significant financial penalties on such producers, including us, that could have a material adverse effect on us and our business. 
 Risks Related to Ownership of our Shares 
 The price of our common stock may be volatile. 
 The market price of our common stock may be influenced by many factors, some of which are beyond our control, including those described above and the following: 
 actual or anticipated fluctuations in our operating results or our competitors operating results; 

announcements by us or our competitors of new products, capacity changes, significant contracts, acquisitions or strategic investments; 

our growth rate and our competitors growth rates; 

the financial market and general economic conditions; 

changes in stock market analyst recommendations regarding us, our competitors or the forest products industry generally or lack of analyst coverage of our common stock; 

sales of common stock by our executive officers, directors and significant shareholders; 

changes in accounting principles; and 

changes in laws and regulations. 

In addition, there has been significant volatility in the market price and trading volume of securities of companies operating in the forest products industry that often has been unrelated to the operating performance of particular companies. Some companies that have had volatile market prices for their securities have had securities litigation brought against them. If litigation of this type is brought against us, it could result in substantial costs and would divert management's attention and resources. 
 A small number of our shareholders could significantly influence our business. 
 There are a few significant shareholders of our common stock who own a substantial percentage of the outstanding shares of our common stock. These few significant shareholders, either individually or acting together, may be able to exercise significant influence over matters requiring shareholder approval, including the election of directors and approval of significant corporate transactions, such as a merger or other sale of the company or our assets. This concentration of ownership may make it more difficult for other shareholders to effect substantial changes in the company, may have the effect of delaying, preventing or expediting, as the case may be, a change in control of the company and may adversely affect the market price of our common stock. Further, the possibility that one or more of these significant shareholders may sell all or a large portion of their common stock in a short period of time could adversely affect the trading price of our common stock. Also, the interests of these few shareholders may not be in the best interests of all shareholders. 
 ITEM 1B. UNRESOLV ED STAFF COMMENTS 
 None. 
 ITEM 2. P ROPERTIES 
 We own the Stendal, Rosenthal, Celgar, Peace River pulp mills, the Friesau sawmill and their underlying properties and have a 50 joint venture interest in the Cariboo pulp mill. We also own the Mercer Mass Timber facility and its underlying property near Spokane, Washington and sandalwood plantations in Western Australia. We also acquired as of September 30, 2022, a timber processing and value-add pallet production facility in Torgau, Germany and a wood processing facility in Dahlen, Germany that produces garden products. 
 44 
 
 Stendal Mill. The Stendal mill is situated on a 335 acre site that is part of a larger 3,090 acre industrial park near the town of Arneburg in the state of Saxony-Anhalt, approximately 185 miles north of the Rosenthal mill and 80 miles west of Berlin. The mill is adjacent to the Elbe River and has access to harbor facilities for water transportation. The mill is a single line mill with a current annual design production capacity of approximately 740,000 ADMTs of kraft pulp. The Stendal mill is self-sufficient in steam and electrical power. Some excess electrical power which is constantly being generated is sold to the regional power grid. The facilities at the mill include: 
 an approximately 740,000 square feet fiber and roundwood storage area; 

debarking and chipping facilities for pulp logs; 

a fiber line, which includes 12 SuperBatch digesters and bleaching facilities; 

a pulp machine, which includes a dryer, a cutter and two baling lines;

Rosenthal Mill. The Rosenthal mill is situated on a 230 acre site in the town of Rosenthal am Rennsteig in the state of Thuringia, approximately 185 miles south of Berlin. The Saale River flows through the site of the mill. In late 1999, we completed a major capital project which converted the Rosenthal mill to the production of kraft pulp. It is a single line mill with a current annual production capacity of approximately 360,000 ADMTs of kraft pulp. The mill is self-sufficient in steam and electrical power. Some excess electrical power which is constantly generated is sold to the regional power grid. The facilities at the mill include: 
 an approximately 425,000 square feet fiber storage area; 

debarking and chipping facilities for pulp logs; 

an approximately 700,000 square feet roundwood yard; 

a fiber line, which includes a Kamyr continuous digester and bleaching facilities; 

a pulp machine, which includes a dryer, a cutter and a baling line; 

an approximately 60,000 square feet finished goods storage area; 

a chemical recovery line, which includes a recovery boiler, evaporation plant, recausticizing plant and lime kiln; 

a fresh water plant; 

a wastewater treatment plant; and 

a power station with a turbine capable of producing 57 MW of electrical power from steam produced by the recovery boiler and a power boiler. 

Celgar Mill. The Celgar mill is situated on a 400 acre site near the city of Castlegar, British Columbia.

 ITEM 3. LEGAL PROCEEDINGS 
 In 2021, the European Commission opened a cartel investigation into the wood pulp sector in Europe to investigate if there was an infringement of European Union competition law. In October 2021, the Commission conducted inspections of major European pulp producers including our German operations. We are cooperating with the investigation. As the matter is currently in the investigation stage, we cannot predict the timing of the same and what further actions, if any, the European Commission may pursue or what the outcome of any such actions may be. 
 We are also subject to routine litigation incidental to our business. We do not believe that the outcome of such litigation will have a material adverse effect on our business or financial condition.

 NON-GAAP FINA NCIAL MEASURES 
 This annual report on Form 10-K contains non-GAAP financial measures , that is, financial measures that either exclude or include amounts that are not excluded or included in the most directly comparable measure calculated and presented in accordance with the generally accepted accounting principles in the United States, referred to as GAAP . Specifically, we make use of the non-GAAP measures Operating EBITDA and Operating EBITDA margin . 
 Operating EBITDA is defined as operating income (loss) plus depreciation and amortization and non-recurring capital asset impairment charges. Operating EBITDA margin is Operating EBITDA expressed as a percentage of revenues. We use Operating EBITDA and Operating EBITDA margin as benchmark measurements of our own operating results and as benchmarks relative to our competitors. We consider them to be meaningful supplements to operating income as performance measures primarily because depreciation expense and non-recurring capital asset impairment charges are not actual cash costs and depreciation expense varies widely from company to company in a manner that we consider largely independent of the underlying cost efficiency of our operating facilities. In addition, we believe Operating EBITDA is commonly used by securities analysts, investors and other interested parties to evaluate our financial performance. 
 Operating EBITDA does not reflect the impact of a number of items that affect our net income (loss), including financing costs and the effect of derivative instruments. Operating EBITDA is not a measure of financial performance under GAAP, and should not be considered as an alternative to net income (loss) or operating income as a measure of performance, or as an alternative to net cash from (used in) operating activities as a measure of liquidity. Operating EBITDA and Operating EBITDA margin are internal measures and therefore may not be comparable to other companies. 
 Operating EBITDA has significant limitations as an analytical tool, and should not be considered in isolation, or as a substitute for analysis of our results as reported under GAAP. Some of these limitations are that Operating EBITDA does not reflect: (i) our cash expenditures, or future requirements, for capital expenditures or contractual commitments; (ii) changes in, or cash requirements for, working capital needs; (iii) the significant interest expense, or the cash requirements necessary to service interest or principal payments, on our outstanding debt; (iv) the impact of realized or marked to market changes in our derivative positions, which can be substantial; and (v) the impact of non-recurring impairment charges against our investments or assets. Because of these limitations, Operating EBITDA should only be considered as a supplemental performance measure and should not be considered as a measure of liquidity or cash available to us to invest in the growth of our business. Because all companies do not calculate Operating EBITDA in the same manner, Operating EBITDA as calculated by us may differ from Operating EBITDA or EBITDA as calculated by other companies. We compensate for these limitations by using Operating EBITDA as a supplemental measure of our performance and by relying primarily on our GAAP financial statements.

 ITEM 6. [ RESERVED] 
 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS O F FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS 
 The following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of our operations for the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021 is based upon and should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and related notes included elsewhere in this annual report. Please refer to Item 7. Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations in our annual report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2021 for a discussion of our results of operations for 2020 and financial position as of December 31, 2020. This annual report contains forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties. Our actual results may differ materially from those indicated in forward-looking statements. See Cautionary Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements and Item 1A. Risk Factors . 
 Results of Operations 
 General 
 We have two reportable operating segments: 
 Pulp consists of the manufacture, sale and distribution of pulp, electricity and chemicals at our pulp mills in Germany and Canada. 

Solid Wood consists of the manufacture, sale and distribution of lumber, manufactured products (including CLT and finger joint lumber), wood pallets, electricity, biofuels and wood residuals at our sawmills and other facilities in Germany and the United States. 

Each segment offers primarily different products and requires different manufacturing processes, technology and sales and marketing. 
 Markets for kraft pulp are global, cyclical and commodity based. Our financial performance depends on a number of variables that impact sales and production costs. Sales and production results for kraft pulp are influenced largely by the market price for kraft pulp, fiber costs and foreign currency exchange rates. Kraft pulp prices are highly cyclical and primarily determined by the balance between supply and demand. Pricing and demand are influenced by global macro-economic conditions, changes in consumption and industry capacity, the level of customer and producer inventories and fluctuations in exchange rates. The third party industry quoted average European list prices for NBSK pulp between 2013 and 2022 have fluctuated between a low of 790 per ADMT in 2016 to a high of 1,500 per ADMT in 2022. In the same period, third party industry quoted average North American list prices for NBHK pulp have fluctuated between a low of 770 per ADMT in 2013 to a high of 1,620 per ADMT in 2022. 
 Our pulp sales realizations are third party industry quoted list prices, net of customer discounts, rebates and other selling concessions. Our sales to China are closer to a net price with significantly lower or little discounts and rebates. 
 The market for lumber is cyclical and generally driven by macroeconomic conditions, producer inventories and fluctuations in exchange rates. As a key construction material, the pricing and demand for lumber is significantly influenced by the number of housing starts, especially in the United States. In the U.S., third party industry quoted monthly average western spruce/pine/fir WSPF 2 x 4 #2 Btr prices between 2013 and 2022 have fluctuated between a low of 245 per Mfbm in 2015 to a high of 1,604 per Mfbm in 2021. Similarly, the demand for CLT is primarily driven by the wood construction market and increased government policies focused on a low-carbon economy. 
 European and U.S. lumber markets differ. In the European market, lumber is generally customized in terms of dimensions and finishing, whereas the U.S. market is driven primarily by demand from new housing starts and home renovation activities and dimensions and finishing are generally standardized and competition is primarily price driven. 
 51 
 
 Energy and chemical production and sales are key revenue sources for us. Further initiatives to increase our generation and sales of renewable energy, chemicals and other by-products will continue to be a key focus for us. Such further initiatives may require additional capital spending. 
 Energy and chemicals are by-products of our pulp and lumber production and the volumes generated and sold are primarily related to the rate of production. Prices for our energy and chemical sales are generally stable and unrelated to cyclical changes in pulp or lumber prices. 
 Our production costs are influenced by the availability and cost of raw materials, energy and labor, and our plant efficiencies and productivity. Our main raw material is fiber in the form of wood chips, pulp logs and sawlogs. Wood chip, pulp logs and sawlog costs are primarily affected by the supply of, and demand for, lumber and pulp, which are both highly cyclical. Higher fiber costs could affect producer profit margins if they are unable to pass along price increases to pulp, lumber, pallet and biofuel customers or purchasers of surplus energy. 
 Our financial performance is also impacted by changes in the dollar to euro and Canadian dollar exchange rates. Changes in currency rates affect our operating results because most of our operating costs at our German mills are incurred in euros and those at our Canadian mills are in Canadian dollars. These costs do not fluctuate with the dollar to euro or Canadian dollar exchange rates. Thus, an increase in the strength of the dollar versus the euro and the Canadian dollar decreases our operating costs and increases our operating margins and income from operations. Conversely, a weakening of the dollar against the euro and the Canadian dollar tends to increase our operating costs and decrease our operating margins and income from operations. Our energy, chemical, pallet, biofuel, wood residual and European lumber sales are made in local currencies and, as a result, decline in dollar terms when the dollar strengthens and increase when the dollar weakens. 
 As a corollary to changes in exchange rates between the dollar and the euro and Canadian dollar, a stronger dollar generally increases costs to our customers and results in downward pressure on pulp and lumber prices. Conversely, a weakening dollar generally supports higher pulp and lumber pricing. However, there is invariably a time lag between changes in currency exchange rates and prices. This lag can vary and is not predictable with any precision. 
 Production costs also depend on the total volume of production. High operating rates and production efficiencies permit us to lower our average per unit cost by spreading fixed costs over more units. Higher operating rates also permit us to increase our generation and sales of surplus renewable energy, chemicals and biofuels. Our production levels are also dependent on, among other things, the number of days of maintenance downtime at our mills. 
 Unexpected maintenance downtime can be particularly disruptive in our industry. 
 Selected 2022 Highlights 
 In 2022, we: 
 achieved record net income of 247.0 million and record Operating EBITDA of 536.5 million driven primarily by higher pulp and energy sales realizations; 

significantly expanded our solid wood business through the acquisition of the Torgau facility; 

enhanced our liquidity by establishing the New German Facility with a principal amount of 300.0 million and a five-year term; and 

built up the engineering and design team and enhanced the operations at Mercer Mass Timber to position it to bid on major construction projects and fill out its order book. 

Current Market Environment 
 We currently expect modestly declining NBSK pulp prices in Europe and North America in the first half of 2023 as a result of lower demand due to inflationary pressures negatively impacting paper demand. In China we currently expect modestly higher NBSK pulp prices in the first part of 2023 due to China's reopening after lifting of COVID-19 restrictions and the seasonal demand increase after the lunar new year. For NBHK pulp we currently expect prices to decrease in the first half of 2023 due to additional supply coming online. 
 52 
 
 In our solid wood segment, we currently expect lumber prices to modestly increase in the first half of 2023 due to producer curtailments, low customer inventory levels and the start of the construction season. These positive impacts will be partially offset by lower demand caused by continued economic uncertainty due to inflation and higher interest rates. 
 We currently expect pallet prices to be stable in the first half of 2023 as a result of continued economic uncertainty offset by modestly stronger lumber demand.

 Year Ended December 31, 2022 Compar ed to Year Ended December 31, 2021 
 Consolidated Year Ended December 31, 2022 Compared to Year Ended December 31, 2021 
 Total revenues in 2022 increased by approximately 26 to a record 2,280.9 million from 1,803.3 million in 2021 primarily due to higher sales realizations, higher pulp sales volumes and the inclusion of revenues from our Torgau facility from its acquisition on September 30, 2022. These increases were partially offset by the negative impact of a stronger dollar on our euro denominated energy and European lumber revenues. 
 Energy and chemical revenues increased by approximately 89 to a record 211.8 million in 2022 from 111.9 million in 2021 primarily as a result of strong demand and higher energy prices in Germany, which were double those in 2021. Energy demand and prices in Germany increased primarily from actions restricting the flow of natural gas and oil from Russia resulting from its invasion of Ukraine. 
 Effective December 1, 2022, the German government implemented an energy windfall tax in response to high energy prices which taxes energy revenues at 90 above a base threshold . In 2022, the energy windfall tax expense was 7.8 million and was recognized in cost of sales, excluding depreciation and amortization. 
 In 2022, after reducing energy revenues by the windfall tax our average energy sales realizations in Germany were approximately 219 per MWh compared to about 113 per MWh in 2021. 
 Costs and expenses in 2022 increased by approximately 30 to 1,888.6 million from 1,456.7 million in 2021 primarily due to higher per unit fiber, freight, chemical and energy costs, the inclusion of Torgau s results and a higher pulp sales volume partially offset by the positive impact of a stronger dollar on our euro and Canadian dollar denominated costs and expenses. 
 In 2022, the dollar was 11 stronger against the euro and 4 stronger against the Canadian dollar compared to 2021, which decreased our euro and Canadian dollar denominated costs and expenses. 
 In 2022, cost of sales depreciation and amortization increased by approximately 9 to 144.1 million from 132.1 million in 2021 due to the inclusion of Torgau partially offset by the positive impact of a stronger dollar. 
 Selling, general and administrative expenses increased by approximately 34 to 105.8 million in 2022 from 78.9 million in 2021 primarily due to the acquisition of Torgau and higher employee costs, including stock compensation expense, and consulting costs. 
 In 2022, our operating income increased by approximately 13 to a record 392.4 million from 346.6 million in 2021 primarily due to higher sales realizations, the positive impact of a stronger dollar and higher pulp sales volumes partially offset by higher production costs, including per unit fiber costs, chemical and freight costs. 
 In January 2021, we refinanced, referred to as the Refinancing , a significant portion of our debt by issuing 875.0 million of 5.125 senior notes due 2029 (the 2029 Senior Notes and used the proceeds to redeem and/or repurchase all of our 6.5 2024 Senior Notes and our 7.375 2025 Senior Notes at a cost including premium of 824.6 million, referred to as the Redemption . We recorded a loss on such Redemption of 30.4 million (being 0.46 per share). 
 Interest expense in 2022 increased to 71.5 million from 70.0 million in 2021 primarily as a result of increased borrowings on our revolving credit facilities partially offset by a lower interest rate for our 2029 Senior Notes. 
 Other income in 2022 was 24.4 million compared to 14.4 million in 2021. Other income in both periods is primarily due to foreign exchange gains, caused by a stronger dollar, on dollar denominated cash held at our operations. 
 In 2022, income tax expense was 98.3 million or an effective tax rate of approximately 28 . In 2021, income tax expense was 89.6 million or an effective tax rate of 34 . The decrease in effective tax rate is primarily due to higher 2022 profits being partially sheltered by carryforward tax assets which were previously not recognized. We continue to maintain a full valuation allowance in certain jurisdictions where it is not more likely than not that the deferred tax assets are recoverable. 
 55 
 
 In 2022, our net income was a record 247.0 million, or 3.74 per basic share and 3.71 per diluted share, compared to 171.0 million, or 2.59 per basic share and 2.58 per diluted share in 2021. 
 In 2022, Operating EBITDA increased by approximately 12 to a record 536.5 million from 478.8 million in 2021 as higher sales realizations, the positive impact of a stronger dollar and higher pulp sales volumes were only partially offset by higher per unit fiber costs and other production and freight costs.

Pulp revenues in 2022 increased by approximately 21 to a record 1,686.4 million from 1,389.4 million in 2021 due to higher sales realizations and sales volumes. 
 Energy and chemical revenues increased by approximately 92 to a record 179.7 million in 2022 from 93.7 million in 2021 primarily due to higher sales realizations and sales volumes. During 2022, we benefited from strong energy demand and higher energy prices in Germany. 
 Total pulp production was flat at 1,878,612 ADMTs in 2022 compared to 1,863,893 ADMTs in 2021 as the positive impact of lower annual maintenance downtime at our pulp mills was offset by the negative impact of the fire at the Stendal mill in July 2022, lower production at our Canadian mills as they slowed production as a result of logistics issues and unplanned maintenance downtime. 
 The fire at our Stendal mill resulted in it being down for most of July and, after its restart, operating at a modestly lower production rate. Total lost production due to the fire in 2022 was approximately 68,100 ADMTs. We currently expect to complete the installation of replacement equipment at our Stendal mill in the second quarter of 2023. We maintain property and business interruption insurance for the Stendal pulp mill and the insurer has provided written confirmation of coverage, subject to customary deductibles and limits. In 2022, the insurer provided initial non-refundable payments of 15.1 million for the business interruption claim and an initial 2.2 million payment for the property and casualty claim. 
 In 2022, our pulp mills had 80 days of annual maintenance downtime (approximately 111,000 ADMTs) and an additional six days (approximately 8,400 ADMTs) at our Celgar mill due to a slower than planned start up. We estimate that annual maintenance downtime in 2022 adversely impacted our operating income by approximately 99.0 million, comprised of approximately 70.2 million in direct out-of-pocket expenses and the balance in reduced production. Many of our competitors that report their financial results using International Financial Reporting Standards, referred to as IFRS , capitalize their direct costs of maintenance downtime. In 2021, our pulp mills had 188 days of annual maintenance downtime (approximately 253,700 ADMTs). 
 In 2023, we currently have scheduled maintenance downtime for our pulp mills of an aggregate of 77 days, or approximately 91,000 ADMTs which will be comprised of 3 days in the first quarter, 31 days in the second quarter, 14 days in the third quarter and 29 days in the final quarter. 
 Total pulp sales volumes increased by approximately 6 to 1,917,744 ADMTs in 2022 compared to 1,812,689 ADMTs in 2021 primarily due to the timing of shipments and strong demand. 
 In 2022, third party industry quoted average list prices for NBSK pulp increased from 2021, largely as a result of low customer inventory levels primarily caused by the pandemic and other logistics and shipping issues. Third party industry quoted average list prices for NBSK pulp in Europe and North America were approximately 1,427 per ADMT and 1,704 per ADMT, respectively, in 2022 compared to approximately 1,243 per ADMT and 1,478 per 
 56 
 
 ADMT, respectively, in 2021. Average net prices for NBSK pulp in China were approximately 949 per ADMT in 2022 compared to approximately 850 per ADMT in 2021. 
 Third party industry quoted average list prices for NBHK pulp in North America were approximately 1,514 per ADMT in 2022 compared to approximately 1,225 per ADMT in 2021. Average net prices for NBHK pulp in China were approximately 794 per ADMT in 2022 compared to approximately 661 per ADMT in 2021. 
 Average NBSK pulp sales realizations increased by approximately 12 to 876 per ADMT in 2022 from 779 per ADMT in 2021 and NBHK pulp sales realizations increased by approximately 41 to 869 per ADMT in 2022 from 615 per ADMT in 2021. The higher sales realizations are due to higher list prices. 
 In 2022, we had a positive impact of approximately 106.0 million on operating income due to foreign exchange compared to 2021, primarily as a result of the effect of the stronger dollar on our euro and Canadian dollar denominated costs and expenses. 
 Costs and expenses in 2022 increased by approximately 24 to 1,525.5 million from 1,231.7 million in 2021 primarily due to higher per unit fiber, chemical, freight and energy costs and higher pulp sales volumes. Such higher costs were partially offset by the positive impact of a stronger dollar and our receipt of German regulatory approval to reverse a wastewater fee accrual of 13.3 million as a result of completing certain capital projects. Included in costs and expenses in 2022 is 6.7 million for the German energy windfall tax. 
 On average, in 2022, overall per unit fiber costs increased by approximately 33 from 2021 due to higher per unit fiber costs for all of our mills. Our German mills had higher per unit fiber costs as a result of strong demand from other wood consumers such as heating pellet manufacturers. For our Canadian mills, per unit fiber costs increased due to strong demand in the mills' fiber baskets and for our Celgar mill a decrease in the availability of wood chips due to regional sawmill curtailments. In 2023, we currently expect modestly lower per unit fiber costs with a modest decrease in Germany due to lower demand for wood for energy purposes and generally flat per unit fiber costs in Canada. 
 Transportation costs increased by approximately 29 to 176.2 million in 2022 from 136.3 million in 2021 primarily as a result of the increased use of higher cost trucking and higher freight rates and sales volumes. 
 In 2022, depreciation and amortization modestly decreased to 112.1 million from 115.3 million in 2021 due to the positive impact of foreign exchange partially offset by higher depreciation due to the completion of capital projects. 
 In 2022, pulp segment operating income increased by approximately 35 to a record 340.7 million from 251.7 million in 2021 primarily due to higher sales realizations, the positive impact of a stronger dollar and higher sales volumes being only partially offset by higher production costs, including per unit fiber costs, chemical and freight costs.

 Lumber revenues modestly decreased to 288.0 million in 2022 from 293.2 million in 2021, primarily due to lower sales volumes, partially offset by higher sales realizations. Lumber markets in both the U.S. and Europe were strong in the first half of 2022 but weakened materially later in the year primarily due to higher interest rates and lower housing construction activity. In 2022, the U.S. market accounted for approximately 55 of our lumber revenues and approximately 42 of our lumber sales volumes, while the majority of remaining sales were to Europe. 
 Energy and wood residual revenues increased to a record 43.9 million in 2022 from 17.9 million in 2021 primarily due to higher sales realizations resulting from strong energy demand and prices in Germany. 
 Manufactured products revenues of 22.8 million in 2022 and 2.4 million in 2021 primarily consists of finger joint lumber revenues from our Mercer Mass Timber facility. 
 Pallet revenues of 36.1 million and biofuel revenues of 17.7 million are from the inclusion of Torgau s results since its acquisition on September 30, 2022. 
 Lumber production modestly decreased to 442.2 MMfbm in 2022 from 447.9 MMfbm in 2021 due to planned maintenance downtime. 
 Lumber sales volumes modestly decreased to 409.9 MMfbm in 2022 from 419.7 MMfbm in 2021 due to the timing of sales and weaker demand in the later half of 2022 . 
 Average lumber sales realizations modestly increased to 703 per Mfbm in 2022 from 699 per Mfbm in 2021 as overall higher average pricing in both the European and U.S. markets was only partially offset by the negative impact of foreign exchange on our euro denominated sales. European lumber pricing increased due to steady demand with limited supply. U.S. lumber pricing increased due to strong demand at the start of the year from the housing and renovation markets before declining sharply in the later part of 2022. 
 Fiber costs were approximately 75 of our lumber cash production costs in 2022. In 2022 per unit fiber costs increased by approximately 19 from 2021 as a result of using more green wood and strong demand for sawlogs partially offset by the positive impact of a stronger dollar on our euro denominated fiber costs. 
 Transportation costs increased by approximately 33 to 45.6 million in 2022 from 34.4 million in 2021 primarily due to higher freight rates and the inclusion of Torgau. 
 In 2022, depreciation and amortization for our solid wood segment increased to 31.2 million from 15.8 million in 2021 primarily due to the inclusion of Torgau. Torgau s amortization included 8.3 million for the order backlog intangible asset acquired. 
 In 2022, our solid wood segment operating income decreased by approximately 33 to 70.6 million compared to 106.1 million in 2021 primarily due to higher per unit fiber costs and higher other production and freight costs partially offset by higher sales realizations. 
 Sensiti vities 
 The following sensitivity analysis provides only a limited point-in-time view of the pulp price, lumber price, fiber costs, foreign exchange rates and inflation discussed. The actual impact of the underlying price, rate and inflation changes may differ materially from that shown in the sensitivity analysis. 
 Our earnings are sensitive to, among other things, fluctuations in: 
 Pulp Price. Pulp is a global commodity that is priced in dollars, whose markets are highly competitive and cyclical in nature. As a result, our earnings are sensitive to pulp price changes. Based upon our 2022 sales volume and assuming all other factors remained constant, each 10.00 per tonne change in pulp third party industry quoted list prices yields a change in pulp revenues of approximately 14.1 million. 
 58 
 
 Lumber Price. Lumber markets are highly competitive and cyclical in nature. As a result, our earnings are sensitive to lumber price changes. Based upon our 2022 sales volume and assuming all other factors remain constant, each 10.00 per Mfbm change in lumber price yields a change in lumber revenues of approximately 4.1 million. 
 Fiber Costs. Our main raw material is fiber in the form of wood chips, pulp logs and sawlogs. Fiber is a commodity and both prices and supply are cyclical. As a result, our operating costs are sensitive to fiber cost changes. For our pulp segment, based upon our 2022 fiber costs and assuming all other factors remained constant, each 1 change in per unit fiber cost yields a change in annual operating costs of approximately 5.2 million. For our solid wood segment, based upon our 2022 fiber costs and assuming all other factors remained constant, each 1 change in per unit fiber cost yields a change in annual operating costs of approximately 1.8 million. 
 Foreign Exchange. Our operating costs are in euros for our German mills and Canadian dollars for our Canadian mills. As a result, our operating costs will fluctuate with changes in the value of the dollar relative to the euro and Canadian dollar. Based on our 2022 operating costs and assuming all other factors remained constant, each 0.01 change in the value of the dollar relative to the Canadian dollar yields a total change in annual operating costs of approximately 9.9 million. Based on our 2022 operating costs and assuming all other factors remained constant, each 0.01 change in the value of the dollar relative to the euro yields a total change in annual operating costs of approximately 9.2 million. 
 Our energy, chemical, pallet, biofuel, wood residual and European lumber sales are made in local currencies and, as a result, will fluctuate with changes in the value of the dollar relative to the euro and Canadian dollar. Based on our 2022 energy, chemical, pallet, biofuel, wood residual and European lumber revenues and assuming all other factors remained constant, each 0.01 change in the value of the dollar relative to the euro yields a total change in revenues of approximately 3.1 million. Based on our 2022 energy and chemical revenues and assuming all other factors remained constant, each 0.01 change in the value of the dollar relative to the Canadian dollar yields a total change in energy and chemical revenues of approximately 0.3 million. 
 Inflation. Our key production input costs are for fiber, chemicals and energy. Other material costs in our business include labor and transportation. As a result, our operating costs are sensitive to inflation. For our pulp segment, based upon our 2022 cash production costs and assuming all other factors remained constant, each 1 change in per unit cash production cost yields a change in annual cash production costs of approximately 10.8 million. For our solid wood segment, based upon our 2022 cash production costs and assuming all other factors remained constant, each 1 change in per unit cash production cost yields a change in annual cash production costs of approximately 2.6 million. 
 Seasonal Influences. We are exposed to fluctuations in quarterly sales volumes and expenses due to seasonal factors. These factors are common in the pulp and lumber industries. We generally have weaker pulp demand in Europe during the summer holiday months and in China in the period relating to the lunar new year. We typically have a seasonal build-up in raw material inventories in the early winter months as the mills build up their fiber supply for the winter when there is reduced availability.

We operate in a cyclical industry and our operating cash flows vary accordingly. Our principal operating cash expenditures are for fiber, labor, chemicals and debt service. 
 59 
 
 Working capital levels fluctuate throughout the year and are affected by maintenance downtime, changing sales patterns, seasonality and the timing of receivables and the payment of payables and expenses. Generally, finished goods inventories are increased prior to scheduled maintenance downtime to maintain sales volume while production is stopped. Our fiber inventories exhibit seasonal swings as we increase pulp log, sawlog and wood chip inventories to ensure adequate supply of fiber to our mills during the winter months. Changes in sales volume can affect the level of receivables and influence overall working capital levels. We believe our management practices with respect to working capital conform to common business practices.

Interest on our 2029 Senior Notes is paid semi-annually in February and August of each year, commencing August 2021. 

As of December 31, 2022, we had cash and cash equivalents of 354.0 million and approximately 281.6 million available under our revolving credit facilities providing us with aggregate liquidity of about 635.6 million. 
 As of December 31, 2022, we had no material commitments to acquire assets or operating businesses. 
 In 2023, excluding amounts being financed through government grants, we currently expect capital expenditures to be approximately 175.0 million to 200.0 million. 
 We currently consider the majority of undistributed earnings of our foreign subsidiaries to be indefinitely reinvested and, accordingly, no U.S. income tax has been provided on such earnings. However, if we were required to repatriate

 funds to the United States, we believe that we currently could repatriate the majority thereof without incurring any material amount of taxes as a result of our shareholder advances and U.S. tax reform. However, it is currently not practical to estimate the income tax liability that might be incurred if such earnings were remitted to the United States. Substantially all of our undistributed earnings are held by our foreign subsidiaries outside of the United States. 
 Based upon the current level of operations and our current expectations for future periods in light of the current economic environment, and in particular, current and expected pulp and lumber pricing and foreign exchange rates, we believe that cash flow from operations and available cash, together with available borrowings under our revolving credit facilities, will be adequate to finance the capital requirements for our business including the payment of our quarterly dividend during the next 12 months. 
 In the future we may make acquisitions of businesses or assets or commitments to additional capital projects. To achieve the long-term goals of expanding our assets and earnings, including through acquisitions, capital resources will be required. Depending on the size of a transaction, the capital resources that will be required can be substantial. The necessary resources will be generated from cash flow from operations, cash on hand, borrowing against our assets or the issuance of securities.

(1) In September 2022, replaced the prior 200.0 million facility for our German subsidiaries. 

(2) In January 2022, discharged and replaced with the Canadian Revolving Facility. 

(3) In January 2021, we issued 875.0 million in 2029 Senior Notes and used a portion of the net proceeds to refinance and discharge in full the 2024 Senior Notes and 2025 Senior Notes. 

For a description of such indebtedness, see Item 1. Business Description of Certain Indebtedness . 
 Certain of our long-term obligations contain various financial tests and covenants customary to these types of arrangements. 
 Under the New German Facility, the Obligors must not exceed a ratio of net debt to EBITDA of 3.50:1:00 in any 12 month period and maintain defined capital of not less than 500.0 million. 
 The Canadian Revolving Facility includes a covenant that so long as the excess amount under the facility is less than the greater of 10 of the line cap thereunder and C 14.0 million, in either case, for five consecutive days or less than the greater of 7.5 of the line cap and C 10.0 million, at any time, and which requires the borrowers to comply, on a combined basis, with a 1.00:1.00 fixed charge coverage ratio. 
 The New German Facility is provided by a syndicate of six financial institutions and the Canadian Revolving Facility is provided by three financial institutions. To date we have not experienced any reductions in credit availability with respect to these credit facilities. However, if any of these financial institutions were to default on their commitment to fund, we could be adversely affected. 
 The indentures governing the Senior Notes do not contain any financial maintenance covenants and there are no scheduled principal payments until maturity. Interest on our 2026 Senior Notes is payable semi-annually in arrears on 
 62 
 
 January 15 and July 15, at the rate of 5.50 and they mature in January 2026. Interest on our 2029 Senior Notes is payable semi-annually in arrears on February 1 and August 1, at the rate of 5.125 and they mature in February 2029. 
 As of December 31, 2022, we were in full compliance with all of the covenants of our indebtedness. 
 Foreign Currency 
 Our reporting currency is the dollar. However, we hold certain assets and liabilities in euros and Canadian dollars and the majority of our expenditures are denominated in euros or Canadian dollars. Accordingly, our consolidated financial results are subject to foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations. 
 We translate foreign denominated assets and liabilities into dollars at the rate of exchange on the balance sheet date. Equity accounts are translated using historical exchange rates. Unrealized gains or losses from these translations are recognized in our other comprehensive income (loss) and do not affect our net earnings. 
 In 2022, accumulated other comprehensive loss increased by 89.2 million to 180.0 million, primarily due to the foreign currency translation adjustment. 
 Based upon the exchange rate as of December 31, 2022, the dollar was approximately 6 stronger against both the euro and the Canadian dollar since December 31, 2021. See Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk . 
 Credit Ratings o f Senior Notes 
 We and our Senior Notes are rated by Standard Poor s Rating Services, referred to as S P , and Moody s Investors Service, Inc., referred to as Moody s . 
 S P and Moody s base their assessment of the credit risk on our Senior Notes on the business and financial profile of Mercer Inc. and our restricted subsidiaries under the indentures governing the Senior Notes. As of December 31, 2022, all of our subsidiaries are restricted subsidiaries. Factors that may affect our credit rating include changes in our operating performance and liquidity. Credit rating downgrades can adversely impact, among other things, future borrowing costs and access to capital markets. 
 In August 2022, S P confirmed its outlook is stable and confirmed its rating on our Senior Notes is B+. Its recovery rating remained unchanged as 3 . In December 2022, Moody's confirmed its rating on our Senior Notes is Ba3 and its outlook is stable. 
 Credit ratings are not recommendations to buy, sell or hold securities and may be subject to revision or withdrawal by the assigning rating organization. Each rating should be evaluated independently of any other rating. 
 Critical Accoun ting Policies 
 The preparation of financial statements and related disclosures in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect both the amount and the timing of recording of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses in the consolidated financial statements and accompanying note disclosures. Our management routinely makes judgments and estimates about the effects of matters that are inherently uncertain. As the number of variables and assumptions affecting the probable future resolution of the uncertainties increase, these judgments become even more subjective and complex. 
 Our significant accounting policies are disclosed in Note 1 to our audited annual consolidated financial statements included in Part IV of this annual report. While all of the significant accounting policies are important to the consolidated financial statements, some of these policies may be viewed as having a high degree of judgment. On an ongoing basis using currently available information, management reviews its estimates, including those related to accounting for, among other things, pension and other post-retirement benefit obligations, deferred income taxes (valuation allowance and permanent reinvestment), depreciation and amortization, future cash flows associated with impairment testing for long-lived assets, the allocation of the purchase price in a business combination to the assets 
 63 
 
 acquired and liabilities assumed, legal liabilities and contingencies. Actual results could differ materially from these estimates, and changes in these estimates are recorded when known. 
 The following accounting policies require management s most difficult, subjective and complex judgments, and are subject to a fair degree of measurement uncertainty. 
 Pension and Other Post-Retirement Benefit Obligations 
 We maintain defined benefit pension plans and an other post-retirement benefit plan for certain employees of our Peace River mill and our Celgar mill which are funded based on actuarial estimates and requirements and are non-contributory. We recognize the net funded status of the plans and we record net periodic benefit costs associated with these net obligations. As of December 31, 2022, we had pension and other post-retirement benefit obligations aggregating 104.1 million and accumulated pension plan assets with a fair value of 95.6 million. Our 2022 net periodic pension and other post-retirement benefit cost was 1.7 million. The amounts recorded for the net pension and other post-retirement obligations include various judgments and uncertainties. 
 The following inputs are used to determine our net obligations and our net periodic benefit costs each year and the determination of these inputs requires judgment: 
 discount rate used to determine the net present value of our pension and other post-retirement benefit obligations and to determine the interest cost component of our net periodic pension and other post-retirement benefit costs; 

return on assets used to estimate the growth in the value of invested assets that are available to satisfy pension obligations and to determine the expected return on the plan assets component of our net periodic pension costs; 

mortality rate used to estimate the impact of mortality on pension and other post-retirement benefit obligations; 

rate of compensation increase used to calculate the impact future pay increases will have on pension benefit obligations; and 

health care cost trend rate used to calculate the impact of future health care costs on other post-retirement benefit obligations. 

For the discount rate, we use the rates available on high-quality corporate bonds with a duration that is expected to match the timing of expected pension and other post-retirement benefit obligations. High-quality corporate bonds are those with a rating of AA or better. 
 In determining the expected return on assets, we consider the historical long-term returns, expected asset mix and the active management premium. 
 For the mortality rate we use actuarially-determined mortality tables that are consistent with our historical mortality experience and future expectations for mortality of the employees who participate in our pension and other post-retirement benefit plans. 
 In determining the rate of compensation increase, we review historical compensation increases and promotions, while considering current industry conditions, the terms of collective bargaining agreements with employees and the outlook for the industry. 
 For the health care cost trend rate, we consider historical trends for these costs, as well as recently enacted health care legislation. We also compare our health care rate to those of our industry. 
 64 
 
 Variations in assumptions described above could have a significant effect on the pension and other post-retirement benefits, net periodic benefit cost and obligation reported in our consolidated financial statements. For example, a one-percentage point change in any one of the following assumptions would have increased (decreased) our 2022 net periodic benefit cost and our accrued benefit obligation as follows:

Deferred Taxes 
 As of December 31, 2022, we had 126.0 million in deferred tax liabilities. Our tax assets are net of a 38.9 million valuation allowance. Our deferred tax assets are comprised primarily of tax loss and interest carryforwards and deductible temporary differences, all of which will reduce taxable income in the future. We assess the realization of these deferred tax assets at each reporting period to determine whether it is more likely than not that the deferred tax assets will be realized. Our assessment includes a review of all available positive and negative evidence, including, but not limited to, the following: 
 the history of the tax loss carryforwards and their expiry dates; 

future reversals of temporary differences; 

our historical and projected earnings; and 

tax planning opportunities. 

Significant judgment is required when evaluating the positive and negative evidence, specifically the Company s estimates of future earnings. The weight given to negative and positive evidence is commensurate with the extent to which it can be objectively verified. Operating results during the most recent three-year period are generally given more weight than expectations of future profitability, which are inherently uncertain. A cumulative loss position during the most recent three-year period is considered significant negative evidence in assessing the realizability of deferred income tax assets that is difficult to overcome. 
 Once our evaluation of the evidence is complete, if we believe that it is more likely than not that some of the deferred tax assets will not be realized, based on currently available information, an income tax valuation allowance is recorded against the deferred tax assets. 
 If market conditions improve or tax planning opportunities arise in the future, we may reduce our valuation allowance, resulting in future tax benefits. If market conditions deteriorate in the future, we may increase our valuation allowance, resulting in future tax expenses. Any change in tax laws may change the valuation allowances in future periods. 
 Long-Lived Assets 
 As of December 31, 2022, we had long-lived assets recorded in our Consolidated Balance Sheet of 1,433.8 million. These long-lived assets include property, plant and equipment, net, amortizable intangible assets, net and goodwill. In 2022, we recorded depreciation and amortization of 144.2 million and no impairment charges. Depreciation and amortization and impairment charges are based on accounting estimates. 
 The calculation of depreciation and amortization of long-lived assets requires us to apply judgment in selecting the remaining useful lives of the assets. The remaining useful life of an asset must address both physical and economic considerations. The remaining economic life of a long-lived asset may be shorter than its physical life. The pulp industry has historically been characterized by considerable uncertainty in business conditions. Estimates of future economic conditions for our long-lived assets and therefore, their remaining useful economic life, require considerable judgment. 
 65 
 
 If our estimate of the remaining useful life changes, such a change is accounted for prospectively in our determination of depreciation and amortization. Actual depreciation and amortization charges for an individual asset may therefore be significantly accelerated if the outlook for its remaining useful life is shortened considerably. 
 The unit of accounting for impairment testing for long-lived assets is its Asset Group , which includes property, plant and equipment, net, amortizable intangible assets, net, goodwill and liabilities directly related to those assets. We evaluate an Asset Group for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable, such as continuing operating losses. When an indicator that the carrying value of an Asset Group may not be recoverable is triggered, we compare the carrying value of the Asset Group to its forecasted undiscounted future cash flows. If the carrying value of the Asset Group is greater than the undiscounted future cash flows an impairment charge is recorded based on the excess of the Asset Group s carrying value over its fair value. 
 Impairment testing for long-lived assets requires us to apply judgment in estimating the future cash flows of the Asset Group. The significant estimates in the future cash flows include periods of operation, projections of product pricing, production levels, fiber and other production costs and maintenance spending. When performing impairment tests, we estimate the fair values of the assets using management s best assumptions, which we believe would be consistent with the assumptions that a hypothetical marketplace participant would use. Estimates and assumptions used in these tests are evaluated and updated each period an impairment indicator is triggered. 
 Actual asset impairment losses could vary considerably from estimated impairment losses if actual results are not consistent with the assumptions and judgments used in estimating future cash flows. 
 Business Combination 
 We allocate the total purchase price of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on their estimated fair values as of the business combination date. In developing estimates of fair values for long-lived assets, including identifiable intangible assets, we utilize a variety of inputs including forecasted cash flows, discount rates, estimated replacement costs and depreciation and obsolescence factors. Determining the fair value for specifically identified intangible assets, such as contracts, involves significant judgment. We may refine our estimates and make adjustments to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed over a measurement period, not to exceed one year. Upon the conclusion of the measurement period or the final determination of the values of assets acquired and liabilities assumed, whichever comes first, any subsequent adjustments are charged to earnings. Subsequent actual results of the underlying business activity supporting the specifically identified intangible assets could change, requiring us to record impairment charges or accelerate the remaining useful life. 
 Contingent Liabilities 
 We are subject to lawsuits, investigations and other claims related to environmental, product and other matters, and are required to assess the likelihood of any adverse judgments or outcomes to these matters, as well as potential ranges of probable losses. We disclose contingent liabilities when there is a reasonable possibility that an ultimate loss may occur and we record contingent liabilities when it becomes probable that we will have to make payments and the amount of loss can be reasonably estimated. 
 Assessing probability of loss and estimating probable losses requires analysis of multiple factors, including, but not limited to, the following: 
 historical experience; 

judgments about the potential actions of third-party claimants and courts; and 

recommendations of legal counsel. 

Contingent liabilities are based on the best information available and actual losses in any future period are inherently uncertain. If estimated probable future losses or actual losses exceed our recorded liability for such claims, we would record additional charges. These exposures and proceedings can be significant and the ultimate negative outcomes could be material to our operating results or liquidity in any given quarter or year.

 See Note 1 to our consolidated financial statements included in Item 15 of this annual report on Form 10-K. 
 ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITA TIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK 
 We are exposed to risks associated with fluctuations in: 
 foreign currency exchange rates; 

prices for the products we manufacture; 

fiber costs; 

credit risk; 

inflation; and 

interest rates. 

For a discussion of our earnings sensitivities to foreign exchange rates, pulp and lumber prices, fiber costs and inflation, see Item 7. Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Sensitivities on page 51 hereof. 
 Foreign Currency Exchange Risk 
 We compete with producers from around the world, particularly Europe and North America, in our product lines. We sell our principal product, pulp, mainly in transactions denominated in dollars but sell certain other products including energy, chemicals, pallets, biofuels, wood residuals and European lumber in local currencies, being euros and Canadian dollars. Changes in the relative strength or weakness of the dollar versus the euro and the Canadian dollar affect our operating costs and margins. A stronger dollar lowers our operating costs but can in turn increase the cost of pulp to our customers and thereby create downward pressure on prices. On the other hand, a weaker dollar tends to increase our operating costs but tends to support higher pulp prices. 
 We are particularly sensitive to changes in the value of the dollar versus the euro and Canadian dollar. We expect exchange rate fluctuations to continue to impact costs and revenues, but we cannot predict the magnitude or direction of this effect for any period, and there can be no assurance of any future effects. 
 Furthermore, certain of our assets and liabilities are denominated in euros and Canadian dollars. A depreciation of these currencies against the dollar will decrease the fair value of such financial instrument assets and an appreciation of these currencies against the dollar will increase the fair value of such financial instrument liabilities, thereby decreasing our fair value. An appreciation of these currencies against the dollar will increase the fair value of such financial instrument assets and a depreciation of these currencies against the dollar will decrease the fair value of financial instrument liabilities, thereby increasing our fair value. As a result, our earnings can be subject to the potentially significant effect of foreign currency translation gains or losses in respect of these euros and Canadian dollar items.

Product Pr ice Risk 
 Historically, economic and market shifts, fluctuations in capacity and changes in foreign currency exchange rates have created cyclical changes in prices, sales volume and margins for our principal products, being kraft pulp and lumber. In general, our products are commodities that are widely available from other producers and, because these products have few distinguishing qualities from producer to producer, competition is based primarily on price which is determined by supply relative to demand. The overall levels of demand for the products we manufacture, and consequently our sales and profitability, reflect fluctuations in end user demand. 
 Fiber Pr ice Risk 
 Fiber in the form of wood chips, pulp logs and sawlogs represents our largest operating cost. Fiber is a market-priced commodity and, as such, is subject to fluctuations in prices based on supply and demand. Increases in the prices of fiber will tend to increase our operating costs and reduce our operating margins. 
 Infla tion Risk 
 Our key production input costs are for fiber, chemicals and energy. Other material costs in our business include labor and transportation. As a result, our operating costs are sensitive to inflation. Increases in inflation will tend to increase our operating costs and reduce our operating margins. 
 Interest R ate Risk 
 Fluctuations in interest rates may affect the fair value of fixed interest rate financial instruments which are sensitive to such fluctuations. A decrease in interest rates may increase the fair value of such fixed interest rate financial instrument assets and an increase in interest rates may decrease the fair value of such fixed interest rate financial instrument liabilities, thereby increasing our fair value. An increase in interest rates may decrease the fair value of such fixed interest rate financial instrument assets and a decrease in interest rates may increase the fair value of such 
 68 
 
 fixed interest rate financial instrument liabilities, thereby decreasing our fair value. We may seek to manage our interest rate risks through the use of interest rate derivatives. 
 The following tables provide information about our exposure to interest rate fluctuations for the financial instruments sensitive to such fluctuations as of December 31, 2022 and expected cash flows from these instruments:

(4) The Canadian Revolving Facility bearing interest by way of: (i) Canadian denominated advances, which bear interest at a designated prime rate per annum; (ii) banker s acceptance equivalent loans, which bear interest at the applicable Canadian dollar banker s acceptance plus 1.20 to 1.45 per annum; (iii) dollar denominated base rate advances at the greater of the federal funds rate plus 0.50 , an Adjusted Term SOFR for a one month tenor plus 1.00 and the bank s applicable reference rate for U.S. dollar loans; and (iv) dollar SOFR advances, which bear interest at Adjusted Term SOFR plus 1.20 to 1.45 per annum. 

Credit Risk 
 Our credit risk is primarily attributable to cash held in bank accounts and accounts receivable. We maintain cash balances in foreign financial institutions in excess of insured limits. We limit our credit exposure on cash held in bank accounts by periodically investing cash in excess of short-term operating requirements and debt obligations in low risk government bonds, or similar debt instruments. Our credit risk associated with our sales is managed through setting credit limits, the purchase of credit insurance and for certain customers a letter of credit is received prior to shipping the product. We review new customers credit history before granting credit and conduct regular reviews of existing customers credit. Concentrations of credit risk are with customers and agents based primarily in Germany, China and the U.S. 
 Risk Management and Derivatives 
 We seek to manage these risks through internal risk management policies as well as, from time to time, through the periodic use of derivatives. We may also from time to time use derivatives to reduce or limit our exposure to interest rate and currency risks. We may also use derivatives to reduce or limit our exposure to fluctuations in pulp and lumber prices. We may use derivatives to reduce our potential losses or to augment our potential gains, depending on our management s perception of future economic events and developments. These types of derivatives are generally highly speculative in nature. They are also very volatile as they are highly leveraged given that margin requirements are relatively low in proportion to notional amounts. 
 The principal derivatives we have periodically previously used are interest rate derivatives, pulp price derivatives, energy derivatives and foreign exchange derivatives. 
 Many of our strategies, including the use of derivatives, and the types of derivatives selected by us, are based on historical trading patterns and correlations and our management s expectations of future events. However, these 
 69 
 
 strategies may not be effective in all market environments or against all types of risks. Unexpected market developments may affect our risk management strategies during this time, and unanticipated developments could impact our risk management strategies in the future. If any of the variety of instruments and strategies we utilize is not effective, we may incur significant losses. 
 As of December 31, 2022 and December 31, 2021, we had no outstanding derivatives. 
 However, in the future, we may from time to time use foreign exchange derivatives to convert some of our costs (including currency swaps relating to our long-term indebtedness) from euros or Canadian dollars to dollars as our principal product is priced in dollars. We have also converted some of our costs to dollars by issuing long-term dollar-denominated debt in the form of our Senior Notes. We may also from time to time use pulp or lumber derivatives to fix price realizations and interest rate derivatives to fix the rate of interest on indebtedness. 
 We record unrealized gains and losses on our outstanding derivatives when they are marked to market at the end of each reporting period and realized gains or losses on them when they are settled. We determine market valuations based primarily upon valuations provided by our counterparties. 
 We are exposed to modest credit related risks in the event of non-performance by counterparties to derivative contracts.

 ITEM 9A. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES 
 Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures 
 Our management, with the participation of our principal executive officer and principal financial officer, has evaluated the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures (as such term is defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act), as of the end of the period covered by this annual report on Form 10-K. Disclosure controls and procedures include, without limitation, controls and procedures designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in the reports we file or submit under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to management, including our principal executive officer and principal financial officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. Based on such evaluation, our principal executive officer and principal financial officer have concluded that, as of the end of the period covered by this report, our disclosure controls and procedures are effective in recording, processing, summarizing and reporting, on a timely basis, information required to be disclosed by us in the reports that we file or submit under the Exchange Act. 
 It should be noted that any system of controls is based in part upon certain assumptions designed to obtain reasonable (and not absolute) assurance as to its effectiveness, and there can be no assurance that any design will succeed in achieving its stated goals. 
 Management s Report on Internal C ontrol Over Financial Reporting 
 Our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting. Mercer s internal control over financial reporting is designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with GAAP. 
 70 
 
 Our internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that: 
 pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of Mercer; 

provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with GAAP, and that receipts and expenditures are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors; and 

provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements. 

Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. 
 Management assessed the effectiveness of Mercer s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2022. In making this assessment, management used the criteria set forth in Internal Control-Integrated Framework , as issued in 2013 by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO). Based on our assessment and those criteria, management concluded that the Company's internal control over financial reporting was effective as of December 31, 2022. 
 
 Management has excluded Torgau from its assessment of internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2022, because it was acquired in a purchase business combination in September 2022. The total assets and total revenues excluded from management s assessment of internal control over financial reporting represent 13 and 3 , respectively, of the related consolidated financial statement amounts as of and for the year ended December 31, 2022. 
 The effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2022 has been audited by , an independent registered public accounting firm, as stated in their attestation report which appears in this annual report on Form 10-K. 
 Changes in Int ernal Controls 
 There have been no changes in our internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Exchange Act) during the period that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.

 Report of Inde pendent Registered Public Accounting Firm 
 
 To the Shareholders and Board of Directors of Mercer International Inc. 
 Opinions on the Financial Statements and Internal Control over Financial Reporting 
 We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Mercer International Inc. and its subsidiaries (together, the Company) as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, and the related consolidated statements of operations, comprehensive income, changes in shareholders equity and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2022, including the related notes (collectively referred to as the consolidated financial statements). We also have audited the Company s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2022, based on criteria established in Internal Control Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO). 
 In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2022 in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. Also in our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2022, based on criteria established in Internal Control Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the COSO. 
 Basis for Opinions 
 The Company s management is responsible for these consolidated financial statements, for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting, and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in Management's Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting appearing under Item 9A. Our responsibility is to express opinions on the Company s consolidated financial statements and on the Company s internal control over financial reporting based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB) and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. 
 We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audits to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud, and whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. 
 Our audits of the consolidated financial statements included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the consolidated financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the consolidated financial statements. Our audit of internal control over financial reporting included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk. Our audits also included performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinions. 
 As described in Management's Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting, management has excluded the parent company of Holzindustrie Torgau KG and its subsidiaries (Torgau) from its assessment of internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2022 because it was acquired by the Company in a purchase business combination during the year ended December 31, 2022. We have also excluded Torgau from our audit of internal control over financial reporting. Torgau is a wholly-owned subsidiary whose total assets and total revenues excluded from management s assessment and 
 79 
 
 our audit of internal control over financial reporting represent 351 million and 62 million, respectively, of the related consolidated financial statement amounts as of and for the year ended December 31, 2022. 
 Definition and Limitations of Internal Control over Financial Reporting 
 A company s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (i) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (ii) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (iii) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements. 
 Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. 
 Critical Audit Matters 
 The critical audit matters communicated below are matters arising from the current period audit of the consolidated financial statements that were communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that (i) relate to accounts or disclosures that are material to the consolidated financial statements and (ii) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion on the consolidated financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matters below, providing separate opinions on the critical audit matters or on the accounts or disclosures to which they relate. 
 Valuation of property, plant and equipment (PP E) related to the acquisition of Holzindustrie Torgau KG (Torgau) 
 As described in Notes 1 and 2 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company completed the acquisition of Wood Holdco GmbH, which is the parent company of Torgau, for total cash consideration of 270.0 million 263.2 million) on September 30, 2022. Management accounted for this transaction as a business combination using the acquisition method. Under this method, identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed are recorded at their respective fair market values at the date of acquisition. Management recorded the acquired PP E of Torgau at an aggregated fair value of 205.5 million on the date of acquisition, of which a significant portion was based on the cost approach. Management applied significant judgment in estimating the fair value of PP E acquired using the cost approach, which involved the use of assumptions with respect to estimated replacement costs, estimated useful lives, as well as physical, functional and economic obsolescence, as applicable, at the time of acquisition. 
 The principal considerations for our determination that performing procedures relating to the valuation of PP E related to the acquisition of Torgau is a critical audit matter are (i) the high degree of auditor judgment and subjectivity in performing procedures relating to the fair value measurement of PP E acquired due to the significant amount of judgment required by management when developing the fair value using the cost approach and (ii) the significant audit effort in evaluating the assumptions with respect to this estimate, related to estimated replacement costs, estimated useful lives, as well as physical, functional and economic condition obsolescence, as applicable, at the time of acquisition. In addition, the audit effort involved the use of professionals with specialized skill and knowledge. 
 Addressing the matter involved performing procedures and evaluating audit evidence in connection with forming our overall opinion on the consolidated financial statements. These procedures included testing the effectiveness of controls relating to the acquisition accounting, including controls over management s valuation of the acquired PP E and controls over the development of the assumptions used in the 
 80 
 
 valuation of acquired PP E. These procedures also included, among others, (i) reading the sale and purchase agreement, and (ii) testing management s process for estimating the fair value of the acquired PP E using the cost approach, which included for a sample of the acquired PP E, testing the completeness and accuracy of underlying data used in the valuations, and with the assistance of professionals with specialized skill and knowledge, evaluating whether the assumptions used by management were reasonable by considering consistency with external market and industry data and evaluating the appropriateness of the valuation approach. 
 
 Pulp and lumber revenue recognition 
 As described in Notes 1 and 18 to the consolidated financial statements, management recognizes pulp and lumber revenue when obligations under the terms of a contract with its customer are satisfied; generally, this occurs with the transfer of control of the products sold. Transfer of control to the customer is based on the standardized shipping terms in the contract. The standardized shipping terms are such that (i) for European sales sent by truck or train from the mills directly to the customer, control transfers once the truck or train leaves the mill; (ii) for orders sent by ocean freighter, control transfers at the time the product passes the ship s rail; and (iii) for North American sales shipped by truck or train, control transfers once the truck or train has arrived at the customer s specified location. The transaction price is included in the sales contract and is net of customer discounts, rebates and other selling concessions. Pulp revenue amounted to 1,686 million and lumber revenue amounted to 288 million from external customers for the year ended December 31, 2022. 
 The principal considerations for our determination that performing procedures relating to pulp and lumber revenue recognition is a critical audit matter are the magnitude of the balance and the significant audit effort in performing procedures and evaluating audit evidence related to revenue recognition for pulp and lumber sales. 
 Addressing the matter involved performing procedures and evaluating audit evidence in connection with forming our overall opinion on the consolidated financial statements. These procedures included testing the effectiveness of controls relating to the pulp and lumber revenue recognition process, including controls over accuracy, occurrence and cut-off of revenue recognized. These procedures also included, among others, (i) evaluating the accuracy and occurrence of pulp and lumber revenue for a sample of pulp and lumber revenue transactions by obtaining and inspecting source documents, including invoices, sales contracts, shipping and/or delivery documents and cash receipts, as applicable and (ii) testing the cut-off for a sample of pulp and lumber revenue transactions by comparing the date on which revenue was recognized to the actual shipment or delivery date as relevant based on the applicable shipping terms.

 of the greater of the accrued benefit obligation and the fair value of plan assets as of the beginning of the year. The Company recognizes the net funded status of the plan. The Company also has a multiemployer pension plan and defined contribution plans for which contributions are expensed in the Consolidated Statements of Operations. 
 Note 1. The Company and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies (continued) 
 Note 1. The Company and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies (continued) The Company s pulp sales are to tissue and paper producers and the Company s lumber sales are to manufacturers and retailers. The Company s sales in Europe and North America are direct to the customer. The Company s pulp sales to overseas customers are primarily through third party sales agents and the Company s lumber sales to overseas customers are either direct to the customer or through third party sales agents. The Company is the principal in all of the arrangements with third party sales agents. Energy Revenues Energy sales are to utility companies in Canada and Germany. Sales of energy are recognized as the electricity is consumed by the customer and is based on contractual usage rates and meter readings that measure electricity consumption. Pallet, Chemical, Biofuel and Wood Residual Revenues Pallet, chemical, biofuel and wood residual revenues sold from the German mills are sold primarily into the European market. Pallet and biofuel sales are sold to the end customer or to a trader. Chemical and wood residual sales are sold direct to the customer. These sales typically have shipping terms where control transfers once the product is loaded onto the truck at the mill. Mass Timber Revenues Mass timber includes CLT manufactured at Mercer Mass Timber. A mass timber sales contract will typically represent a single distinct performance obligation due to the highly interdependent and interrelated nature of the underlying goods and/or services provided. Mass timber contract revenue is recognized over the contract term as the work progresses because of the continuous transfer of control to the customer. The customer typically controls the work in process as evidenced by the Company's right to payment of the transaction price associated with work performed to date on products or services that do not have an alternative use to the Company. The accounting for the mass timber contracts involves a judgmental process of estimating total sales, costs and profit for the performance obligation. Cost of sales is recognized as incurred. The amount reported as revenues is determined by adding a proportionate amount of the estimated profit to the amount reported as cost of sales. Recognizing revenue as costs are incurred provides an objective measure of progress and thereby best depicts the extent of transfer of control to the customer. Changes in estimated revenues, cost of sales and the related effect on operating income are recognized using a cumulative catch-up adjustment which recognizes in the current period the cumulative effect of the changes on current and prior periods based on the contract s percentage-of-completion. 
 
 Note 1. The Company and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies (continued) 
 . The fair value of PSUs granted with a performance condition is based upon the targeted number of shares to be awarded and the quoted market price of the Company s shares at that date. The fair value of PSUs granted with a market and performance condition is estimated using a Monte Carlo simulation model using historical volatility and a risk-free interest rate. The Company estimates forfeitures of PSUs based on management s expectations and recognizes compensation cost only for those awards expected to vest. Estimated forfeitures are adjusted to actual experience at each balance sheet date. The fair value of restricted shares, restricted stock units RSUs ), and deferred stock units DSUs is determined based upon the number of shares or units granted and the quoted price of the Company s common shares on the date of grant. The vesting period is generally .

Note 2. Acquisitions (continued) The purchase price allocation was based on a preliminary valuation and may be revised as a result of additional information obtained regarding the assets acquired and liabilities assumed, and revisions of provisional estimates of fair value, including, but not limited to, the completion of valuations related to property, plant, and equipment and the identification of intangible assets. The purchase price allocation will be finalized during the 12 month measurement period following the acquisition date. Management applied significant judgment in estimating the fair value of certain property, plant and equipment acquired using the cost approach, which involved the use of assumptions with respect to estimated replacement costs, estimated useful lives, as well as physical, functional and economic obsolescence, as applicable, at the time of acquisition. Torgau is a business under GAAP, accordingly the Company began consolidating its results of operations, financial position and cash flows in the consolidated financial statements as of the acquisition date.

The discount rate assumption is adjusted annually to reflect the rates available on high-quality debt instruments, with a duration that is expected to match the timing and amount of expected pension and other post-retirement benefit payments. High-quality debt instruments are corporate bonds with a rating of AA or better. The expected rate of return on plan assets is a management estimate based on, among other factors, historical long-term returns, expected asset mix and an active management premium. The expected rate of compensation increase is a management estimate based on, among other factors, historical compensation increases and promotions, while considering current industry conditions, the terms of collective bargaining agreements with employees and the outlook for the industry.

Note 12. Pension and Other Post-Retirement Benefit Obligations (continued) The expected health care cost trend rates are based on historical trends for these costs, as well as recently enacted health care legislation. The Company also compares health care cost trend rates to those of the industry. Investment Objective and Asset Allocation The investment objective for the defined benefit pension plans is to sufficiently diversify invested plan assets to maintain a reasonable level of risk without imprudently sacrificing the return on the invested funds, and ultimately to achieve a long-term total rate of return, net of fees and expenses, at least equal to the long-term interest rate assumptions used for funding actuarial valuations. To achieve this objective, the Company s overall investment strategy is to maintain an investment allocation mix of long-term growth investments (equities) and fixed income investments (debt securities). Investment allocation targets have been established by asset class after considering the nature of the liabilities, long-term return expectations, the risks associated with key asset classes, funded position, inflation and interest rates and related management fees and expenses. In addition, the defined benefit pension plan s investment strategy seeks to minimize risk beyond legislated requirements by constraining the investment managers investment options. There are a number of specific constraints based on investment type, but they all have the general purpose of ensuring that the investments are fully diversified and that risk is appropriately managed. For example, there are constraints on the book value of assets that can be invested in any one entity or group, and all equity holdings must be listed on a public exchange. Reviews of the investment objectives, key assumptions and the independent investment managers are performed periodically. Pension De-Risking Actions In 2017, the Company initiated a pension de-risking strategy for Celgar s defined benefit plan. The first step of the strategy resulted in changing the target investment mix to debt securities, to more effectively hedge the plan liabilities for inactive members, and equity securities, to consider the inflationary effect of future salary increases for the remaining active members. In 2018, the Company used the debt security investments in Celgar s defined benefit plan to purchase buy-in annuities for all inactive members. This transaction fully hedges the plan liabilities for the majority of inactive members. Concentrations of Risk in the Defined Benefit Pension Plan s Assets The Company has reviewed the defined benefit pension plan s equity investments and determined that they are allocated based on the specific investment managers stated investment strategies with only slight over- or under-weightings within any specific category, and that those investments are within the constraints that have been set by the Company. Those constraints include a limitation on the value that can be invested in any one entity or investment category. The Company has concluded that there are no significant concentrations of risk.

Defined Contribution Plans Effective December 31, 2008, the defined benefit plans at the Celgar mill were closed to new members. In addition, the related defined benefit service accrual ceased on December 31, 2008, and members began to receive pension benefits, at a fixed contractual rate, under a new defined contribution plan effective January 1, 2009. The Company s head office employees also participate in a defined contribution plan. During the year ended December 31, 2022, the Company made contributions of to these plans (2021 ; 2020 ). Multiemployer Plan The Company participates in a multiemployer plan for the hourly-paid employees at the Celgar mill. The contributions to the plan are determined based on a percentage of pensionable earnings pursuant to a collective bargaining agreement. The Company has no current or future contribution obligations in excess of the contractual contributions. During the year ended December 31, 2022, the Company made contributions of to this plan (2021 ; 2020 ).

Total income tax provision 

During the year ended December 31, 2022, the foreign current income tax provision is primarily for German entities. The Company s effective income tax rate can be affected by many factors, including but not limited to, changes in the mix of earnings in tax jurisdictions with differing statutory rates, changes in corporate structure, changes in the valuation of deferred tax assets and liabilities, the result of audit examinations of previously filed tax returns and changes in tax laws and rates. The asset and liability approach is used to recognize deferred tax assets and liabilities for the expected future tax consequences of temporary differences between the carrying amounts and the tax bases of assets and liabilities. Note 13. Income Taxes (continued) The Company and/or one or more of its subsidiaries file income tax returns in the U.S., Germany, Canada and Australia. Currently, the Company does not anticipate that the expiration of the statute of limitations or the completion of audits in the next fiscal year will result in liabilities for uncertain income tax positions that are materially different than the amounts accrued or disclosed as of December 31, 2022. However, this could change as tax years are examined by taxing authorities, the timing of which are uncertain at this time. entities, the German tax authorities have completed examinations up to and including the 2013 tax year; for the other entity, up to and including 2019. The Company is generally not subject to U.S. or Canadian income tax examinations for tax years before 2019 and 2018, respectively. The Company believes that it has adequately provided for any reasonable foreseeable outcomes related to its tax audits and that any settlement will not have a material adverse effect on its consolidated results. The liability in the Consolidated Balance Sheets related to unrecognized tax benefits was as of December 31, 2022 (2021 ). The Company recognizes interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits in Income tax provision in the Consolidated Statements of Operations. During the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020 the Company did t record any interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits.

At each reporting period, the Company assesses whether it is more likely than not that the deferred tax assets will be realized, based on the review of all available positive and negative evidence, including future reversals of existing taxable temporary differences, estimates of future taxable income, past operating results and prudent and feasible tax planning strategies. The carrying value of the Company s deferred tax assets reflects its expected ability to generate sufficient future taxable income in certain tax jurisdictions to utilize these deferred income tax benefits. Significant judgment is required when evaluating this positive and negative evidence. Note 13. Income Taxes (continued)

 pulp mills and its interest in the Cariboo pulp mill are aggregated into the pulp segment. The Friesau sawmill, the Torgau facility and the Mercer Mass Timber facility are aggregated into the solid wood segment. Historically the Mercer Mass Timber facility was included in corporate and other, but concurrent with the acquisition of Torgau on September 30, 2022, the Company reorganized its operating and management structure which included having the Mercer Mass Timber facility now being overseen by the same chief operating decision maker as the Friesau sawmill and the Torgau facility. The classification of the Mercer Mass Timber facility within the solid wood segment has been reflected retrospectively. The Company's sandalwood business is included in corporate and other as it does not meet the criteria to be reported as a separate reportable segment. None of the income or loss items following operating income in the Company s Consolidated Statements of Operations are allocated to the segments, as those items are reviewed separately by management.

Senior notes 

The carrying value of the revolving credit facilities classified as Level 2 approximates the fair value as the variable interest rates reflect current interest rates for financial instruments with similar characteristics and maturities. The fair value of the senior notes classified as Level 2 was determined using quoted prices in a dealer market, or using recent market transactions. The Company s senior notes are not carried at fair value on the Consolidated Balance Sheets as of December 31, 2022 and December 31, 2021. However, fair value disclosure is required. The carrying value of the Company s senior notes, net of note issuance costs is as of December 31, 2022 (December 31, 2021 ). Credit Risk The Company s credit risk is primarily attributable to cash held in bank accounts and accounts receivable. The Company maintains cash balances in foreign financial institutions in excess of insured limits. The Company limits its credit exposure on cash held in bank accounts by periodically investing cash in excess of short-term operating requirements and debt obligations in low risk government bonds, or similar debt instruments. The Company s credit risk associated with its sales is managed through setting credit limits, the purchase of credit insurance and for certain customers a letter of credit is received prior to shipping the product. The Company reviews new customers credit history before granting credit and conducts regular reviews of existing customers credit. Concentrations of credit risk on its sales are with customers and agents based primarily in Germany, China and the U.S. The Company s exposure to credit losses may increase if its customers' production and other costs are adversely affected by inflation. Although the Company has historically not experienced significant credit losses, it is possible that there could be a material adverse impact from potential adjustments of the carrying amount of trade receivables if the cash flows of the Company s customers are adversely impacted by inflation. As of December 31, 2022, the Company has not had significant credit losses. The carrying amount of cash and cash equivalents as of December 31, 2022 of and accounts receivable as of December 31, 2022 of recorded in the Consolidated Balance Sheet, net of any allowances for losses, represents the Company s maximum exposure to credit risk.

(b) The Company is involved in legal actions and claims arising in the ordinary course of business. While the outcome of any legal actions and claims cannot be predicted with certainty, it is the opinion of management that the outcome of any such claims which are pending or threatened, either individually or on a combined basis, will not have a material adverse effect on the consolidated financial condition, results of operations or liquidity of the Company. 

 (c) The Company is subject to regulations that require the handling and disposal of asbestos in a prescribed manner if a property undergoes a major renovation or demolition. Otherwise, the Company is not required to remove asbestos from its facilities. Generally asbestos is found on steam and condensate piping systems as well as certain cladding on buildings and in building insulation throughout older facilities. The Company s obligation for the proper removal and disposal of asbestos products from the Company s mills is a conditional asset retirement obligation. As a result of the longevity of the Company s mills, due in part to the maintenance procedures and the fact that the Company does not have plans for major changes that require the removal of asbestos, the timing of the asbestos removal is indeterminate. As a result, the Company is currently unable to reasonably estimate the fair value of its asbestos removal and disposal obligation. The Company will recognize a liability in the period in which sufficient information is available to reasonably estimate its fair value. 

 (d) In 2021, the European Commission opened a cartel investigation into the wood pulp sector in Europe to investigate if there was an infringement of European Union competition law. In October 2021, the Commission conducted inspections of major European pulp producers including the Company s German operations. The Company is cooperating with the investigation. As the matter is currently in the investigation stage, the Company cannot predict the timing of the same and what further actions, if any, the European Commission may pursue or what the outcome of any such actions may be.
