CAUTIONARY
NOTE ABOUT FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS 

The
information contained in this Report includes some statements that are not purely historical and that are forward-looking statements 
within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the Securities Act ), and Section 21E of the
Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the Exchange Act ), and as such, may involve risks and uncertainties. These
forward-looking statements relate to, among other things, expectations of the business environment in which we operate, perceived opportunities
in the market and statements regarding our mission and vision. In addition, any statements that refer to projections, forecasts or other
characterizations of future events or circumstances, including any underlying assumptions, are forward-looking statements. You can generally
identify forward-looking statements as statements containing the words anticipates, believes, continue, 
 could, estimates, expects, intends, may, might, plans, 
 possible, potential, predicts, projects, seeks, should, 
 will, would and similar expressions, or the negatives of such terms, but the absence of these words does
not mean that a statement is not forward-looking. 

Forward-looking
statements involve risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results or outcomes to differ materially from those expressed in the
forward-looking statements. The forward-looking statements contained herein are based on various assumptions, many of which are based,
in turn, upon further assumptions. Our expectations, beliefs and forward-looking statements are expressed in good faith on the basis
of management s views and assumptions as of the time the statements are made, but there can be no assurance that management s
expectations, beliefs or projections will result or be achieved or accomplished. 

In
addition to other factors and matters discussed elsewhere herein, the following are important factors that, in our view, could cause
actual results to differ materially from those discussed in the forward-looking statements: technological advances, impact of competition,
dependence on key personnel and the need to attract new management, effectiveness of cost and marketing efforts, acceptances of products,
ability to expand markets and the availability of capital or other funding on terms satisfactory to us. We disclaim any obligation to
update forward-looking statements to reflect events or circumstances after the date hereof. 

Unless
expressly indicated or the context requires otherwise, the terms Forge company, we, us, 
and our in this document refer to Forge Innovation Development Corp., a Nevada corporation.

PART

Item
1. Description of Business. 

Organization and Corporate History 

Forge
Innovation Development Corp., or the Company , was initially incorporated in the State of Nevada on January 15, 2016 under
the name of You-Go enterprises, LLC (the Company Predecessor ). On November 3, 2016, the Company filed an amendment to its
Articles of Incorporation in the State of Nevada to change the Company s name to Forge Innovation Development Corp. Our principle
executive office is located at 6280 Mission Blvd Unit 205,Jurupa Valley, CA 92509. Tel : 626-986-4566. The Company s main
business is focus on real estate development, land purchasing and selling and property management. 

On
August 17, 2020, the Company established a wholly-owned subsidiary, Forge Network Inc, in the State of California. As of December 31,
2022, we have not generated any income from the subsidiary yet due to our business strategy adjustment. 

On March 24, 2023, pursuant
to an Asset Purchase Agreement between Forge Innovation Development Corp. (the Company or the Buyer and
Legend Investment Management , LLC Legend LLC or the Seller ), the
Company acquired 77.3 of Legend LLC s 66 ownership of Legend International Investment, LP Legend LP ). Legend LP
owns 100 of Mission Marketplace; a grocery anchored shopping center (the Property located at 6240 Mission Boulevard in
Jurupa Valley, California. The Property contains two, one-story and one, two-story buildings containing 48,722 total square foot of gross
leasable area situated on a 4.51acre site. 

The Seller is an affiliate of the Company and
therefore the acquisition is being treated as a related party transaction. The Company acquired 51 interest of Legend LP from Legend
LLC in exchanged for 1,967,143 common stocks of the Company, valued at 0.70 per share for a total purchase price of 1,377,000, which
equals 51 of Legend LP s approximate net value of 2,700,000 based on (1) the Property s valuation appraisal report dated
on February 20, 2023, (2) Legend LP s net book value as of February 28, 2023, and (3) the loan agreement to Legend LP by a third-party
lender effective on March 23, 2023. After the closing of the acquisition, the Company will own 51 of Legend LP and the Seller will own
15 of Legend LP. 

Overview 

The
Company s primary objective is commercial and residential land development, including, to a lesser extent, the possible purchase
and sale of real estate, targeting properties primarily in Southern California. We also intend to manage properties we own and properties
owned by unaffiliated third parties. Our activities will include securing acquisition rights to properties, obtaining zoning and other
entitlements for the properties, securing financing for purchase of the properties, improving the properties infrastructure and
amenities and selling the properties to homeowner and commercial owners for restaurants, offices and small businesses. Our first property
acquisition was 29 acres in the city of Desert Hot Springs in Southern California. Due to problems with permits and adjacent landowners,
rather than get involved in protracted negotiations, the Company sold the property to an independent third party for a profit. 

On
August 1, 2017, the Company entered into a property management agreement with Bloomage Beverly Hills Investment Inc. Pursuant to the
agreement, the Company provided property management services for Bloomage Beverly Hills Investment Inc. in exchange for the compensation
of 3,000 per month. During the year ended December 31, 2021, the service charges increased to 5,000 per month. In April 2022, we terminated
the property management services with Bloomage Beverly Hills Investment Inc. due to the sales of the managed properties. During the years
ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, the Company recognized management service income of 15,000 and 36,000, respectively, under this agreement. 

On
April 2, 2022, the Company entered into a property management agreement with Legend International Investment, LP. (the Legend
LP ), a related party of the Company, of which the management is related to Mr. Patrick Liang, President and CEO of
the Company. Pursuant to the agreement, the Company will manage the properties owned by Legend LP, which is called Mission
Marketplace; a grocery anchored shopping center (the Property located at 6240 Mission Boulevard in Jurupa Valley, California.
The Property contains two, one-story and one, two-story buildings containing 48,722 total square foot of gross leasable area situated
on a 4.51-acre site. The original monthly service charge was 5,000 which was amended to 10,000 per month in June 2022 due to Legend
LP required additional management services for their properties. On November 17, 2022, the monthly service charge was amended
to 15,000 with one year term due to new tenants moving in and additional management services desired. During the year ended December 31, 2022, the Company
recognized property management income from Legend LP in the amount of 107,000. 

1 

Business
Strategy 

The
Company s business strategy includes the following three main segments of the real estate business: 

1. 
 We
 intend to acquire and develop land for residential and commercial development. 
 
 2. 
 We
 also, to a lesser extent, intend to develop a diversified real estate portfolio by investing in residential real estate, including
 single-family housing, condos and town-homes and commercial properties, including strip-malls and small office buildings. 
 
 3. 
 We
 intend to provide property management for our own properties and for properties owned by non-affiliated third parties. 

Property
Development 

The
Company primary business is to acquire land and develop and sell fully constructed homes and commercial property such as stores, offices,
private schools, etc., to non-affiliated third parties. Our first property acquisition was 29 acres of vacant land in the city of Desert
Hot Springs in Southern California. Our original plan was to build various commercial buildings on the parcels, including stores and
restaurants. However, due to problems with permits and adjacent landowners that would lead to lengthy negotiations and possibly additional
costs, the Company sold the property in March 2017, to a non-affiliated third party for a profit. 

Our
principal activities are securing acquisition rights to properties, obtaining zoning and other entitlements for the properties, securing
financing for the purchase of the properties, improving the properties infrastructure and amenities, and selling properties to
third parties. Currently all of our property development activities are centered in the Southern California area. 

Investing
in Development Projects 

The
Company intends to invest a small portion of its funds and to utilize funds pooled from investors to directly invest in income-yielding
properties. The Company will concentrate on investing in properties with long-term leases. 

We
rely on our management s expertise in identifying residential and commercial real estate assets within our stated target objectives.
Our Management makes investment decisions based on various factors, including, relative value, expected risk-adjusted returns, current
and projected credit fundamentals, current and projected macroeconomic considerations, current and projected supply and demand, credit
and market risk concentration limits, liquidity, cost of financing and financing availability, as well as maintaining our exemption from
registration under the 1940 Act. 

Our
targeted asset classes and the principal investments we have made and expect to make in each are as follows: 

Asset
 Class 
 
 Principal
 Investments 
 
 Residential
 Property 

Single
 family attached, Single Family detached, multi-unit, condominiums, townhomes, etc. 

Partially
 completed real estate developments, residential, commercial, retail. 

Acquisition
 and sale of vacant land 

REO
 Tape Transactions 

Bulk
 or block acquisitions of single family detached residential units or homes. 

Our
primary business strategy is to seek out and secure real estate properties that may have been formerly subjected to distressed financing
terms as a consequence of recent economic factors. Our focus is on residential, single-family detached homes throughout Southern California
made available individually or bulk transfer from various private parties or financial institutions seeking to liquidate non-performing
assets. 

2 

Another
business strategy is designed to generate a rate of return by acquiring distressed properties (individually or in bulk transaction(s))
for investment purposes and eventual resale. We believe there is a significant market opportunity to acquire discounted real estate assets
or in some instances, to lend to or invest with real estate developers and property owners or otherwise participate in real estate related
investments where non-traditional financing sources are not available. The current credit crisis and economic environment and the strict
underwriting standards and length of time required by traditional sources including banking institutions are often prohibitive. 

Property
Management 

In
many cases we will manage our own properties and market our property management service to others. Property management involves most
of the following duties 

Establishes
 rental rate by surveying local rental rates; calculating overhead costs, depreciation, taxes, and profit goals. 

Attracts
 tenants by advertising vacancies; obtaining referrals from current tenants; explaining advantages of location and services; showing
 units. 

Contracts
 with tenants by negotiating leases; collecting security deposit. 

Accomplishes
 financial objectives by collecting rents; paying bills; forecasting requirements; preparing an annual budget; scheduling expenditures;
 analyzing variances; initiating corrective action. 

Maintains
 property by investigating and resolving tenant complaints; enforcing rules of occupancy; inspecting vacant units and completing repairs;
 planning renovations; contracting with landscaping and snow removal services. 

Maintains
 building systems by contracting for maintenance services; supervising repairs. 

Secures
 property by contracting with security patrol service; installing and maintaining security devices; establishing and enforcing precautionary
 policies and procedures; responding to emergencies. 

Enforces
 occupancy policies and procedures by confronting violators. 

Prepares
 reports by collecting, analyzing, and summarizing data and trends. 

We
also intend to provide the following special services to our third part owners:

Sales
and Marketing 

We
intend to market our properties through real estate brokers and agents coordinated by company marketing personnel. Our marketing efforts
will target both international and local buyers and builders. We also look for suitable real estate projects for management and operation. 

Competition 

We
believe there are only limited barriers to entry in our business. Current and future competitors may have more resources than we have.
Our projects face competition generally from REITs, institutional pension plans and other public and private real estate companies and
private real estate investors for the acquisition of properties and for raising capital. In transaction services, we face competition
with other real estate firms in the acquisition and disposition of properties, and we also compete with other sponsors of real estate
for investors to provide the capital to allow us to make these investments. We also compete against other real estate companies who may
be chosen by a broker-dealer as an investment platform instead of us. In management services, we compete with other properties for viable
investors for properties. We also believe that our broker dealers compete, or will compete, with institutions that provide or arrange
for other types of financing through private or public offerings of equity or debt and from traditional bank financings. 

Real
estate development is a highly competitive business. We compete with numerous developers, builders and others for the acquisition of
property. As we attempt to expand our operations we will certainly be competing with other business ranging from large multinational
corporations to small startup business such as ourselves. Many of our competitors may have longer operating histories, better brand recognition
and greater financial resources than we do. To successfully compete in our industry, we will need to: 

Ensure
 that investments in our projects are affordable; 

That
 we only invest in properties in well-priced locations; 

That
 our investment strategy is simple to understand; and 

That
 we provide outstanding customer service and rigid integrity in our business dealings. 

However,
there can be no assurance that even if we do these things we will be able to compete effectively with the other companies in our industry.
We believe we have the required management expertise in sourcing properties with good development potential and affordable price. 

We
are committed to work and communicate with our investors and sales consultants to identify their goals and needs which will make it easier
to continually provide them with the best products and services. 

Government
Regulations 

Real
Property Development 

Land
development permits and approvals are required to develop real property. These permits and approvals will vary depending on the land
that is being developed. 

The
commercial and residential real estate development industry is subject to substantial environmental, building, construction, zoning and
real estate regulations that are imposed by various federal, state and local authorities. In developing a community, we must obtain the
approval of numerous government agencies regarding such matters as permitted land uses, housing density, the installation of utility
services (such as water, sewer, gas, electric, telephone and cable television) and the dedication of acreage for open space, parks, schools
and other community purposes. Regulations affect commercial building and homebuilding by specifying, among other things, the type and
quality of building materials that must be used, certain aspects of land use and building design and the manner in which homebuilders
may conduct their sales, operations, and overall relationships with potential renters and buyers. Furthermore, changes in prevailing
local circumstances or applicable laws may require additional approvals, or modifications of approvals previously obtained. These permits
and approvals will vary depending on the land that is being developed. 

4 

Timing
of the initiation and completion of development projects depends upon receipt of necessary authorizations and approvals. Because of the
provisional nature of these approvals and the concerns of various environmental and public interest groups, the approval process can
be delayed by withdrawals or modifications of preliminary approvals and by litigation and appeals challenging development rights. Our
ability to develop projects could be delayed or prevented due to litigation challenging previously obtained governmental approvals. We
also may be subject to periodic delays or may be precluded entirely from developing in certain communities due to building moratoriums
or slow-growth or no-growth initiatives that could be implemented in the future. Such delays could adversely
affect our ability to complete our projects, significantly increase the costs of doing so or drive potential customers to purchase competitors 
products. 

Management
Services 

We
and our brokers, salespersons and, in some instances, property managers are regulated by the states in which we do business. These regulations
may include licensing procedures, prescribed professional responsibilities and anti-fraud provisions. Our activities are also subject
to various local, state, national and international jurisdictions fair advertising, trade, housing and real estate settlement
laws and regulations and are affected by laws and regulations relating to real estate and real estate finance and development. 

Environmental
Compliance 

Federal,
state and local laws and regulations impose environmental zoning restrictions, use controls, disclosure obligations and other restrictions
that impact the management, development, use or sale of real estate. Such laws and regulations tend to discourage sales and leasing activities
with respect to some properties. If transactions in which we are involved are delayed or abandoned as a result of these restrictions,
our business could be adversely affected. In addition, a failure by us to disclose environmental concerns to potential investors or third-party
buyers of the developed property may subject our company to liability and may adversely impact our business or cause us to incur costs
for cleanup of hazardous substances or wastes or other environmental liabilities. 

Various
environmental laws and regulations also can impose liability for the costs of investigating or remediating hazardous or toxic substances
at sites currently or formerly owned or operated by a party, or at off-site locations to which such party sent wastes for disposal. As
a property manager, we could be held liable as an operator for any such contamination; even if the original activity was legal and we
had no knowledge of, or did not cause, the release or contamination. Further, because liability under some of these laws is joint and
several, we could be held responsible for more than our share, or even all, of the costs for such contaminated site if the other responsible
parties are unable to pay. Similarly, we are generally obliged, under the debt financing arrangements on the properties owned by us,
to provide an indemnity to the lenders for environmental liabilities and to remediate any environmental problems that might arise. Insurance
for these matters may not always be available, or sufficient to cover our losses. 

Employees 

Currently
the Company has 2 employees including Mr. Liang, the President/CEO of the Company, who devotes approximately 100 of his time to the
business of the Company.

3. Legal Proceedings. 

On December 8, 2017, the Company entered into a lease agreement with Puente
Hills Business Center II, L.P. PHBC-II for a lease term of forty-eight months, and which was scheduled to expire on January

22, 2020, PHBC-II filed a lawsuit against the Company and its guarantor, Mr. Liang. The Company has retained legal counsel to address
the matter and the Court has rescheduled the trial date from January 31, 2023 to April 18, 2023. No judgment has been rendered as of March
30, 2023, and the case is still in the pre-trial stage.

Market
Information 

There
has only been limited trading for the Company s Common Stock since it began trading on September 25, 2018. There is no assurance
that an active trading market will ever develop or, if such a market does develop, that it will continue. The Securities and Exchange
Commission has adopted Rule 15g-9 which establishes the definition of a penny stock, for purposes relevant to the Company,
as any equity security that has a market price of less than 5.00 per share or with an exercise price of less than 5.00 per share, subject
to certain exceptions. For any transaction involving a penny stock, unless exempt, the rules require: (i) that a broker or dealer approve
a person s account for transactions in penny stocks and (ii) the broker or dealer receive from the investor a written agreement
to the transaction, setting forth the identity and quantity of the penny stock to be purchased. In order to approve a person s
account for transactions in penny stocks, the broker or dealer must (i) obtain financial information and investment experience and objectives
of the person and (ii) make a reasonable determination that the transactions in penny stocks are suitable for that person and that person
has sufficient knowledge and experience in financial matters to be capable of evaluating the risks of transactions in penny stocks. The
broker or dealer must also deliver, prior to any transaction in a penny stock, a disclosure schedule prepared by the Commission relating
to the penny stock market, which, in highlight form, (i) sets forth the basis on which the broker or dealer made the suitability determination
and (ii) that the broker or dealer received a signed, written agreement from the investor prior to the transaction. Disclosure also has
to be made about the risks of investing in penny stocks in both public offerings and in secondary trading, and about commissions payable
to both the broker-dealer and the registered representative, current quotations for the securities and the rights and remedies available
to an investor in cases of fraud in penny stock transactions. Finally, monthly statements have to be sent disclosing recent price information
for the penny stock held in the account and information on the limited market in penny stocks. 

Because
of these regulations, broker-dealers may encounter difficulties in their attempt to buy or sell shares of our common stock, which may
affect the ability of our shareholders to sell their shares in the secondary market and have the effect of reducing the level of trading
activity in the secondary market. These additional sales practice and disclosure requirements could impede the sale of our common stock
in the market place. In addition, the liquidity for our common stock may be decreased, with a corresponding decrease in the price of
our common stock. Our shares are likely to be subject to such penny stock rules for the foreseeable future. 

On
August 31, 2018, our common stock was approved for quotation on the OTCQB Markets under the symbol FGNV . The OTC Markets
is a regulated quotation service that displays real-time quotes, last-sale prices, and volume information in over-the-counter equity
securities. The OTC Markets securities are traded by a community of market makers that enter quotes and trade reports. This market is
limited in comparison to the national stock exchanges and any prices quoted may not be a reliable indication of the value of our common
stock. 

On
March 30, 2023, the closing price of our common stock reported on the OTC Markets was 1.10 per share. The following table sets forth,
for each of the quarterly periods indicated, the high and low closing prices of our common stock, as reported on the OTC Markets.

Overview 

Forge
Innovation Development Corp. is a development stage company and was incorporated in the State of Nevada in January 2016. The Company s
primary objective is commercial and residential land development, including the purchase and sale of real estate, targeting properties
primarily in Southern California. We also intend to manage properties we own, and properties owned by unaffiliated third parties. Our
activities will include securing acquisition rights to properties, obtaining zoning and other entitlements for the properties, securing
financing for purchase of the properties, improving the properties infrastructure and amenities and selling the properties to
homeowner and commercial owners for restaurants, offices and small businesses. Our first property acquisition was 29 acres in the city
of Desert Hot Springs in Southern California. Due to problems with permits and adjacent landowners, rather than getting involved in protracted
negotiations, the Company sold the property to an independent third party for a profit. 

On August 17, 2020, the Company established a wholly-owned
subsidiary, Forge Network Inc, in the State of California. As of December 31, 2022, we have not generated any income from the subsidiary
yet due to our business strategy adjustment. 

On March 24, 2023, pursuant to an Asset Purchase
Agreement between Forge Innovation Development Corp. (the Company or the Buyer and Legend Investment Management ,
 LLC Legend LLC or the Seller ), the Company acquired 77.3 of Legend LLC s 66 ownership of
Legend International Investment, LP Legend LP ). Legend LP owns 100 of Mission Marketplace; a grocery anchored shopping
center (the Property located at 6240 Mission Boulevard in Jurupa Valley, California. The Property contains two, one-story
and one, two-story buildings containing 48,722 total square foot of gross leasable area situated on a 4.51acre site. 

The Seller is an affiliate of the Company and
therefore the acquisition is being treated as a related party transaction. The Company acquired 51 interest of Legend LP from Legend
LLC in exchanged for 1,967,143 common stocks of the Company, valued at 0.70 per share for a total purchase price of 1,377,000, which
equals 51 of Legend LP s approximate net value of 2,700,000 based on (1) the Property s valuation appraisal report dated
on February 20, 2023, (2) Legend LP s net book value as of February 28, 2023, and (3) the loan agreement to Legend LP by a third-party
lender effective on March 23, 2023. After the closing of the acquisition, the Company will own 51 of Legend LP and the Seller will own
15 of Legend LP. 

Results
of Operation for the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021 

During
the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, the Company generated 122,604 and 36,000 of revenues, respectively; which was mainly due
to the newly signed property management agreement with Legend LP. During the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, the Company incurred consulting, general
and administrative expenses of 166,837 and 321,234, respectively. The decrease in consulting, general and administrative expenses was
mainly due to the decreasing in salary expenses and professional fees. During the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, the Company
obtained government grants in the amount of Nil and 24,400, respectively. The government grants were the subsidy to companies against
COVID-19. For the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, our net loss was 34,112 and 262,434, respectively. The decrease in net loss
was mainly due to the increase in revenue generate from property management service and decrease in general and administrative expenses
for the year ended December 31, 2022, compared to last year. 

Equity
and Capital Resources 

We
have incurred losses since inception of our business in 2016 and, as of December 31, 2022, we had an accumulated deficit of 1,565,579.
As of December 31, 2022, we had cash of 11,734 and a negative working capital of 140,204, compared to cash of 60,364 and a working
capital deficit of 95,686 as of December 31, 2021. The increase in the working capital deficit was primarily due to cash used to pay for
operating expenses, acquisition of property and equipment, and repayment of loans. 

8 

Going
Concern Assessment 

The
Company demonstrates adverse conditions that raise substantial doubt about the Company s ability to continue as a going concern.
These adverse conditions are negative financial trends, specifically cash outflow from operating activities, operating losses, accumulated
deficit and other adverse key financial ratios. 

Management s
plan to alleviate the substantial doubt about the Company s ability to continue as a going concern include attempting to improve
its business profitability, its ability to generate sufficient cash flow from its operations and execute the business plan of the Company
in order to meet its operating needs on a timely basis. However, there can be no assurance that these plans and arrangements will be
sufficient to fund the Company s ongoing capital expenditures and other requirements. 

The
consolidated financial statements do not include any adjustments relating to the recoverability and classification of recorded assets,
or the amounts and classification of liabilities that might be necessary in the event that the Company cannot continue as a going concern. 

Off-Balance
Sheet Arrangements 

We
have no off-balance sheet arrangements that have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on our financial condition,
changes in financial condition, revenues or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources that
is material to stockholders. 

Critical
Accounting Policies 

The
consolidated financial statements of the Company have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the
United States. The preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires making estimates and judgments that affect the reported
amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses, and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. The estimates are
based on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results
of which form the basis of making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other
sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions. 

The
critical accounting policies are discussed in further detail in the notes to the audited consolidated financial statements appearing
elsewhere in this report. Management believes that the application of these policies on a consistent basis enables us to provide useful
and reliable financial information about our operating results and financial condition.

Opinion
on the Consolidated Financial Statements 

We
have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Forge Innovation Development Corp. and subsidiary (the
 Company as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, the related consolidated statements of operation, stockholders equity, and
cash flows for each of the two years in the period ended December 31, 2022, and the related notes. In our opinion, the consolidated
financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company at December 31, 2022 and 2021,
and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the two years in the period ended December 31, 2022 , in
conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. 

Substantial
Doubt About the Company s Ability to Continue as a Going Concern 

The
accompanying consolidated financial statements have been prepared assuming that the Company will continue as a going concern. As described
in Note 3 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company has suffered recurring losses from operations, has a net capital deficiency,
and has stated that substantial doubt exists about the Company s ability to continue as a going concern. Management s evaluation
of the events and conditions and management s plans regarding these matters are also described in Note 3. The consolidated financial
statements do not include any adjustments that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty. Our opinion is not modified with respect
to this matter. 

Basis
for Opinion 

These
consolidated financial statements are the responsibility of the Company s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion
on the Company s consolidated financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public
Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company
in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission
and the PCAOB. 

We
conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain
reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud.
The Company is not required to have, nor were we engaged to perform, an audit of its internal control over financial reporting. As part
of our audits we are required to obtain an understanding of internal control over financial reporting but not for the purpose of expressing
an opinion on the effectiveness of the Company s internal control over financial reporting. Accordingly, we express no such opinion. 

Our
audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements, whether
due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence
regarding the amounts and disclosures in the consolidated financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles
used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the consolidated financial statements.
We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion. 

F- 2 

Critical
Audit Matter 

The
critical audit matter communicated below is a matter arising from the current period audit of the consolidated financial statements that
was communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that: (1) relates to accounts or disclosures that are material
to the consolidated financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication
of critical audit matter does not alter in any way our opinion on the consolidated financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are
not, by communicating the critical audit matter below, providing separate opinions on the critical audit matter or on the accounts or
disclosures to which it relates. 

Legal
Contingencies 

As
described in Note 10 to the consolidated financial statements, management disclosed legal proceeding that involved the Company and the
Company s senior management where liability is not probable or the amount of the liability is not estimable, or both, if management
believes there is at least a reasonable possibility that the Company has assessed the obligations, or a loss may be incurred when obligations
were not discharged. 

Our
principal considerations to determine that the legal contingencies are a critical audit matter as there was significant judgment made
by management when assessing the likelihood of a loss being incurred and when estimating the loss or range of loss for each claim, which
in turn led to significant auditor judgment, subjectivity, and effort in performing procedures and evaluating management s assessment
of the liabilities and disclosures related to legal proceedings contingencies. 

Our
audit of legal contingencies included, among others: 

Reviewing
 management s control for assessing legal proceeding; 
 
 Obtaining
 and evaluating the letters of audit inquiry with external legal counsel; 
 
 Reviewing
 public information regarding the Company s litigation case; 
 
 Evaluating
 the reasonableness of management s assessment regarding whether an unfavorable outcome
 is reasonably probable and estimable; 
 
 Evaluating
 the sufficiency of the Company s disclosure related to legal proceeding.

ASC
820, Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures , defines fair value as the exchange price that would be received for an asset or
paid to transfer a liability (an exit price) in the principal or most advantageous market for the asset or liability in an orderly transaction
between market participants on the measurement date. ASC 820 also establishes a fair value hierarchy that distinguishes between (1) market
participant assumptions developed based on market data obtained from independent sources (observable inputs) and (2) an entity s
own assumptions about market participant assumptions developed based on the best information available in the circumstances (unobservable
inputs). The fair value hierarchy consists of three broad levels, which gives the highest priority to unadjusted quoted prices in active
markets for identical assets or liabilities (Level 1) and the lowest priority to unobservable inputs (Level 3). The three levels of the
fair value hierarchy are described below: 

Level
 1 - 
 Unadjusted
 quoted prices in active markets that are accessible at the measurement date for identical, unrestricted assets or liabilities. 

Level
 2 - 
 Inputs
 other than quoted prices included within Level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly or indirectly, including
 quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities in active markets; quoted prices for identical or similar assets or liabilities in
 markets that are not active; inputs other than quoted prices that are observable for the asset or liability (e.g., interest rates);
 and inputs that are derived principally from or corroborated by observable market data by correlation or other means. 

Level
 3 - 
 Inputs
 that are both significant to the fair value measurement and unobservable.

value estimates discussed herein are based upon certain market assumptions and pertinent information available to management as of December
31, 2022 and 2021. The respective carrying value of certain on-balance-sheet financial instruments approximated their fair values due
to the short-term nature of these instruments. These financial instruments include cash and cash equivalent, receivable due from related
party and other current assets. 

as of December 31, 2022. These conditions raise substantial doubt
about the ability of the Company to continue as a going concern. 

In
view of these matters, continuation as a going concern is dependent upon several factors, including the availability of debt or equity
funding upon terms and conditions acceptable to the Company and ultimately achieving profitable operations. Management believes that
the Company s business plan provides it with an opportunity to continue as a going concern. However, management cannot provide
assurance that the Company will meet its objectives and be able to continue in operation. 

The
consolidated financial statements do not include any adjustments to reflect the possible future effects on the recoverability and classification
of assets or the amounts and classification of liabilities that may result from the possible inability of Forge Innovation Development
Corp. to continue as a going concern.

Evaluation
of Disclosure Controls and Procedures 

Disclosure
controls and procedures are designed with an objective of ensuring that information required to be disclosed in our periodic reports
filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission, such as this Annual Report on Form 10-K, is recorded, processed, summarized and reported
within the time periods specified by the Securities and Exchange Commission. Disclosure controls are also designed with an objective
of ensuring that such information is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our chief executive officer, in order
to allow timely consideration regarding required disclosures. 

The
evaluation of our disclosure controls by our principal executive officer included a review of the controls objectives and design,
the operation of the controls, and the effect of the controls on the information presented in this Annual Report. Our management, including
our Chief Executive Officer, does not expect that disclosure controls can or will prevent or detect all errors and all fraud, if any.
A control system, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the objectives
of the control system are met. Also, projections of any evaluation of the disclosure controls and procedures to future periods are subject
to the risk that the disclosure controls and procedures may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of
compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. 

As
of the end of the period covered by this report, we carried out an evaluation, under the supervision and with the participation of our
management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, of the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures,
as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 as of the end of the period covered by this report.
Based on that evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer have concluded that there were significant deficiency
in our internal controls over Financial reporting as of December 31, 2022 and they were therefore not as effective as they could be to
ensure that information required to be disclosed by us in reports that we file or submit under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 is
recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the Securities and Exchange Commission s rules
and forms. The significant deficiency in our controls and procedure were lack of evidences for proper approval and review of disbursements.
Management does not believe that any of these significant deficiencies materially affected the results and accuracy of its consolidated
financial statements. However, in view of this discovery of such weaknesses, management has begun a review to improve them. 

MANAGEMENT S
ANNUAL REPORT ON INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING . 

Our
management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting for the company in accordance
with as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Exchange Act. Our internal control over financial reporting is designed to
provide reasonable assurance regarding the (i) effectiveness and efficiency of operations, (ii) reliability of financial reporting and
the preparation of consolidated financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles,
and (iii) compliance with applicable laws and regulations. Our internal controls framework is based on the criteria set forth in the
Internal Control - Integrated Framework that was issued in 2013 by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission
(COSO). 

Because
of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of
any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions,
or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. Management identified a lack of segregation of duties. 

Management s
assessment of the effectiveness of the small business issuer s internal control over financial reporting is as of the year ended
December 31, 2022. We believe that internal controls over financial reporting as set forth above shows material weaknesses and are not
effective. We have identified material weaknesses considering the nature and extent of our current operations and any risks or errors
in financial reporting under current operations. 

This
annual report does not include an attestation report of the company s registered public accounting firm regarding internal control
over financial reporting. Management s report was not subject to attestation by the Company s registered public accounting
firm pursuant to rules of the SEC that permit the Company to provide only management s report in this annual report. 

Subsequent
to the end of the period covered by this report, and in light of the weakness described above, management is in the process of designing
and implementing improvements in its internal control over financial reporting and we currently plan tom hire an independent third-party
consultant to assist in identifying and determining the appropriate accounting procedures and controls to implement.
