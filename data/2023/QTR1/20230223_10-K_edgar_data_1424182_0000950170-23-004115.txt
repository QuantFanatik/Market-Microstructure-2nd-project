Part I. 
 Item 1. 	 B usiness 
 The Company 
 We are an internally-managed real estate investment trust REIT that invests in, owns, and manages primarily single-tenant commercial real estate properties that are net leased on a long-term basis to a diversified group of tenants. Since our inception in 2007, we have selectively invested in net leased assets in the industrial, healthcare, restaurant, retail, and office property types. As of December 31, 2022, our portfolio has grown to 804 properties, with 797 properties located in 44 U.S. states and seven properties located in four Canadian provinces. 
 We focus on investing in real estate that is operated by creditworthy single tenants in industries characterized by positive business drivers and trends. We target properties that are an integral part of the tenants businesses and are therefore opportunities to secure long-term net leases. Through long-term net leases, our tenants are able to retain operational control of their strategically important locations, while allocating their debt and equity capital to fund core business operations rather than real estate ownership. 
 Diversified Portfolio . As of December 31, 2022, our portfolio comprised approximately 39.1 million rentable square feet of operational space and was highly diversified based on property type, geography, tenant, and industry, and is cross-diversified within each e.g., property-type diversification within a geographic concentration): 

Property Type : We are focused primarily on industrial, healthcare, restaurant, retail, and office property types based on our extensive experience in and conviction around these sectors. Within these sectors, we have meaningful concentrations in manufacturing, distribution and warehouse, food processing, casual dining, clinical, quick service restaurants, general merchandise, and flex/research and development. 
 	 Geographic Diversification : Our properties are located in 44 U.S. states and four Canadian provinces, with no single geographic concentration exceeding 9.7 of our ABR. 
 	 Tenant and Industry Diversification : Our properties are occupied by 221 different commercial tenants who operate 211 different brands that are diversified across 55 different industries, with no single tenant accounting for more than 4.0 of our ABR. 
 Strong In-Place Leases with Significant Remaining Lease Term . As of December 31, 2022, our portfolio was approximately 99.4 leased with an ABR weighted average remaining lease term of approximately 10.9 years, excluding renewal options. 

Standard Contractual Base Rent Escalation . Approximately 97.3 of our leases have contractual rent escalations, with an ABR weighted average minimum increase of 2.0 . 

Extensive Tenant Financial Reporting . Approximately 94.3 of our tenants, based on ABR, provide financial reporting, of which 85.8 are required to provide us with specified financial information on a periodic basis, and an additional 8.5 of our tenants report financial statements publicly, either through SEC filings or otherwise. 

We conduct substantially all of our activities through, and all of our properties are held directly or indirectly by, the OP, which is commonly referred to as an umbrella partnership real estate investment trust UPREIT ). We are the sole managing member of the OP. As of December 31, 2022, we owned approximately 94.8 of the issued and outstanding membership units of the OP OP Units ), with the remaining 5.2 held by persons who were issued OP Units in exchange for their interests in properties acquired by the OP, as well as OP Units issued pursuant to the Internalization.

FFO, Core FFO, AFFO, Net Debt, and Annualized Adjusted EBITDAre are performance measures that are not calculated in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America GAAP ). We present these non-GAAP measures as we believe certain investors and other users of our financial information use them as part of their evaluation of our historical operating performance. See Item 7. Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations of this Annual Report on Form 10-K under the heading Non-GAAP Measures , which includes discussion of the definition, purpose, and use of these non-GAAP measures as well as a reconciliation of each to the most comparable GAAP measure.

Our Leases 
 We typically lease our properties pursuant to long-term net leases with initial terms of 10 years or more that often have renewal options. Substantially all of our leases are net, meaning our tenants are generally obligated to pay all expenses associated with the leased property (such as real estate taxes, insurance, maintenance, repairs, and capital costs). In scenarios where we lease multiple properties to a single tenant (multi-site tenants), we seek to use master lease structures on an all-or-none basis. When we acquire properties associated with a tenant that has an existing master lease structure with us, we seek to add the new properties to the existing master lease structure to strengthen the existing lease with such tenant. As of December 31, 2022, master leases contributed to 67.7 of the ABR associated with multi-site tenants (418 of our 489 properties), and 40.8 of our overall ABR (489 of our 804 properties). 
 As of December 31, 2022, approximately 99.4 of our portfolio, representing all but three of our properties, were subject to a lease. Because substantially all of our properties are leased under long-term leases, we are not currently required to perform significant ongoing leasing activities on our properties. The leases for six properties, representing approximately 1.2 of our ABR, will expire during 2023. As of December 31, 2022, the ABR weighted average remaining term of our leases was approximately 10.9 years. Less than 4 of the properties in our portfolio are subject to leases without at least one renewal option. Approximately 56.4 of our ABR was derived from leases that will expire after 2030, and no more than 6.2 of our ABR was derived from leases that expire in any single year prior to 2030. The following chart sets forth our lease expirations based upon the terms of the leases in place as of December 31, 2022.

Substantially all of our leases provide for periodic contractual rent escalations. As of December 31, 2022, leases contributing 97.3 of our ABR provided for increases in future annual base rent, generally ranging from 1.5 to 2.5 annually, with an ABR weighted average annual minimum increase equal to 2.0 of base rent. Generally, our rent escalators increase rent on specified dates by a fixed percentage. Our escalations provide us with a source of organic growth and a measure of inflation protection. Additional information on lease escalation frequency and weighted average annual escalation rates as of December 31, 2022 is displayed below.

(1) Represents the ABR weighted average annual minimum increase of the entire portfolio as if all escalations occurred annually. For leases where rent escalates by the greater of a stated fixed percentage or the change in CPI, we have assumed an escalation equal to the stated fixed percentage in the lease. As of December 31, 2022, leases contributing 7.5 of our ABR provide for rent increases equal to the lesser of a stated fixed percentage or the change in CPI. As any future increase in CPI is unknowable at this time, we have not included an increase in the rent pursuant to these leases in the weighted average annual minimum increase presented.

The escalation provisions of our leases (by percentage of ABR) as of December 31, 2022, are displayed in the following chart: 
 
 If requested by a tenant, we may, subject to the tenant s history, creditworthiness, and other relevant considerations, agree to reimburse the tenant for property expansion or improvement costs that it incurs in connection with improvements at a property, 100 of which it leases from us. In exchange for such reimbursement, we generally receive contractually specified rent that increases proportionally with our funding. For example, we may agree to reimburse a tenant, up to a specified amount, for property expansion or improvement costs that it incurs in improving a commercial facility on its property. Generally, as we reimburse the tenant for property expansion or improvement costs, the rent will increase proportionally with our funding, which typically allows us to achieve a consistent cash yield on our funding throughout improvement. 
 
 Investment Guidelines 
 
 We seek to acquire primarily freestanding, single-tenant commercial real estate properties located in the United States that are under lease and fully occupied at the time of acquisition. We also seek to maintain our portfolio s diversification by property type, geography, tenant, and industry in an effort to reduce fluctuations in income caused by under-performing individual real estate assets or adverse economic conditions affecting an entire industry or geographic region. When evaluating whether a property acquisition would contribute to our overall portfolio s diversification, we expect to take into account the percentage a single property, tenant, or brand would represent in our overall portfolio, as well as geographic concentrations, both by the metropolitan statistical area and by state. While we consider these criteria when evaluating acquisition opportunities, we may also pursue opportunistic investments that do not meet one or more of these factors if we assess that a transaction presents compelling risk-adjusted returns. We intend to primarily acquire portfolios and assets over time that will generally not result in any one tenant representing more than 5 of ABR. We are focused primarily on investing in the industrial, healthcare, restaurant, and retail property types, and consider certain office properties acquired in connection with a portfolio of other assets. Within each property type, we target specific acquisition opportunities in a highly selective manner. 
 Industrial . We focus on single-tenant manufacturing, warehouse and distribution facilities, food processing, refrigerated storage, flex-space, and research and development facilities where the tenant has a strong credit profile and experienced management team. We look for industrial assets where the real estate is mission critical to the tenant s operations, where the property sits on an essential or strategic location for the tenant, and where it would be difficult or more expensive for the tenant to relocate. We look for industrial properties that are located in close proximity to major transportation thoroughfares such as airports, ports, railways, major freeways or interstate highways. 

Healthcare . We focus on single-tenant medical office buildings, large regional physician practices, and off-campus clinics affiliated with major health systems, as well as laboratories, ambulatory surgical centers, service-type locations such as dental and dialysis centers, and animal health service clinics. We primarily focus on healthcare properties that have substantial tenant 

15 

investments like special regulatory permits and buildouts that would make relocation difficult or costly. We look for healthcare properties that are mission critical to tenant operations, generally located adjacent to or near hospital campuses or other medical facilities, and where the tenant has a strong credit profile and is not easily displaced by regulatory changes. In certain instances, we will seek additional credit enhancements to augment the credit of the tenant. In states where a certificate of need statute exists, we ensure that our sites carry this designation to maintain long-term viability. 

Restaurant . We focus our restaurant investments primarily in single-tenant quick service restaurant and casual dining properties, with an emphasis on restaurants that are located in strong retail markets. We underwrite restaurant properties primarily based on the fundamental value of the underlying real estate, site level performance, corporate owned location or experienced multi-unit franchise operators, and whether the property is subject to a master lease with multiple operating locations. 

Retail. We focus on e-commerce resistant industries where the presence of a physical location is important to the end consumer and mission critical to the tenant. Our retail investments are primarily in single-tenant, net leased retail establishments in the general merchandise, automotive, and home furnishings industries, with an emphasis on market presence and necessity-based shopping. We underwrite retail properties primarily based on the fundamental value of the underlying real estate, site level performance, corporate owned location or experienced multi-unit franchise operators, and whether the property is subject to a master lease with multiple operating locations. 

Office . Our portfolio includes single-tenant corporate headquarters, mission-critical business operations, and call centers with creditworthy tenants where the property is strategically located or important to the tenant s business. While not a strategic priority of ours, key considerations for us when making office investments as part of a broader portfolio acquisition include a strong tenant credit profile, tenant s previous investment in the property, occupancy costs relative to the market, divisibility of the space, cost associated with repositioning the space upon lease expiration and whether the property is subject to a master lease with multiple operating locations in a different property type. 

Competition 
 The commercial real estate market is highly competitive. We compete for tenants to occupy our properties in all of our markets with other owners and operators of commercial real estate. We compete based on a number of factors that include location, rental rates, security, suitability of the property s design to prospective tenants needs, and the manner in which the property is operated and marketed. The number of competing properties in a particular market could have a material effect on our occupancy levels, rental rates, and the operating expenses of certain of our properties. 
 In addition, we compete with other entities engaged in real estate investment activities to locate suitable properties to acquire and purchasers to buy our properties. These competitors include other REITs, private and institutional real estate investors, sovereign wealth funds, banks, insurance companies, investment banking firms, lenders, specialty finance companies, and other entities. Some of these competitors, including larger REITs, have substantially greater financial resources, including lower cost of capital, than we have. The relative size of their portfolios may allow them to absorb properties with lower returns or allow them to accept more risk on a given property than we can prudently manage, including risks with respect to the creditworthiness of tenants. In addition, these same entities may seek financing through similar channels to us, and may have a higher target leverage profile. Competition from these REITs and other third-party real estate investors may limit the number of suitable investment opportunities available to us. It also may result in higher prices, lower yields, and a narrower spread of yields over our borrowing costs, making it more difficult for us to acquire new investments on attractive terms. 
 Human Capital 
 As of December 31, 2022, we employed 73 full-time employees, comprised of professional employees engaged in origination, underwriting, closing, accounting and financial reporting, portfolio and asset management, capital markets, and other corporate activities essential to our business. 
 Our commitment to our employees is central to our ability to continue to deliver strong performance and financial results for our stockholders and other stakeholders. We are as passionate about our people as we are about real estate. We seek to create and cultivate an inclusive and engaging work environment for our employees, which allows us to attract, retain, and develop top talent to manage our business. We strive to provide our employees with a work environment that is free from discrimination and harassment, that respects and honors their differences and unique life experiences, and that enables employees the opportunity to develop and excel in their role and reach their full potential. We seek to provide a collaborative, creative workplace where people with unique talents can flourish, where their opinions are valued, and where their contributions are rewarded. 
 
 16 

As part of our commitment to our employees, we are focused on the following: 
 Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion DE I We are committed to providing equal opportunity in all aspects of employment and cultivating a diverse, equitable, and inclusive workplace. We believe that diverse backgrounds and experiences help drive our performance and are important assets for our company. To that end, we value and advance the diversity, equity, and inclusion of the people with whom we work. Our cross-functional DE I committee spearheads our ongoing efforts to deepen our commitment to this important initiative and drive our education, including diversity trainings on topics such as unconscious bias, and inclusive leadership and culture. The committee also focuses on employee engagement, policy reviews, recruitment, and monetary donations to external DE I focused programs and organizations and sponsorship of employee groups. DE I is a critical business imperative that requires ongoing focus and commitment; therefore, our efforts to promote greater diversity, equity, and inclusion within and beyond our workplace have been instituted as a regular reporting item for our employees and our Board of Directors. 

Career Development We strive to create an engaging work experience that allows for career development and related opportunities. We offer numerous opportunities for our employees to engage in personal and professional development, including educational support and opportunities for tuition assistance and reimbursement, participation in industry conferences and networking events, individual leadership and management training, access to an online learning library and professional book club providing an extensive collection of learning and development opportunities, lunch and learn meetings with our CEO and senior management team, group trainings (e.g., underwriting, real estate fundamentals, cyber security, computer skills, safety, ethics, harassment prevention, and DE I related content), peer mentorship opportunities, and reimbursement for continuing education. 

Employee Wellness Our employees are our most valuable asset, and their individual and group contributions drive our performance and success. As a result, we are focused on and invest in our team s overall health, wellness, and engagement. We employ numerous strategies and initiatives to nurture and nourish our employees physical, mental, and emotional well-being, including, among other things, competitive employee benefits (with 100 employer-paid healthcare options), generous paid time off programs, fringe benefits to make both the Broadstone and home office environments more comfortable, transparent and open communication and dialogue between our senior executives and our employee base, events and opportunities for social connectedness and fun family-friendly corporate events, wellness and fitness events, on-site flu vaccinations administered by a third-party health-services provider, flexibility in work location and schedules to meet specific employee needs, and access to an employee assistance program and other health and wellness resources. 

Community Engagement We believe in our responsibility to help the communities around us by providing support to charitable organizations and encourage living philanthropically. We offer regular volunteer and giving opportunities throughout the year that provide our employees with meaningful civic involvement. Since our inception, we have facilitated opportunities for our employees to contribute time and resources to benefit local nonprofit organizations. Our community engagement efforts are led by our employees through a dedicated committee that is responsible for engaging with community organizations, planning and organizing various opportunities for employees to make a difference through volunteer giving and service, and civic involvement with non-profit organizations, and corporate donations. 

We believe that the initiatives described above will help us attract, hire, and retain employees. 
 Principal Executive Offices 
 Our principal executive offices are located at 800 Clinton Square, Rochester, New York, 14604, and our telephone number is (585) 287-6500. 
 Insurance 
 Our tenants are generally required to maintain liability and property insurance coverage for the properties they lease from us pursuant to net leases. These leases generally require our tenants to name us (and any of our lenders that have a mortgage on the property leased by the tenant) as additional insureds on their liability policies and loss payee (or mortgagee, in the case of our lenders) on their property policies. Depending on the location of the property, certain losses of a catastrophic nature, such as those caused by earthquakes and floods, may be covered by insurance policies that are held by our tenant with limitations such as large deductibles or co-payments that a tenant may not be able to meet. Certain other losses of a catastrophic nature, such as those caused by wind/hail, hurricanes, terrorism or acts of war, may be uninsurable or not economically insurable. In the event there is damage to our properties that is not covered by insurance and such properties are subject to recourse indebtedness, we will continue to be liable for the indebtedness, even if these properties are irreparably damaged. 
 
 In addition to being an additional insured on our tenants liability policies, we separately maintain commercial general liability coverage on the entire portfolio and, in certain instances, general or specific (e.g., flood) property-level insurance coverage on certain properties or pursuant to the terms of certain of our leases. We also maintain full property coverage on all untenanted properties and other property coverage as may be required by our lenders, which are not required to be carried by our tenants under our leases. 
 17 

Government Regulation 
 General 
 Our investments are subject to various laws, ordinances, and regulations, including, among other things, fire and safety requirements, zoning regulations, land use controls, and environmental controls relating to air and water quality, noise pollution, and indirect environmental impacts. We believe that we have all permits and approvals necessary under current law to operate our investments. 
 Americans with Disabilities Act ADA 
 Under Title III of the ADA, and rules promulgated thereunder, in order to protect individuals with disabilities, public accommodations must remove architectural and communication barriers that are structural in nature from existing places of public accommodation to the extent readily achievable. In addition, under the ADA, alterations to a place of public accommodation or a commercial facility are to be made so that, to the maximum extent feasible, such altered portions are readily accessible to and usable by disabled individuals. The readily achievable standard takes into account, among other factors, the financial resources of the affected site and the owner, lessor or other applicable person. 
 Compliance with the ADA, as well as other federal, state, and local laws, may require modifications to properties we currently own or may purchase, or may restrict renovations of those properties. Failure to comply with these laws or regulations could result in the imposition of fines or an award of damages to private litigants, as well as the incurrence of the costs of making modifications to attain compliance, and future legislation could impose additional obligations or restrictions on our properties. Although our tenants are generally responsible for all maintenance and repairs of the property pursuant to our lease, including compliance with the ADA and other similar laws or regulations, we could be held liable as the owner of the property for a failure of one of our tenants to comply with these laws or regulations. 
 Environmental Matters 
 Federal, state, and local environmental laws and regulations regulate, and impose liability for, releases of hazardous or toxic substances into the environment. Under many of these laws and regulations, a current or previous owner, operator or tenant of real estate may be required to investigate and clean up or otherwise address hazardous or toxic substances, hazardous wastes or petroleum product releases or threats of releases at the property, and may be held liable to a government entity or to third parties for property damage and for investigation, clean-up, and monitoring costs incurred by those parties in connection with the actual or threatened contamination. These laws may impose clean-up responsibility and liability without regard to fault and regardless of, whether the owner, operator, or tenant knew of or caused the presence of the contamination. The liability under these laws may be joint and several for the full amount of the investigation, clean-up, and monitoring costs incurred or to be incurred or actions to be undertaken, although a party held jointly and severally liable may seek to obtain contributions from other identified, solvent, responsible parties of their fair share toward these costs. These costs may be substantial, and can exceed the value of the property. In addition, some environmental laws may create a lien on the contaminated site in favor of the government for damages and costs it incurs in connection with the contamination. As the owner or operator of real estate, we also may be liable under common law to third parties for damages and injuries resulting from environmental contamination emanating from the real estate. The presence of contamination, or the failure to properly remediate contamination, on a property may adversely affect the ability of the owner, operator or tenant to sell or rent that property or to borrow using the property as collateral, and may adversely impact our investment in that property. 
 Some of our properties contain, have contained, or are adjacent to or near other properties that have contained or currently contain storage tanks for the storage of petroleum products or other hazardous or toxic substances. Similarly, some of our properties currently are or were used in the past for commercial or industrial purposes that involve or involved the use of petroleum products or other hazardous or toxic substances, or are adjacent to or near properties that have been or are used for similar commercial or industrial purposes. These operations create a potential for the release of petroleum products or other hazardous or toxic substances, and we could potentially be required to pay to clean up any contamination. In addition, environmental laws regulate a variety of activities that can occur on a property, including the storage of petroleum products or other hazardous or toxic substances, air emissions, water discharges, and exposure to lead-based paint. Such laws may impose fines or penalties for violations and may require permits or other governmental approvals to be obtained for the operation of a business involving such activities. Any of the foregoing matters could have a material adverse effect on us. 
 Environmental laws also govern the presence, maintenance, and removal of asbestos-containing materials ACM ). Federal regulations require building owners and those exercising control over a building s management to identify and warn, through signs and labels, of potential hazards posed by workplace exposure to installed ACM in their building. The regulations also have employee training, record keeping, and due diligence requirements pertaining to ACM. Significant fines can be assessed for violation of these regulations. As a result of these regulations, building owners and those exercising control over a building s management may be subject to an increased risk of personal injury lawsuits by workers and others exposed to ACM. The regulations may affect the value of a building containing ACM in which we have invested. Federal, state, and local laws and regulations also govern the removal, encapsulation, disturbance, handling, and/or disposal of ACM when those materials are in poor condition or in the event of construction, remodeling, renovation, or demolition of a building. These laws may impose liability for improper handling or a release into the environment of ACM and may provide for fines to, and for third parties to seek recovery from, owners or operators of real properties for personal injury or improper work exposure associated with ACM. 
 18 

When excessive moisture accumulates in buildings or on building materials, mold growth may occur, particularly if the moisture problem remains undiscovered or is not addressed over a period of time. Some molds may produce airborne toxins or irritants. Indoor air quality issues can also stem from inadequate ventilation, chemical contamination from indoor or outdoor sources, and other biological contaminants such as pollen, viruses, and bacteria. Indoor exposure to airborne toxins or irritants above certain levels can be alleged to cause a variety of adverse health effects and symptoms, including allergic or other reactions. As a result, the presence of significant mold or other airborne contaminants at any of our properties could require us to undertake a costly remediation program to contain or remove the mold or other airborne contaminants from the affected property or increase indoor ventilation. In addition, the presence of significant mold or other airborne contaminants could expose us to liability from our tenants, employees of our tenants, or others if property damage or personal injury occurs. 
 Before completing any property acquisition, we typically obtain environmental assessments in order to identify potential environmental concerns at the property. These assessments are carried out in accordance with the Standard Practice for Environmental Site Assessments (ASTM Practice E 1527-13) as set by ASTM International, formerly known as the American Society for Testing and Materials, and generally include a physical site inspection, a review of relevant federal, state, and local environmental and health agency database records, one or more interviews with appropriate site-related personnel, review of the property s chain of title, and review of historical aerial photographs and other information on past uses of the property. These assessments are limited in scope. If, however, recommended in the initial assessments, we may undertake additional assessments such as soil and/or groundwater sampling or other limited subsurface investigations and ACM or mold surveys to test for substances of concern. A prior owner or operator of a property or historical operations at or near our properties may have created a material environmental condition that is not known to us or the independent consultants preparing the site assessments. Material environmental conditions may have arisen after the review was completed or may arise in the future, and future laws, ordinances, or regulations may impose material additional environmental liability. If environmental concerns are not satisfactorily resolved in any initial or additional assessments, we may obtain environmental insurance policies to insure against potential environmental risk or loss depending on the type of property, the availability and cost of the insurance, and various other factors we deem relevant (e.g., an environmental occurrence affects one of our properties where our lessee may not have the financial capability to honor its indemnification obligations to us). Our ultimate liability for environmental conditions may exceed the policy limits on any environmental insurance policies we obtain, if any. 
 Generally, our leases require the lessee to comply with environmental law and provide that the lessee will indemnify us for any loss or expense we incur as a result of lessee s violation of environmental law or the presence, use or release of hazardous materials on our property attributable to the lessee. If our lessees do not comply with environmental law, or we are unable to enforce the indemnification obligations of our lessees, our results of operations would be adversely affected. 
 We cannot predict what other environmental legislation or regulations will be enacted in the future, how existing or future laws or regulations will be administered or interpreted, or what environmental conditions may be found to exist on the properties in the future. Compliance with existing and new laws and regulations may require us or our tenants to spend funds to remedy environmental problems. If we or our tenants were to become subject to significant environmental liabilities, we could be materially and adversely affected. 
 Tax Regulation 
 We elected to be taxed as a REIT under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, (as amended, the Code beginning with our taxable year ended December 31, 2008. We believe that as of such date we have been organized and have operated in a manner to qualify for taxation as a REIT for U.S. federal income tax purposes. We intend to continue to be organized and operate in such a manner. In order to qualify as a REIT, we are required under the Code, among other things, to distribute annually at least 90 of our REIT taxable income, determined without regard to the dividends paid deduction and excluding any net capital gain. In addition, we will be subject to income tax at the corporate rate to the extent that we distribute less than 100 of our REIT taxable income, determined without regard to the dividends paid deduction and including any net capital gain. As a result of our distribution requirements, we rely, in part, on third-party sources to fund our capital needs. Additionally, if we were to lose REIT status we would face significant tax consequences that would substantially reduce our cash available for distribution to our stockholders.

Item 1A. 	 Ris k Factors 
 Summary Risk Factors 
 You should carefully consider the matters discussed in the Risk Factors section beginning on page 21 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for factors you should consider before investing in our Common Stock: 
 Single-tenant leases involve significant risks of tenant default and tenant vacancies, which could materially and adversely affect us. 

We have limited opportunities to increase rents under our long-term leases with tenants, which could impede our growth and materially and adversely affect us. 

We may not be able to achieve growth through acquisitions at a rate that is comparable to our historical results, which could materially and adversely affect us. 

We may not be able to effectively manage our growth and any failure to do so could materially and adversely affect us. 

The departure of any of our key personnel with long-standing business relationships could materially and adversely affect us. 

Our portfolio is concentrated in certain states, and any adverse developments and economic downturns in these geographic markets could materially and adversely affect us. 

Our portfolio is concentrated in certain property types and any adverse developments relating to one or more of these property types could materially and adversely affect us. 

We may be unable to renew leases, re-lease properties as leases expire, or lease vacant spaces on favorable terms or at all, which, in each case, could materially and adversely affect us. 

We could face potential material adverse effects from the bankruptcies or insolvencies of our tenants. 

Global and U.S. financial markets and economic conditions may materially and adversely affect us and the ability of our tenants to make rental payments to us pursuant to our leases. 

Inflation may materially and adversely affect us and our tenants. 

As of December 31, 2022, we had approximately 2.0 billion principal balance of indebtedness outstanding, which may expose us to the risk of default under our debt obligations. 

Market conditions could adversely affect our ability to refinance existing indebtedness on acceptable terms or at all, which could materially and adversely affect us. 

Our Revolving Credit Facility and term loan agreements contain various covenants which, if not complied with, could accelerate our repayment obligations, thereby materially and adversely affecting us. 

We are a holding company with no direct operations and rely on funds received from the OP to pay liabilities. 

Failure to qualify as a REIT would materially and adversely affect us and the value of our Common Stock. 

The market price and trading volume of shares of our Common Stock may be volatile. 

We may not be able to make distributions to our stockholders at the times or in the amounts we expect, or at all. 

21 

Risk Factors 
 The following are some of the risks and uncertainties that could cause our actual results to differ materially from those presented in our forward-looking statements. You should consider carefully the risks described below and the other information in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, including our Consolidated Financial Statements and the related notes. The risks and uncertainties described below are not the only ones we face but do represent those risks and uncertainties that we believe are material to us. Additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us or that we currently deem immaterial may also harm our business. 
 Risks Related to Our Business and Properties 
 Single-tenant leases involve significant risks of tenant default and tenant vacancies, which could materially and adversely affect us. 
 Our portfolio consists primarily of single-tenant net leased properties and we are dependent on our tenants for substantially all of our revenue. As a result, our success depends on the financial stability of our tenants. The ability of our tenants to meet their obligations to us, including their obligations to pay rent, maintain certain insurance coverage, pay real estate taxes, and maintain the properties in a manner so as not to jeopardize their operating licenses or regulatory status depends on the performance of their business and industry, as well as general market and economic conditions, which are outside of our control. At any given time, any tenant may experience a downturn in its business that may weaken its operating results or the overall financial condition of individual properties or its business as whole. As a result, a tenant may fail to make rental payments when due, decline to extend a lease upon its expiration, become insolvent, or declare bankruptcy. An actual or anticipated tenant default, bankruptcy, or vacancy, or speculation in the press or investment community about an actual or anticipated tenant default, bankruptcy, or vacancy may also negatively affect our share price or result in fluctuations in the market price or trading volume of shares of our Common Stock. The financial failure of, or default in payment by, a single tenant under its lease is likely to cause a significant or complete reduction in our rental revenue from that property and a reduction in the value of the property. We may also experience difficulty or a significant delay in re-leasing or selling such property. The occurrence of one or more tenant defaults could materially and adversely affect us. 
 This risk is magnified in situations where we lease multiple properties to a single tenant under a master lease. As of December 31, 2022, master leases contributed to approximately 67.7 of our ABR associated with multi-site tenants (418 of our 489 multi-site tenant properties), and approximately 40.8 of our overall ABR (489 of our 804 properties). A tenant failure or default under a master lease could reduce or eliminate rental revenue from multiple properties and reduce the value of such properties. Although the master lease structure may be beneficial to us because it restricts the ability of tenants to remove individual underperforming assets, there is no guarantee that a tenant will not default in its obligations to us or decline to renew its master lease upon expiration. The default of a tenant that leases multiple properties from us or its decision not to renew its master lease upon expiration could materially and adversely affect us. 
 We have limited opportunities to increase rents under our long-term leases with tenants, which could impede our growth and materially and adversely affect us. 
 We typically lease our properties pursuant to long-term net leases with initial terms of 10 years or more that often have renewal options. As of December 31, 2022, the ABR weighted average remaining term of our leases was approximately 10.9 years, excluding renewal options. Substantially all of our leases provide for periodic rent escalations, but these built-in increases may be less than what we otherwise could achieve in the market. Most of our leases contain rent escalators that increase rent at a fixed amount on fixed dates, which may be less than prevailing market rates over the lease duration. For those leases that contain rent escalators based on CPI changes, our rent increases during periods of low inflation or deflation may be less than what we otherwise could achieve in the market. As a result, the long-term nature of our leases could impede our growth and materially and adversely affect us. In addition, properties leased pursuant to long-term leases at below market rental rates or with below market rent escalations may be less attractive to potential buyers, which could affect our ability to sell such properties at an acceptable price or at all. 
 We may not be able to achieve growth through acquisitions at a rate that is comparable to our historical results, which could materially and adversely affect us. 
 Our growth strategy depends significantly on acquiring new properties. From 2015 to 2022, we have acquired an average of 500.0 million of new properties per year, with a low of 100.0 million and a high of 1.0 billion. Our ability to continue to grow requires us to identify and complete acquisitions that meet our investment criteria and depends on general market and economic conditions. 
 Changes in the volume of real estate transactions, the availability of acquisition financing, capitalization rates, interest rates, competition, or other factors may negatively impact our acquisition opportunities in 2023 and beyond. If we are unable to achieve growth through acquisitions at a rate that is comparable to our historical results, it could materially and adversely affect us. Furthermore, our acquisition volume within each year has not always been consistent on a quarterly basis, nor can we guarantee it will be consistent in the future. As a result, our acquisition results that we report on a quarterly basis may not meet investors expectations and could negatively impact the value of our Common Stock. 
 We may not achieve the total returns we expect from our future acquisitions, which could materially and adversely affect us. 
 As we pursue our growth strategy, we may encounter increasingly difficult market conditions that place downward pressure on the total returns we can achieve on our investments. Accordingly, future acquisitions may have lower yield characteristics than past and present 
 22 

opportunities. To the extent that our future growth is achieved through acquisitions that yield lower returns, it could materially and adversely affect us. In addition, if we fund future acquisitions with equity issuances, the dilutive impact could outweigh the benefits of acquisitions that achieve lower returns, which could materially and adversely affect us. 
 We may be unable to sell a property at the time we desire on favorable terms or at all, which could limit our ability to access capital through dispositions and could adversely affect our cash flow, financial condition and results of operations. 
 Real estate investments generally cannot be sold quickly. Our ability to dispose of properties on advantageous terms depends on factors beyond our control, including competition from other sellers, increases in market capitalization rates and the availability of attractive financing for potential buyers of our properties, and we cannot predict the various market conditions affecting real estate investments that will exist at any particular time in the future. As a result of the uncertainty of market conditions, we cannot provide any assurance that we will be able to sell properties at a profit, or at all. In addition, and subject to certain safe harbor provisions, the Code generally imposes a 100 tax on gain recognized by REITs upon the sale or disposition of property other than a foreclosure property, if the property is held primarily for sale to customers in the ordinary course of business, rather than for investment, which may cause us to forego or defer sales of properties that otherwise would be attractive from a pre-tax perspective or require us to conduct such sales through our taxable REIT subsidiary TRS ), which would be subject to U.S. federal and state income taxation. Accordingly, our ability to access capital through dispositions of properties may be limited, which could limit our ability to fund future capital needs. 
 We may not be able to obtain acquisition financing or obtain other capital from third-party sources on favorable terms or at all, which could materially and adversely affect our growth prospects and our business. 
 In order to qualify as a REIT, we are required under the Code, among other things, to distribute annually at least 90 of our REIT taxable income, determined without regard to the dividends paid deduction and excluding any net capital gain. In addition, we will be subject to income tax at the corporate rate to the extent that we distribute less than 100 of our REIT taxable income, determined without regard to the dividends paid deduction and including any net capital gain. Because of these distribution requirements, we may not be able to fund future capital needs, including any necessary acquisition financing, or repay debt obligations from operating cash flow. Consequently, we expect to rely, in part, on third-party sources to fund our capital needs. We may not be able to obtain the financing on favorable terms or at all. Our access to third-party sources of capital from the equity and/or debt markets depends, in part, on: 
 general market conditions; 

the market s perception of our growth potential; 

our current debt levels; 

our current and expected future earnings; 

the performance of our portfolio; 

our cash flow and cash distributions; 

external valuations by credit ratings agencies and analysts; and 

the market price per share of our Common Stock. 

If we cannot obtain capital from third-party sources, we may not be able to acquire properties when strategic opportunities exist, meet the capital and operating needs of our existing properties, or satisfy our debt service obligations, which could materially and adversely affect us. 
 An increase in market interest rates could increase our interest costs on existing and future debt and could adversely affect our stock price, and a decrease in market interest rates could lead to additional competition for the acquisition of real estate, which could adversely affect our results of operations. 
 If interest rates continue to increase, so could our interest costs for any new debt and our existing variable-rate debt obligations. Absent a simultaneous increase in acquisition yields, this increased cost could make the financing of any acquisition more expensive and lower our current and future period earnings. Rising interest rates could limit our ability to refinance existing debt when it matures or cause us to pay higher interest rates upon refinancing. See Risks Related to Debt Financing for additional information. In addition, an increase in interest rates could decrease the access current and prospective tenants have to credit, thereby decreasing the amount they are willing to pay to lease our assets and consequently limiting our ability, if necessary, to reposition our portfolio promptly in response to changes in economic or other conditions. Furthermore, the distribution yield on our Common Stock will influence the price of such Common Stock. Thus, an increase in market interest rates may lead prospective purchasers of our Common Stock to expect a higher distribution yield, which could adversely affect the market price of our Common Stock. See Risks Related to Ownership of Our Common Stock for more information. In addition, decreases in interest rates may lead to additional competition for the acquisition of real estate due to a reduction in desirable alternative income-producing investments. Increased competition for the acquisition of real estate may lead to a decrease in the 
 23 

yields on real estate we have targeted for acquisition. In such circumstances, if we are not able to offset the decrease in yields by obtaining lower interest costs on our borrowings, our results of operations will be adversely affected. 
 Security breaches and other technology disruptions could compromise our information systems and expose us to liability, which could materially and adversely affect us. 
 Information security risks generally have increased in recent years due to the increased technological sophistication and activities of perpetrators of cyber-attacks. Our business involves the storage and transmission of numerous classes of sensitive and confidential information and intellectual property, including tenants information, private information about our stockholders and our employees, and financial and strategic information about us. In addition to our internal information systems, we also rely on third-party service providers that may have access to such information in connection with providing necessary information technology and security and other business services to us. We face risks associated with security breaches through cyber-attacks or cyber-intrusions, malware, computer viruses, attachments to e-mails, persons inside our organization or persons with access to systems inside our organization, and other significant disruptions of our IT networks and related systems. The risk of a security breach or disruption, particularly through cyber-attack or cyber-intrusion, including by computer hackers, foreign governments, and cyber terrorists, has generally increased as the number, intensity, and sophistication of attempted attacks and intrusions from around the world have increased. If we fail to assess and identify cybersecurity risks associated with our operations, we may become increasingly vulnerable to such risks. Additionally, the measures we have implemented to prevent security breaches and cyber incidents may not be effective. The theft, destruction, loss, misappropriation, or release of sensitive or confidential information or intellectual property, or interference with or disruptions of our IT networks and related systems or the technology systems of third parties on which we rely, could result in business disruption, negative publicity, brand damage, violation of privacy laws, loss of tenants, potential liability, and competitive disadvantage. The costs related to cyber-attacks or other security threats or disruptions may not be fully insured or indemnified by other means. Laws and regulations governing data privacy are constantly evolving. Many of these laws and regulations, including the California Consumer Protection Act, contain detailed requirements regarding collecting and processing personal information, restrict the use and storage of such information, and govern the effectiveness of consumer consent. Any of the above risks could materially and adversely affect us. 
 We may not be able to effectively manage our growth and any failure to do so could materially and adversely affect us. 
 We have grown rapidly and our growth strategy depends significantly on continued growth through acquisitions. Our future operating results will depend on our ability to effectively manage this growth. To accomplish this, we will need to: 
 invest in enhanced operational systems that can scale as our portfolio grows in size; 

attract, integrate, and retain operations personnel as our Company grows in complexity; and 

identify and supervise a number of suitable third-parties to provide services to us. 

We cannot provide any assurance that we will be able to effectively manage our growth, which could materially and adversely affect us. 
 As we continue to acquire properties pursuant to our growth strategy, our portfolio may become less diversified, which could materially and adversely affect us. 
 In pursuing our growth strategy, we may acquire properties that cause our portfolio to become less diversified. If our portfolio becomes less diverse, our business may become subject to greater risk, including tenant bankruptcies, adverse industry trends, and economic downturns in a particular geographic area. As a result, if any such risks of a less diversified portfolio are realized, we could be materially and adversely affected. 
 We face significant competition for acquiring properties from both publicly traded REITs and private investors that have greater resources than we do, which could materially and adversely affect us. 
 We face significant competition from other entities engaged in real estate investment activities, including publicly traded and privately held REITs, private and institutional real estate investors, sovereign wealth funds, banks, insurance companies, investment banking firms, lenders, specialty finance companies, and other entities. Some of our competitors are larger and may have considerably greater financial, technical, leasing, underwriting, marketing, and other resources than we do. Some competitors may have a lower cost of capital and access to funding sources that may not be available to us. In addition, other competitors may have higher risk tolerances or different risk assessments and may not be subject to the same operating constraints, including maintaining REIT status. This competition may result in fewer acquisitions, higher prices, lower yields, less desirable property types, and acceptance of greater risk. As a result, we cannot provide any assurance that we will be able to successfully execute our growth strategy. Any failure to grow through acquisitions as a result of the significant competition we face could materially and adversely affect us. 
 24 

We face significant competition for tenants, which could materially and adversely affect us, including our occupancy, rental rates, results of operations, and business. 
 We compete with numerous developers, owners, and operators of properties, many of which own properties similar to ours in the same markets in which our properties are located. If our competitors offer space at rental rates below current market rates or below the rental rates we currently charge our tenants, we may lose existing or potential tenants or we may be pressured to reduce our rental rates or to offer more substantial rent abatements, tenant improvements, early termination rights, or below-market renewal options to retain tenants when our leases expire. Competition for tenants could decrease or prevent increases of the occupancy and rental rates of our properties, which could materially and adversely affect us. 
 
 Our performance may be negatively impacted by our recently announced management transitions, and we may not be able to successfully manage the transition process. 
 In January 2023, we announced that Christopher J. Czarnecki will resign from his roles as the President and Chief Executive Officer CEO of the Company and from the Board of Directors effective February 28, 2023. Our Board of Directors has named the Company s Executive Vice President and Chief Operating Officer COO ), John Moragne, to succeed Mr. Czarnecki as CEO of the Company and intends to appoint Mr. Moragne as a director to replace Mr. Czarnecki upon his departure. In light of the CEO transition, our Board of Directors approved a series of management team promotions, including: (1) the Company s Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer CFO ), Ryan Albano, being named as President and COO of the Company; and (2) the Company s Senior Vice President, Capital Markets Credit Risk, Kevin M. Fennell, being named to succeed Mr. Albano as the Executive Vice President and CFO of the Company, with each promotion to be effective on February 28, 2023. 
 Although Mr. Czarnecki has entered into a Chief Executive Officer Transition Agreement, pursuant to which Mr. Czarnecki has agreed to assist in the transition of his role and provide advisory services to the Company through January 31, 2024, there can be no assurance that we will be able to successfully manage this transition. If we do not successfully manage this transition process, it could be viewed negatively by our customers, employees or investors and could have a negative impact on our performance. 
 The departure of any of our key personnel with long-standing business relationships could materially and adversely affect us. 
 Our success and our ability to manage anticipated future growth depend, in large part, upon the efforts of our key personnel. 
 The majority of our senior management team has worked together and collectively managed our business, operations, and portfolio since 2015 and has a strong investment track record. Many of our other key executive personnel, particularly our senior management team, also have extensive experience and strong reputations in the real estate industry and have been instrumental in setting our strategic direction, operating our business, identifying, recruiting, and training key personnel, and arranging necessary financing. The departure of any member of our senior management team, or our inability to attract and retain highly qualified personnel, could adversely affect our business, diminish our investment opportunities, and weaken our relationships with lenders, business partners, existing and prospective tenants, and industry personnel, which could materially and adversely affect us. 
 Our portfolio is concentrated in certain states, and any adverse developments and economic downturns in these geographic markets could materially and adversely affect us. 
 As of December 31, 2022, approximately 34.6 of our ABR came from properties in our top five states: Texas (9.7 ), Michigan (8.4 ), Illinois (6.2 ), Wisconsin (5.4 ), and California (4.8 ). These geographic concentrations could adversely affect our operating performance if conditions become less favorable in any of the states or markets within which we have a concentration of properties. We can provide no assurance that any of our markets will grow, will not experience adverse developments, or that underlying real estate fundamentals will be favorable to owners and operators of industrial, healthcare, restaurant, office, and retail properties. A downturn in the economy in the states or regions in which we have a concentration of properties, or markets within such states or regions, or a slowdown in the demand for our tenants businesses caused by adverse economic, regulatory, or other conditions, could adversely affect our tenants operating businesses in those states and impair their ability to pay rent to us, which, in turn could materially and adversely affect us. 
 Our portfolio is also concentrated in certain property types and any adverse developments relating to one or more of these property types could materially and adversely affect us. 
 As of December 31, 2022, approximately 51.5 of our ABR came from industrial properties, 17.1 from healthcare properties, 13.5 from restaurant properties, 11.5 from retail properties, and 6.5 from office properties. Any adverse developments in one or more of these property types could materially and adversely affect us. For example, the market for restaurant, retail, and office properties has been, and could continue to be, adversely affected by weakness in the national, regional, and local economies, the adverse financial condition of some large restaurant and retail companies, the ongoing consolidation in the restaurant and retail industries, the widespread practice of telecommuting, the adverse changes in consumer spending and consumer preferences for particular goods, services, or store-based retailing, and the excess amount of restaurant, retail and office space in a number of markets. Accordingly, decreases in the demand for restaurant, retail, and/or office properties may have a greater adverse effect on us than if we had fewer investments in these industries. It also may be 
 25 

difficult and expensive to re-tenant a property designed for a particular property type with a new tenant that operates in an industry requiring a different property type. As a result, any adverse developments in one or more of our concentrated property types could materially and adversely affect us. 
 If one or more of our top 10 tenants, which together represented approximately 19.0 of our ABR as of December 31, 2022, suffers a downturn in their business, it could materially and adversely affect us. 
 As of December 31, 2022, our top 10 tenants together represented 19.0 of our ABR. Our largest tenant is Roskam Baking Company, which leases seven properties that in the aggregate represent approximately 4.0 of our ABR. Our top 10 tenants may experience a material business downturn weakening their financial position resulting in their failure to make timely rent payments and/or default under their leases. As a result, our revenue and cash flow could be materially and adversely affected. 
 We may be unable to renew leases, re-lease properties as leases expire, or lease vacant spaces on favorable terms or at all, which, in each case, could materially and adversely affect us. 
 Our results of operations depend on our ability to continue to successfully lease our properties, including renewing expiring leases, re-leasing properties as leases expire, leasing vacant space, optimizing our tenant mix, or leasing properties on more economically favorable terms. As of December 31, 2022, six leases representing approximately 1.2 of our ABR will expire during 2023. Current tenants may decline, or may not have the financial resources available, to renew current leases and we cannot assure you that leases that are renewed will have terms that are as economically favorable to us as the expiring lease terms. If tenants do not renew the leases as they expire, we cannot provide any assurance that we will be able to find new tenants or that our properties will be re-leased at rental rates equal to or above the current average rental rates or that substantial rent abatements, leasing commissions, tenant improvement allowances, early termination rights, or below-market renewal options will not be required to attract new tenants. We may experience significant costs in connection with re-leasing a significant number of our properties, which could materially and adversely affect us. As of December 31, 2022, three of our properties, representing approximately 0.6 of our portfolio, were unoccupied. We may experience difficulties in leasing this vacant space on favorable terms or at all. Any failure to renew leases, re-lease properties as leases expire, or lease vacant space could materially and adversely affect us. 
 Property vacancies could result in significant capital expenditures and illiquidity, particularly for specialty properties that are suitable for only one use. 
 The loss of a tenant, either through lease expiration or tenant bankruptcy or insolvency, may require us to spend significant amounts of capital to renovate the property before it is suitable for a new tenant and cause us to incur significant costs. In particular, our specialty properties are designed for a particular type of tenant or tenant use. If tenants of specialty properties do not renew or default on their leases, we may not be able to re-lease properties without substantial capital improvements, which may require significant cost and time to complete. Alternatively, we may not be able to re-lease or sell the property without such improvements or may be required to reduce the rent or selling price significantly. Recently, supply chain disruptions in the construction and building industry have resulted in increased costs and significant delays for building renovation and maintenance projects. This potential illiquidity may limit our ability to modify quickly our portfolio in response to changes in economic or other conditions, including tenant demand. Such occurrences could materially and adversely affect us. 
 We may experience a higher number of tenant defaults because we lease most of our properties to tenants who do not have an investment grade credit rating. 
 We depend on the ability of our tenants to meet their obligations to pay rent to us due under our lease for substantially all of our revenue. As of December 31, 2022, only approximately 15.4 of our ABR came from tenants who had an investment grade credit rating. A substantial majority of our properties are leased to unrated tenants. Our investments in properties leased to such tenants may have a greater risk of default than investments in properties leased exclusively to investment grade tenants. The ability of an unrated tenant to meet its rent and other obligations under its lease with us may be subject to greater risk than our tenants that have an investment grade rating. When we invest in properties where the tenant does not have a publicly available credit rating, we use certain credit-assessment tools as well as our own estimates of the tenant s credit rating which includes reviewing the tenant s financial information (e.g., financial ratios, net worth, revenue, cash flows, leverage and liquidity, if applicable). Our methods, however, may not adequately assess the risk of an investment and, if our assessment of credit quality proves to be inaccurate, we may be subject to defaults and investors may view our cash flows as less stable. If one or more of our unrated tenants defaults, it could have a material adverse effect on us. 
 Our underwriting and risk management procedures that we use to evaluate a tenant s credit risk may be faulty, deficient, or otherwise fail to accurately reflect the risk of our investment, which could materially and adversely affect us. 
 Our underwriting and risk management procedures that we use to evaluate a tenant s credit risk may not be sufficient to identify tenant problems in a timely manner or at all. To evaluate tenant credit risk, we utilize a third-party model, S P Capital IQ, to help us 
 26 

determine a tenant s implied credit rating when a public rating is not available. However, a rating from S P Capital IQ is not the same as a published credit rating and lacks extensive company participation that is typically involved when a rating agency publishes a rating. Therefore, such rating may not be as indicative of creditworthiness as a rating published by a nationally recognized statistical rating organization. Tenant credit ratings, public or implied, however, are only one component of how we assess the risk of tenant insolvency. We also use our own internal estimate of the likelihood of an insolvency or default, based on the regularly monitored performance of our properties, our assessment of each tenant s financial health, including profitability, liquidity, indebtedness, and leverage profile, and our assessment of the health and performance of the tenant s particular industry. If our assessment of credit quality proves to be inaccurate, we may experience one or more tenant defaults, which could have a material adverse effect on us. 
 Any failure of one or more tenants to provide accurate or complete financial information could prevent us from identifying tenant problems that could materially and adversely affect us. 
 We rely on information from our tenants to determine a potential tenant s credit risk as well as for on-going risk management. As of December 31, 2022, approximately 85.8 of our ABR is received from tenants that are required to provide us with specified financial information on a periodic basis. An additional 8.5 of our ABR is received from tenants who are not required to provide us with specified financial information under the terms of our lease, but whose financial statements are available publicly, either through SEC filings or otherwise. Ratings or conclusions derived from both S P Capital IQ and our internal teams rely on such information provided to us by our tenants and prospective tenants without independent verification on our part, and we must assume the appropriateness of estimates and judgments that were made by the party preparing the financial information. A tenant s failure to provide appropriate information may interfere with our ability to accurately evaluate a potential tenant s credit risk or determine an existing tenant s default risk, the occurrence of either could materially and adversely affect us. 
 We could face potential material adverse effects from the bankruptcies or insolvencies of our tenants. 
 If a tenant, or the guarantor of a lease of a tenant, commences, or has commenced against it, any legal or equitable proceeding under any bankruptcy, insolvency, receivership, or other debtor s relief statute or law (collectively, a bankruptcy proceeding ), we may be unable to collect all sums due to us under that tenant s lease or be forced to take back a property as a result of a default or a rejection of a lease by a tenant in a bankruptcy proceeding. In addition, an actual or anticipated tenant bankruptcy or speculation in the press or investment community about an actual or anticipated tenant bankruptcy may also negatively affect our share price or result in fluctuations in the market price or trading volume of shares of our Common Stock. If a tenant becomes bankrupt or insolvent, federal law may prohibit us from evicting such tenant based solely upon such bankruptcy or insolvency. In addition, a bankrupt or insolvent tenant may be authorized to reject and terminate its lease or leases with us. Any claims against such bankrupt tenant for unpaid future rent would be subject to statutory limitations that would likely result in our receipt of rental revenues that are substantially less than the contractually specified rent we are owed under the lease or leases. Any or all of the lease obligations of our tenants, or any guarantor of our tenants, could be subject to a bankruptcy proceeding which may bar our efforts to collect pre-bankruptcy debts from these entities or their properties, unless we are able to obtain an enabling order from the bankruptcy court. If our lease is rejected by a tenant in bankruptcy, we may only have a general unsecured claim against the tenant and may not be entitled to any further payments under the lease. We may also be unable to re-lease a terminated or rejected space or to re-lease it on comparable or more favorable terms. A bankruptcy proceeding could hinder or delay our efforts to collect past due balances and ultimately preclude collection of these sums, resulting in a decrease or cessation of rental payments, which could materially and adversely affect us. 
 Our properties may be subject to impairment charges. 
 We routinely evaluate our real estate investments for impairment indicators. The judgment regarding the existence of impairment indicators is based on factors such as market conditions and tenant performance. For example, the early termination of, or default under, a lease by a tenant may lead to an impairment charge. Since our investment focus is on properties net leased to a single tenant, the financial failure of, or other default by, a single tenant under its lease(s) may result in a significant impairment loss. If we determine that an impairment has occurred, we would be required to make a downward adjustment to the net carrying value of the property, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations in the period in which the impairment charge is recorded. Management has recorded impairment charges related to certain properties in each of the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021, and 2020, and may record future impairments based on actual results and changes in circumstances. Negative developments in the real estate market may cause management to reevaluate the business and macro-economic assumptions used in its impairment analysis. Changes in management s assumptions based on actual results may have a material impact on the Company s financial statements. See Critical Accounting Polices Long-Lived Asset Impairment in Item 7. Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations for a discussion of real estate impairment charges. 
 
 Changes in accounting standards may materially and adversely affect us. 
 From time to time the Financial Accounting Standards Board FASB ), and the SEC, which create and interpret appropriate accounting standards, may change the financial accounting and reporting standards or their interpretation and application of these standards 
 27 

that will govern the preparation of our financial statements. These changes could materially and adversely affect our reported financial condition and results of operations. In some cases, we could be required to apply a new or revised standard retroactively, resulting in restating prior period financial statements. In addition, any changes may undermine our ability to prepare timely and accurate financial statements, which could result in a lack of investor confidence and could materially and adversely affect us. Similarly, these changes could materially and adversely affect our tenants reported financial condition or results of operations and affect their preferences regarding leasing real estate as well as their ability to provide accurate or complete financial information to us. 
 We may acquire properties or portfolios of properties through tax deferred contribution transactions, which could result in stockholder dilution and limit our ability to sell such assets. 
 In the future we may acquire properties or portfolios of properties through tax deferred contribution transactions in exchange for OP Units, which may result in stockholder dilution. This acquisition structure may have the effect of, among other things, reducing the amount of tax depreciation we could deduct over the tax life of the acquired properties, and may require that we agree to protect the contributors ability to defer recognition of taxable gain through restrictions on our ability to dispose of the acquired properties and/or the allocation of debt to the contributors to maintain their tax bases. As of December 31, 2022, we were party to tax protection agreements covering three properties. Based on values as of December 31, 2022, taxable sales of the applicable properties would trigger liability under the agreements of approximately 10.4 million. In addition, in connection with the Internalization, we entered into a tax protection agreement with Amy L. Tait, the Company s founder, and certain members of her family (the Founding Owners Tax Protection Agreement ), which has a potential liability of up to 10 million based on values as of December 31, 2022. These restrictions could limit our ability to sell certain assets or the OP (or our interest in the OP) at a time, or on terms, that would be favorable absent such restrictions. 
 Certain provisions of our leases or loan agreements may be unenforceable, which could materially and adversely affect us. 
 Our rights and obligations with respect to the leases at our properties, mortgage loans, or other loans are governed by written agreements. A court could determine that one or more provisions of such agreements are unenforceable, such as a particular remedy, a master lease covenant, a loan prepayment provision, or a provision governing our security interest in the underlying collateral of a borrower or lessee. We could be adversely impacted if this were to happen with respect to an asset or group of assets. 
 We may become subject to litigation, which could materially and adversely affect us. 
 In the future we may become subject to litigation, including, but not limited to, claims relating to our operations, past and future securities offerings, corporate transactions, and otherwise in the ordinary course of business. Some of these claims may result in significant defense costs and potentially significant judgments against us, some of which are not, or cannot be, insured against. We generally intend to vigorously defend ourselves. However, we cannot be certain of the ultimate outcomes of any claims that may arise in the future. Resolution of these types of matters against us may result in our having to pay significant fines, judgments, or settlements, which, if uninsured, or if the fines, judgments, and settlements exceed insured levels, could adversely impact our earnings and cash flows, thereby materially and adversely affecting us. Certain litigation or the resolution of certain litigation may affect the availability or cost of some of our insurance coverage, which could materially and adversely impact us, expose us to increased risks that would be uninsured, and materially and adversely impact our ability to attract directors and officers. 
 A failure to maintain effective internal controls could materially and adversely affect us. 
 Effective internal controls over financial reporting, disclosures, and operations are necessary for us to provide reliable financial reports and public disclosures, effectively prevent fraud, and operate successfully. If we cannot provide reliable financial reports and public disclosures or prevent fraud, our reputation and operating results would be harmed. Our internal controls over financial reporting and our operating internal controls may not prevent or detect financial misstatements or loss of assets because of inherent limitations, including the possibility of human error, management override of controls, or fraud. Effective internal controls can provide only reasonable assurance with respect to financial statement accuracy, public disclosures, and safeguarding of assets. Any failure of these internal controls, including any failure to implement required new or improved controls as a result of changes to our business or otherwise, or if we experience difficulties in their implementation, could result in decreased investor confidence in the accuracy and completeness of our financial reports and public disclosures, civil litigation, or investigations by the SEC or other regulatory authorities, and we could fail to meet our reporting obligations, which could materially and adversely affect us. 
 A limited number of our leases may require us to pay property-related expenses that are not the obligations of our tenants, which could materially and adversely affect us. 
 Under the terms of substantially all of our leases, our tenants are responsible for the payment or reimbursement of property expenses such as real estate taxes, insurance, maintenance, repairs, and capital costs in addition to satisfying their rent obligations. Under the provisions of a limited number of our existing leases and leases that we may enter into in the future, however, we may be required to pay some or all of the expenses of the property, such as the costs of environmental liabilities, roof and structural repairs, real estate taxes, 
 28 

insurance, certain non-structural repairs, and maintenance. If our properties incur significant expenses that must be paid by us under the terms of our leases, our business, financial condition, and results of operations may be adversely affected and the amount of cash available to meet expenses and to make distributions to our stockholders and unitholders may be reduced. 
 
 As a property owner, we may be subject to environmental liabilities, which could be substantial. 
 There may be known or unknown environmental liabilities associated with properties we previously owned, currently own, or may acquire in the future. Under various federal, state, and local laws and regulations relating to the environment, as a current or former owner or operator of real property, we may be liable for costs and damages resulting from environmental matters, including the presence or discharge of hazardous or toxic substances, waste, or petroleum products at, on, in, under or migrating from such property, including costs to investigate or clean up such contamination and liability for personal injury, property damage, or harm to natural resources. Such laws often impose liability without regard to whether the owner or operator knew of, or was responsible for, the presence of such contamination. These costs and damages could be substantial. Certain uses of some properties may have a heightened risk of environmental liability because of the hazardous materials used in performing services on those properties, such as industrial properties or auto parts and auto service businesses using petroleum products, paint, machine solvents, and other hazardous materials. We typically undertake customary environmental diligence prior to our acquisition of any property, including obtaining Phase I environmental site assessments. The Phase I environmental site assessments are limited in scope and therefore may not reveal all environmental conditions affecting a property. Therefore, there could be undiscovered environmental liabilities on the properties we own. 
 The known or potential presence of hazardous substances on a property may adversely affect our ability to sell, lease, or improve the property, or to borrow using the property as collateral. In addition, environmental laws may create liens on contaminated properties in favor of the government for damages and costs it incurs to address such contamination. Moreover, if contamination is discovered on our properties, environmental laws may impose restrictions on the manner in which they may be used or which businesses may be operated, and these restrictions may require substantial expenditures. 
 Although we may obtain insurance for environmental liability for certain properties that are deemed to warrant coverage, our insurance may be insufficient to address any particular environmental situation and we may be unable to continue to obtain insurance for environmental matters, at a reasonable cost or at all, in the future. If our environmental liability insurance is inadequate, we may become subject to material losses for environmental liabilities. Our ability to receive the benefits of any environmental liability insurance policy will depend on the financial stability of our insurance company and the position it takes with respect to our insurance policies. 
 Although our leases generally require our tenants to operate in compliance with all applicable federal, state, and local environmental laws, ordinances, and regulations, and to indemnify us against any environmental liabilities arising from the tenants activities on the property, we could nevertheless be subject to liability, as a current or previous owner of real estate, including strict liability, by virtue of our ownership interest and may be required to remove or remediate hazardous or toxic substances on, under, or in a property. Further, there can be no assurance that our tenants, or the guarantor of a lease, could or would satisfy their indemnification obligations under their leases. 
 Some of our properties may contain, or may have contained, asbestos-containing building materials ACM ). Strict environmental, health, and safety laws govern the presence, maintenance, and removal of ACM. These laws may impose fines and penalties on employers, building owners, or operators for failure to comply with these laws. In addition, third parties may seek recovery from employers, owners, or operators for personal injury associated with exposure to asbestos. If we become subject to any of these penalties or other liabilities as a result of ACM at one or more of our properties, it could have a material adverse effect on us. 
 
 Our ability to effectively monitor and respond to the rapid and ongoing developments and expectations regarding our environmental, social, and governance ESG practices, may impose unexpected costs or result in reputational or other harm that could have a material adverse effect on our business. 
 There are rapid and ongoing developments and changing expectations relating to ESG matters as governmental entities, investors, employees, and other stakeholders have begun to focus increasingly on ESG practices, including those that relate to corporate governance, environmental compliance, employee health and safety practices, human capital management, and workforce inclusion and diversity. For example, many investment funds focus on positive ESG business practices and sustainability scores when making investments and may consider a company s ESG or sustainability scores as a factor in making an investment decision. In addition, investors, particularly institutional investors, use these scores to benchmark companies against their peers and if a company is perceived as lagging, these investors may engage with such company to improve ESG disclosure or performance and may also make voting decisions on this basis. With this increased focus and demand, public reporting regarding ESG practices is becoming more broadly expected. If we are unable to adequately recognize and effectively respond to such developments and governmental, societal, investor, and consumer expectations relating to our ESG practices, we may miss corporate opportunities, become subject to additional scrutiny, incur unexpected and significant costs, or experience damage to our reputation. If any of these events were to occur, there may be a material adverse effect on our business.

Risks Related to Investments in Real Estate 
 Our operating results are affected by economic and regulatory changes that impact the commercial real estate market in general. 
 Our core business is the ownership of commercial real estate that is net leased on a long-term basis to businesses in the industrial, healthcare, restaurant, retail, and office sectors. Accordingly, our performance is subject to risks generally attributable to the ownership of commercial real property, including: 
 changes in supply and demand for single-tenant space in the industrial, healthcare, restaurant, retail, and office sectors; 

increased competition for real property investments targeted by our investment strategy; 

changes in consumer trends and preferences that affect the demand for products and services offered by our tenants; 

inability to lease or sell properties upon expiration or termination of existing leases and renewal of leases at lower rental rates; 

the subjectivity of real estate valuations and changes in such valuations over time; 

the potential risk of functional obsolescence of properties over time; and 

competition from other properties. 

The factors described above are out of our control, and we are unable to predict future changes in such factors. Any negative changes in these factors may cause the value of our real estate to decline, which could materially and adversely affect us. 
 Global and U.S. financial markets and economic conditions may materially and adversely affect us and the ability of our tenants to make rental payments to us pursuant to our leases. 
 A significant portion of our portfolio is leased to tenants operating businesses that directly or indirectly rely on discretionary consumer spending. The success of most of these businesses depends on the willingness of consumers to use discretionary income to purchase their products or services. Our results of operations are sensitive to changes in the overall economic conditions that impact our tenants financial condition and leasing practices and a downturn in the economy could cause consumers to reduce their discretionary spending, which could result in tenant bankruptcies or otherwise have an adverse impact on our tenants ability to successfully manage their businesses and pay us amounts due under our lease agreements, thereby materially and adversely affecting us. Accordingly, adverse economic conditions such as high unemployment levels, an increase in interest rates, a decrease in available financing, high inflation, labor and workforce shortages, supply chain issues, tax rates, and fuel and energy costs may have an impact on the results of operations and financial conditions of our tenants. During periods of economic slowdown or recession, rising interest rates and declining demand for real estate may result in a general decline in rents or an increased incidence of defaults under existing leases. A lack of demand for rental space could adversely affect our ability to maintain our current tenants and gain new tenants, which may affect our growth and results of operations. Accordingly, a decline in economic conditions could materially and adversely affect us. 
 
 Inflation may materially and adversely affect us and our tenants. 
 Increased inflation could lead to interest rate increases that could have a negative impact on variable rate debt we currently have or that we may incur in the future, including increases to interest rates on our borrowings set to reprice in the future. During times when inflation is greater than the increases in rent provided by many of our leases, rent increases will not keep up with the rate of inflation. Increased costs may have an adverse impact on our tenants if increases in their operating expenses exceed increases in revenue, which may adversely affect the tenants ability to pay rent owed to us, which in turn could materially and adversely affect us. Inflation may also have an adverse effect on consumer spending, which could impact our tenants revenues and their ability to pay rent owed to us, which in turn could materially and adversely affect us. 
 Our real estate investments are illiquid. 
 Because real estate investments are relatively illiquid, our ability to adjust our portfolio promptly in response to economic, financial, investment, or other conditions may be limited. Return of capital and realization of gains, if any, from an investment generally will occur upon disposition or refinancing of the underlying property. We may be unable to realize our investment objective by sale, other disposition, or refinancing at attractive prices within any given period of time, or we may otherwise be unable to complete any exit strategy. In particular, these risks could arise from weakness in or even the lack of an established market for a property, changes in the financial condition or prospects of prospective purchasers, changes in national or international economic conditions, and changes in laws, regulations, or fiscal policies of the jurisdiction in which the property is located. Further, certain significant expenditures generally do not change in response to economic or other conditions, such as (i) debt service, (ii) real estate taxes, and (iii) operating and maintenance costs. The inability to dispose of a property at an acceptable price or at all, as well as the combination of variable revenue and relatively fixed expenditures may result, under certain market conditions, in reduced earnings and could have an adverse effect on our financial condition.

We face risks associated with climate change, which could materially and adversely impact us. 
 As a result of climate change, our properties in certain markets could experience increases in storm intensity, flooding, drought, wildfires, rising sea levels, and extreme temperatures. The potential physical impacts of climate change on our properties are uncertain and would be particular to the geographic circumstances in areas in which we own property. Over time, these conditions could result in volatile or decreased demand for certain of our properties or, in extreme cases, the inability of our tenants to operate the properties at all. Climate change may also have indirect effects on our business by increasing the cost of insurance (or making insurance unavailable), increasing the cost of energy at our properties, or requiring us to spend funds to repair and protect our properties against such risks. In addition, we also face business trend-related climate risks as investors, employees and other stakeholders are increasingly taking into account ESG factors, including climate risks. Our reputation and investor relationships could be damaged as a result of our involvement with certain industries or assets associated with activities perceived to be causing or exacerbating climate change, as well as any decisions we make to continue to conduct or change our activities in response to considerations relating to climate change. Moreover, compliance with new federal and state-level laws or regulations related to climate change, including climate change disclosures, compliance with green building codes or other laws or regulations relating to reduction of carbon footprints and/or greenhouse gas emissions, may require us to make significant cash expenditures both at the property and corporate level. Furthermore, our tenants increased costs associated with compliance with such laws or regulations could negatively impact our tenants operating results and ability to pay rent. Any of these occurrences could materially and adversely impact us. 
 Natural disasters, pandemics or epidemics, terrorist attacks, other acts of violence or war, or other catastrophic events could materially and adversely impact us. 
 Natural disasters, pandemics or epidemics, terrorist attacks, other acts of violence or war, or other catastrophic events e.g. , hurricanes, floods, earthquakes, or other types of natural disasters or wars or other acts of violence) could cause damage to our properties, materially interrupt our business operations (or those of our tenants), cause consumer confidence and spending to decrease, or result in increased volatility in the U.S. and worldwide financial markets and economy. Such occurrences also could result in or prolong an economic recession in the United States. We own properties in regions that have historically been impacted by natural disasters and it is probable such regions will continue to be impacted by such events. If a disaster occurs, we could suffer a complete loss of capital invested in, and any profits expected from, the affected properties. Any of these occurrences could materially and adversely affect us. 
 Insurance on our properties may not adequately cover all losses and uninsured losses could materially and adversely affect us. 
 Our tenants are generally required to maintain comprehensive insurance coverage for the properties they lease from us pursuant to our net leases. Pursuant to such leases, our tenants are required to name us (and any of our lenders that have a mortgage on the property leased by the tenant) as additional insureds on their liability policies and loss payee (or mortgagee, in the case of our lenders) on their property policies. Additionally, most tenants are required to maintain casualty coverage and most carry limits at 100 of replacement cost. Depending on the location of the property, losses of a catastrophic nature, such as those caused by earthquakes and floods, may be covered by insurance policies that are held by our tenant with limitations such as large deductibles or co-payments that a tenant may not be able to meet. In addition, losses of a catastrophic nature, such as those caused by wind/hail, hurricanes, terrorism, or acts of war, may be uninsurable or not economically insurable. In the event there is damage to our properties that is not covered by insurance and such properties are subject to recourse indebtedness, we will continue to be liable for the indebtedness, even if these properties are irreparably damaged. In addition, if uninsured damages to a property occur or a loss exceeds policy limits and we do not have adequate cash to fund repairs, we may be forced to sell the property at a loss or to borrow capital to fund the repairs. 
 Inflation, changes in building codes and ordinances, environmental considerations, and other factors, including terrorism or acts of war, may make any insurance proceeds we receive insufficient to repair or replace a property if it is damaged or destroyed. In that situation, the insurance proceeds received may not be adequate to restore our economic position with respect to the affected real property. Furthermore, in the event we experience a substantial or comprehensive loss of one of our properties, we may not be able to rebuild such property to its existing specifications without significant capital expenditures which may exceed any amounts received pursuant to insurance policies, as reconstruction or improvement of such a property would likely require significant upgrades to meet zoning and building code requirements. The loss of our capital investment in or anticipated future returns from our properties due to material uninsured losses could materially and adversely affect us. 
 Our costs of compliance with laws and regulations may require us or our tenants to make unanticipated expenditures that could reduce the investment return of our stockholders. 
 All real property and the operations conducted on real property are subject to numerous federal, state, and local laws and regulations. We cannot predict what laws or regulations will be enacted in the future, how future laws or regulations will be administered or interpreted, or how future laws or regulations will affect us or our properties. For example, we may be required to make substantial capital expenditures to comply with applicable fire and safety regulations, building codes, environmental regulations, and other land use regulations, and may be required to obtain approvals from various authorities with respect to our properties, including prior to acquiring a property or when undertaking improvements of any of our existing properties. Additionally, pursuant to the Americans with Disabilities Act ADA ), all 
 31 

public accommodations must meet federal requirements related to access and use by disabled persons. Compliance with ADA requirements could require property-level expenditures and non-compliance could result in imposition of fines by the U.S. government or an award of damages to private litigants, or both. 
 In most instances, our tenants are obligated to comply with these types of laws and regulations pursuant to our leases and cover costs associated with compliance. However, if required changes involve greater expenditures than anticipated or if the changes must be made on a more accelerated basis than anticipated, the ability of our tenants to cover such costs could be adversely affected and we may be required to expend our own funds. Further, there can be no assurance that existing laws and regulations will not adversely affect us or the timing or cost of any future acquisitions or improvements, or that additional regulations will not be adopted that increase such delays or result in additional costs. Accordingly, compliance with new laws or regulations, or stricter interpretation of existing laws, may require us or our tenants to incur significant expenditures, impose significant liability, restrict or prohibit business activities, and could cause a material adverse effect on us. 
 Risks Related to Debt Financing 
 As of December 31, 2022, we had approximately 2.0 billion principal balance of indebtedness outstanding, which may expose us to the risk of default under our debt obligations. 
 As of December 31, 2022, we had approximately 2.0 billion principal balance of indebtedness outstanding. We have incurred, and plan to incur in the future, financing through borrowings under term loans, senior notes, our Revolving Credit Facility, and mortgage loans secured by some or all of our properties. In some cases, the mortgage loans we incur are guaranteed by us, the OP, or both. We may also borrow funds if necessary to satisfy the requirement that we distribute to stockholders as dividends at least 90 of our annual REIT taxable income (computed without regard to the dividends paid deduction and our net capital gain), or otherwise as is necessary or advisable to assure that we maintain our qualification as a REIT for U.S. federal income tax purposes. Payments of principal and interest on borrowings may leave us with insufficient cash resources to meet our cash needs or make the distributions to our common stockholders currently contemplated or necessary to qualify as a REIT. Our level of debt and the limitations imposed on us by our debt agreements could have significant adverse consequences, including the following: 
 our cash flow may be insufficient to meet our required principal and interest payments; 

cash interest expense and financial covenants relating to our indebtedness, including a covenant in our Revolving Credit Facility that restricts us from paying distributions if an event of default exists, other than distributions required to maintain our REIT status, may limit or eliminate our ability to make distributions to our common stockholders; 

we may be forced to dispose of properties, possibly on unfavorable terms or in violation of certain covenants to which we may be subject; 

we may default on our obligations and the lenders or mortgagees may foreclose on our properties or our interests in the entities that own the properties that secure their loans and receive an assignment of rents and leases; 

we may be restricted from accessing some of our excess cash flow after debt service if certain of our tenants fail to meet certain financial performance metric thresholds; and 

our default under any loan with cross default provisions could result in a default on other indebtedness. 

The occurrence of any of these events could materially and adversely affect us. Furthermore, foreclosures could create taxable income without accompanying cash proceeds, which could hinder our ability to meet the REIT distribution requirements imposed by the Code. 
 Disruptions in the financial markets and deteriorating economic conditions could adversely affect our ability to obtain debt financing on commercially reasonable terms and adversely impact our ability to implement our investment strategy and achieve our investment objectives. 
 The United States and global financial markets have experienced periods of significant volatility and disruption in the past, and are expected to continue to do so in the future. Recent disruptions in the capital markets have resulted in constrained equity and debt capital available for investment in the real estate market and increases in capitalization rates. Future events or sustained negative conditions may also reduce the availability of financing, make financing terms less attractive, as well as negatively impact the value of our investments in properties. If sufficient sources of external financing are not available to us on cost effective terms, we could be forced to limit our planned business activities or take other actions to fund our business activities and repayment of debt such as selling assets or reducing our cash distributions. Uncertainty in the credit markets could also negatively impact our ability to make acquisitions, make it more difficult or impossible for us to sell properties, or adversely affect the price we receive for properties that we do sell, as prospective buyers may experience increased costs of debt financing or difficulties in obtaining debt financing. 
 32 

Market conditions could adversely affect our ability to refinance existing indebtedness on acceptable terms or at all, which could materially and adversely affect us. 
 We use external financing to refinance indebtedness as it matures and to partially fund our acquisitions. Credit markets may experience significant price volatility, displacement, and liquidity disruptions, including the bankruptcy, insolvency, or restructuring of certain financial institutions. As a result, we may be unable to fully refinance maturing indebtedness with new indebtedness, which could materially and adversely affect us. Furthermore, if prevailing interest rates or other factors at the time of refinancing result in higher interest rates upon refinancing, then the interest expense relating to that refinanced indebtedness would increase. Higher interest rates on newly incurred debt may negatively impact us as well. If interest rates increase, our interest costs and overall costs of capital will increase, which could materially and adversely affect us and our ability to make distributions to our stockholders. 
 Failure to hedge effectively against interest rate changes may materially and adversely affect us. 
 To reduce our exposure to variable-rate debt, we enter into interest rate swap agreements to fix the rate of interest as a hedge against interest rate fluctuations on floating-rate debt. These arrangements involve risks and may not be effective in reducing our exposure to interest rate changes. In addition, the counterparties to any hedging arrangements we enter into may not honor their obligations. Failure to hedge effectively against changes in interest rates relating to the interest expense of our future floating-rate borrowings may materially and adversely affect us. 
 Our Revolving Credit Facility and term loan agreements contain various covenants which, if not complied with, could accelerate our repayment obligations, thereby materially and adversely affecting us. 
 We are subject to various financial and operational covenants and financial reporting requirements pursuant to the agreements we have entered into governing our Revolving Credit Facility, term loans, and senior notes. These covenants require us to, among other things, maintain certain financial ratios, including leverage, fixed charge coverage, and debt service coverage, among others. As of December 31, 2022, we believe we were in compthrliance with all of our loan covenants. Our continued compliance with these covenants depends on many factors and could be impacted by current or future economic conditions, and thus there are no assurances that we will continue to comply with these covenants. Failure to comply with these covenants would result in a default which, if we were unable to cure or obtain a waiver from the lenders, could accelerate our repayment obligations and thereby have a material and adverse impact on us. 
 Further, these covenants, as well as any additional covenants to which we may be subject in the future because of additional borrowings, could cause us to forego investment opportunities, reduce or eliminate distributions to our common stockholders, or obtain financing that is more expensive than financing we could obtain if we were not subject to the covenants. Additionally, these restrictions may adversely affect our operating and financial flexibility and may limit our ability to respond to changes in our business or competitive environment, all of which may materially and adversely affect us. 
 Failure to maintain our current credit ratings could materially and adversely affect our cost of capital, liquidity, and access to capital markets. 
 The spread we pay over applicable reference rates for our unsecured credit facilities is determined based on our current credit ratings of Baa2 and BBB from Moody s and S P, respectively. The ratings are based on a number of factors, including an assessment of our financial strength, portfolio size and diversification, credit and operating metrics, and sustainability of cash flow and earnings. If we are unable to maintain our current credit ratings it could adversely affect our cost of capital, liquidity, and access to capital markets. Factors that could negatively impact our credit ratings include, but are not limited to: a significant increase in our leverage on a sustained basis, a significant increase in the proportion of secured debt levels, a significant decline in our unencumbered asset base, and a significant decline in our portfolio diversification. 
 We may be adversely affected by changes in LIBOR or CDOR reporting practices, the methods by which LIBOR or CDOR are determined, or the use of alternative reference rates. 
 As of December 31, 2022, we had approximately 400 million of debt outstanding for which the interest rate was tied to London Interbank Offered Rate LIBOR ). Further, pursuant to alternative currency clauses in our unsecured revolving credit agreement, we had approximately C 100 million of debt outstanding for which the interest rate was tied to the Canadian Dollar Offered Rate CDOR as of December 31, 2022. Additionally, as of December 31, 2022, we had entered into interest rate swaps totaling 640 million and C 60 million that fix the LIBOR and CDOR components of our debt, respectively, through various tenors. 
 On July 27, 2017, the Financial Conduct Authority (the FCA which regulates LIBOR, announced its intention to stop compelling banks to submit rates for the calculation of LIBOR after June 30, 2023. The Alternative Reference Rates Committee ARRC has identified the Secured Overnight Financing Rate SOFR as its preferred alternative rate for USD LIBOR in derivatives and other financial contracts. Our variable-interest debt instruments, including our unsecured revolving credit and term loan agreements, provide for alternate interest rate calculations using SOFR if LIBOR is no longer widely available or should the alternative interest rate prove more favorable. 
 33 

In December 2021, the Canadian Alternative Reference Rate Working Group CARR which was established by the Bank of Canada s Canadian Fixed-Income Forum to coordinate Canadian interest rate reform, recommended that Refinitiv Benchmark Services (UK) Limited Refinitiv cease its calculation and publication of CDOR after June 30, 2024. CARR also recommended that by June 30, 2023, all new securities use the Canadian Overnight Repo Rate Average CORRA ), subject to certain limited exceptions. On May 16, 2022, Refinitiv announced the cessation of the calculation and publication of CDOR after June 28, 2024. On January 11, 2023, CARR announced development of a new Term CORRA benchmark that is expected to be available for use by the third quarter of 2023. 
 We are monitoring and evaluating the related risks which arise in connection with transitioning our Canadian dollar-denominated debt to a new alternative rate, including any resulting value transfer that may occur. There can be no assurances as to what alternative interest rates may be and whether such interest rates will be more or less favorable than LIBOR or CDOR and any other unforeseen impacts of the potential discontinuation of LIBOR or CDOR. Any changes in LIBOR or CDOR reporting practices, the methods by which LIBOR or CDOR are determined, or the use of alternative reference rates may adversely affect us. 
 
 We may incur mortgage debt on a particular property, which may subject us to certain risks, and the occurrence of any such risk could materially and adversely affect us. 
 We may incur mortgage debt on a particular property, especially if we believe the property s projected cash flow is sufficient to service the mortgage debt. In addition, incurring mortgage debt may increase the risk of loss since defaults on indebtedness secured by a property may result in foreclosure actions initiated by lenders and our loss of the property securing the loan that is in default. For U.S. federal income tax purposes, a foreclosure of any of our properties would be treated as a sale of the property for a purchase price equal to the outstanding balance of the debt secured by the mortgage. If the outstanding balance of the debt secured by the mortgage exceeds our tax basis in the property, we would recognize taxable income on foreclosure but would not receive any of the proceeds. We may give full or partial guarantees to lenders to the OP or its affiliates. If we give a guaranty on behalf of the OP, we will be responsible to the lender for satisfaction of the debt if it is not paid by the OP. If any mortgages contain cross-collateralization or cross-default provisions, there is a risk that more than one of our real properties may be affected by a default. If any of our properties are foreclosed upon due to a default, we could be materially and adversely affected. 
 Risks Related to Our Organizational Structure 
 Our Charter contains provisions, including ownership and transfer restrictions, that may delay, discourage, or prevent a takeover or change of control transaction that could otherwise result in a premium price to our stockholders. 
 Our Charter contains various provisions that are intended to facilitate our qualification as a REIT. For example, our Charter restricts the direct or indirect ownership by one person or entity to no more than 9.8 of the value of our then outstanding shares of capital stock and no more than 9.8 of the value or number of shares, whichever is more restrictive, of our then outstanding Common Stock unless exempted by our board of directors. This restriction may discourage a change of control of us and may deter individuals or entities from making tender offers for shares of our Common Stock on terms that might be financially attractive to stockholders or which may cause a change in our management. In addition to deterring potential change of control transactions that may be favorable to our stockholders, these provisions may also decrease our stockholders ability to sell their shares of our Common Stock. As a result, these charter provisions may negatively impact the market price of our Common Stock. 
 We may issue preferred stock or separate classes or series of Common Stock, which could adversely affect the holders of our Common Stock. 
 Our Charter authorizes us to issue up to 520,000,000 shares of stock, and our board of directors, without any action by our stockholders, may amend our Charter from time to time to increase or decrease the aggregate number of shares or the number of shares of any class or series of stock that we have authority to issue. Holders of shares of our Common Stock do not have preemptive rights to acquire any shares issued by us in the future. 
 In addition, our board of directors may classify or reclassify any unissued shares of our Common Stock or preferred stock and establish the preferences, rights, and powers of any such stock. As a result, our board of directors could authorize the issuance of preferred stock or separate classes or series of Common Stock with terms and conditions that could have priority, with respect to distributions and amounts payable upon our liquidation, over the rights of our Common Stock. The issuance of shares of such preferred or separate classes or series of Common Stock could dilute the value of an investment in shares of our Common Stock. The issuance of shares of preferred stock or a separate class or series of Common Stock could provide the holders thereof with specified dividend payments and payments upon liquidation prior or senior to those of the Common Stock, and could also have the effect of delaying, discouraging, or preventing a change in control of us, including an extraordinary transaction (such as a merger, tender offer, or sale of all or substantially all of our assets) that might provide a premium price for holders of our Common Stock. 
 34 

Termination of the Employment Agreements with certain members of our senior management team could be costly. 
 The Employment Agreements with certain members of our senior management team provide that if their employment with us terminates under certain circumstances (including in connection with a change in control of our Company), we may be required to pay them significant amounts of severance compensation, thereby making it costly to terminate their employment. 
 Our board of directors may change our investment and financing policies without stockholder approval, which could materially and adversely alter the nature of an investment in us. 
 The methods of implementing our investment policies and strategy may vary as new real estate development trends emerge, new investment techniques are developed, and market conditions evolve. Our investment and financing policies are exclusively determined by our board of directors and senior management team. Accordingly, our stockholders do not control these policies. Further, our organizational documents do not limit the amount or percentage of indebtedness, funded or otherwise, that we may incur. Although we are not required to maintain a particular leverage ratio, we generally intend to maintain on a sustained basis a level of Net Debt that is generally less than 6.0x our Annualized Adjusted EBITDAre. However, from time to time, our ratio of Net Debt to our Annualized Adjusted EBITDAre may exceed 6.0x. Our board of directors may alter or eliminate our current policy on borrowing at any time without stockholder approval. If this policy changed, we could become more highly leveraged, which could result in an increase in our debt service costs and obligations. Higher leverage also increases the risk of default on our obligations. In addition, a change in our investment policies, including the manner in which we allocate our resources across our portfolio or the types of assets in which we seek to invest, may increase our exposure to interest rate risk, real estate market fluctuations, and liquidity risk. Changes to our policies with regard to the foregoing could materially and adversely affect us. 
 Our rights and the rights of our stockholders to take action against our directors and officers are limited. 
 Maryland law provides that a director of a Maryland corporation will not have any liability in that capacity if he or she performs his or her duties in accordance with the applicable standard of conduct. Our Charter limits the liability of our directors and officers to us and our stockholders for money damages to the maximum extent permitted by Maryland law. Therefore, our directors and officers are subject to monetary liability resulting only from: 
 actual receipt of an improper benefit or profit in money, property, or services; or 

active and deliberate dishonesty by the director or officer that was established by a final judgment as being material to the cause of action adjudicated. 

As a result, we and our stockholders have rights against our directors and officers that are more limited than might otherwise exist. Accordingly, in the event that actions taken by any of our directors or officers impede the performance of our Company, your and our ability to recover damages from such director or officer will be limited. Our Charter and Second Amended and Restated Bylaws also require us to indemnify and advance expenses to our directors and our officers for losses they may incur by reason of their service in those capacities subject to any limitations under Maryland law or in our Charter. Moreover, we have entered into separate indemnification agreements with each of our directors and executive officers. As a result, we and our stockholders may have more limited rights against these persons than might otherwise exist under common law, which could reduce our stockholders and our recovery against such persons. In addition, we may be obligated to fund the defense costs incurred by these persons in some cases, which would reduce the cash available for distributions. 
 We are a holding company with no direct operations and rely on funds received from the OP to pay liabilities. 
 We are a holding company and conduct substantially all of our operations through the OP. We do not have, apart from an interest in the OP, any independent operations. As a result, we rely on distributions from the OP to pay any distributions we might declare on shares of our Common Stock. We will also rely on distributions from the OP to meet any of our obligations, including any tax liability on taxable income allocated to us from the OP. In addition, because we are a holding company, your claims as stockholders are structurally subordinated to all existing and future liabilities and obligations (whether or not for borrowed money) of the OP and its subsidiaries. Therefore, in the event of our bankruptcy, liquidation, or reorganization, our assets and those of the OP and its subsidiaries will be able to satisfy the claims of our stockholders only after all of our and the OP and its subsidiaries liabilities and obligations have been paid in full. 
 Our UPREIT structure may result in potential conflicts of interest between the interests of our stockholders and members in the OP, which may materially and adversely impede business decisions that could benefit our stockholders. 
 Conflicts of interest could arise in the future as a result of the relationships between us and our affiliates, on the one hand, and the OP or any future member thereof, on the other. Our directors and officers have duties to our Company under applicable Maryland law in connection with the management of our Company. At the same time, we, as the managing member of the OP, will have fiduciary duties and obligations to the OP and its members under New York law and the OP Agreement in connection with the management of the OP. Our fiduciary duties and obligations, as the managing member of the OP, and its members may come into conflict with the duties of our directors and officers to our Company. 
 35 

While we intend to avoid situations involving conflicts of interest, there may be situations in which the interests of the OP may conflict with our interests. Our activities specifically authorized by or described in the OP Agreement may be performed by us and will not, in any case or in the aggregate, be deemed a breach of the OP Agreement or any duty owed by us to the OP or any member. In exercising our authority under the OP Agreement, we may, but are under no obligation to, take into account the tax consequences of any action we take. Other than liabilities associated with tax protection agreements that we have entered into, we and the OP have no liability to a non-managing member under any circumstances as a result of an income tax liability incurred by such non-managing member as a result of an action (or inaction) by us pursuant to our authority under the OP Agreement. 
 The OP Agreement provides that the managing member will not be liable to the OP, its members, or any other person bound by the OP Agreement for monetary damages for losses sustained, liabilities incurred, or benefits not derived by the OP or any member, except for liability for the member s gross negligence or willful misconduct. Moreover, the OP Agreement provides that the OP is required to indemnify the managing member, its affiliates, and certain related persons, and any manager, officer, stockholder, director, member, employee, representative, or agent of the managing member or its affiliates from and against any and all claims that relate to the operations of the OP, except if (i) the act was committed in bad faith, (ii) the act was the result of active and deliberate dishonesty and was material to the cause of action involved, or (iii) it personally gained in fact a financial income or other advantage to which it was not entitled under law. 
 The value of an investment in our Common Stock may be reduced if we, the OP, or any of our subsidiaries are required to register as an investment company under the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended (the Investment Company Act and, if we are subject to registration under the Investment Company Act, we will not be able to continue our business. 
 Neither we, the OP, nor any of our subsidiaries intend to register as an investment company under the Investment Company Act. If we were obligated to register as an investment company, we would have to comply with a variety of substantive requirements under the Investment Company Act that would impose significant and onerous limitations on our operations, as well as require us to comply with various reporting, record keeping, voting, proxy disclosure, and other rules and regulations that would significantly alter our operations and significantly increase our operating expenses. 
 We believe that we, the OP, and the subsidiaries of the OP do not and will not fall within the definition of investment company under Section 3(a)(1) of the Investment Company Act as we intend to invest primarily in real property through our wholly or majority-owned subsidiaries. Accordingly, we believe that we and the OP are and will be primarily engaged in the non-investment company business of such subsidiaries and therefore will not fall within the aforementioned definition of investment company. 
 To ensure that neither we nor any of our subsidiaries, including the OP, are required to register as an investment company, each entity may be unable to sell assets that it would otherwise want to sell and may need to sell assets that it would otherwise wish to retain. In addition, we, the OP, or our subsidiaries may be required to acquire additional income- or loss-generating assets that we might not otherwise acquire or forego opportunities to acquire interests in companies that we would otherwise want to acquire. Although we, the OP, and our subsidiaries intend to monitor our portfolio periodically and prior to each acquisition and disposition, any of these entities may not be able to remain outside the definition of investment company or maintain an exclusion from the definition of investment company. If we, the OP, or our subsidiaries are required to register as an investment company but fail to do so, the unregistered entity would be prohibited from engaging in our business, and criminal and civil actions could be brought against such entity. In addition, the contracts of such entity would be unenforceable unless a court required enforcement, and a court could appoint a receiver to take control of the entity and liquidate its business. 
 U.S. Federal Income Tax Risks 
 Failure to qualify as a REIT would materially and adversely affect us and the value of our Common Stock. 
 We elected to be taxed as a REIT under Sections 856 through 860 of the Code and the applicable U.S. Treasury regulations, which contain the requirements for qualifying as a REIT, which we refer to in this Form 10-K as the REIT Requirements, beginning with our taxable year ended December 31, 2008. We believe that we have been organized and operated in a manner to qualify for taxation as a REIT for U.S. federal income tax purposes commencing with such year, and we intend to continue operating in such a manner. However, we cannot assure you that we have qualified as a REIT, or that we will remain qualified as such in the future. If we lose our REIT status, we will face significant tax consequences that would substantially reduce our cash available for distribution to our stockholders for each of the years involved because: 
 we would not be allowed a deduction for distributions to stockholders in computing our taxable income and would be subject to U.S. federal income tax at the corporate rate; 

we could be subject to increased state and local income taxes; 

unless we are entitled to relief under applicable statutory provisions of the Code, we could not elect to be taxed as a REIT for four taxable years following the year during which qualification was lost; and 

36 

for the five years following re-election of REIT status, upon a taxable disposition of an asset owned as of such re-election, we would be subject to corporate level tax with respect to any built-in gain inherent in such asset at the time of re-election. 

Any such corporate tax liability could be substantial and would reduce our cash available for, among other things, our operations and distributions to stockholders. In addition, if we fail to qualify as a REIT, we will not be required to make distributions to our stockholders. If this occurs, we may need to borrow funds or liquidate some of our properties in order to pay any applicable taxes. As a result of all these factors, our failure to qualify as a REIT also could impair our ability to execute our growth strategy and raise capital, and could materially and adversely affect the trading price of our Common Stock. 
 Qualification as a REIT involves the application of technical and complex Code provisions for which there are only limited judicial and administrative interpretations. The determination of various factual matters and circumstances not entirely within our control may affect our ability to qualify as a REIT. In order to qualify as a REIT, we must satisfy a number of requirements, including requirements regarding the ownership of our stock, requirements regarding the composition of our assets and a requirement that at least 95 of our gross income in any year must be derived from qualifying sources, such as rents from real property. Also, we must make distributions to stockholders aggregating annually at least 90 of our REIT taxable income, computed without regard to the dividends paid deduction and our net capital gain. In addition, legislation, new regulations, administrative interpretations, or court decisions may materially and adversely affect our investors, our ability to qualify as a REIT for U.S. federal income tax purposes, or the desirability of an investment in a REIT relative to other investments. 
 Even if we remain qualified as a REIT for U.S. federal income tax purposes, we may be subject to other tax liabilities that reduce our cash flow and our ability to make distributions to our stockholders. 
 Even if we remain qualified as a REIT for U.S. federal income tax purposes, we may still be subject to some U.S. federal, state, and local income, property, and excise taxes on our income or property. For example: 	 
 In order to qualify as a REIT, we must distribute annually at least 90 of our REIT taxable income to our stockholders (computed without regard to the dividends paid deduction and our net capital gain), and to the extent that we satisfy the distribution requirement but distribute less than 100 of our REIT taxable income (computed without regard to the dividends paid deduction and including our net capital gain), we will be subject to U.S. federal corporate income tax on the undistributed income, as well as applicable state and local income taxes. 

If we should fail to distribute, or fail to be treated as having distributed, with respect to each calendar year at least the sum of (i) 85 of our REIT ordinary income for such year, (ii) 95 of our REIT capital gain net income for such year, and (iii) any undistributed taxable income from prior periods, we would be subject to a 4 nondeductible excise tax on the excess of such required distribution over the sum of (a) the amounts actually distributed and (b) the amounts we retained and upon which we paid U.S. federal income tax at the corporate level. 

If we have (i) net income from the sale or other disposition of foreclosure property that is held primarily for sale to customers in the ordinary course of business or (ii) other non-qualifying net income from foreclosure property, we will be subject to tax at the U.S. federal corporate income tax rate on such income. To the extent that income from foreclosure property is otherwise qualifying income for purposes of the 75 gross income test, this tax is not applicable. 

If we have net income from prohibited transactions (which are, in general, certain sales or other dispositions of property held primarily for sale to customers in the ordinary course of business, other than sales of foreclosure property and sales that qualify for certain statutory safe harbors), such income will be subject to a 100 tax. 

We may be subject to tax on gain recognized in a taxable disposition of assets acquired from a non-REIT C corporation by way of a carryover basis transaction, when such gain is recognized on a disposition of an asset during a 5-year period beginning on the date on which we acquired the asset. To the extent of any built-in gain, such gain will be subject to U.S. federal income tax at the federal corporate income tax rate. Built-in gain means the excess of (i) the fair market value of the asset as of the beginning of the applicable recognition period over (ii) our adjusted basis in such asset as of the beginning of such recognition period. 

If we should fail to satisfy the 75 gross income test or the 95 gross income test, but have nonetheless maintained our qualification as a REIT because certain other requirements have been met, we will be subject to a 100 tax on the greater of the gross income amount by which we fail the 75 or the 95 test multiplied in either case by a fraction generally intended to reflect our profitability without regard to our long-term capital gain. 

Similarly, if we should fail to satisfy the asset tests or other requirements applicable to REITs, yet nonetheless qualify as a REIT because there is reasonable cause for the failure and other applicable requirements are met, we may be subject to a penalty. The amount of the penalty will be at least 50,000 per failure, and, in the case of certain asset test failures, will be equal to the amount of net income generated by the assets in question multiplied by the highest corporate tax rate if that amount exceeds 50,000 per failure. 

37 

We may perform additional, non-customary services for tenants of our buildings through a TRS, including real estate or non-real estate related services; however, any earnings related to such services are subject to federal and state income taxes. 

We will be subject to a 100 tax on transactions with our TRSs if such transactions are not at arm s length. 

If the OP fails to qualify as a partnership for U.S. federal income tax purposes, we would cease to qualify as a REIT and suffer other adverse consequences. 
 We believe that the OP will be treated as a partnership for U.S. federal income tax purposes. As a partnership, the OP would generally not be subject to U.S. federal income tax on its income. Instead, for U.S. federal income tax purposes, if the OP is treated as a partnership, each of its partners, including us, would be allocated, and may be required to pay tax with respect to, such partner s share of its income. The OP may be required to determine and pay an imputed underpayment of tax (plus interest and penalties) resulting from an adjustment of the OP s items of income, gain, loss, deduction, or credit at the partnership level. We cannot assure you that the IRS will not challenge the status of the OP or any other subsidiary in which we own an interest as a disregarded entity or partnership for U.S. federal income tax purposes, or that a court would not sustain such a challenge. If the IRS were successful in treating the OP or any such other subsidiary as an entity taxable as a corporation for U.S. federal income tax purposes, we would fail to meet the gross income tests and certain of the asset tests applicable to REITs and, accordingly, we would likely cease to qualify as a REIT. Also, the failure of the OP or any subsidiary to qualify as a disregarded entity or partnership could cause it to become subject to U.S. federal and state corporate income tax, which would significantly reduce the amount of cash available for debt service and for distribution to its partners, including us. 
 To satisfy the REIT distribution requirements, we may be forced to take certain actions to raise funds if we have insufficient cash flow which could materially and adversely affect us and the trading price of our Common Stock. 
 To qualify as a REIT, we generally must distribute to our stockholders at least 90 of our REIT taxable income each year, computed without regard to the dividends paid deduction and our net capital gain, and we will be subject to corporate income tax on our undistributed taxable income to the extent that we distribute less than 100 of our REIT taxable income each year, computed without regard to the dividends paid deduction and including our net capital gain. In addition, we will be subject to a 4 nondeductible excise tax on the amount, if any, by which distributions paid by us in any calendar year are less than the sum of 85 of our ordinary income, 95 of our capital gain net income and 100 of our undistributed income from prior years. In order to satisfy these distribution requirements to maintain our REIT status and avoid the payment of income and excise taxes, we may need to take certain actions to raise funds if we have insufficient cash flow, such as borrowing funds, raising additional equity capital, selling a portion of our assets or finding another alternative to make distributions to our stockholders. We may be forced to take those actions even if the then-prevailing market conditions are not favorable for those actions. This situation could arise from, among other things, differences in timing between the actual receipt of cash and recognition of income for U.S. federal income tax purposes, or the effect of non-deductible capital expenditures or other non-deductible expenses, the creation of reserves, or required debt or amortization payments. Such actions could increase our costs and reduce the value of our Common Stock. These sources, however, may not be available on favorable terms or at all. Our access to third-party sources of capital depends on a number of factors, including the market s perception of our growth potential, our current debt levels, the market price of our Common Stock, and our current and potential future earnings. We cannot assure you that we will have access to such capital on favorable terms at the desired times, or at all, which may cause us to curtail our investment activities and/or to dispose of assets at inopportune times, and could materially and adversely affect us and the trading price of our Common Stock. 
 Further, to qualify as a REIT, we must also satisfy tests on an ongoing basis concerning, among other things, the sources of our income, nature of our assets, and the amounts we distribute to our stockholders. We may be required to make distributions to stockholders at times when it would be more advantageous to reinvest cash in our business or when we do not have funds readily available for distribution. Compliance with the REIT Requirements may hinder our ability to operate solely on the basis of maximizing profits. 
 The IRS may treat sale-leaseback transactions as loans, which could jeopardize our REIT status or require us to make an unexpected distribution. 
 We may purchase properties and lease them back to the sellers of such properties. The IRS may take the position that certain of these sale-leaseback transactions that we treat as leases are not true leases but are, instead, financing arrangements or loans for U.S. federal income tax purposes. 
 If a sale-leaseback transaction were so re-characterized, we might fail to satisfy the REIT asset tests, the income tests, or distribution requirements and consequently lose our REIT status effective with the year of re-characterization unless we elect to make an additional distribution to maintain our REIT status. The primary risk relates to the disallowance of deductions for depreciation and cost recovery relating to such property, which could affect the calculation of our REIT taxable income and could cause us to fail the REIT distribution requirement that requires a REIT to distribute at least 90 of its REIT taxable income, computed without regard to the dividends paid deduction and any net capital gain. In this circumstance, we may elect to distribute an additional dividend of the increased taxable income so as not to fail the REIT distribution test. This distribution would be paid to all stockholders at the time of declaration rather than the stockholders that held our shares in the taxable year affected by the re-characterization. 
 38 

Dividends payable by REITs do not qualify for the reduced tax rates available for some dividends. 
 The maximum U.S. federal income tax rate applicable to income from qualified dividends payable to U.S. stockholders that are individuals, trusts, and estates is 20 . Ordinary dividends payable by REITs, however, generally are not eligible for the 20 rate applicable to qualified dividends except to the extent the REIT dividends are attributable to qualified dividends received by the REIT itself or generally attributable to income upon which we (or a predecessor) have paid U.S. federal corporate income tax. However, for non-corporate U.S. stockholders, ordinary dividends payable by REITs that are not designated as capital gain dividends or treated as qualified dividends generally are eligible for a deduction of 20 of the amount of such ordinary REIT dividends, for taxable years beginning before January 1, 2026. More favorable rates will nevertheless continue to apply for regular corporate qualified dividends. Although these rules do not adversely affect the taxation of REITs or dividends payable by REITs, to the extent that the 20 rate continues to apply to regular corporate qualified dividends, investors who are individuals, trusts and estates may regard investments in REITs to be relatively less attractive than investments in the stocks of non-REIT corporations. 
 The tax imposed on REITs engaging in prohibited transactions may limit our ability to engage in transactions which would be treated as sales for U.S. federal income tax purposes. 
 A REIT s net income from prohibited transactions is subject to a 100 penalty tax. In general, prohibited transactions are sales or other dispositions of property, other than foreclosure property, held primarily for sale to customers in the ordinary course of business. Although we do not intend to hold any properties that would be characterized as held for sale to customers in the ordinary course of our business, unless a sale or disposition qualifies under certain statutory safe harbors, such characterization is a factual determination and no guarantee can be given that the IRS would agree with our characterization of our properties or that we will always be able to make use of the available safe harbors. 
 Complying with the REIT Requirements may limit our ability to hedge effectively and may cause us to incur tax liabilities. 
 The REIT provisions of the Code substantially limit our ability to hedge our assets and liabilities. Any income from a hedging transaction that we enter into to manage the risk of interest rate changes with respect to borrowings made or to be made to acquire or carry real estate assets, or from certain terminations of such hedging positions, does not constitute gross income for purposes of the 75 or 95 gross income tests that apply to REITs, provided that certain identification requirements are met. To the extent that we enter into other types of hedging transactions or fail to properly identify such transaction as a hedge, the income is likely to be treated as non-qualifying income for purposes of the 75 and 95 gross income tests. As a result of these rules, we may be required to limit our use of advantageous hedging techniques or implement those hedges through a TRS. This could increase the cost of our hedging activities because any TRS in which we own an interest may be subject to tax on gains or expose us to greater risks associated with changes in interest rates than we would otherwise want to bear. In addition, losses in any TRS in which we own an interest will generally not provide any tax benefit, except that such losses in some cases may be carried back against past taxable income in the TRS and may be carried forward against future taxable income in the TRS (subject to certain limitations). 
 Complying with the REIT Requirements may force us to liquidate or forgo otherwise attractive investments. 
 To qualify as a REIT, we must continually satisfy tests concerning, among other things, the nature and diversification of our assets, the sources of our income, and the amounts we distribute to our stockholders. In connection with the Internalization, we were treated as having acquired substantial amounts of goodwill that may not qualify for the 75 asset test. Compliance with these limitations, particularly given the goodwill that we acquired in the Internalization, may hinder our ability to make, and, in certain cases, maintain ownership of certain attractive investments that might not qualify for the 75 asset test. If we fail to comply with the REIT asset test requirements at the end of any calendar quarter, we must correct the failure within 30 days after the end of the calendar quarter or qualify for certain statutory relief provisions to avoid losing our REIT qualification and suffering adverse tax consequences. As a result, we may be required to liquidate or forgo otherwise attractive investments in order to satisfy the asset and income tests or to qualify under certain statutory relief provisions. These actions could have the effect of reducing our income, increasing our income tax liability, and reducing amounts available for distribution to our stockholders. In addition, we may be required to make distributions to stockholders at disadvantageous times or when we do not have funds readily available for distribution, and may be unable to pursue investments (or, in some cases, forego the sale of such investments) that would be otherwise advantageous to us in order to satisfy the REIT Requirements. Accordingly, satisfying the REIT Requirements could materially and adversely affect us. Moreover, if we are compelled to liquidate our investments to meet any of these asset, income, or distribution tests, or to repay obligations to our lenders, we may be unable to comply with one or more of the requirements applicable to REITs or may be subject to a 100 tax on any resulting gain if such sales constitute prohibited transactions. 
 In certain circumstances, we may be liable for certain tax obligations of certain of the members of the OP. 
 In certain circumstances, we may be liable for tax obligations of certain of the members of the OP. In connection with certain UPREIT transactions, we have entered or will enter into tax protection agreements under which we have agreed to indemnify members of the OP against adverse tax consequences if we were to sell, convey, transfer, or otherwise dispose of our assets in taxable transactions, with specific 
 39 

exceptions and limitations. Pursuant to the tax protection agreements, we have also agreed to ensure that such members of the OP are allocated minimum amounts of the OP s indebtedness. If we fail to meet our obligations under the tax protection agreements, we may be required to reimburse those members of the OP for the amount of the tax liabilities they incur, subject to certain limitations. We may enter into additional tax protection agreements in the future in connection with other UPREIT transactions. Although it may be in our stockholders best interest that we sell a property, it may be economically disadvantageous for us to do so because of these obligations. In order to limit our exposure to a tax obligation, our use of proceeds from any sales or dispositions of certain properties will be limited. With respect to the existing tax protection agreements with property contributors (excluding the Internalization), as of December 31, 2022, our potential indemnification obligation for the taxable sale of those properties is approximately 10.4 million. 
 In connection with the Internalization, we entered into the Founding Owners Tax Protection Agreement, pursuant to which we have agreed to indemnify the Founding Owners (as defined in the Founding Owners Tax Protection Agreement) against the applicable income tax liabilities resulting from: (1) the sale, exchange, transfer, conveyance, or other disposition of the assets of BRE that we acquired in the Internalization (the Contributed Property in a taxable transaction prior to February 7, 2030; and (2) our failure to offer the Founding Owners the opportunity to guarantee or otherwise bear the economic risk of loss with respect to specific types of the OP s indebtedness in order to enable them to continue to defer the applicable income tax liabilities associated with the allocation of that indebtedness. Our maximum liability under the Founding Owners Tax Protection Agreement is capped at 10 million. 
 The Blocker Corp Mergers may have adverse tax consequences. 
 As a general matter, notwithstanding that we qualify to be taxed as a REIT for U.S. federal income tax purposes, if we acquire appreciated assets from a non-REIT C corporation in a transaction in which the adjusted tax basis of the assets in its hands is determined by reference to the adjusted tax basis of the assets in the hands of the C corporation, we will be subject to entity-level tax on any gain recognized in connection with a disposition (such as a taxable sale) of any such assets during the 5-year period following such acquisition. In addition, in order to qualify as a REIT, we must not have, at the end of any taxable year, any earnings and profits accumulated in a non-REIT year. 
 Because each of Trident BRE Holdings I, Inc. and Trident BRE Holdings II, Inc. (the Blocker Corps were taxable as a non-REIT C corporation and we acquired their appreciated assets in connection with the Internalization in transactions (the Blocker Corp Mergers in which the adjusted tax basis of the assets in our hands was determined by reference to the adjusted tax basis of the assets in the hands of each of the Blocker Corps prior to the Blocker Corp Mergers, we will be subject to corporate income tax on the built-in gain with respect to the Blocker Corps assets at the time of the Blocker Corp Mergers if we dispose of those assets in a taxable transaction within five years following the Blocker Corp Mergers. This built-in gain is measured by the difference between the value of the Blocker Corps assets at the time of the Blocker Corp Mergers and the adjusted basis in those assets. We estimate this built-in gain to be approximately 56.4 million. The assets of the Blocker Corps we acquired in the Blocker Corp Mergers are the Blocker Corps interests in BRE. When BRE merged into the OP in a tax-deferred transaction and the Blocker Corps received OP Units, the built-in gain associated with the Blocker Corps assets became represented as part of an intangible asset on our balance sheet. The disposition of that intangible asset in a taxable transaction within five years following the Blocker Corp Mergers could trigger a corporate income tax on that built-in gain. The most likely transaction in which that intangible asset is disposed of would be a sale of the OP (or our interest in the OP) in a taxable transaction. Thus, if the OP (or our interest in the OP) is sold in a taxable transaction within five years following the Blocker Corp Mergers, we could incur a corporate income tax on approximately 56.4 million of built-in gain. 
 Because the Blocker Corps were each taxable as a regular C corporation, we assumed any earnings and profits accumulated by the Blocker Corps for taxable periods prior to and including the Blocker Corp Mergers, referred to as C corporation earnings and profits. To qualify as a REIT, we cannot have any C corporation earnings and profits at the end of any taxable year. We estimated the C corporation earnings and profits of the Blocker Corps to be approximately 2.3 million in total at the time of the Blocker Corp Mergers and we used a nationally recognized accounting firm to prepare a study to assist management in confirming that calculation. During 2020, we made sufficient distributions in excess of our earnings and profits (including the C corporation earnings and profits from the Blocker Corps) so we would not have to pay a special dividend to eliminate such C corporation earnings and profits. In effect, the inclusion of the C corporation earnings and profits from the Blocker Corps increased the portion of our distributions during 2020 that were taxable as dividends. However, if we were determined to succeed to more C corporation earnings and profits as a result of the Blocker Corp Mergers, we may have to pay a special dividend and/or employ applicable deficiency dividend procedures to eliminate such earnings and profits. If we need to make a special dividend or pay a deficiency dividend and do not otherwise have cash on hand to do so, we may need to (i) sell assets at unfavorable prices, (ii) borrow on unfavorable terms, (iii) distribute amounts that would otherwise be invested in future acquisitions, capital expenditures, or repayment of debt, or (iv) make a taxable distribution of Common Stock as part of a distribution in which stockholders may elect to receive Common Stock or cash (subject to a limit measured as a percentage of the total distribution), in order to comply with REIT Requirements. These alternatives could increase our costs or reduce our equity. In addition, if we were to rely upon the remedial deficiency dividend procedures, we would be required to pay interest based on the amount of any such deficiency dividends. 
 In addition to the foregoing, as a result of the Blocker Corp Mergers, we inherited any liability with respect to unpaid taxes of each of the Blocker Corps for any periods prior to the Blocker Corp Mergers.

Changes to the U.S. federal income tax laws could have a material and adverse effect on us. 
 The rules dealing with U.S. federal income taxation are constantly under review by persons involved in the legislative process and by the IRS and the U.S. Department of the Treasury, which may result in revisions to regulations and interpretations and changes to the application of existing tax rules by U.S. federal, state, local, and foreign governments, in addition to statutory changes. No assurance can be given as to whether, or in what form, any proposals affecting REITs or their stockholders will be enacted. 
 There may also be future changes in U.S. federal tax laws, regulations, rules, and judicial and administrative interpretations applicable to us and our business, the effect of which cannot be predicted. Our stockholders and prospective investors are urged to consult with their own tax advisors with respect to the status of legislative, regulatory, or administrative developments and proposals and their potential effect on an investment in shares of our Common Stock.

Risks Related to Ownership of Our Common Stock 
 The market price and trading volume of shares of our Common Stock may be volatile. 
 The market price of shares of our Common Stock may fluctuate. In addition, the trading volume in shares of our Common Stock, may fluctuate and cause significant price variations to occur. Historically, these changes frequently appear to occur without regard to the operating performance of the affected companies. Hence, the price of our Common Stock could fluctuate based upon factors that have little or nothing to do with us in particular. If the market price of shares of our Common Stock declines significantly, you may be unable to resell your shares of our Common Stock at or above the public offering price. We cannot assure you that the market price of shares of our Common Stock will not fluctuate or decline significantly, including a decline below the public offering price, in the future. 
 Some of the factors that could negatively affect our share price or result in fluctuations in the market price or trading volume of shares of our Common Stock include: 
 
 actual or anticipated declines in our quarterly operating results or distributions; 

actual or anticipated tenant defaults, bankruptcies, or vacancies, or speculation in the press or investment community about actual or anticipated tenant defaults, bankruptcies, or vacancies; 

changes in government regulations; 

changes in laws affecting REITs and related tax matters; 

the announcement of new contracts by us or our competitors; 

reductions in our FFO, AFFO, or earnings estimates; 

publication of research reports about us or the real estate industry; 

increases in market interest rates that lead purchasers of shares of our Common Stock to demand a higher yield; 

future equity issuances, or the perception that they may occur, including issuances of Common Stock upon exercise or vesting of equity awards or redemption of OP Units; 

changes in market valuations of similar companies; 

adverse market reaction to any increased indebtedness we incur in the future; 

additions or departures of key management personnel; 

actions by institutional stockholders; 

differences between our actual financial and operating results and those expected by investors and analysts; 

changes in analysts recommendations or projections; 

speculation in the press or investment community; and 

the realization of any of the other risk factors presented herein. 

In the past, securities class action litigation has often been instituted against companies following periods of volatility in the price of their common stock. This type of litigation could result in substantial costs and divert our management s attention and resources, which could have a material adverse effect on our cash flows, our ability to execute our business strategy, and our ability to make distributions to our stockholder. 
 We may not be able to make distributions to our stockholders at the times or in the amounts we expect, or at all. 
 We intend to make cash distributions to our stockholders in amounts such that all or substantially all of our taxable income in each year, subject to adjustments, is distributed. However, we may not be able to continue to generate sufficient cash flow from our properties to permit us to make the distributions we expect. Our ability to continue to make distributions in the future may be adversely affected by the risk factors described in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. We can provide no assurance that we will be able to make or maintain distributions and certain agreements relating to our indebtedness may, under certain circumstances, limit or eliminate our ability to make distributions to our common stockholders. For instance, our Revolving Credit Facility contains provisions that restrict us from paying distributions if an event of default exists, other than distributions required to maintain our REIT status. We can give no assurance that rents from our properties will increase, or that future acquisitions of real properties or other investments will increase our cash available for distributions to stockholders. In addition, any distributions will be authorized at the sole discretion of our board of directors, and the form, timing, and amount, if any, will depend upon a number of factors, including our actual and projected results of operations, FFO, AFFO, 
 42 

liquidity, cash flows and financial condition, the revenue we actually receive from our properties, our operating expenses, our debt service requirements, our capital expenditures, prohibitions and other limitations under our financing arrangements, our REIT taxable income, the annual REIT distribution requirements, applicable law, and such other factors as our board of directors deems relevant. 
 Distributions are expected to be based upon our FFO, AFFO, financial condition, cash flows and liquidity, debt service requirements, and capital expenditure requirements for our properties. If we do not have sufficient cash available for distributions, we may need to fund the shortage out of working capital or borrow to provide funds for such distributions, which would reduce the amount of proceeds available for real estate investments and increase our future interest costs. Our inability to make distributions, or to make distributions at expected levels, could result in a decrease in trading price of our Common Stock. 
 We may change the dividend policy for our Common Stock in the future. 
 The decision to declare and pay dividends on our Common Stock, as well as the form, timing, and amount of any such future dividends, will be at the sole discretion of our board of directors and will depend on our earnings, cash flows, liquidity, financial condition, capital requirements, contractual prohibitions or other limitations under our indebtedness, the annual distribution requirements under the REIT provisions of the Code, state law, and such other factors as our board of directors considers relevant. Any change in our dividend policy could have a material adverse effect on the market price of our Common Stock. 
 Increases in market interest rates may result in a decrease in the value of shares of our Common Stock. 
 One of the factors that will influence the price of shares of our Common Stock will be the distribution yield on shares of our Common Stock (as a percentage of the price of shares of our Common Stock) relative to market interest rates. An increase in market interest rates, which are currently at low levels relative to historical rates, may lead prospective purchasers of shares of our Common Stock to expect a higher distribution yield and higher interest rates would likely increase our borrowing costs and potentially decrease funds available for distribution. Thus, higher market interest rates could cause the per share trading price of our Common Stock to decrease. 
 There may be future dilution to earnings related to shares of our Common Stock. 
 The market price of shares of our Common Stock could decline as a result of issuances or sales of a large number of shares of our Common Stock in the market, or the perception that such issuances or sales could occur. Additionally, future issuances or sales of substantial amounts of shares of our Common Stock may be at prices below the initial public offering price of the shares of our Class A Common Stock and may result in further dilution in our earnings and FFO per share and/or materially and adversely impact the per share trading price of our Common Stock. 
 Future offerings of debt, which would be senior to shares of our Common Stock upon liquidation, and/or preferred equity securities that may be senior to shares of our Common Stock for purposes of distributions or upon liquidation, may materially and adversely affect the market price of shares of our Common Stock. 
 In the future, we may attempt to increase our capital resources by making additional offerings of debt or preferred equity securities (or causing the OP to issue debt securities). Upon liquidation, holders of our debt securities and preferred stock and lenders with respect to other borrowings will receive distributions of our available assets prior to our stockholders. Additionally, any convertible or exchangeable securities that we issue in the future may have rights, preferences, and privileges more favorable than those of our Common Stock and may result in dilution to owners of our Common Stock. Our stockholders are not entitled to preemptive rights or other protections against dilution. Our preferred stock, if issued, could have a preference on liquidating distributions or a preference on distribution payments that could limit our right to make distributions to our stockholders.

 Performance Graph 
 The following graph is a comparison of the cumulative total return of shares of our common stock, the Russell 2000, and the MCSI US REIT Index. The graph assumes that 100 was invested on December 31, 2016, in each of shares of our common stock, the Russell 2000 and the MCSI US REIT Index, and that all dividends were reinvested. There can be no assurance that the performance of our shares will continue in line with the same or similar trends depicted in the graph below. The MCSI US REIT Index is a free float-adjusted market capitalization index that is comprised of equity REITs. The index is based on MSCI USA Investable Market Index (IMI), its parent index, which captures large, mid, and small capitalization securities. While funds used in this benchmark typically target institutional investors and have characteristics that differ from us (including differing fees), we feel that the MCSI US REIT Index is an appropriate and accepted index for the purpose of evaluating returns on investments in direct real estate funds.

Item 7.	Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations 
 The following Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations MD A is intended to help the reader understand our results of operations and financial condition. This MD A is provided as a supplement to, and should be read in conjunction with, our Consolidated Financial Statements and the accompanying Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements appearing in Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. 
 Overview 
 We own and manage primarily single-tenant commercial real estate properties that are net leased on a long-term basis to a diversified group of tenants. Since our inception in 2007, we have selectively invested in net leased assets in the industrial, healthcare, restaurant, retail, and office property types. As of December 31, 2022, our portfolio has grown to 804 properties, with 797 properties located in 44 U.S. states and seven properties located in four Canadian provinces. 
 We focus on investing in real estate that is operated by creditworthy single tenants in industries characterized by positive business drivers and trends. We target properties that are an integral part of the tenants businesses and are therefore opportunities to secure long-term net leases. Through long-term net leases, our tenants are able to retain operational control of their strategically important locations, while allocating their debt and equity capital to fund core business operations rather than real estate ownership. 
 Diversified Portfolio . As of December 31, 2022, our portfolio comprised approximately 39.1 million rentable square feet of operational space, and was highly diversified based on property type, geography, tenant, and industry, and is cross-diversified within each e.g., property-type diversification within a geographic concentration): 

Property Type : We are focused primarily on industrial, healthcare, restaurant, retail, and office property types based on our extensive experience in and conviction around these sectors. Within these sectors, we have meaningful concentrations in manufacturing, distribution and warehouse, food processing, casual dining, clinical, quick service restaurants, general merchandise, and flex/research and development. 

Geographic Diversification : Our properties are located in 44 U.S. states and four Canadian provinces, with no single geographic concentration exceeding 9.7 of our ABR. 

Tenant and Industry Diversification : Our properties are occupied by 221 different commercial tenants who operate 211 different brands that are diversified across 55 different industries, with no single tenant accounting for more than 4.0 of our ABR. 

Strong In-Place Leases with Significant Remaining Lease Term . As of December 31, 2022, our portfolio was approximately 99.4 leased with an ABR weighted average remaining lease term of approximately 10.9 years, excluding renewal options. 

Standard Contractual Base Rent Escalation . Approximately 97.3 of our leases have contractual rent escalations, with an ABR weighted average minimum increase of 2.0 . 

Extensive Tenant Financial Reporting . Approximately 94.3 of our tenants, based on ABR, provide financial reporting, of which 85.8 are required to provide us with specified financial information on a periodic basis and an additional 8.5 of our tenants report financial statements publicly, either through SEC filings or otherwise. 

Factors That Impact Our Result of Operations 
 Our results of operations and financial condition are affected by numerous factors, many of which are beyond our control. Key factors that typically impact our results of operations and financial condition, include rental rates, property dispositions, lease renewals and occupancy, investment activity, net lease terms, interest expense, general and administrative expenses, tenant bankruptcies, and impairments. 
 Rental Rates 
 Our ability to grow rental revenue from our existing portfolio will depend on our ability to realize the rental escalations built into our leases. As of December 31, 2022, leases contributing approximately 97.3 of our ABR provided for increases in future annual base rent, generally ranging from 1.5 to 2.5 annually, with an ABR weighted average minimum increase of 2.0 . Generally, our rent escalators increase rent on specified dates by a fixed percentage. Approximately 11.6 of our rent escalators are based on an increase in the CPI over a specified period and 2.7 of our leases are flat leases, meaning they do not provide for rent increases during their terms. 
 
 47 

Property Dispositions 
 From time to time, we strategically dispose of properties, primarily when we believe the risk profile has changed and become misaligned with our then current risk-adjusted return objectives. The resulting gains or losses on dispositions may materially impact our operating results, and the recognition of a gain or loss on the sale of real estate varies from transaction to transaction based on fluctuations in asset prices and demand in the real estate market at the time a property is listed for sale. 
 Lease Renewals and Occupancy 
 As of December 31, 2022, the ABR weighted average remaining term of our portfolio was approximately 10.9 years, excluding renewal options, and leases for six properties will expire during 2023. Less than 4 of the properties in our portfolio are subject to leases without at least one renewal option. Approximately 56.4 of our ABR was derived from leases that will expire after 2030, and no more than 6.2 of our ABR was derived from leases that expire in any single year prior to 2030. The stability of the rental revenue generated by our properties depends principally on our tenants ability to pay rent and our ability to collect rents, renew expiring leases or re-lease space upon the expiration or other termination of leases, lease currently vacant properties, and maintain or increase rental rates at our leased properties. To the extent our properties become vacant and are not subject to a lease, we would forego rental income while remaining responsible for the payment of property taxes and maintaining the property until it is re-leased, which could negatively impact our operating results. Our portfolio was 99.4 occupied as of December 31, 2022. 
 Investment Activity 
 Our historical growth in revenues and earnings has been achieved through rent escalations associated with existing in-place leases, coupled with rental income generated from accretive property investments. Our ability to grow revenue will depend, to a significant degree, on our ability to identify and complete acquisitions that meet our investment criteria. Changes in capitalization rates, interest rates, or other factors may impact our acquisition opportunities in the future. Market conditions may also impact the total returns we can achieve on our investments. Our investment volume also depends on our ability to access third-party debt and equity financing. 
 Net Lease Terms 
 Substantially all of our leases are net, pursuant to which our tenant generally is obligated to pay most recurring expenses associated with the leased property including real estate taxes, insurance, maintenance, and repairs. The remaining leases generally require that we pay some property expenses such as real estate taxes, insurance, or certain repairs and maintenance. Additionally, we seek to use master lease structures when possible, pursuant to which we lease multiple properties to a single tenant on an all or none basis. Master leases strengthen our ability to preserve rental revenue and prevent costs associated with vacancies for underperforming properties. As of December 31, 2022, master leases contributed 67.7 of the ABR associated with multi-site tenants (418 of our 489 properties), and 40.8 of our overall ABR (489 of our 804 properties). 
 Interest Expense 
 We anticipate that we will continue to incur debt to fund future investment activity, which will increase the amount of interest expense we incur. In addition, although we attempt to limit our total floating-rate debt exposure, changes in the interest rate environment could either increase or decrease our weighted average interest rate in the future. Any changes to our debt structure or debt financing associated with property investments, could materially influence our operating results depending on the terms of any such debt. Our current investment grade credit ratings are BBB from S P Global Ratings S P and Baa2 from Moody s Investors Service Moody s ), which allow us to take advantage of the lower cost of debt. However, a downgrade in our credit rating, or interest rate change due to governmental monetary and tax policies, domestic and international economic and political conditions, or other factors beyond our control, could also increase the amount of interest we pay under our debt agreements. 
 General and Administrative Expenses 
 Our general and administrative expenses primarily consist of employee compensation and related costs, third party legal, accounting, and consulting expenses, travel and entertainment, and general office expenses. 
 
 48 

Impact of Inflation 
 Our leases with tenants of our properties are long-term in nature, with a current weighted average remaining lease term of 10.9 years as of December 31, 2022. To mitigate the impact of inflation on our fixed revenue streams, we have implemented limited escalation clauses in our leases. As of December 31, 2022, substantially all of our leases had contractual lease escalations, with an annual weighted average of 2.0 . A majority of our leases have fixed annual rent increases or periodic escalations over the term of the lease e.g. , a 10 increase every five years), and the remaining portion has annual lease escalations based on increases in the CPI. These lease escalations mitigate the risk of fixed revenue streams in the case of an inflationary economic environment, and provide increased return in otherwise stable market conditions. As a majority of our portfolio has fixed lease escalations, we are limited in our same store rental revenue inflation protection. 
 Our focus on single-tenant, net leases also shelters us from fluctuations in the cost of services and maintenance as a result of inflation. For a portion of our portfolio, we have leases that are not fully triple-net, and, therefore, we bear certain responsibilities for the maintenance and structural component replacements e.g., roof, structure, or parking lot) that may be required in the future, although the tenants are still required to pay all operating expenses associated with the property e.g. , real estate taxes, insurance, and maintenance). Inflation and increased costs may have an adverse impact to our tenants and their creditworthiness if the increase in costs are greater than their increase in revenue. Where we cannot implement a triple-net lease, we attempt to limit our exposure to inflation through the use of warranties and other remedies that reduce the likelihood of a significant capital outlay. 
 Tenant Bankruptcies 
 Adverse economic conditions, particularly those that affect the markets in which our properties are located, or downturns in our tenants industries could impair our tenants ability to meet their lease obligations to us and our ability to renew expiring leases or re-lease space. In particular, the bankruptcy of one or more of our tenants could adversely affect our ability to collect rents from such tenants and maintain our portfolio s occupancy. We have historically experienced only a limited number of tenant bankruptcies, which have not been material to our financial results. 
 Impairments 
 We review long-lived assets to be held and used for possible impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate that their carrying amounts may not be recoverable. If, and when, such events or changes in circumstances are present, an impairment exists to the extent the carrying value of the long-lived asset or asset group exceeds the sum of the undiscounted cash flows expected to result from the use of the long-lived asset or asset group and its eventual disposition. Such cash flows include expected future operating income, as adjusted for trends and prospects, as well as the effects of demand, competition, and other factors. Significant judgment is made as to if and when impairment should be taken. If our strategy, or one or more of the assumptions described above, changes in the future, we may have to recognize an impairment. Indications of a tenant s inability to continue as a going concern, changes in our view or strategy relative to a tenant s business or industry, or changes in our long-term hold strategies, could each be indicative of an impairment triggering event. For the year ended December 31, 2022, we recognized 5.5 million of impairment due to a change in our long-term hold strategy for three properties. 
 Results of Operations 
 Discussion of our Results of Operations for the year ended December 31, 2021 compared to the year ended December 31, 2020 was previously filed in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2021. See Item 7. Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations under the heading Results of Operations Year Ended December 31, 2021 Compared to Year Ended year ended December 31, 2020 . 
 Overview 
 As of December 31, 2022, our real estate investment portfolio included 804 commercial real estate properties, with 797 properties located in 44 U.S. states and seven properties located in four Canadian provinces, and leased to tenants in various industries. All but three of our properties were subject to a lease as of December 31, 2022.

The increase in Lease revenues, net was primarily due to growth in our real estate portfolio through accretive property acquisitions during 2021 and 2022 partially offset by the reductions of revenues associated with property dispositions. During the year ended December 31, 2022, we invested 907.2 million, in 87 properties at a weighted average initial cash capitalization rate of 6.4 . The increase in lease revenues was partially offset by a decrease in lease termination fee income, which we classified as other income from real estate transactions in the table above. During the year ended December 31, 2022, we recognized 2.5 million of lease termination income, compared to 35.0 million in lease termination fee income during the year ended December 31, 2021. In September 2021, we executed the early termination of a long-term, master lease with an investment-grade office tenant in exchange for a termination fee of 35.0 million. Simultaneously, we sold the underlying vacant properties to an unrelated third party. Through these simultaneous transactions, we recorded 33.8 million of revenue, 4.1 million of amortization, and 25.7 million of impairment, for a net 4.0 million increase to net income. This resulted in a 33.8 million increase to generated FFO, but no impact to generated AFFO or net debt to annualized adjusted EBITDAre.

 The increase in depreciation and amortization was due to growth in our real estate portfolio during the year ended December 31, 2022, partially offset by a decrease in certain accelerated amortization associated with certain lease terminations during the year ended December 31, 2021, as discussed in Lease revenues, net above. 
 Property and operating expense 
 The increase in property and operating expense was primarily attributable to the number of properties we own for which we are responsible for engaging a third-party manager to manage ongoing property maintenance, along with insurance and real estate taxes associated with those properties. We pay a majority of these expenses and are reimbursed by the tenants under the terms of the respective leases. There was a corresponding increase in operating expenses billed to tenants, which is included within Lease revenues, net. 

50 

Provision for impairment of investment in rental properties 
 During the year ended December 31, 2022, we recognized 5.5 million of impairment on our investments in rental properties, primarily due to a change in our long-term hold strategy for three properties, compared to 28.2 million of impairment during the year ended December 31, 2021.

Interest expense 
 The increase in interest expense reflects an increase in our weighted average cost of borrowings combined with increased average outstanding borrowings during the year ended December 31, 2022, compared to the year ended December 31, 2021. Since December 31, 2021, we increased total outstanding borrowings by 334.9 million to partially fund our acquisitions. Of our total outstanding indebtedness, approximately 93.5 is fixed or hedged via interest rates swaps and therefore not subject to the impact of fluctuations in interest rates. 
 Gain on sale of real estate 
 Our recognition of a gain or loss on the sale of real estate varies from transaction to transaction based on fluctuations in asset prices and demand in the real estate market. During the year ended December 31, 2022, we recognized gains of 16.0 million on the sale of eight properties, compared to gains of 13.5 million on the sale of 31 properties during the year ended December 31, 2021. 
 Change in fair value of earnout liability 
 The fair value of the earnout liability was remeasured each reporting period, with changes recorded as Change in fair value of earnout liability in the Consolidated Statements of Income and Comprehensive Income. The change in the fair value of the earnout liability during the year ended December 31, 2022, reflects our achievement of all four milestones applicable to the earnout during the year ended December 31, 2021. 
 Other income (expenses) 
 The change in other income during the year ended December 31, 2022 was primarily 5.6 million of unrealized foreign exchange gain recognized on the remeasurement of our 100 million CAD revolver borrowings, compared to a 0.2 million unrealized foreign exchange loss recognized during the year ended December 31, 2021.

GAAP net income includes items such as gain or loss on sale of real estate and provisions for impairment, among others, which can vary from quarter to quarter and impact period-over-period comparisons. 
 Liquidity and Capital Resources 
 General 
 We invest in real estate using a combination of debt and equity capital and with cash from operations that is not otherwise distributed to our stockholders. Our focus is on maximizing the risk-adjusted return to our stockholders through an appropriate balance of debt and equity in our capital structure. We are committed to maintaining an investment grade balance sheet through active management of our leverage profile and overall liquidity position. We believe our leverage strategy has allowed us to take advantage of the lower cost of debt while simultaneously strengthening our balance sheet, as evidenced by our current investment grade credit ratings of BBB from S P and Baa2 from Moody s. We manage our leverage profile using a ratio of Net Debt to Annualized Adjusted EBITDAre, a non-GAAP financial measure, which we believe is a useful measure of our ability to repay debt and a relative measure of leverage, and is used in communications with lenders and with rating agencies regarding our credit rating. We seek to maintain on a sustained basis a Net Debt to Annualized Adjusted EBITDAre ratio that is generally less than 6.0x. As of December 31, 2022, we had total debt outstanding and Net Debt of 2.0 billion each, and a Net Debt to Annualized Adjusted EBITDAre ratio of 5.2x. 
 Net Debt and Annualized Adjusted EBITDAre are non-GAAP financial measures, and Annualized Adjusted EBITDAre is calculated based upon EBITDA, EBITDAre, and Adjusted EBITDAre, each of which is also a non-GAAP financial measure. Refer to Non-GAAP Measures below for further details concerning our calculation of non-GAAP measures and reconciliations to the comparable GAAP measure. 
 Liquidity/REIT Requirements 
 Liquidity is a measure of our ability to meet potential cash requirements, including our ongoing commitments to repay debt, fund our operations, acquire properties, make distributions to our stockholders, and other general business needs. As a REIT, we are required to distribute to our stockholders at least 90 of our REIT taxable income determined without regard to the dividends paid deduction and excluding net capital gain, on an annual basis. As a result, it is unlikely that we will be able to retain substantial cash balances to meet our long-term liquidity needs, including repayment of debt and the acquisition of additional properties, from our annual taxable income. Instead, we expect to meet our long-term liquidity needs primarily by relying upon external sources of capital. 
 Short-term Liquidity Requirements 
 
 Our short-term liquidity requirements consist primarily of funds necessary to pay for our operating expenses, including our general and administrative expenses as well as interest payments on our outstanding debt, to pay distributions, and to fund our acquisitions that are under control or expected to close within a short time period. We do not currently anticipate making significant capital expenditures or incurring other significant property costs, including as a result of inflationary pressures in the current economic environment, because of the strong occupancy levels across our portfolio and the net lease nature of our leases. We expect to meet our short-term liquidity requirements primarily from cash and cash equivalents balances, net cash provided by operating activities, borrowings under our Revolving Credit Facility and capital recycled through selective property dispositions. We intend to match fund our acquisitions with an appropriate mix of debt and equity capital. We use cash on hand and borrowings under our Revolving Credit Facility to initially fund acquisitions, which are subsequently repaid or replaced with proceeds from our equity and debt capital markets activities and cash flows in excess of distributions. 
 As detailed in the contractual obligations table below, we have approximately 87.5 million of expected obligations due throughout 2023, primarily consisting of 7.6 million of mortgage maturities, and 79.2 million of interest expense due, including the impact of our interest rate swaps. We expect our cash provided by operating activities, as discussed below, will be sufficient to pay for our current obligations including interest expense on our borrowings. We expect to either repay the maturing mortgages with available cash on hand generated from our results of operations or borrowings under our Revolving Credit Facility, or refinance with property-level borrowings. 
 
 Long-term Liquidity Requirements 
 Our long-term liquidity requirements consist primarily of funds necessary to repay debt and invest in additional revenue generating properties. We expect to source debt capital from unsecured term loans from commercial banks, revolving credit facilities, private placement senior unsecured notes, and public bond offerings. 
 The source and mix of our debt capital in the future will be impacted by market conditions as well as our continued focus on lengthening our debt maturity profile to better align with our portfolio s long-term leases, staggering debt maturities to reduce the risk that a significant amount of debt will mature in any single year in the future, and managing our exposure to interest rate risk. As of December 31, 2022, we have 802.7 million of available capacity under our Revolving Credit Facility. 
 We expect to meet our long-term liquidity requirements primarily from borrowings under our Revolving Credit Facility, future debt and equity financings, and proceeds from selective sales of our properties. Our ability to access these capital sources may be impacted by unfavorable market conditions, particularly in the debt and equity capital markets, that are outside of our control. In addition, our success will depend on our operating performance, our borrowing restrictions, our degree of leverage, and other factors. Our acquisition growth 
 52 

strategy significantly depends on our ability to obtain acquisition financing on favorable terms. We seek to reduce the risk that long-term debt capital may be unavailable to us by strengthening our balance sheet by investing in real estate with creditworthy tenants and lease guarantors, and by maintaining an appropriate mix of debt and equity capitalization. We also, from time to time, obtain or assume non-recourse mortgage financing from banks and insurance companies secured by mortgages on the corresponding specific property. Mortgages, however, are not currently a strategic focus of the active management of our capital structure. 
 
 Equity Capital Resources 
 
 Our equity capital is primarily provided through our at-the-market common equity offering program ATM Program ), as well as follow-on equity offerings. Under the terms of our ATM Program we may, from time to time, publicly offer and sell shares of our common stock having an aggregate gross sales price of up to 400 million. The ATM Program provides for forward sale agreements, enabling us to set the price of shares upon pricing the offering while delaying the issuance of shares and the receipt of the net proceeds. As of December 31, 2022, we have 145.4 million of available capacity under our ATM Program. 
 
 The following table presents information about our ATM Program activity:

In August 2022, we completed a public offering to sell an aggregate of 13,000,000 shares of common stock at a price of 21.35 per share, subject to certain adjustments, in connection with a forward sale agreement. On December 28, 2022, we settled all 13,000,000 outstanding shares for net proceeds of 272.6 million, after deducting underwriting discounts and commissions of 3.4 million and 0.6 million in other expenses. 
 
 Our public offerings have been used to repay debt, fund acquisitions, and for other general corporate purposes. 
 
 As we continue to invest in accretive real estate properties, we expect to balance our debt and equity capitalization, while maintaining a Net Debt to Annualized Adjusted EBITDAre ratio below 6.0x on a sustained basis, through the anticipated use of follow-on equity offerings and the ATM Program.

Revolving Credit Facility 
 On January 28, 2022, we amended and restated the Revolving Credit Facility, upsizing the capacity to 1 billion and extending its maturity date to March 2026. In addition to United States Dollars USD ), borrowings under the Revolving Credit Facility can be made in Pound Sterling, Euros or Canadian Dollars CAD up to an aggregate amount of 500.0 million. Borrowings under the amended credit facility are subject to interest only payments at variable rates equal to the applicable reference rate plus a margin of 0.85 based on our 
 53 

current credit ratings of BBB and Baa2 from S P and Moody s, respectively. In addition, the amended credit facility is subject to a facility fee on the amount of the revolving commitments, based on our credit rating. The applicable facility fee is 0.20 per annum. 
 2026 Unsecured Term Loan 
 Borrowings under the 2026 Unsecured Term Loan are subject to interest at variable rates based on LIBOR plus a margin based on our credit rating ranging between 0.85 and 1.65 based on our credit rating. At December 31, 2022, the applicable margin was 1.00 . Upon the cessation of the publication of LIBOR, borrowings under the 2026 Unsecured Term Loan will automatically become subject to SOFR. 
 2027 Unsecured Term Loan and 2029 Unsecured Term Loan 
 On August 1, 2022, we entered into two new unsecured bank term loans, including a 200.0 million, five-year term loan that matures in 2027 (the 2027 Unsecured Term Loan ), and a 300.0 million, seven-year term loan that matures in 2029 (the 2029 Unsecured Term Loan ). Borrowings on the new term loans bear interest at variable rates based on adjusted SOFR plus a margin based on our credit rating ranging between 0.80 and 1.60 per annum for the 2027 Unsecured Term Loan, and 1.15 and 2.20 per annum for the 2029 Unsecured Term Loan. At December 31, 2022, the applicable margin was 0.95 and 1.25 for the 2027 Unsecured Term Loan and 2029 Unsecured Term Loan, respectively. 
 2027 Senior Unsecured Notes - Series A 
 The 2027 Senior Unsecured Notes - Series A are payable interest only semiannually during their term, bear interest at a fixed rate of 4.84 per annum, and mature in April 2027. 
 2028 Senior Unsecured Notes - Series B and 2030 Senior Unsecured Notes - Series C 
 The 2028 Senior Unsecured Notes - Series B and 2030 Senior Unsecured Notes - Series C are payable interest only semiannually during their term, and bear interest at fixed rates of 5.09 per annum and 5.19 per annum, respectively. Series B Notes mature in July 2028, and the Series C Notes mature in July 2030. 
 2031 Senior Unsecured Public Notes 
 Borrowings under the 2031 Senior Unsecured Public Notes are subject to interest only, semi-annual payments at a fixed rate of 2.60 per annum and mature in September 2031. 
 Debt Covenants 
 We are subject to various covenants and financial reporting requirements pursuant to our debt facilities, which are summarized below. As of December 31, 2022, we believe we were in compliance with all of our covenants on all outstanding borrowings. In the event of default, either through default on payments or breach of covenants, we may be restricted from paying dividends to our stockholders in excess of dividends required to maintain our REIT qualification. For each of the previous three years, we paid dividends out of our cash flows from operations in excess of the distribution amounts required to maintain our REIT qualification.

(1) On January 28, 2022, we amended and restated the Revolving Credit Facility, extending its maturity date to March 2026. The amended agreement contains two six-month extension options subject to certain conditions, including the payment of an extension fee equal to 0.0625 of the revolving commitments. 

(2) Interest expense is projected based on the outstanding borrowings and interest rates in effect as of December 31, 2022. This amount includes the impact of interest rate swap agreements. 

(3) We expect to pay tenant improvement allowances out of cash flows from operations or from additional borrowings. 

At December 31, 2022 and 2021, investment in rental property of 143.3 million and 161.6 million, respectively, was pledged as collateral against our mortgages. 
 Additionally, we are a party to two separate tax protection agreements with the contributing members of two distinct UPREIT transactions and a tax protection agreement in connection with the Internalization. The tax protection agreements require us to indemnify the beneficiaries in the event of a sale, exchange, transfer, or other disposal of the contributed property, and in the case of the tax protection agreement entered into in connection with the Internalization, the entire Company, in a taxable transaction that would cause such beneficiaries to recognize a gain that is protected under the agreements, subject to certain exceptions. Based on values as of December 31, 2022, taxable sales of the applicable properties would trigger liability under the three agreements of approximately 20.4 million. Based on information available, we do not believe that the events resulting in damages as detailed above have occurred or are likely to occur in the foreseeable future. Accordingly, we have excluded these commitments from the contractual commitments table above. 
 In the normal course of business, we enter into various types of commitments to purchase real estate properties. These commitments are generally subject to our customary due diligence process and, accordingly, a number of specific conditions must be met before we are obligated to purchase the properties. 
 Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities 
 We are exposed to interest rate risk arising from changes in interest rates on the floating-rate borrowings under our unsecured credit facilities and a certain mortgage. Borrowings pursuant to our unsecured credit facilities bear interest at floating rates based on the applicable reference rate plus an applicable margin. Accordingly, fluctuations in market interest rates may increase or decrease our interest expense, which will in turn, increase or decrease our net income and cash flow. 
 We attempt to manage our interest rate risk by entering into interest rate swaps. As of December 31, 2022, we had 32 interest rate swaps outstanding in an aggregate notional amount of 973.8 million. Under these agreements, we receive monthly payments from the counterparties equal to the related variable interest rates multiplied by the outstanding notional amounts. In turn, we pay the counterparties each month an amount equal to a fixed interest rate multiplied by the related outstanding notional amounts. The intended net impact of these transactions is that we pay a fixed interest rate on our variable-rate borrowings. The interest rate swaps have been designated by us as cash flow hedges for accounting purposes and are reported at fair value. We assess, both at inception and on an ongoing basis, the effectiveness of our qualifying cash flow hedges. We have not entered, and do not intend to enter, into derivative or interest rate transactions for speculative purposes. 
 In addition, we own investments in Canada, and as a result are subject to risk from the effects of exchange rate movements in the Canadian dollar, which may affect future costs and cash flows. We funded a significant portion of our Canadian investments through Canadian dollar borrowings under our Revolving Credit Facility, which is intended to act as a natural hedge against our Canadian dollar investments. The Canadian dollar revolving borrowings are remeasured each reporting period, with the unrealized foreign currency gains and losses flowing through earnings. These unrealized foreign currency gains and losses do not impact our cash flows from operations until settled, and are expected to directly offset the changes in the value of our net investments as a result of changes in the Canadian dollar. Our Canadian investments are recorded at their historical exchange rates, and therefore are not impacted by changes in the value of the Canadian dollar. 
 55 

Cash Flows 
 Cash and cash equivalents and restricted cash totaled 60.0 million, 27.8 million, and 110.7 million at December 31, 2022, 2021, and 2020, respectively. The table below shows information concerning cash flows for the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021, and 2020:

The increase in net cash provided by operating activities during the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021 was mainly due to growth in our real estate portfolio. 
 The increase in net cash used in investing activities during the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021 was mainly due to increased acquisition volume. The increase in 2021 as compared to 2020 was also driven by a decrease in cash paid in connection with the Internalization. 
 The increase in net cash provided by (used in) financing activities during the year ended December 31, 2022 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2021, mainly reflects an increase in net proceeds from equity and debt offerings in 2022 to fund growth in our real estate portfolio. The change in net cash (used in) financing activities during the year ended December 31, 2021 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2020, mainly reflects an increase in net proceeds from equity and debt offerings in 2021 to fund growth in our real estate portfolio. 
 
 Non-GAAP Measures 

FFO, Core FFO, and AFFO 
 
 We compute FFO in accordance with the standards established by the Board of Governors of Nareit, the worldwide representative voice for REITs and publicly traded real estate companies with an interest in the U.S. real estate and capital markets. Nareit defines FFO as GAAP net income or loss adjusted to exclude net gains (losses) from sales of certain depreciated real estate assets, depreciation and amortization expense from real estate assets, gains and losses from change in control, and impairment charges related to certain previously depreciated real estate assets. FFO is used by management, investors, and analysts to facilitate meaningful comparisons of operating performance between periods and among our peers, primarily because it excludes the effect of real estate depreciation and amortization and net gains (losses) on sales, which are based on historical costs and implicitly assume that the value of real estate diminishes predictably over time, rather than fluctuating based on existing market conditions. 
 
 We compute Core FFO by adjusting FFO, as defined by Nareit, to exclude certain GAAP income and expense amounts that we believe are infrequently recurring, unusual in nature, or not related to its core real estate operations, including write-offs or recoveries of accrued rental income, lease termination fees, non-cash gains on insurance recoveries, the change in fair value of our earnout liability, cost of debt extinguishments, unrealized and realized gains or losses on foreign currency transactions, severance, and other extraordinary items. Exclusion of these items from similar FFO-type metrics is common within the equity REIT industry, and management believes that presentation of Core FFO provides investors with a metric to assist in their evaluation of our operating performance across multiple periods and in comparison to the operating performance of our peers, because it removes the effect of unusual items that are not expected to impact our operating performance on an ongoing basis. 
 
 We compute AFFO, by adjusting Core FFO for certain non-cash revenues and expenses, including straight-line rents, amortization of lease intangibles, amortization of debt issuance costs, amortization of net mortgage premiums, loss (gain) on interest rate swaps and other non-cash interest expense, realized gains or losses on foreign currency transactions, stock-based compensation, severance, extraordinary items, and other specified non-cash items. We believe that excluding such items assists management and investors in distinguishing whether changes in our operations are due to growth or decline of operations at our properties or from other factors. We use AFFO as a measure of our performance when we formulate corporate goals, and is a factor in determining management compensation. We believe that AFFO is a useful supplemental measure for investors to consider because it will help them to better assess our operating performance without the distortions created by non-cash revenues or expenses. 
 
 Specific to our adjustment for straight-line rents, our leases include cash rents that increase over the term of the lease to compensate us for anticipated increases in market rental rates over time. Our leases do not include significant front-loading or back-loading of payments, or significant rent-free periods. Therefore, we find it useful to evaluate rent on a contractual basis as it allows for comparison of existing rental rates to market rental rates. In situations where we granted short-term rent deferrals as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, and such deferrals were probable of collection and expected to be repaid within a short term, we continued to recognize the same amount of GAAP lease revenues each period. Consistent with GAAP lease revenues, the short-term deferrals associated with COVID-19, and the corresponding payments, did not impact our AFFO. 
 56 

FFO, Core FFO, and AFFO may not be comparable to similarly titled measures employed by other REITs, and comparisons of our FFO, Core FFO, and AFFO with the same or similar measures disclosed by other REITs may not be meaningful. 
 
 Neither the SEC nor any other regulatory body has passed judgment on the acceptability of the adjustments to FFO that we use to calculate Core FFO and AFFO. In the future, the SEC, Nareit or another regulatory body may decide to standardize the allowable adjustments across the REIT industry and in response to such standardization we may have to adjust our calculation and characterization of Core FFO and AFFO accordingly.

EBITDA, EBITDAre, Adjusted EBITDAre and Annualized Adjusted EBITDAre 
 
 We compute EBITDA as earnings before interest, income taxes and depreciation and amortization. EBITDA is a measure commonly used in our industry. We believe that this ratio provides investors and analysts with a measure of our performance that includes our operating results unaffected by the differences in capital structures, capital investment cycles and useful life of related assets compared to other companies in our industry. We compute EBITDAre in accordance with the definition adopted by Nareit, as EBITDA excluding gains (losses) from the sales of depreciable property and provisions for impairment on investment in real estate. We believe EBITDA and EBITDAre are useful to investors and analysts because they provide important supplemental information about our operating performance exclusive of certain non-cash and other costs. EBITDA and EBITDAre are not measures of financial performance under GAAP, and our EBITDA and EBITDAre may not be comparable to similarly titled measures of other companies. You should not consider our EBITDA and EBITDAre as alternatives to net income or cash flows from operating activities determined in accordance with GAAP. 
 
 We are focused on a disciplined and targeted acquisition strategy, together with active asset management that includes selective sales of properties. We manage our leverage profile using a ratio of Net Debt to Annualized Adjusted EBITDAre, each discussed further below, which we believe is a useful measure of our ability to repay debt and a relative measure of leverage, and is used in communications with our lenders and rating agencies regarding our credit rating. As we fund new acquisitions using our unsecured Revolving Credit Facility, our leverage profile and Net Debt will be immediately impacted by current quarter acquisitions. However, the full benefit of EBITDAre from newly acquired properties will not be received in the same quarter in which the properties are acquired. Additionally, EBITDAre for the quarter includes amounts generated by properties that have been sold during the quarter. Accordingly, the variability in EBITDAre caused by the timing of our acquisitions and dispositions can temporarily distort our leverage ratios. We adjust EBITDAre Adjusted EBITDAre for the most recently completed quarter (i) to recalculate as if all acquisitions and dispositions had occurred at the beginning of the quarter, 
 57 

(ii) to exclude certain GAAP income and expense amounts that are either non-cash, such as cost of debt extinguishments, realized or unrealized gains and losses on foreign currency transactions, or the change in fair value of our earnout liability, or that we believe are one time, or unusual in nature because they relate to unique circumstances or transactions that had not previously occurred and which we do not anticipate occurring in the future, and (iii) to eliminate the impact of lease termination fees and other items that are not a result of normal operations. We then annualize quarterly Adjusted EBITDAre by multiplying it by four Annualized Adjusted EBITDAre ). You should not unduly rely on this measure as it is based on assumptions and estimates that may prove to be inaccurate. Our actual reported EBITDAre for future periods may be significantly different from our Annualized Adjusted EBITDAre. Adjusted EBITDAre and Annualized Adjusted EBITDAre are not measurements of performance under GAAP, and our Adjusted EBITDAre and Annualized Adjusted EBITDAre may not be comparable to similarly titled measures of other companies. You should not consider our Adjusted EBITDAre and Annualized Adjusted EBITDAre as alternatives to net income or cash flows from operating activities determined in accordance with GAAP. 
 The following table reconciles net income (which is the most comparable GAAP measure) to EBITDA, EBITDAre, and Adjusted EBITDAre. Information is also presented with respect to Annualized EBITDAre and Annualized Adjusted EBITDAre:

Net Debt, Net Debt to Annualized EBITDAre and Net Debt to Annualized Adjusted EBITDAre 
 We define Net Debt as gross debt (total reported debt plus debt issuance costs) less cash and cash equivalents and restricted cash. We believe that the presentation of Net Debt to Annualized EBITDAre and Net Debt to Annualized Adjusted EBITDAre is useful to investors and analysts because these ratios provide information about gross debt less cash and cash equivalents, which could be used to repay debt, compared to our performance as measured using EBITDAre, and is used in communications with lenders and rating agencies regarding our credit rating.

Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates 
 The preparation of our consolidated financial statements in conformance with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues, and expenses as well as other disclosures in the financial statements. We base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions believed to be reasonable under the circumstances. These judgments affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the dates of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting periods. On an ongoing basis, management evaluates its estimates and assumptions; however, actual results may differ from these estimates and assumptions, which in turn could have a material impact on our financial statements. A summary of our significant accounting policies and procedures are included in Note 2, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies , contained in Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Management believes the following critical accounting policies, among others, affect its more significant estimates and assumptions used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements. 
 Investment in Rental Property 
 Rental property accounted for under operating leases is recorded at cost. Rental property accounted for under direct financing leases and sales-type are recorded at its net investment, which generally represents the cost of the property at the inception of the lease. 
 We account for acquisitions of real estate as asset acquisitions in accordance with Accounting Standards Codification ASC 805, Business Combinations, as substantially all of the fair value of the assets acquired are concentrated in a single identifiable asset or group of similar identifiable assets. 
 We allocate the purchase price of investments in rental property accounted for as asset acquisitions based on the relative fair value of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed. These generally include tangible assets, consisting of land and land improvements, buildings and other improvements, and equipment, and identifiable intangible assets and liabilities, including the value of in-place leases and acquired above-market and below-market leases. 
 We use multiple sources to estimate fair value, including information obtained about each property as a result of our pre-acquisition due diligence and our marketing and leasing activities. Factors that impact our fair value determination include real estate market conditions, industry conditions that the tenant operates in, and characteristics of the real estate and/or real estate appraisals. Changes in any of these factors could impact the future purchase prices of our investments and the corresponding capitalization rates recognized. 
 The estimated fair value of the tangible assets of an acquired property is determined by valuing the property as if it were vacant. The as-if-vacant value is then allocated to land and land improvements, buildings, and equipment based on comparable sales and other relevant information with respect to the property, as estimated by management. Specifically, the if vacant value of buildings and equipment is calculated using an income approach. Assumptions used in the income approach to value the buildings include: capitalization and discount rates, lease-up time, market rents, make ready costs, land value, and land improvement value. 
 The estimated fair value of acquired in-place leases are the costs we would have had to incur to lease the properties to the occupancy level of the properties at the date of acquisition. Such costs include the fair value of leasing commissions and other operating costs that would have been incurred to lease the properties, had they been vacant, to their acquired occupancy level. Acquired in-place leases as of the date of acquisition are amortized over the remaining non-cancellable lease terms of the respective leases to amortization expense. 
 Acquired above-market and below-market lease values are recorded based on the present value (using an interest rate that reflects the risks associated with the lease acquired) of the differences between the contractual amounts to be paid pursuant to the in-place leases and management s estimate of fair market value lease rates at the time of acquisition for the corresponding in-place leases. The capitalized above-market and below-market lease values are amortized as adjustments to rental income over the remaining term of the respective leases. 
 Management estimates the fair value of assumed mortgages based upon indications of then-current market pricing for similar types of debt with similar maturities. Assumed mortgages are initially recorded at their estimated fair value as of the assumption date, and the 
 59 

difference between such estimated fair value and the notes outstanding principal balance is amortized to interest expense over the remaining term of the debt. 
 Long-lived Asset Impairment 
 We review long-lived assets to be held and used for possible impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate that their carrying amounts may not be recoverable. If, and when, such events or changes in circumstances are present, an impairment exists to the extent the carrying value of the long-lived asset or asset group exceeds the sum of the undiscounted cash flows expected to result from the use of the long-lived asset or asset group and its eventual disposition. Such cash flows include expected future operating income, as adjusted for trends and prospects, as well as the effects of demand, competition, and other factors. An impairment loss is measured as the amount by which the carrying amount of the long-lived asset or asset group exceeds the fair value. Significant judgment is made to determine if and when impairment should be taken. Management s assessment of impairment as of December 31, 2022 was based on the most current information available to management. Certain of our properties may have fair values less than their carrying amounts. However, based on management s plans with respect to each of those properties, we believe that their carrying amounts are recoverable and therefore, no impairment charges were recognized other than those described below. If the operating conditions mentioned above deteriorate or if our expected holding period for assets changes, subsequent tests for impairments could result in additional impairment charges in the future. 
 Inputs used in establishing fair value for real estate assets generally fall within Level 3 of the fair value hierarchy, which are characterized as requiring significant judgment as little or no current market activity may be available for validation. The main indicator used to establish the classification of the inputs is current market conditions, as derived through the use of published commercial real estate market information. We determine the valuation of impaired assets using generally accepted valuation techniques including discounted cash flow analysis, income capitalization, analysis of recent comparable sales transactions, actual sales negotiations, and bona fide purchase offers received from third parties. We may consider a single valuation technique or multiple valuation techniques, as appropriate, when estimating the fair value of our real estate. 
 The following table summarizes our impairment charges resulting primarily from changes in our long-term hold strategy with respect to the individual properties:

Goodwill 
 Goodwill represents the excess of the amount paid over the fair value of the identifiable tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed in a business combination and it assigned to one or more reporting units. We evaluate goodwill for impairment when an event occurs or circumstances change that indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable, or at least annually. Our annual testing date is November 30. 
 The goodwill impairment evaluation is completed using either a qualitative or quantitative approach. Under a qualitative approach, the impairment review for goodwill consists of an assessment of whether it is more-likely-than-not that the reporting unit s fair value is less than its carrying value, including goodwill. If a qualitative approach indicates it is more likely-than-not that the estimated carrying value of a reporting unit (including goodwill) exceeds its fair value, or if we choose to bypass the qualitative approach, we perform the quantitative approach described below. 
 When we perform a quantitative test of goodwill for impairment, we compare the carrying value of a reporting unit with its fair value. If the fair value of the reporting unit exceeds its carrying amount, we do not consider goodwill to be impaired and no further analysis would be required. If the fair value is determined to be less than its carrying value, the amount of goodwill impairment equals the amount by which the reporting unit s carrying value exceeds its fair value, not to exceed the carrying amount of goodwill. 
 Management determined that we have one reporting unit, consistent with our segment reporting analysis, which includes the acquisition, leasing, and ownership of net leased properties (i.e., the consolidated entity). When necessary to perform the quantitative test for goodwill impairment, our estimate of fair value is determined using a market approach, leveraging assumptions such as the fair value of our equity, and consideration of a control premium, if necessary, which includes an analysis of similar market transactions. While we believe the assumptions used to estimate the fair value of our reporting unit are reasonable, changes in these assumptions may have a material impact on our financial results. Based on the results of our annual goodwill impairment test on November 30, 2022, our annual goodwill impairment test date, we concluded that goodwill was not impaired. 
 Revenue Recognition 
 We account for leases in accordance with ASC 842, Leases. We commence revenue recognition on our leases based on a number of factors, including the initial determination that the contract is or contains a lease. Generally, all of our property related contracts are or 
 60 

contain leases, and therefore revenue is recognized when the lessee takes possession of or controls the physical use of the leased assets. In most instances this occurs on the lease commencement date. At the time of lease assumption or at the inception of a new lease, including new leases that arise from amendments, we assess the terms and conditions of the lease to determine the proper lease classification. 
 A lease is classified as an operating lease if none of the following criteria are met: (i) ownership transfers to the lessee at the end of the lease term, (ii) the lessee has a purchase option that is reasonably expected to be exercised, (iii) the lease term is for a major part of the economic life of the leased property, (iv) the present value of the future lease payments and any residual value guaranteed by the lessee that is not already reflected in the lease payments equals or exceeds substantially all of the fair value of the leased property, and (v) the leased property is of such a specialized nature that it is expected to have no future alternative use to the Company at the end of the lease term. If one or more of these criteria are met, the lease will generally be classified as a sales-type lease, unless the lease contains a residual value guarantee from a third party other than the lessee, in which case it would be classified as a direct financing lease under certain circumstances. 
 We account for the right to use land as a separate lease component, unless the accounting effect of doing so would be insignificant. Determination of significance requires management judgment. In determining whether the accounting effect of separately reporting the land component from other components for its real estate leases is significant, we assess: (i) whether separating the land component impacts the classification of any lease component, (ii) the value of the land component in the context of the overall contract, and (iii) whether the right to use the land is coterminous with the rights to use the other assets. 
 Lease Termination Fee Income 
 The Company recognizes lease termination fee income as other income from real estate transactions, a component of Lease revenues, net, when all conditions of the termination agreement have been met, and collection of the lease termination fee is probable. If the tenant immediately vacates the property upon satisfying the conditions of the termination agreement, the Company recognizes the lease termination fee income net of accrued rental income associated with the lease immediately, as other income from real estate transactions, a component of Lease revenues, net, in the Consolidated Statement of Income and Comprehensive Income. 
 Forward Sale Agreements 
 The Company occasionally sells shares of common stock through forward sale agreements to enable the Company to set the price of such shares upon pricing the offering (subject to certain adjustments) while delaying the issuance of such shares and the receipt of the net proceeds by the Company. To account for the forward sale agreements, the Company considers the accounting guidance governing financial instruments and derivatives. To date, the Company has concluded that its forward sale agreements are not liabilities as they do not embody obligations to repurchase its shares nor do they embody obligations to issue a variable number of shares for which the monetary value is predominantly fixed, varying with something other than the fair value of the shares, or varying inversely in relation to its shares. The Company then evaluates whether the agreements meet the derivatives and hedging guidance scope exception to be accounted for as equity instruments. The Company has concluded that the agreements are classifiable as equity contracts based on the following assessments: (i) none of the agreements exercise contingencies are based on observable markets or indices besides those related to the market for the Company s own stock price and operations; and (ii) none of the settlement provisions preclude the agreements from being indexed to its own stock. The Company also considers the potential dilution resulting from the forward sale agreements on the earnings per share calculations. The Company uses the treasury stock method to determine the dilution resulting from the forward sale agreements during the period of time prior to settlement. 
 Derivative Instruments and Hedging 
 Management uses interest rate swap agreements to manage risks related to interest rate movements. Management documents its risk management strategy and hedge effectiveness at the inception of, and during the term of, each hedge. Our interest rate risk management strategy is intended to stabilize cash flow requirements by maintaining interest rate swap agreements to convert certain variable-rate debt to a fixed rate. 
 The interest rate swap agreements, designated and qualifying as cash flow hedges, are reported at fair value. Interest rate swaps are measured at fair value using inputs that are directly observable in active markets and are classified within Level 2 of the valuation hierarchy, using an income approach. Specifically, the fair value of the interest rate swaps is determined using a discounted cash flow analysis on the expected future cash flows of each instrument. This analysis utilizes observable market data including yield curves and implied volatilities to determine the market s expectation of the future cash flows of the variable component. The fixed and variable components of the interest rate swaps are then discounted using calculated discount factors developed based on the overnight indexed swap OIS curve and are aggregated to arrive at a single valuation for the period. The Company also incorporates credit valuation adjustments to appropriately reflect both its own nonperformance risk and the respective counterparty s nonperformance risk in the fair value measurements. Although the Company has determined that the majority of the inputs used to value its interest rate swaps fall within Level 2 of the fair value hierarchy, the credit valuation adjustments associated with its interest rate swaps utilize Level 3 inputs, such as estimates of current credit spreads to evaluate the likelihood of default by itself and its counterparties. At December 31, 2022 and 2021, the Company has assessed the significance of the impact of the credit valuation adjustments on the overall valuation of its derivative positions and has determined that the credit valuation adjustments are not significant to the overall valuation. As a result, the Company has determined that its interest rate swap valuations in their entirety are appropriately classified within Level 2 of the fair value hierarchy. 
 61 

When an existing cash flow hedge is terminated, we determine the accounting treatment for the accumulated gain or loss recognized in Accumulated other comprehensive income (loss), based on the probability of the hedged forecasted transaction occurring within the period the cash flow hedge was anticipated to affect earnings. If management determines that the hedged forecasted transaction is probable of occurring during the original period, the accumulated gain or loss is reclassified into earnings over the remaining life of the cash flow hedge using a straight-line method. If management determines that the hedged forecasted transaction is not probable of occurring during the original period, the entire amount of accumulated gain or loss is reclassified into earnings at such time. 
 Impact of Recent Accounting Pronouncements 
 For information on the impact of recent accounting pronouncements on our business, see the captions Recently Adopted Accounting Standards and Other Recently Issued Accounting Standards in Note 2, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. 
 
 62 

Item 7A.	Quantitative and Qualitat ive Disclosures About Market Risk 
 We are exposed to certain market risks, one of the most predominant of which is a change in interest rates. Increases in interest rates can result in increased interest expense under our Revolving Credit Facility and other variable-rate debt. Increases in interest rates can also result in increased interest expense when our fixed rate debt matures and needs to be refinanced. We attempt to manage interest rate risk by entering into long-term fixed rate debt or by entering into interest rate swaps to convert certain variable-rate debt to a fixed rate. The interest rate swaps have been designated by us as cash flow hedges for accounting purposes and are reported at fair value. We have not entered, and do not intend to enter, into derivative or interest rate transactions for speculative purposes. Further information concerning our interest rate swaps can be found in Note 11 in our Consolidated Financial Statements contained elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. 
 Our fixed-rate debt includes our senior unsecured notes, mortgages, and variable-rate debt converted to a fixed rate with the use of interest rate swaps. Our fixed-rate debt and outstanding interest rate swaps had carrying values and fair values of approximately 1.9 billion and 1.7 billion, respectively, as of December 31, 2022. Changes in market interest rates impact the fair value of our fixed-rate debt and interest rate swaps, but they have no impact on interest incurred or on cash flows. For instance, if interest rates were to increase 1 , and the fixed-rate debt balance were to remain constant, we would expect the fair value of our debt to decrease, similar to how the price of a bond decreases as interest rates rise. A 1 increase in market interest rates would have resulted in a decrease in the fair value of our fixed-rate debt and interest rate swaps of approximately 75.8 million as of December 31, 2022. 
 Borrowings pursuant to our Revolving Credit Facility and other variable-rate debt bear interest at rates based on applicable reference rate plus an applicable margin, and totaled 1.1 billion as of December 31, 2022, of which 973.8 million was swapped to a fixed rate by our use of interest rate swaps. Taking into account the effect of our interest rate swaps, a 1 increase in interest rates would have a corresponding 1.2 million increase in interest expense annually, while a 1 decrease in interest rates would have a corresponding 1.2 million decrease in interest expense annually. 
 With the exception of our interest rate swap transactions, we have not engaged in transactions in derivative financial instruments or derivative commodity instruments. 
 As of December 31, 2022, our financial instruments were not exposed to significant market risk due to foreign currency exchange risk.

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM 
 To the stockholders and the Board of Directors of Broadstone Net Lease, Inc. 
 Opinion on the Financial Statements 
 We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Broadstone Net Lease, Inc. and Subsidiaries (the Company as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, the related consolidated statements of income and comprehensive income, stockholders equity and mezzanine equity, and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2022, and the related notes and the schedule listed in the Index at Item 15 (collectively referred to as the financial statements ). In our opinion, the financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2022, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. 
 We have also audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the Company s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2022, based on criteria established in Internal Control Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission and our report dated February 23, 2023, expressed an unqualified opinion on the Company s internal control over financial reporting. 
 Basis for Opinion 
 These financial statements are the responsibility of the Company s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company s financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. 
 We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. Our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion. 
 Critical Audit Matters 
 The critical audit matters communicated below are matters arising from the current-period audit of the financial statements that were communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that (1) relate to accounts or disclosures that are material to the financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion on the financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matters below, providing separate opinions on the critical audit matters or on the accounts or disclosures to which they relate. 
 Investment in rental property Refer to Notes 2 and 5 to the financial statements 
 Critical Audit Matter Description 
 During the year ended December 31, 2022, the Company acquired 878.4 million of real estate, excluding capitalized acquisition costs. The Company accounts for acquisitions of real estate as asset acquisitions. For acquired properties accounted for using the operating method, the Company allocates the purchase price to the tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on their relative fair value. Acquisition costs are capitalized and included with the allocated purchase price. The Company uses multiple sources to estimate fair value. Factors that impact estimates of fair value include real estate market conditions, industry conditions that the tenant operates in, and characteristics of the real estate and/or real estate appraisals. 
 
 We identified the allocation of purchase price as a critical audit matter because of management s significant estimates utilized to estimate the relative fair value of tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed. This required a high degree of auditor judgment and an increased extent of effort, including the need to involve our fair value specialists. 
 
 65 

How the Critical Audit Matter Was Addressed in the Audit 
 Our audit procedures related to the allocation of purchase price for investments in rental property accounted for using the operating method included the following, among others: 
 We obtained an understanding and tested the design and operating effectiveness over the Company s controls to allocate the purchase price of investments in real estate, including controls over management s evaluation of inputs and assumptions used in the valuation estimates. 

For each acquisition, we obtained and evaluated the third-party purchase price allocation report, along with relevant supporting documentation, such as the executed purchase and sale agreement. 

For each real estate acquisition, we compared the purchase price allocated to identifiable tangible and intangible assets and liabilities to the Company s historical allocation percentages for similar types of properties, identifying outliers for further investigation. 

With the assistance of our fair value specialists, on a sample basis, we evaluated the reasonableness of the valuation methodology and significant assumptions used in the third-party purchase price allocation report, including comparing the key inputs used in the purchase price allocation to external market sources. 

Evaluation of long-lived asset impairment Refer to Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements 
 Critical Audit Matter Description 
 The Company s evaluation of long-lived assets to be held and used for possible impairment involves an initial assessment to determine whether events or changes in circumstances indicate that their carrying amounts may not be recoverable. If, and when, such events or changes in circumstances are present, an impairment exists to the extent the carrying value of the long-lived asset or asset group exceeds the sum of the undiscounted cash flows expected to result from the use of the long-lived asset and its eventual disposition. An impairment loss is measured as the amount by which the carrying amount of the long-lived asset or asset group exceeds its estimated fair value. 
 
 We identified the evaluation of long-lived asset impairment as a critical audit matter because of the significant estimates and assumptions management utilizes to identify whether events or changes in circumstances have occurred indicating that the carrying value of the long-lived asset may not be recoverable, and, when applicable, the significant estimates and assumptions utilized to evaluate the long-lived asset for recoverability, including probabilities of outcomes, estimates of the hold or sell strategy, projected rental rates, and estimated disposition proceeds. Auditing these estimates and assumptions required a high degree of auditor judgment and an increased extent of effort. 
 How the Critical Audit Matter Was Addressed in the Audit 
 Our audit procedures related to the significant estimates and assumptions utilized by management to identify whether events or changes in circumstances have occurred indicating that the carrying value of the long-lived asset may not be recoverable and, when applicable, the significant estimates and assumptions utilized to evaluate the long-lived asset for recoverability included the following, among others: 
 We obtained an understanding and tested the design and operating effectiveness of the Company s controls to monitor long-lived assets for events or changes in circumstances that indicate that their carrying amounts may not be recoverable, and, when applicable, the Company s controls over the undiscounted cash flow recoverability estimates, including the estimated hold or sell strategy, projected rental rates, and estimated disposition proceeds. 

We evaluated the completeness and reasonableness of the Company s criteria to identify long-lived assets with indicators of impairment, including assessing the methodologies applied and testing the completeness and accuracy of the underlying data utilized. 

We compared the Company s undiscounted cash flow recoverability estimates and assumptions, including estimated hold or sell strategy, projected rental rates and estimated disposition proceeds to historical results and external market sources to evaluate the reasonableness. In addition, we performed procedures to evaluate the completeness and accuracy of the data utilized in management s recoverability estimates.

 Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements 
 December 31, 2022, 2021, and 2020 
 , that elected to be taxed as a real estate investment trust REIT commencing with the taxable year ended December 31, 2008. The Corporation focuses on investing in income-producing, net leased commercial properties, primarily in the United States. The Corporation leases industrial, healthcare, restaurant, retail, and office commercial properties under long-term lease agreements. At December 31, 2022 , the Corporation owned a diversified portfolio of individual commercial properties with properties located in U.S. states and properties located in Canadian provinces. Broadstone Net Lease, LLC (the Corporation s operating company, or the OP ), is the entity through which the Corporation conducts its business and owns (either directly or through subsidiaries) all of the Corporation s properties. The Corporation is the sole managing member of the OP. The remaining membership units in the OP OP Units ), which are referred to as non-controlling interests, are held by members who were issued OP Units pursuant to the Internalization (defined below) or in exchange for their interests in properties acquired by the OP. As the Corporation conducts substantially all of its operations through the OP, it is structured as what is referred to as an umbrella partnership real estate investment trust UPREIT ). The Corporation, the OP, and its consolidated subsidiaries are collectively referred to as the Company. Prior to February 7, 2020, the Corporation was externally managed by Broadstone Real Estate, LLC BRE and Broadstone Asset Management, LLC (the Asset Manager subject to the direction, oversight, and approval of the Company s board of directors (the Board of Directors ). The Asset Manager was a wholly owned subsidiary of BRE and all of the Corporation s officers were employees of BRE. Accordingly, both BRE and the Asset Manager were related parties of the Company. Refer to Note 3 for further discussion concerning related parties and related party transactions. On February 7, 2020, the Corporation, the OP, BRE, and certain of their respective subsidiaries and affiliates completed through a series of mergers (the Mergers the internalization of the external management functions previously performed for the Corporation and the OP by BRE and the Asset Manager (such transactions, collectively, the Internalization ). Upon consummation of the Internalization, the Company s management team and corporate staff, who were previously employed by BRE, became employees of an indirect subsidiary of the OP and the Company became internally managed. Upon Internalization, the prior Property Management Agreement and Asset Management Agreement (defined in Note 3) were terminated. The Internalization was not considered a Termination Event under the terms of either agreement and therefore fees were paid under them as a result of the Internalization. On September 18, 2020, the Corporation effected a four-for-one stock split on its then outstanding shares of common stock Common Stock that previously had a par value. Concurrent with the stock split, the OP effected a -for-one stock split of its outstanding OP Units. fractional shares or OP Units were issued as a result of the stock split. All historic share and per share amounts in these Consolidated Financial Statements have been adjusted to give retroactive effect to the stock split. On September 21, 2020, the Corporation completed its initial public offering IPO and issued an aggregate of shares of a new class of common stock, par value per share Class A Common Stock at per share, which includes shares issued pursuant to the underwriters partial exercise of their over-allotment option on October 20, 2020, pursuant to a registration statement on Form S-11 (File No. 333-240381), as amended, under the Securities Act of 1933. Shares of Class A Common Stock were listed on the New York Stock Exchange NYSE under the symbol BNL. On March 20, 2021, each share of Class A Common Stock automatically converted into one share of Common Stock, and effective March 22, 2021, all shares of Common Stock were listed and freely tradeable on the NYSE under the symbol BNL. See Note 14.

Acquired above-market and below-market lease values are recorded based on the present value (using an interest rate that reflects the risks associated with the lease acquired) of the differences between the contractual amounts to be paid pursuant to the in-place leases and management s estimate of fair market value lease rates at the time of acquisition for the corresponding in-place leases. The capitalized above-market and below-market lease values are amortized as adjustments to lease revenue over the remaining term of the respective leases. Should a tenant terminate its lease, the unamortized portion of the in-place lease value is charged to amortization expense and the unamortized portion of above-market or below-market lease value is charged to lease revenue. Management estimates the fair value of assumed mortgages payable based upon indications of then-current market pricing for similar types of debt with similar maturities. Assumed mortgages are initially recorded at their estimated fair value as of the assumption date, and the difference between such estimated fair value and the notes outstanding principal balance is amortized to interest expense over the remaining term of the debt. Expenditures for significant betterments and improvements are capitalized. Maintenance and repairs are charged to expense when incurred. 
 impairment charges were recognized other than those described below. If the operating conditions mentioned above deteriorate or if the Company s expected holding period for assets changes, subsequent tests for impairments could result in additional impairment charges in the future. Inputs used in establishing fair value for real estate assets generally fall within Level 3 of the fair value hierarchy, which are characterized as requiring significant judgment as little or no current market activity may be available for validation. The main indicator used to establish the classification of the inputs is current market conditions, as derived through the use of published commercial real estate market information. The Company determines the valuation of impaired assets using generally accepted valuation techniques including discounted cash flow analysis, income capitalization, analysis of recent comparable sales transactions, actual sales negotiations, and bona fide purchase offers received from third parties. Management may consider a single valuation technique or multiple valuation techniques, as appropriate, when estimating the fair value of its real estate. 

Impairment charge 

During the year ended December 31, 2021, the Company executed an early lease termination with an office tenant on two properties in exchange for a fee of million, and simultaneously sold the underlying properties to an unrelated third party for aggregate gross proceeds of million. As the sale of the underlying properties was to an unrelated third party, the Company accounted for the lease termination income and sale of properties as separate transactions in accordance with GAAP. As a result, the million cash receipt was not able to be factored into the properties future undiscounted cash flows, resulting in a million impairment charge in the Consolidated Statements of Income and Comprehensive Income. The Company recognized termination fee income of million as other income from real estate transactions, a component of Lease revenues, net, in the Consolidated Statements of Income and Comprehensive Income. The net impact of the lease termination and the sale of the underlying properties was a million increase to net income after considering certain other adjustments. Remaining impairments recognized during the year ended December 31, 2021 were immaterial. During the year ended December 31, 2020, impairment indicators primarily included changes in the Company s long-term hold strategy with respect to the individual properties, which was due in part to unfavorable market trends resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic in geographic areas where the Company had vacant properties marketed for re-lease or sale. Impairments recognized during the year ended December 31, 2022 were immaterial.

assumption of existing leases or through sale-leaseback transactions, and records such assets at their fair value at the time of acquisition, which in most cases coincides with lease inception. As a result, the Company does not generally recognize selling profit on sales-type leases. The net investment in the sales-type lease represents receivables for the sum of future lease payments and the estimated unguaranteed residual value of the leased property, each measured at net present value. Interest income is recorded over the lease terms so as to produce a constant periodic rate of return on the Company s net investment in the leases. Certain of the Company s lease contracts contain nonlease components e.g. , charges for management fees, common area maintenance, and reimbursement of third-party maintenance expenses) in addition to lease components i.e. , monthly rental charges). Services related to nonlease components are provided over the same period of time as, and billed in the same manner as, monthly rental charges. The Company elected to apply the practical expedient available under ASC 842, for all classes of assets, not to separate the lease components from the nonlease components when accounting for operating leases. Since the lease component is the predominant component under each of these leases, combined revenues from both the lease and nonlease components are reported as Lease revenues, net in the accompanying Consolidated Statements of Income and Comprehensive Income. In accordance with ASC 842, provisions for uncollectible rent are recorded as an offset to Lease revenues, net on the accompanying Consolidated Statements of Income and Comprehensive Income. In April 2020, the FASB staff issued a question and answer document (the Lease Modification Q A that focused on the application of lease accounting guidance to lease concessions provided as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. The Lease Modification Q A allowed the Company to make an accounting policy election to account for COVID-19 related lease concessions as either a lease modification or a negative variable adjustment to rental revenue. Such election was required to be applied consistently to leases with similar characteristics and similar circumstances. In accordance with elections made pursuant to the Lease Modification Q A, straight-line revenue recognized in the financial statements was not impacted for partial rent deferrals that were expected to be repaid within a short period of time, and where there was not a substantial change to the total consideration in the original lease agreement. Deferred rents due under these agreements was recorded as Tenant and other receivables, net in the Consolidated Balance Sheets. 
 
 reporting unit, consistent with its segment reporting analysis, which includes the acquisition, leasing, and ownership of net leased properties (i.e., the consolidated entity). When necessary to perform the quantitative test for goodwill impairment, the Company s estimate of fair value is determined using a market approach, leveraging assumptions such as the fair value of our equity, and consideration of a control premium, if necessary, which includes an analysis of similar market transactions. While the Company believes the assumptions used to estimate the fair value of its reporting unit are reasonable, changes in these assumptions may have a material impact on the Company s financial results. Based on the results of its annual goodwill impairment test on November 30, 2022 and 2021, the Company concluded that goodwill was not impaired. 

million fair value of the shares of common stock and OP Units associated with the third and fourth earnout tranches as of the date of the IPO, was reclassified to equity as a component of Additional paid-in capital and Non-controlling interests on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. At December 31, 2020, the million fair value of shares of common stock and OP Units associated with the first and second earnout tranches was reclassified to equity as a component of Additional paid-in capital and Non-controlling interests on the Consolidated Balance Sheets, as the achievement of 2020 adjusted funds from operations AFFO targets were not met and were no longer applicable. The Company achieved all four milestones applicable to the earnout thereby triggering the payout of all earnout tranches during the year ended December 31, 2021, and therefore no remaining earnout liability existing on, or after, December 31, 2021. 
 
 , , and at December 31, 2022, 2021, and 2020, respectively, by third parties which are accounted for as a separate component of equity. The Company adjusts the carrying value of non-controlling interests to reflect their share of the book value of the OP. Such adjustments are recorded to Additional paid-in capital as a reallocation of Non-controlling interests in the Consolidated Statements of Stockholders Equity and Mezzanine Equity. 
 
 utilizing undiscounted cash flows expected to result from the use of the asset or asset group and its eventual disposition, the Company accounts for a full or partial property loss as an acceleration of depreciation and evaluates whether all or a portion of the property loss can be offset by the recognition of insurance recoveries. Under the terms of the lease agreements with tenants, in the case of full or partial loss to a property, the tenant has an obligation to restore/rebuild the premises as nearly as possible to its value, condition and character immediately prior to such event. To mitigate the risk of loss, the Company requires tenants to maintain general liability insurance policies on the replacement value of the properties. Based on these considerations, the Company follows the guidance in ASC 610-30, Other Income Gains and Losses on Involuntary Conversions, for the conversion of nonmonetary assets i.e. , the properties) to monetary assets i.e. , insurance recoveries or tenant recoveries). Under ASC 610-30, once probable of receipt, the Company recognizes an insurance/tenant recovery receivable in Tenant and other receivables, net, in the Consolidated Balance Sheets, with a corresponding offset to the accelerated depreciation recognized in the Consolidated Statements of Income and Comprehensive Income. If the insurance/tenant recovery is less than the amount of accelerated depreciation recognized, the Company will recognize a net loss in the Consolidated Statements of Income and Comprehensive Income. If the insurance/tenant recovery is greater than the amount of accelerated depreciation recognized, the Company will only recognize a recovery up to the amount of the accelerated depreciation, and will account for the excess as a gain contingency in accordance with ASC 450-30, Gain Contingencies. Gain contingencies are recognized when earned and realized, which typically will occur at the time of final settlement or when non-refundable cash advances are received. 
 
 Recurring Fair Value Measurements Interest Rate Swap Assets and Liabilities The Company measures and records its interest rate swap instruments (see Note 11) and earnout liability at fair value, and discloses the fair value of its long-term debt, on a recurring basis. Interest rate swaps are derivative instruments that have no quoted readily available Level 1 inputs, and therefore are measured at fair value using inputs that are directly observable in active markets and are classified within Level 2 of the valuation hierarchy, using an income approach. Specifically, the fair value of the interest rate swaps is determined using a discounted cash flow analysis on the expected future cash flows of each instrument. This analysis utilizes observable market data including yield curves and implied volatilities to determine the market s expectation of the future cash flows of the variable component. The fixed and variable components of the interest rate swaps are then discounted using calculated discount factors developed based on the overnight indexed swap OIS curve and are aggregated to arrive at a single valuation for the period. The Company also incorporates credit valuation adjustments to appropriately reflect both its own nonperformance risk and the respective counterparty s nonperformance risk in the fair value measurements. Although the Company has determined that the majority of the inputs used to value its interest rate swaps fall within Level 2 of the fair value hierarchy, the credit valuation adjustments associated with its interest rate swaps utilize Level 3 inputs, such as estimates of current credit spreads to evaluate the likelihood of default by itself and its counterparties. At December 31, 2022 and 2021, the Company has assessed the significance of the impact of the credit valuation adjustments on the overall valuation of its derivative positions and has determined that the credit valuation adjustments are not significant to the overall valuation. As a result, the Company has determined that its interest rate swap valuations in their entirety are appropriately classified within Level 2 of the fair value hierarchy. Earnout Liability In connection with the Internalization, the Company recognized an earnout liability that was due and payable to the former owners of BRE if certain milestones were achieved during specified periods of time following the closing of the Internalization (the Earnout Periods ). Under the terms of the agreement, the milestones related to either (a) the 40-day dollar volume-weighted average price of a share of the Company s common stock VWAP per REIT Share ), following the completion of an IPO of the Company s common stock, or (b) the Company s AFFO per share, prior to the completion of an IPO. The Company utilized third-party valuation experts to assist in estimating the fair value of the earnout liability, and developed estimates by considering weighted-average probabilities of likely outcomes, and using a Monte Carlo simulation and discounted cash flow analysis. These estimates required the Company to make various assumptions about share price volatility and, prior to the IPO, about the timing of an IPO and net asset prices, each of which are unobservable and considered Level 3 inputs in the fair value hierarchy. A change in these inputs to a different amount could have resulted in a significantly higher or lower fair value measurement at the reporting date. Specifically, advancements in the estimated IPO date assumption increased the earnout liability s fair value given the earnout s fixed time horizon. Peer share price volatilities were used to estimate the Company s expected share price volatility, and the Company s corresponding ability to achieve the earnout targets. Increases in the volatility assumption would increase the earnout liability s fair value. Increases in net asset values would also increase the earnout liability s fair value. The Company achieved all four volume-weighted average price VWAP milestones applicable to the earnout thereby triggering the payout of all earnout tranches during the year ended December 31, 2021.

Long-term Debt The fair value of the Company s debt was estimated using Level 1, Level 2, and Level 3 inputs based on recent secondary market trades of the Company s 2031 Senior Unsecured Public Notes (see Note 9), recent financing transactions, estimates of the fair value of the property that serves as collateral for such debt, historical risk premiums for loans of comparable quality, current London Interbank Offered Rate LIBOR ), Secured Overnight Financing Rate SOFR ), Canadian Dollar Offered Rate CDOR ), U.S. Treasury obligation interest rates, and discounted estimated future cash payments to be made on such debt. The discount rates estimated reflect the Company s judgment as to the approximate current lending rates for loans or groups of loans with similar maturities and assumes that the debt is outstanding through maturity. Market information, as available, or present value techniques were utilized to estimate the amounts required to be disclosed. Since such amounts are estimates that are based on limited available market information for similar transactions and do not acknowledge transfer or other repayment restrictions that may exist on specific loans, it is unlikely that the estimated fair value of any such debt could be realized by immediate settlement of the obligation. 

Fair value 

Non-recurring Fair Value Measurements The Company s non-recurring fair value measurements at December 31, 2022 and 2021 , consisted of the fair value of impaired real estate assets that were determined using Level 3 inputs. 
 The Company is required to file income tax returns with federal, state, and Canadian taxing authorities. At December 31, 2022, the Company s U.S. federal and state income tax returns remain subject to examination by the respective taxing authorities for the 2019 through 2021 tax years. The Company recognizes and measures uncertain tax positions using a two-step approach. The first step is to evaluate the tax position for recognition by determining if the weight of available evidence indicates it is more-likely-than-not that the position will be sustained upon examination, including resolution of related appeals or litigation processes, if any. In making this assessment, the Company must assume that the taxing authority will examine the income tax position and have full knowledge of all relevant information. The second step is to measure the tax benefit as the largest amount that is likely of being realized upon ultimate settlement. The Company considers many factors when evaluating and estimating tax positions and tax benefits, which may require periodic adjustments and which may or may not accurately forecast actual outcomes. The Company has determined that it has no uncertain tax positions at December 31, 2022 and 2021, or for the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021, and 2020, which include the tax status of the Company. Interest and penalties related to income taxes are charged to tax expense during the year in which they are incurred.

 Upon completion of the Internalization, the Property Management Agreement was terminated and, prospectively, property management fees were longer payable to BRE. The Internalization was not considered a Termination Event under the Property Management Agreement, therefore fees were payable to BRE as a result of the Internalization. See Note 4 for further discussion regarding the Internalization, including the associated payments related thereto. Asset Management Agreement The Corporation and the OP were parties to an asset management agreement (as amended, the Asset Management Agreement with the Asset Manager, a single member limited liability company of which BRE was the sole member, and therefore a related party in which certain directors of the Corporation had an indirect ownership interest. Under the terms of the Asset Management Agreement, the Asset Manager was responsible for, among other things, the Corporation s acquisition, initial leasing, and disposition strategies, financing activities, and providing support to the Corporation s Independent Directors Committee IDC for its valuation functions and other duties. The Asset Manager also nominated two individuals to serve on the Board of Directors of the Corporation.

 (v) of the gross sale price received for each rental property disposition; and 

 (vi) of the Aggregate Consideration, as defined in the Asset Management Agreement, received in connection with a disposition event, as defined in the Asset Management Agreement. 

 Upon completion of the Internalization, the Asset Management Agreement was terminated and, prospectively, asset management fees were no longer payable to the Asset Manager.

The target number of units is based on achieving a rTSR equal to the th percentile of the peer companies and MSCI US REIT Index. Dividends accrue during the measurement period and will be paid on the PRSUs ultimately earned at the end of the measurement period in either cash or common stock, at the direction of the Board of Director s Compensation Committee.

 During the year ended December 31, 2020, the Company issued shares of Common Stock and OP Units, with a total value of approximately million, and earnout consideration with a fair value of million as consideration for the Internalization, and assumed million of debt (see Note 4).

million remaining commitment to fund a building expansion, in exchange for increases in rent contractually scheduled to commence simultaneously upon funding. The Company expects to fulfill the obligation during 2023. The Company had a commitment to fund a building expansion related to a previous acquisition for a total of million as of December 31, 2021, in exchange for an increase in base rent. In June 2022, the Company fulfilled this commitment and the base rent increased accordingly. The Company is a party to three separate tax protection agreements with the contributing members of two distinct UPREIT transactions and to a tax protection agreement in connection with the Internalization. The tax protection agreements require the Company to indemnify the beneficiaries in the event of a sale, exchange, transfer, or other disposal of the contributed property, and in the case of the tax protection agreement entered into in connection with the Internalization, the entire Company, in a taxable transaction that would cause such beneficiaries to recognize a gain that is protected under the agreements, subject to certain exceptions. The Company is required to allocate an amount of nonrecourse liabilities to each beneficiary that is at least equal to the minimum liability amount, as contained in the agreements. The minimum liability amount and the associated allocation of nonrecourse liabilities are calculated in accordance with applicable tax regulations, are completed at the OP level, and do not represent GAAP accounting. Therefore, there is no impact to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Based on values as of December 31, 2022 , taxable sales of the applicable properties would trigger liability under the agreements of approximately million. Based on information available, the Company does not believe that the events resulting in damages as detailed above have occurred or are likely to occur in the foreseeable future. In the normal course of business, the Company enters into various types of commitments to purchase real estate properties. These commitments are generally subject to the Company's customary due diligence process and, accordingly, a number of specific conditions must be met before the Company is obligated to purchase the properties. Obligations Under Leases In October 2022, the Company executed a ten year lease for its new corporate office space that commences in 2023, the timing of which depends on the satisfaction of certain conditions set forth in the lease. The Company has the ability to terminate the lease prior to commencement if certain conditions are not met. If the lease were to commence, the total expected future lease payments would be million. 

 million. On , the Board of Directors declared a quarterly distribution of per share on the Company s common stock and OP Units for the first quarter of 2023, which will be payable on or before to stockholders and unit holders of record as of .

Subsequent to December 31, 2022, the Company executed an early lease termination with an office tenant on a single property in exchange for a fee of million, and simultaneously sold the underlying property to an unrelated third party for total proceeds of million. The carrying value of the property was approximately million, resulting in a gain on sale of real estate of approximately million after selling costs. As the sale was to an unrelated third party, the Company accounted for the lease termination and sale as separate transactions in accordance with GAAP. Aggregate gross proceeds from the two transactions amounted to million.

As of and for the year ended December 31, 2022, we carried out an evaluation of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures, under the supervision and with the participation of management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer. Based on the foregoing, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective and were operating at a reasonable assurance level. 
 Management s Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting 
 Our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting, as such term is defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Exchange Act. Internal control over financial reporting is a process to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of our financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with GAAP. Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting is not intended to provide absolute assurance that a misstatement of our financial statements would be prevented or detected. 
 Under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, we conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting based on the framework in Internal Control Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. Based on this evaluation, management has concluded that our internal control over financial reporting was effective as of December 31, 2022. 
 The effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2022 has been audited by Deloitte Touche LLP, an independent registered public accounting firm, as stated in their report in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. 
 Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM 
 To the stockholders and the Board of Directors of Broadstone Net Lease, Inc. 
 Opinion on Internal Control over Financial Reporting 
 We have audited the internal control over financial reporting of Broadstone Net Lease, Inc. and subsidiaries (the Company as of December 31, 2022, based on criteria established in Internal Control Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO). In our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2022, based on criteria established in Internal Control Integrated Framework (2013) issued by COSO. 
 We have also audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the consolidated financial statements as of and for the year ended December 31, 2022, of the Company and our report dated February 23, 2023, expressed an unqualified opinion on those financial statements. 
 Basis for Opinion 
 The Company s management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in the accompanying Management's Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company s internal control over financial reporting based on our audit. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. 
 We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk, and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion. 
 Definition and Limitations of Internal Control over Financial Reporting 
 A company s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements. 
 Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

The number of shares subject to the restricted stock award will be determined by dividing the applicable pro-rated Annual Equity Grant Value by the average closing price of a share of the Company s common stock over the 15 trading days preceding and ending on the date of grant rounded down to the nearest whole share. The initial restricted stock award will vest on the date of next annual meeting of stockholders following the Non-Employee Director s appointment.
