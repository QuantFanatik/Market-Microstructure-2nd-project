1. Business 

The
purpose of the abrdn Palladium ETF Trust (known as Aberdeen Standard Palladium ETF Trust prior to March 31, 2022) (the Trust is to own palladium transferred to the Trust in exchange for shares issued by the Trust Shares ). Each Share represents
a fractional undivided beneficial interest in and ownership of the Trust. The assets of the Trust consist solely of palladium
bullion. The Trust was formed on December 30, 2009 when an initial deposit of palladium was made in exchange for the issuance
of two Baskets (a Basket consists of 50,000 Shares). 

The
sponsor of the Trust is abrdn ETFs Sponsor LLC (known as Aberdeen Standard ETFs Sponsor LLC prior to March 1, 2022) (the Sponsor ).
The trustee of the Trust is The Bank of New York Mellon (the Trustee and the custodian is JPMorgan Chase Bank N.A.,
London Branch (the Custodian ). 

The
Trust s Shares at redeemable value decreased from 357,971,468 at December 31, 2021 to 295,490,794 at December 31, 2022,
the Trust s fiscal year end. Outstanding Shares in the Trust decreased from 1,950,000 Shares at December 31, 2021 to 1,800,000
Shares at December 31, 2022. 

The
Trust is not managed like a corporation or an active investment vehicle. The Trust has no directors, officers or employees. It
does not engage in any activities designed to obtain a profit from or to improve the losses caused by changes in the price of palladium.
The palladium held by the Trust will only be delivered to pay the remuneration due to the Sponsor (the Sponsor s
Fee ), distributed to Authorized Participants (defined below) in connection with the redemption of Baskets or sold (1) on
an as-needed basis to pay Trust expenses not assumed by the Sponsor, (2) in the event the Trust terminates and liquidates its
assets, or (3) as otherwise required by law or regulation. 

The
Trust is not registered as an investment company under the Investment Company Act of 1940 and is not required to register under
such act. The Trust does not and will not hold or trade in commodities futures contracts, commodity interests or
any other instruments regulated by the Commodity Exchange Act (the CEA ), as administered by the Commodity Futures
Trading Commission (the CFTC and the National Futures Association NFA ). The Trust is not a commodity
pool for purposes of the CEA and the Shares are not commodity interests, and neither the Sponsor nor the Trustee
is subject to regulation as a commodity pool operator or a commodity trading advisor in connection with the Shares. The Trust
has no fixed termination date. 

The
Sponsor of the registrant maintains an Internet website at www.abrdn.com/us/etf through which the registrant s annual reports
on Form 10-K, quarterly reports on Form 10-Q, and amendments to those reports filed or furnished pursuant to Section 13(a) or
15(d) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, or the Exchange Act, are made available free of charge as soon as reasonably
practicable after they have been filed or furnished to the Securities and Exchange Commission (the SEC ). Additional
information regarding the Trust may also be found on the SEC s EDGAR database at www.sec.gov. 

Trust
Objective 

The
investment objective of the Trust is for the Shares to reflect the performance of the price of physical palladium bullion,
less the Trust s expenses. The Shares are intended to constitute a simple and cost-effective means of making an investment
similar to an investment in physical palladium. An investment in physical palladium requires expensive and sometimes complicated
arrangements in connection with the assay, transportation, warehousing and insurance of the metal. Traditionally, such expense
and complications have resulted in investments in physical palladium being efficient only in amounts beyond the reach of
many investors. 

3 

The
Shares are intended to provide institutional and retail investors with a simple and cost-efficient means, with minimal credit
risk, of gaining investment benefits similar to those of holding palladium bullion. The Shares offer an investment that: 

Easily
Accessible and Relatively Cost Effective . Investors can access the palladium bullion market through a traditional brokerage
account. The Sponsor believes that investors will be able to more effectively implement strategic and tactical asset allocation
strategies that use palladium bullion by using the Shares instead of using the traditional means of purchasing, trading and
holding palladium bullion and for many investors, transaction costs related to the Shares will be lower than those associated
with the purchase, storage and insurance of physical palladium bullion. 

Exchange
Traded and Transparent. The Shares trade on the NYSE Arca, providing investors with an efficient means to implement various
investment strategies. The Shares are eligible for margin accounts and are backed by the assets of the Trust and the Trust does
not hold or employ any derivative securities. Furthermore, the value of the Trust s holdings are reported on the Trust s
website daily. 

Minimal Credit Risk . The Shares represent an interest in physical palladium owned by the Trust (other than an amount
held in unallocated form which is not sufficient to make up a whole plate or ingot of which is held temporarily to effect
a creation or redemption of Shares). Physical palladium of the Trust in the Custodian s possession is not subject to
borrowing arrangements with third parties. Other than the palladium temporarily being held in an unallocated palladium
account with the Custodian, the physical palladium of the Trust is not subject to counterparty or credit risks. See Risk
Factors Palladium held in the Trust s unallocated palladium account and any Authorized Participant s unallocated palladium
account is not segregated from the Custodian s assets... This contrasts with most other financial products that
gain exposure to palladium through the use of derivatives that are subject to counterparty and credit risks. 

Investing
in the Shares does not insulate the investor from certain risks, including price volatility. See Risk Factors. 

Overview
of the Palladium Industry 

This
section provides a brief introduction to the palladium industry by looking at some of the key participants, detailing the primary
sources of demand and supply. 

In
this annual report, the term ounces refers to troy ounces. 

Platinum Group
Metals 

Platinum
and palladium are the two best known metals of the six platinum group metals PGMs ). Platinum and palladium have
the greatest economic importance and are found in the largest quantities. The other four iridium, rhodium, ruthenium and
osmium are produced only as co-products of platinum and palladium. 

PGMs
are found primarily in South Africa and Russia. South Africa is the world s leading platinum producer and one of the largest
palladium producers. Russia is the largest producer of palladium and most production is concentrated in the Norilsk region. All
of South Africa s production is sourced from the Bushveld Igneous Complex, which hosts the world s largest resource
of PGMs. Together, South Africa and Russia accounted for over 78 of palladium supply in 2021.

The
following are some of the main characteristics of the palladium market illustrated by the table: 

Russia has traditionally been the largest producer of palladium, providing
on average 41 of supply over the past 10 years. South Africa has, on average, supplied approximately 37 of production over the past
10 years. In 2021, Russia provided 39.6 of mine supplies, while South Africa produced 39 . North America contributed approximately 13 
of mine supply in 2021. Scrap supply, from recycling of autocatalyst and other sources, has accounted for an average of roughly 32 of
total supply over the last 5 years, up from 26 in 2012. Autocatalysts continue to be the largest component of palladium demand, representing
nearly 83 of total demand in 2021, down from a high of 85 of total demand in 2020. Jewelry demand for palladium has tapered off considerably
over the last 10 years, contributing only 0.9 of total demand in 2021, down from a high of 4.5 in 2012 . Other industrial demand (chemical,
dental and electrical) has fallen from 22.4 of total demand in 2012 to 14.4 of total demand in 2021. Since 2017 pollution control demand
has increased from 0.8 to 1 of total demand. Pollution control demand captures the production demand for emissions control in non-automotive
applications. 

Historical
Chart of the Price of Palladium 

The
price of palladium is volatile and fluctuations are expected to have a direct impact on the value of the Shares. However, movements
in the price of palladium in the past are not a reliable indicator of future movements. The following chart illustrates the movements
in the price of an ounce of palladium in U.S. Dollars from December 31, 2012 to December 31, 2022 and is based on information
provided by Bloomberg: 

Source: Bloomberg, abrdn. Chart data from 12/31/2012 to 12/31/2022.
Palladium Price = PLDMLNPM Index. 

Rising palladium prices tempered in 2011, but concerns over supply
shortages due to labor problems at mines in South Africa and dwindling Russian stocks provided some price support into mid-2012. Palladium
rose to a 13 year high of 907 per ounce in September 2014, a 27 increase from the start of the year. The rally was driven by supply
side concerns following the longest strike in South African mining history and escalating tensions between Russia and Ukraine. The strong
rally in 2014 was completely unwound in 2015, when South African mine supply resumed back to pre-strike levels and pessimism about industrial
demand in China overwhelmed the true tightness in the market. Palladium was then the top performer of the precious metals complex for
3 consecutive years from 2017 to 2019, where it rose nearly 182 from 676 per troy ounce on December 31, 2016 to 1,905 per troy ounce
on December 31, 2019. The price of palladium reached an all-time high of 2,781/oz on February 19, 2020, before closing out the year at
a price of 2,342/oz on December 31, 2020. Similar to other precious metals, palladium took a step back in 2021 as it returned -16 (as
of December 31, 2021). A decline in autocatalyst demand due to the pandemic was a big reason for the negative performance seen during
the year. 

 The price of Palladium reached a record high of 3,015 per ounce
on March 7, 2022, as Russian s invasion of Ukraine infused uncertainty into global markets and created additional price pressure
that pushed the price of palladium nearly 53 above its 2021 close. While each of the precious metals (Gold, Silver, Platinum) saw prices
fluctuate throughout the year, the price of palladium showed greater correlation with the price of Platinum during the first quarter.
The price of palladium fell by roughly 25 between March 8 th and March 31 st , ending the first quarter at a price
of 2,259 per ounce. On June 14 th , 2022 the price of palladium fell as low as 1,810 per ounce, as aggressive interest rate
policies from the U.S. Federal Reserve drove the U.S. Dollar higher. Contrary to the other three precious metals, the price of palladium
increased as high as 2,315 per ounce on October 4 th , 2022, as supplies were further constrained by operational challenges
in South African and North American mines, as well as a weaker automotive recycling market. Throughout the year, tailwinds from supply
disruptions were countered by weaker automotive and investment demand, higher interest rates and the risk of a potential recession. As
a result, while the other three precious metals rallied to end the year, the price of palladium reversed course during the fourth quarter
to end the year at 1,775 per ounce, down 10 from the end of 2021. 

Operation
of the Palladium Bullion Market 

The
global trade in palladium consists of Over-the-Counter OTC transactions in spot, forwards, and options and
other derivatives, together with exchange-traded futures and options. 

Global
Over-The-Counter Market 

The
OTC market trades on a 24-hour per day continuous basis and accounts for most global palladium trading. Market makers, as well
as others in the OTC market, trade with each other and with their clients on a principal-to-principal basis. All risks and issues
of credit are between the parties directly involved in the transaction. Market makers include the market-making members of the
London Platinum and Palladium Market LPPM ), the trade association that acts as the coordinator for activities conducted
on behalf of its members and other participants in the LPPM. Five member participants of the LPPM are currently participating
in the electronic LME PM fix process (as described below) administered by the London Metal Exchange LME ). The OTC
market provides a relatively flexible market in terms of quotes, price, size, destinations for delivery and other factors. Bullion
dealers customize transactions to meet clients requirements. The OTC market has no formal structure and no open-outcry
meeting place. The main centers of the OTC market are London, New York, Hong Kong and Zurich. Mining companies, manufacturers
of jewelry and industrial products, together with investors and speculators, tend to transact their business through one of these
market centers. Centers such as Dubai and several cities in the Far East also transact substantial OTC market business, typically
involving jewelry and small plates or ingots (1 kilogram or less) and will hedge their exposure by selling into one of these main
OTC centers. Precious metals dealers have offices around the world and most of the world s major bullion dealers are either
members or associate members of the London Bullion Market Association LBMA and/or the LPPM. In the OTC market,
the standard size of palladium trades between market makers is 1,000 ounces. Liquidity in the OTC market can vary from time to
time during the course of the 24-hour trading day. Fluctuations in liquidity are reflected in adjustments to dealing spreads the
differential between a dealer s buy and sell prices. The period of greatest liquidity in the
palladium market generally occurs at the time of day when trading in the European time zones overlaps with trading in the United
States, which is when OTC market trading in London, New York, Zurich and other centers coincides with futures and options trading
on the Commodity Exchange, Inc. COMEX ), a designated contract market within the CME Group. This period lasts for
approximately four hours each New York business day morning.

The
Zurich and London Palladium Bullion Markets 

Although
the market for physical palladium is distributed globally, most palladium is stored and most OTC market trades are cleared through
Zurich. As of September 1, 2009, London also serves as a center for the clearing of OTC trades in palladium. In addition to coordinating
market activities, the LPPM acts as the principal point of contact between the market and its regulators. A primary function of
the LPPM is its involvement in the promotion of refining standards by maintenance of the London/Zurich Good Delivery Lists, 
which are the lists of LPPM accredited refiners of palladium. The LPPM also coordinates market clearing and vaulting, promotes
good trading practices and develops standard documentation. 

Palladium
is traded generally on a loco Zurich basis, meaning the precious metal is physically held in vaults in Zurich or is transferred
into accounts established in Zurich. As of September 1, 2009, palladium began trading on a loco London basis as well, meaning
that the precious metal is physically held in vaults in London or is transferred into accounts established in London. The basis
for settlement and delivery of a loco Zurich spot trade is payment (generally in U.S. Dollars) two business days after the trade
date against delivery. Delivery of the palladium can either be by physical delivery or through the clearing systems to an unallocated
account. 

The
unit of trade in London and Zurich is the troy ounce, whose conversion between grams is: 1,000 grams equals 32.1507465 troy ounces,
and one troy ounce equals 31.1034768 grams. A good delivery palladium plate or ingot on the LPPM approved list is acceptable for
delivery in settlement of a transaction on the OTC market (a Good Delivery Plate or Ingot ). A Good Delivery Plate
or Ingot must contain between 32 and 192 troy ounces of palladium with a minimum fineness (or purity) of 999.5 parts per 1,000
(99.95 ), be of good appearance, and be easy to handle and stack. The palladium content of a palladium plate or ingot is calculated
by multiplying the gross weight by the fineness of the plate or ingot. A Good Delivery Plate or Ingot must also bear the stamp
of one of the refiners who are on the LPPM approved list. Unless otherwise specified, the palladium spot price always refers to
that of Good Delivery Standards set by the LPPM. Business is generally conducted over the phone and through electronic
dealing systems. 

Since
December 1, 2014, the LME has been administering the operation of electronic palladium bullion price fixing systems LMEbullion that replicate electronically the manual London palladium fix processes previously employed by the London Platinum and Palladium
Fixing Company Ltd LPPFCL as well as providing electronic market clearing processes for palladium bullion transactions
at the fixed prices established by the LME pricing mechanism. The LME s electronic price fixing processes, like the previous
London palladium fix processes, establishes and publishes fixed prices for troy ounces of palladium twice each London trading
day during fixing sessions beginning at 9:45 a.m. London time (the LME AM Fix) and 2:00 p.m. London time (the LME PM Fix). In
addition to utilizing the same London palladium fix standards and methods, the LME also supervises the palladium electronic price
fixing processes through its market operations, compliance, internal audit and third-party complaint handling capabilities in
order to support the integrity of the LME PM Fix. The LME, in administering LMEbullion, uses a pricing methodology that meets
the administrative and regulatory needs of palladium market participants, including the International Organization of Securities
Commission s (IOSCO) Principles for Financial Benchmarks, (the "IOSCO Principles"). 

Daily
during London trading hours the LME AM Fix and the LME PM Fix each provide reference palladium prices for that day s trading.
Many long-term contracts will be priced on the basis of either the LME AM Fix or the LME PM Fix, and market participants will
usually refer to one or the other of these prices when looking for a basis for valuations. The Trust values its palladium on the
basis of the LME PM Fix. 

6 

Formal
participation in the LME PM Fix is limited to participating LPPM members. Five LPPM members are currently participating in establishing
the LME PM Fix (Goldman Sachs International, HSBC Bank USA NA, ICBC Standard Bank plc, Johnson Matthey plc and BASF Metals Ltd.).
Any other market participant wishing to participate in the trading on the LME PM Fix is required to do so through one of the participating
LPPM members. 

Orders
are placed either with one of the participating LPPM member participants or with another precious metals dealer who will then
be in contact with a participating LPPM member during the fixing. The fix begins with the chair reflecting the market price and
other data, prevailing at the opening of the fix. This is relayed by the LPPM member participants to their dealing rooms which
have direct communication with all interested parties. Any market member may enter the fixing process at any time, or adjust or
withdraw his order. The palladium price is adjusted up or down until all the buy and sell orders are electronically matched, at
which time the price is declared fixed. All fixing orders are transacted on the basis of this fixed price, which is instantly
relayed to the market through various media. 

The
LBMA and the LME have asserted that the LME s electronic price fixing processes are similar to the non-electronic processes
previously used to establish the applicable London palladium fix where the London palladium fix process adjusted the palladium
price up or down until all the buy and sell orders entered by the participating LPPM members are matched, at which time the price
was declared fixed. Nevertheless, the LME PM Fix has several advantages over the previous London palladium fix. The LME s
electronic price fixing processes are intended to be transparent. The LME asserts that its electronic price fixing processes are
fully auditable by third parties since an audit trail exists from the beginning of each fixing session. The LME also asserts that
the market operation, compliance, internal audit and third-party complaint handling capabilities of the LME will support the integrity
of the LME PM Fix. 

Since
December 1, 2014, the Sponsor determined that the London palladium fix, which has been revised based on the new LME method and
is now known as the LME PM Fix, is an appropriate basis for valuing palladium bullion received upon purchase of the Trust s
Shares, delivered upon redemption of the Trust s Shares and for determining the value of the Trust s palladium bullion
each trading day. The Sponsor also has determined that the LME PM Fix will fairly represent the commercial value of palladium
bullion held by the Trust and, the Benchmark Price (as defined in the Trust Agreement) of the Trust s palladium
bullion as of any day is the LME PM Fix for such day. 

As
of December 1, 2014, the LPPFCL transferred ownership of the historic and future intellectual property of the twice daily fix 
for platinum and palladium bullion to a subsidiary company of the LBMA. 

Futures
Exchanges 

The
most significant palladium futures exchanges are the COMEX, a designated contract market within the CME Group, and the Tokyo Commodity Exchange TOCOM ). The COMEX
is the largest exchange in the world for trading precious metals futures and options and launched palladium futures in 1968, followed
with options in 2010. The TOCOM has been trading palladium since 1992. Trading on these exchanges is based on fixed delivery dates
and transaction sizes for the futures and options contracts traded. Trading costs are negotiable. As a matter of practice, only
a small percentage of the futures market turnover ever comes to physical delivery of the palladium represented by the contracts
traded. Both exchanges permit trading on margin. Margin trading can add to the speculative risk involved given the potential for
margin calls if the price moves against the contract holder. The COMEX trades palladium futures almost continuously (with one
short break in the evening) through its CME Globex electronic trading system and clears through its central clearing system. On
June 6, 2003, the TOCOM adopted a similar clearing system. In each case, the exchange acts as a counterparty for each member for
clearing purposes. 

7 

Market
Regulation 

The
global palladium markets are overseen and regulated by both governmental and self-regulatory organizations. In addition,
certain trade associations have established rules and protocols for market practices and participants. In the United Kingdom,
responsibility for the regulation of the financial market participants, including the major participating members of the LPPM
falls under the authority of the Financial Conduct Authority FCA as provided by the Financial Services
and Markets Act 2000 FSM Act ). Under this act, all UK-based banks, together with other investment firms, are subject
to a range of requirements, including fitness and properness, capital adequacy, liquidity, and systems and controls. 

The
FCA is responsible for regulating investment products, including derivatives, and those who deal in investment products. Regulation
of spot, commercial forwards, and deposits of palladium not covered by the FSM Act is provided for by The London Code of
Conduct for Non-Investment Products, which was established by market participants in conjunction with the Bank of England. 

The
TOCOM has authority to perform financial and operational surveillance on its members trading activities, scrutinize positions
held by members and large-scale customers, and monitor the price movements of futures markets by comparing them with cash and
other derivative markets prices. To act as a Futures Commission Merchant Broker on the TOCOM, a broker must obtain a license
from Japan s Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry METI ), the regulatory authority that oversees the operations
of the TOCOM. 

The
CFTC regulates trading in commodity contracts, such as futures, options and swaps. In addition, under the CEA, the CFTC has jurisdiction
to prosecute manipulation and fraud in any commodity (including precious metals) traded in interstate commerce as spot as well
as deliverable forwards. The CFTC is the exclusive regulator of U.S. commodity exchanges and clearing houses. 

Secondary
Market Trading 

While
the Trust s investment objective is for the Shares to reflect the performance of palladium bullion, less the expenses of
the Trust, the Shares may trade in the secondary market on the NYSE Arca at prices that are lower or higher relative to their net
asset value (the value of the Trust s assets less its liabilities NAV )) per Share. The amount of the discount
or premium in the trading price relative to the NAV per Share may be influenced by non-concurrent trading hours between the NYSE
Arca, COMEX and the London and Zurich palladium markets. While the Shares trade on the NYSE Arca until 4:00 PM New York time,
liquidity in the global palladium market is reduced after the close of the COMEX at 1:30 PM New York time. As a result, during
this time, trading spreads, and the resulting premium or discount, on the Shares may widen. 

Valuation
of Palladium and Computation of Net Asset Value 

On
each day that the NYSE Arca is open for regular trading, as promptly as practicable after 4:00 p.m., New York time, on such day
(the Evaluation Time ), the Trustee evaluates the palladium held by the Trust and determines both the adjusted net
asset value ANAV and the NAV of the Trust. For the purposes of making these calculations, a business day means
any day other than a day when NYSE Arca is closed for regular trading. 

At
the Evaluation Time, the Trustee values the Trust s palladium on the basis of that day s LME PM Fix or, if no LME
PM Fix is made on such day, the next most recent LME PM Fix determined prior to the Evaluation Time will be used, unless the Sponsor
determines that such price is inappropriate as a basis for evaluation. In the event the Sponsor determines that the LME PM Fix
or such other publicly available price as the Sponsor may deem fairly represents the commercial value of the Trust s palladium
is not an appropriate basis for evaluation of the Trust s palladium, it shall identify an alternative basis for such evaluation
to be employed by the Trustee. Neither the Trustee nor the Sponsor shall be liable to any person for the determination that the
LME PM Fix or such other publicly available price is not appropriate as a basis for evaluation of the Trust s palladium
or for any determination as to the alternative basis for such evaluation provided that such determination is made in good faith.
See Operation of the Palladium Market The Zurich and London Palladium Bullion Markets for a description
of the LME PM Fix. 

Once
the value of the palladium has been determined, the Trustee subtracts all estimated accrued but unpaid fees (other than
the fees accruing for such day on which the valuation takes place which are computed by reference to the value of the Trust or
its assets), expenses and other liabilities of the Trust from the total value of the palladium and any other assets of the
Trust. The resulting figure is the ANAV of the Trust. The ANAV of the Trust is used to compute the Sponsor s Fee. 

8 

All
fees accruing for the day on which the valuation takes place which are computed by reference to the value of the Trust or
its assets are calculated using the ANAV calculated for such day. The Trustee subtracts from the ANAV the amount of accrued fees
so computed for such day and the resulting figure is the NAV of the Trust. The Trustee also determines the NAV per Share
by dividing the NAV of the Trust by the number of the Shares outstanding as of the close of trading on the NYSE Arca (which includes
the net number of any Shares created or redeemed on such evaluation day). 

Any
estimate of the accrued but unpaid fees, expenses and liabilities of the Trust for purposes of computing the NAV of the Trust
and ANAV made by the Trustee in good faith shall be conclusive upon all persons interested in the Trust and no revision or correction
in any computation made under the Trust Agreement will be required by reason of any difference in amounts estimated from those
actually paid. 

The
Sponsor and the Shareholders may rely on any evaluation furnished by the Trustee, and the Sponsor has no responsibility for the
evaluation s accuracy. The determinations the Trustee makes will be made in good faith upon the basis of, and the Trustee
will not be liable for any errors contained in, information reasonably available to it. The Trustee will not be liable to the
Sponsor, DTC, Authorized Participants, the Shareholders or any other person for errors in judgment. However, the preceding liability
exclusion will not protect the Trustee against any liability resulting from bad faith or gross negligence in the performance of
its duties. 

Trust
Expenses 

The
Trust s only ordinary recurring expense is the Sponsor s Fee. In exchange for the Sponsor s Fee, the Sponsor
has agreed to assume the following administrative and marketing expenses incurred by the Trust: the Trustee s monthly fee
and out-of-pocket expenses, the Custodian s fee and reimbursement of the Custodian s expenses under the Custody Agreements,
Exchange listing fees, SEC registration fees, printing and mailing costs, audit fees and up to 100,000 per annum in legal expenses.
The Sponsor also paid the costs of the Trust s organization and the initial sale of the Shares, including the applicable SEC registration
fees. 

The
Sponsor s Fee accrues daily at an annualized rate equal to 0.60 of the ANAV of the Trust and is payable monthly in arrears.
The Sponsor, from time to time, may temporarily waive all or a portion of the Sponsor s Fee at its discretion for a stated
period of time. Presently, the Sponsor does not intend to waive any of its fee. 

Furthermore,
the Sponsor may, in its sole discretion, agree to rebate all or a portion of the Sponsor s Fee attributable to Shares held
by institutional investors subject to minimum shareholding and lock up requirements as determined by the Sponsor to foster stability
in the Trust s asset levels. Any such rebate will be subject to negotiation and written agreement between the Sponsor and
the investor on a case by case basis. The Sponsor is under no obligation to provide any rebates of the Sponsor s Fee. Neither
the Trust nor the Trustee will be a party to any Sponsor s Fee rebate arrangements negotiated by the Sponsor. Any Sponsor s
Fee rebate shall be paid from the funds of the Sponsor and not from the assets of the Trust. 

The
Sponsor s Fee is paid by delivery of palladium to an account maintained by the Custodian for the Sponsor on an unallocated
basis, monthly on the first business day of the month in respect of fees payable for the prior month. The delivery is of that
number of ounces of palladium which equals the daily accrual of the Sponsor s Fee for such prior month calculated at the
LME PM Fix. 

The
Trustee will, when directed by the Sponsor, and, in the absence of such direction, may, in its discretion, sell palladium
in such quantity and at such times as may be necessary to permit payment in cash of Trust expenses not assumed by the Sponsor.
The Trustee is authorized to sell palladium at such times and in the smallest amounts required to permit such payments as
they become due, it being the intention to avoid or minimize the Trust s holdings of assets other than palladium. Accordingly,
the amount of palladium to be sold will vary from time to time depending on the level of the Trust s expenses and the
market price of palladium. The Custodian is authorized to purchase from the Trust, at the request of the Trustee, palladium
needed to cover Trust expenses not assumed by the Sponsor at the price used by the Trustee to determine the value of the palladium
held by the Trust on the date of the sale. 

9 

The
Sponsor s Fee for the year ended December 31, 2022 was 2,226,662 (December 31, 2021: 2,447,225; December 31, 2020: 2,012,865). 

Cash
held by the Trustee pending payment of the Trust s expenses will not bear any interest. Each delivery or sale of palladium by
the Trust to pay the Sponsor s Fee of other Trust expenses will be a taxable event to Shareholders. 

Creation
and Redemption of Shares 

The
Trust creates and redeems Shares from time to time, but only in one or more Baskets. Prior to April 1, 2019, the number of Shares
that constituted a Basket was 50,000 Shares. Effective April 1, 2019, the Basket size was decreased to 25,000 Shares. The
creation and redemption of Baskets is only made in exchange for the delivery to the Trust or the distribution by the Trust of
the amount of palladium represented by the Baskets being created or redeemed, the amount of which is based on the combined
NAV of the number of Shares included in the Baskets being created or redeemed determined on the day the order to create or redeem
Baskets is properly received. 

Authorized
Participants are the only persons that may place orders to create and redeem Baskets. Authorized Participants must be (1) registered
broker-dealers or other securities market participants, such as banks and other financial institutions, which are not required
to register as broker-dealers to engage in securities transactions, and (2) participants in DTC. To become an Authorized Participant,
a person must enter into an Authorized Participant Agreement with the Sponsor and the Trustee. The Authorized Participant Agreement
provides the procedures for the creation and redemption of Baskets and for the delivery of the palladium and any cash required
for such creations and redemptions. The Authorized Participant Agreement and the related procedures attached thereto may be amended
by the Trustee and the Sponsor, without the consent of any Shareholder or Authorized Participant. Authorized Participants pay
a transaction fee of 500 to the Trustee for each order they place to create or redeem one or more Baskets. Authorized Participants
who make deposits with the Trust in exchange for Baskets receive no fees, commissions or other form of compensation or inducement
of any kind from either the Sponsor or the Trust for serving as an Authorized Participant, and no such person has any obligation
or responsibility to the Sponsor or the Trust to effect any sale or resale of Shares. 

Authorized
Participants are cautioned that some of their activities will result in their being deemed participants in a distribution in a
manner which would render them statutory underwriters and subject them to the prospectus-delivery and liability provisions of
the Securities Act. 

Prior
to initiating any creation or redemption order, an Authorized Participant must have entered into an agreement with the Custodian
or a palladium clearing bank to establish an Authorized Participant Unallocated Account in London or Zurich Authorized
Participant Unallocated Bullion Account Agreement ). Palladium held in Authorized Participant Unallocated Accounts is
typically not segregated from the Custodian s or other palladium clearing bank s assets, as a consequence of
which an Authorized Participant will have no proprietary interest in any specific plates or ingots of palladium held by the
Custodian or the clearing bank. Credits to its Authorized Participant Unallocated Account are therefore at risk of the Custodian s
or other palladium clearing bank s insolvency. No fees will be charged by the Custodian for the use of the Authorized
Participant Unallocated Account as long as the Authorized Participant Unallocated Account is used solely for palladium transfers
to and from the Trust Unallocated Account and the Custodian (or one of its affiliates) receives compensation for maintaining the
Trust Allocated Account. Authorized Participants should be aware that the Custodian s liability threshold under the Authorized
Participant Unallocated Bullion Account Agreement is generally gross negligence, not negligence, which is the Custodian s
liability threshold under the Trust s Custody Agreements. 

10 

As
the terms of the Authorized Participant Unallocated Bullion Account Agreement differ in certain respects from the terms of the
Trust Unallocated Account Agreement, potential Authorized Participants should review the terms of the Authorized Participant Unallocated
Bullion Account Agreement carefully. A copy of the Authorized Participant Agreement may be obtained by potential Authorized Participants
from the Trustee. 

Certain
Authorized Participants are expected to have the facility to participate directly in the physical palladium market and the palladium futures
markets. In some cases, an Authorized Participant may from time to time acquire palladium from or sell palladium to
its affiliated palladium trading desk, which may profit in these instances. Each Authorized Participant must be registered
as a broker-dealer under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 Exchange Act and regulated by FINRA or be exempt from
being or otherwise not be required to be so regulated or registered, and be qualified to act as a broker or dealer in the
states or other jurisdictions where the nature of its business so requires. Certain Authorized Participants are regulated under
federal and state banking laws and regulations. Each Authorized Participant has its own set of rules and procedures, internal
controls and information barriers as it determines is appropriate in light of its own regulatory regime. 

Authorized
Participants may act for their own accounts or as agents for broker-dealers, custodians and other securities market participants
that wish to create or redeem Baskets. An order for one or more Baskets may be placed by an Authorized Participant on behalf of
multiple clients. As of the date of this report, Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC, Goldman Sachs Co. LLC, HSBC Securities
(USA) Inc., J.P. Morgan Securities LLC, Merrill Lynch Professional Clearing Corp., Mizuho Securities USA LLC, Morgan Stanley
 Co. LLC, Scotia Capital (USA) Inc., UBS Securities LLC and Virtu Americas, LLC have each signed an Authorized
Participant Agreement with the Trust and, upon the effectiveness of such agreement, may create and redeem Baskets as described
above. Persons interested in purchasing Baskets should contact the Sponsor or the Trustee to obtain the contact information for
the Authorized Participants. Shareholders who are not Authorized Participants will only be able to redeem their Shares
through an Authorized Participant. 

All palladium will
be delivered to the Trust and distributed by the Trust in unallocated form through credits and debits between Authorized
Participant Unallocated Accounts and the Trust Unallocated Account. Palladium transferred from an Authorized Participant
Unallocated Account to the Trust in unallocated form will first be credited to the Trust Unallocated Account. Thereafter, the
Custodian will allocate, or cause the allocation by the Zurich Sub-Custodian of, specific plates or ingots of palladium, in each
case representing the amount of palladium credited to the Trust Unallocated Account (to the extent such amount is representable
by palladium plates or ingots) to the Trust Allocated Account. The movement of palladium is reversed for the distribution
of palladium to an Authorized Participant in connection with the redemption of Baskets. 

All
physical palladium represented by a credit to any Authorized Participant Unallocated Account and to the Trust Unallocated
Account and all physical palladium held in the Trust Allocated Account with the Custodian or for the Custodian by the Zurich
Sub-Custodian must be of at least a minimum fineness (or purity) of 999.5 parts per 1,000 (99.95 and otherwise conform to the
rules, regulations practices and customs of the LPPM, including the specifications for a Good Delivery Palladium Plate or Ingot. 

Under
the Authorized Participant Agreement, the Sponsor has agreed to indemnify the Authorized Participants against certain liabilities,
including liabilities under the Securities Act. 

Loco
London Loco Zurich Palladium Delivery Elections. 

Authorized
Participants can elect to deliver palladium loco London or loco Zurich in connection with the creation of a Basket. Authorized
Participants can also elect to receive delivery of palladium loco London or loco Zurich in connection with the redemption of a
Basket. A Basket creation order that elects a loco London or loco Zurich delivery of palladium will cause the Custodian to effect
an allocation of such palladium to the Trust Allocated Account maintained by the Custodian in its London vault premises or by
the Zurich Sub-Custodian in its Zurich vault premises. Likewise, a Basket redemption order that elects a loco London or loco Zurich
delivery of palladium will cause the Custodian to effect a de-allocation of palladium necessary to satisfy such redemption requests
from the Trust Allocated Account maintained by the Custodian to the Trust Unallocated Account. 

11 

In
the event that there is not sufficient palladium in the Trust Allocated Account in London to satisfy loco London
redemptions, the Custodian shall cause the Zurich Sub-Custodian to de-allocate sufficient palladium held in the Trust
Allocated Account in Zurich and cause a transfer of palladium from the Trust Unallocated Account maintained by the Custodian
in Zurich to the Authorized Participant Unallocated Account maintained in London. Likewise, in the event that there is not
sufficient palladium in the Trust Allocated Account in Zurich to satisfy loco Zurich redemptions, the Custodian will initiate
the reverse procedure to transfer palladium from London to Zurich. These transfers between London and Zurich unallocated
accounts will generally occur pursuant to loco swap arrangements and will not expose the Authorized Participant or the Trust
to any additional expense. The Custodian has assumed the responsibility and expenses for loco swap transfers and shall bear
any risk of loss related to the palladium being transferred. If no loco swap counterparty is available, the Custodian shall
arrange, at its own expense and risk, for the physical transportation of palladium between the Zurich Sub-Custodian s
Zurich vault premises and the Custodian s London vault premises. If such a loco swap or physical transfer is necessary
to effect a loco London or loco Zurich redemption, the settlement of loco London or loco Zurich redemption deliveries may be
delayed more than two, but not more than five, business days. The Custodian, in its sole discretion, has the right to limit
the location where Authorized Participants can elect to receive delivery of palladium to either loco London or loco
Zurich. 

The
following description of the procedures for the creation and redemption of Baskets is only a summary and an investor should refer
to the relevant provisions of the Trust Agreement and the form of Authorized Participant Agreement for more detail. 

Creation
Procedures 

On
any business day, an Authorized Participant may place an order with the Trustee to create one or more Baskets. Creation and redemption
orders are accepted on business days the NYSE Arca is open for regular trading. Settlements of such orders requiring
receipt or delivery, or confirmation of receipt or delivery, of palladium in the United Kingdom, Zurich or another jurisdiction
will occur on business days when (1) banks in the United Kingdom, Zurich and such other jurisdiction and (2) the
London and Zurich palladium markets are regularly open for business. If such banks or the London or Zurich palladium markets are
not open for regular business for a full day, such a day will only be a business day for settlement purposes if
the settlement procedures can be completed by the end of such day. Redemption settlements including palladium deliveries loco
London may be delayed longer than two, but no more than five, business days following the redemption order date. Settlement of
orders requiring receipt or delivery, or confirmation of receipt or delivery, of Shares will occur, after confirmation of the
applicable palladium delivery, on business days when the NYSE Arca is open for regular trading. In the event of
a level 3 market-wide circuit breaker resulting in a trading halt for the remainder of the trading day, the time of the market-wide
trading halt is considered the close of regular trading and no creation orders for the current trade date will be accepted after
that time (the cutoff ). Orders placed after the cutoff will be deemed to be rejected and will not be processed.
Orders should be placed in proper form on the following business day. Purchase orders must be placed no later than 3:59:59 p.m.
on each business day the NYSE Arca is open for regular trading. 

By
placing a purchase order, an Authorized Participant agrees to deposit palladium with the Trust. Prior to the delivery of Baskets
for a purchase order, the Authorized Participant must also have wired to the Trustee the non-refundable transaction fee due for
the purchase order. 

Determination
of required deposits 

The
amount of the required palladium deposit is determined by dividing the number of ounces of palladium held by the Trust by the
number of Baskets outstanding, as adjusted for the amount of palladium constituting estimated accrued but unpaid fees and expenses
of the Trust. 

12 

Fractions
of a fine ounce of palladium smaller than 0.001 of a fine ounce which are included in the palladium deposit amount are disregarded
in the foregoing calculation. All questions as to the composition of a Creation Basket Deposit will be finally determined by the
Trustee. The Trustee s determination of the Creation Basket Deposit shall be final and binding on all persons interested
in the Trust. 

Delivery
of required deposits 

An
Authorized Participant who places a purchase order is responsible for crediting its Authorized Participant Unallocated Account
with the required palladium deposit amount by the second business day in London or Zurich following the purchase order date. Upon
receipt of the palladium deposit amount, the Custodian, after receiving appropriate instructions from the Authorized Participant
and the Trustee, will transfer on the second business day following the purchase order date the palladium deposit amount from
the Authorized Participant Unallocated Account to the Trust Unallocated Account and the Trustee will direct DTC to credit the
number of Baskets ordered to the Authorized Participant s DTC account. The expense and risk of delivery, ownership and safekeeping
of palladium until such palladium has been received by the Trust shall be borne solely by the Authorized Participant. The Trustee
may accept delivery of palladium by such other means as the Sponsor, from time to time, my determine with the Trustee to be acceptable
for the Trust, provided that the same is disclosed in a prospectus relating to the Trust filed with the SEC pursuant to Rule 424
under the Securities Act. If palladium is to be delivered other than as described above, the Sponsor is authorized to establish
such procedures and to appoint such custodians and establish such custody accounts in addition to those described in this report,
as the Sponsor determines to be desirable. 

Acting
on standing instructions given by the Trustee, the Custodian will transfer the palladium deposit amount from the Trust Unallocated
Account to the Trust Allocated Account by transferring palladium plates and ingots from its inventory or the inventory of the
Zurich Sub-Custodian to the Trust Allocated Account. The Custodian uses commercially reasonable efforts to complete the transfer
of palladium to the Trust Allocated Account prior to the time by which the Trustee is to credit the Basket to the Authorized Participant s
DTC account; if, however, such transfers have not been completed by such time, the number of Baskets ordered will be delivered
against receipt of the palladium deposit amount in the Trust Unallocated Account, and all Shareholders will be exposed to the
risks of unallocated palladium to the extent of that palladium deposit amount until the Custodian completes the allocation process
or a Zurich Sub-Custodian completes the allocation process for the Custodian. See Risk Factors Palladium held in
the Trust s unallocated palladium account and any Authorized Participant s unallocated palladium account is not segregated
from the Custodian s assets.... 

Because
palladium is only allocated in multiples of whole plates or ingots, the amount of palladium allocated from the Trust Unallocated
Account to the Trust Allocated Account may be less than the total fine ounces of palladium credited to the Trust Unallocated Account.
Any balance will be held in the Trust Unallocated Account. The Custodian uses commercially reasonable efforts to minimize the
amount of palladium held in the Trust Unallocated Account; no more than 192.904 troy ounces of palladium (maximum weight to make
one Good Delivery Palladium Plate or Ingot) is expected to be held in the Trust Unallocated Account at the close of each business
day. 

Rejection
of purchase orders 

The
Trustee may reject a purchase order or a Creation Basket Deposit if such order or Creation Basket Deposit is not presented in
proper form as described in the Authorized Participant Agreement or if the fulfillment of the order, in the opinion of counsel,
might be unlawful. None of the Trustee, the Sponsor or the Custodian will be liable for the rejection of any purchase order or
Creation Basket Deposit. 

13 

Redemption
Procedures 

The
procedures by which an Authorized Participant can redeem one or more Baskets mirror the procedures for the creation of Baskets.
On any business day, an Authorized Participant may place an order with the Trustee to redeem one or more Baskets. Redemption orders
must be placed no later than 3:59:59 p.m. on each business day the NYSE Arca is open for regular trading. In the event of a level
3 market-wide circuit breaker resulting in a trading halt for the remainder of the trading day, the time of the market wide trading
halt is considered the close of regular trading and no redemption orders for the current trade date will be accepted after that
time (the cutoff ). Orders placed after the cutoff will be deemed to be rejected and will not be processed. Orders
should be placed in proper form on the following business day. A redemption order so received is effective on the date it is received
in satisfactory form by the Trustee. The redemption procedures allow Authorized Participants to redeem Baskets and do not entitle
an individual Shareholder to redeem any Shares in an amount less than a Basket, or to redeem Baskets other than through an Authorized
Participant. 

By
placing a redemption order, an Authorized Participant agrees to deliver the Baskets to be redeemed through DTC s book entry
system to the Trust not later than the second business day following the effective date of the redemption order. Prior to the
delivery of the redemption distribution for a redemption order, the Authorized Participant must also have wired to the Trustee
the non-refundable transaction fee due for the redemption order. 

Determination
of redemption distribution 

The
redemption distribution from the Trust consists of a credit to the redeeming Authorized Participant s Authorized Participant
Unallocated Account representing the amount of the palladium held by the Trust evidenced by the Shares being redeemed. Fractions
of a fine ounce of palladium included in the redemption distribution smaller than 0.001 of a fine ounce are disregarded. 

Redemption
distributions will be subject to the deduction of any applicable tax or other governmental charges which may be due. 

Delivery
of redemption distribution 

The
redemption distribution due from the Trust will be delivered to the Authorized Participant on the second business day following
a loco Zurich redemption order date if, by 10:00 a.m. New York time on such second business day, the Trustee s DTC account
has been credited with the Baskets to be redeemed. The redemption distribution due from the Trust will be delivered to the Authorized
Participant on or before the fifth business day following a loco London redemption order date if, by 10:00 a.m. New York time
on the second business day after the loco London redemption order date, the Trustee s DTC account has been credited with
the Baskets to be redeemed. If a loco swap or physical transfer is necessary to effect a loco London or loco Zurich redemption,
the redemption distribution due from the Trust will be delivered to the Authorized Participant on or before the fifth business
day following such a loco London or loco Zurich redemption order date if, by 10:00 a.m. New York time on the second business day
after the loco London or loco Zurich redemption order date, the Trustee s DTC account has been credited with the Baskets
to be redeemed. In the event that, by 10:00 a.m. New York time on the second business day following the order date of a redemption
order, the Trustee s DTC account has not been credited with the total number of Shares corresponding to the total number
of Baskets to be redeemed pursuant to such redemption order, the Trustee shall send to the Authorized Participant and the Custodian
via fax or electronic mail message notice of such fact and the Authorized Participant shall have two business days following receipt
of such notice to correct such failure. If such failure is not cured within such two business day period, the Trustee (in consultation
with the Sponsor) will cancel such redemption order and will send via fax or electronic mail message notice of such cancellation
to the Authorized Participant and the Custodian, and the Authorized Participant will be solely responsible for all costs incurred
by the Trust, the Trustee or the Custodian related to the cancelled order. The Trustee is also authorized to deliver the redemption
distribution notwithstanding that the Baskets to be redeemed are not credited to the Trustee s DTC account by 10:00 a.m.
New York time on the second business day following the redemption order date if the Authorized Participant has collateralized
its obligation to deliver the Baskets through DTC s book entry system on such terms as the Sponsor and the Trustee may from
time to time agree upon. 

The
Custodian transfers the redemption palladium amount from the Trust Allocated Account to the Trust Unallocated Account and, thereafter,
to the redeeming Authorized Participant s Authorized Participant Unallocated Account. The Authorized Participant and the
Trust are each at risk in respect of palladium credited to their respective unallocated accounts in the event of the Custodian s
insolvency. See Risk Factors Palladium held in the Trust s unallocated palladium account and any Authorized
Participant s unallocated palladium account is not segregated from the Custodian s assets.... 

14 

As
with the allocation of palladium to the Trust Allocated Account which occurs upon a purchase order, if in transferring palladium
from the Trust Allocated Account to the Trust Unallocated Account in connection with a redemption order there is an excess amount
of palladium transferred to the Trust Unallocated Account, the excess over the palladium redemption amount will be held in the
Trust Unallocated Account. The Custodian uses commercially reasonable efforts to minimize the amount of palladium held in the
Trust Unallocated Account; no more than 192 ounces of palladium (maximum weight to make one Good Delivery Palladium Plate or Ingot)
is expected to be held in the Trust Unallocated Account at the close of each business day. 

Suspension
or rejection of redemption orders 

The
Trustee may, in its discretion, and will when directed by the Sponsor, suspend the right of redemption, or postpone the redemption
settlement date, (1) for any period during which the NYSE Arca is closed other than customary weekend or holiday closings, or
trading on the NYSE Arca is suspended or restricted or (2) for any period during which an emergency exists as a result of which
delivery, disposal or evaluation of palladium is not reasonably practicable. None of the Sponsor, the Trustee or the Custodian
are liable to any person or in any way for any loss or damages that may result from any such suspension or postponement. 

The
Trustee will reject a redemption order if the order is not in proper form as described in the Authorized Participant Agreement
or if the fulfillment of the order, in the opinion of its counsel, might be unlawful. 

Creation
and Redemption Transaction Fe e 

To
compensate the Trustee for services in processing the creation and redemption of Baskets, an Authorized Participant is required
to pay a transaction fee to the Trustee of 500 per order to create or redeem Baskets. An order may include multiple Baskets.
The transaction fee may be reduced, increased or otherwise changed by the Trustee with the consent of the Sponsor. From time to
time, the Trustee, with the consent of the Sponsor, may waive all or a portion of the applicable transaction fee. The Trustee shall
notify DTC of any agreement to change the transaction fee and will not implement any increase in the fee for the redemption of
Baskets until 30 days after the date of the notice. 

The
Sponsor 

The
Trust s Sponsor is abrdn ETFs Sponsor LLC (known as Aberdeen Standard Investments ETFs Sponsor LLC prior to March 1, 2022 and
ETF Securities USA LLC prior to October 1, 2018), a Delaware limited liability company formed on June 17, 2009. 

The
Sponsor s office is located at c/o abrdn ETFs Sponsor LLC, 1900 Market Street, Suite 200, Philadelphia, PA 19103. Prior
to April 27, 2018, the Sponsor was wholly-owned by ETF Securities Limited, a Jersey, Channel Islands based company. Effective
April 27, 2018, ETF Securities Limited sold its membership interest in the Sponsor to abrdn Inc. (known as Aberdeen Standard Investments
Inc. prior to January 1, 2022), a Delaware corporation. As a result of the sale, abrdn Inc. became the sole member of the Sponsor.
abrdn Inc. is a wholly-owned indirect subsidiary of abrdn plc, which together with its affiliates and subsidiaries, is collectively
referred to as abrdn. Under the Delaware Limited Liability Company Act and the governing documents of the Sponsor,
the sole member of the Sponsor, abrdn Inc., is not responsible for the debts, obligations and liabilities of the Sponsor solely
by reason of being the sole member of the Sponsor. 

The
Sponsor s Role 

The
Sponsor arranged for the creation of the Trust, and is responsible for the ongoing registration of the Shares for their public
offering in the United States and the listing of the Shares on the NYSE Arca. The Sponsor has agreed to assume the following administrative
and marketing expenses incurred by the Trust: the Trustee s monthly fee and out-of-pocket expenses, the Custodian s
fee and the reimbursement of the Custodian s expenses under the Custody Agreements, Exchange listing fees, SEC registration
fees, printing and mailing costs, audit fees and up to 100,000 per annum in legal expenses. The Sponsor also paid the costs of
the Trust s organization and the initial sale of the Shares, including the applicable SEC registration fees. 

15 

The
Sponsor does not exercise day-to-day oversight over the Trustee or the Custodian. The Sponsor may remove the Trustee and appoint
a successor Trustee (i) if the Trustee ceases to meet certain objective requirements (including the requirement that it have capital,
surplus and undivided profits of at least 150 million), (ii) if, having received written notice of a material breach of its obligations
under the Trust Agreement, the Trustee has not cured the breach within 30 days, or (iii) if the Trustee refuses to consent to
the implementation of an amendment to the Trust s initial Internal Control Over Financial Reporting. The Sponsor also has
the right to replace the Trustee during the 90 days following any merger, consolidation or conversion in which the Trustee is
not the surviving entity or, in its discretion, on the fifth anniversary of the creation of the Trust or on any subsequent third
anniversary thereafter. The Sponsor also has the right to approve any new or additional custodian that the Trustee may wish to
appoint and any new or additional Zurich Sub-Custodian that the Custodian may wish to appoint. 

The
Sponsor or one of its affiliates or agents (1) develops a marketing plan for the Trust on an ongoing basis, (2) prepares marketing
materials regarding the Shares, including the content of the Trust s website and (3) executes the marketing plan for the
Trust. 

The
Trustee 

The
Bank of New York Mellon, a banking corporation organized under the laws of the State of New York with trust powers BNYM ),
serves as the Trustee. BNYM has a trust office at 240 Greenwich Street, New York, NY 10286. BNYM is subject to supervision by
the New York State Financial Services Department and the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System. Information regarding
creation and redemption Basket composition, NAV of the Trust, transaction fees and the names of the parties that have each executed
an Authorized Participant Agreement may be obtained from BNYM. A copy of the Trust Agreement is available for inspection at BNYM s
trust office identified above. Under the Trust Agreement, the Trustee is required to have capital, surplus and undivided profits
of at least 150 million. 

The
Trustee s Role 

The
Trustee is generally responsible for the day-to-day administration of the Trust, including keeping the Trust s operational
records. The Trustee s principal responsibilities include (1) transferring the Trust s palladium as needed to
pay the Sponsor s Fee in palladium (palladium transfers are expected to occur approximately monthly in the ordinary
course), (2) valuing the Trust s palladium and calculating the NAV of the Trust and the NAV per Share, (3) receiving and
processing orders from Authorized Participants to create and redeem Baskets and coordinating the processing of such orders with
the Custodian and DTC, (4) selling the Trust s palladium as needed to pay any extraordinary Trust expenses that are
not assumed by the Sponsor, (5) when appropriate, making distributions of cash or other property to Shareholders, and (6) receiving
and reviewing reports from or on the Custodian s custody of and transactions in the Trust s palladium. The Trustee
shall, with respect to directing the Custodian, act in accordance with the instructions of the Sponsor. If the Custodian resigns,
the Trustee shall appoint an additional or replacement Custodian selected by the Sponsor. 

The
Trustee intends to regularly communicate with the Sponsor to monitor the overall performance of the Trust. The Trustee does not
monitor the performance of the Custodian, the Zurich Sub-Custodian, or any other sub-custodian other than to review the reports
provided by the Custodian pursuant to the Custody Agreements. The Trustee, along with the Sponsor, will liaise with the Trust s
legal, accounting and other professional service providers as needed. The Trustee will assist and support the Sponsor with the
preparation of all periodic reports required to be filed with the SEC on behalf of the Trust. 

The
Trustee s monthly fees and out-of-pocket expenses are paid by the Sponsor. 

Affiliates
of the Trustee may from time to time act as Authorized Participants or purchase or sell palladium or Shares for their own
account, as agent for their customers and for accounts over which they exercise investment discretion. Affiliates of the Trustee
are subject to the same transaction fee as other Authorized Participants. 

16 

The
Custodian 

JPMorgan
Chase Bank, N.A. JPMorgan serves as the Custodian of the Trust s palladium. JPMorgan is a national banking
association organized under the laws of the United States of America. JPMorgan is subject to supervision by the Federal Reserve
Bank of New York and the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation. 

JPMorgan s
London office is regulated by the FCA and is located at 25 Bank Street, Canary Wharf, London, E14 5JP, United Kingdom. JPMorgan
is a subsidiary of JPMorgan Chase Co. While the United Kingdom operations of the Custodian are regulated by the
FCA, the custodial services provided by the Custodian and any sub-custodian, including the Zurich Sub-Custodian under the Custody
Agreements, are presently not a regulated activity subject to the supervision and rules of the FCA. The Zurich Sub-Custodian that
the Custodian currently uses is UBS AG, which is located at 45 Bahnhofstrasse, 8001 Zurich, Switzerland. 

The
Custodian s Role 

The
Custodian is responsible for safekeeping of the Trust s palladium deposited with it by Authorized Participants in connection
with the creation of Baskets. The Custodian is also responsible for selecting the Zurich Sub-Custodian and its other direct sub-custodians,
if any. The Custodian facilitates the transfer of palladium in and out of the Trust through the unallocated palladium accounts
it will maintain for each Authorized Participant and the unallocated and allocated palladium accounts it will maintain for the
Trust. The Custodian holds at its London, England vault premises that portion of the Trust s allocated palladium to be held
in London. The Zurich Sub-Custodian holds at its Zurich, Switzerland vault premises that portion of the Trust s allocated
palladium to be held in Zurich on behalf of the Custodian. The Custodian is responsible for allocating specific plates or ingots
of physical palladium to the Trust s allocated palladium account. The Custodian provides the Trustee with regular reports
detailing the palladium transfers in and out of the Trust s unallocated and allocated palladium accounts and identifying
the palladium plates or ingots held in the Trust s allocated palladium account. 

The
Custodian s fees and expenses under the Custody Agreements are paid by the Sponsor. 

The
Custodian and its affiliates may from time to time act as Authorized Participants or purchase or sell palladium or Shares for
their own account, as agent for their customers and for accounts over which they exercise investment discretion. The Custodian
and its affiliates are subject to the same transaction fee as other Authorized Participants. 

Inspection
of Palladium 

Under
the Custody Agreements, the Trustee, the Sponsor and the Trust s auditors and inspectors may, only up to twice a year, visit
the premises of the Custodian and the Zurich Sub-Custodian for the purpose of examining the Trust s palladium and certain
related records maintained by the Custodian. Under the Allocated Account Agreement, the Custodian agreed to procure similar
inspection rights from the Zurich Sub-Custodian. Any such inspection rights with respect to the Zurich Sub-Custodian are expected
to be granted in accordance with the normal course of dealing between the Custodian and the Zurich Sub-Custodian. Visits by auditors
and inspectors to the Zurich Sub-Custodian s facilities will be arranged through the Custodian. Other than with respect
to the Zurich Sub-Custodian, the Trustee and the Sponsor have no right to visit the premises of any sub-custodian for the purposes
of examining the Trust s palladium or any records maintained by the sub-custodian, and no sub-custodian is obligated
to cooperate in any review the Trustee or the Sponsor may wish to conduct of the facilities, procedures, records or creditworthiness
of such sub-custodian. 

The
Sponsor has exercised its right to visit the Custodian and the Zurich Sub-Custodian, in order to examine the palladium and
the records maintained by the them. Inspections were conducted by Bureau Veritas Commodities UK Ltd, a leading commodity
inspection and testing company retained by the Sponsor, as of June 30, 2022 and December 31, 2022. 

17 

There
can be no guarantee that the Sponsor or the Trust s auditors and inspectors will be able to perform physical inspections
of the Trust s palladium as planned. Local policies, regulations, or ordinances, as well as polices or restrictions
adopted by the Custodian or a sub-custodian, may temporarily prevent, or otherwise impair the ability of, the Sponsor or the Trust s
auditors and inspectors, from performing a physical inspection of the Trust s palladium on a desired date. In those
situations, the Sponsor or the Trust s auditors and inspectors may seek to verify the palladium held by the Trust by
alternate means, including through virtual inspections of the Trust s palladium and/or a review of pertinent records. 

Description
of the Shares 

General

The
Trustee is authorized under the Trust Agreement to create and issue an unlimited number of Shares. The Trustee creates Shares
only in Baskets and only upon the order of an Authorized Participant. Effective April 1, 2019, the number of Shares that constitute
a Basket for the purposes of creations and redemptions is 25,000 Shares. Prior to April 1, 2019, a Basket consisted of 50,000
Shares. The Shares represent units of fractional undivided beneficial interest in and ownership of the Trust and have no par value.
Any creation and issuance of Shares above the amount registered on the Trust s then-current and effective registration statement
with the SEC will require the registration of such additional Shares. 

Description
of Limited Rights 

The
Shares do not represent a traditional investment and Shareholders should not view them as similar to shares of a corporation operating
a business enterprise with management and a board of directors. Shareholders do not have the statutory rights normally associated
with the ownership of shares of a corporation, including, for example, the right to bring oppression or derivative 
actions. All Shares are of the same class with equal rights and privileges. Each Share is transferable, is fully paid and non-assessable
and entitles the holder to vote on the limited matters upon which Shareholders may vote under the Trust Agreement. The Shares
do not entitle their holders to any conversion or pre-emptive rights, or, except as provided below, any redemption rights or rights
to distributions. 

Distributions 

If
the Trust is terminated and liquidated, the Trustee will distribute to the Shareholders any amounts remaining after the satisfaction
of all outstanding liabilities of the Trust and the establishment of such reserves for applicable taxes, other governmental charges
and contingent or future liabilities as the Trustee shall determine. Shareholders of record on the record date fixed by the Trustee
for a distribution will be entitled to receive their pro rata portion of any distribution. 

Voting
and Approvals 

Under
the Trust Agreement, Shareholders have no voting rights, except in limited circumstances. The Trustee may terminate the Trust
upon the agreement of Shareholders owning at least 75 of the outstanding Shares. In addition, certain amendments to the Trust
Agreement require advance notice to the Shareholders before the effectiveness of such amendments, but no Shareholder vote or approval
is required for any amendment to the Trust Agreement. 

Redemption
of the Shares 

The
Shares may only be redeemed by or through an Authorized Participant and only in Baskets. 

18 

Book-Entry
Form 

Individual
certificates will not be issued for the Shares. Instead, one or more global certificates is deposited by the Trustee with DTC
and registered in the name of Cede Co., as nominee for DTC. The global certificates evidence all of the Shares outstanding
at any time. Under the Trust Agreement, Shareholders are limited to (1) participants in DTC such as banks, brokers, dealers and
trust companies (DTC Participants), (2) those who maintain, either directly or indirectly, a custodial relationship with a DTC
Participant (Indirect Participants), and (3) those banks, brokers, dealers, trust companies and others who hold interests in the
Shares through DTC Participants or Indirect Participants. The Shares are only transferable through the book-entry system of DTC.
Shareholders who are not DTC Participants may transfer their Shares through DTC by instructing the DTC Participant holding their
Shares (or by instructing the Indirect Participant or other entity through which their Shares are held) to transfer the Shares.
Transfers will be made in accordance with standard securities industry practice. 

Custody
of the Trust s Palladium 

Custody
of the physical palladium deposited with and held by the Trust is provided by the Custodian at its London, England vaults and
by the Zurich Sub-Custodian selected by the Custodian in its Zurich vaults and by other sub-custodians on a temporary basis. The
Custodian is a market maker, clearer and approved weigher under the rules of the LPPM. 

The
Custodian is the custodian of the physical palladium credited to the Trust Allocated Account in accordance with the Custody
Agreements. The Custodian segregates the physical palladium credited to the Trust s Allocated Account from any other precious
metal it holds or holds for others by entering appropriate entries in its books and records, and requires the Zurich Sub-Custodian
to also segregate the physical palladium of the Trust that it holds from the other palladium held by it for other customers of the
Custodian and the Zurich Sub-Custodian s other customers. The Custodian requires the Zurich Sub-Custodian to identify in its
books and records the Trust as having the rights to the physical palladium credited to its Trust Allocated Account. Under the
Custody Agreements, the Trustee, the Sponsor and the Trust s auditors and inspectors may inspect the vaults of the Custodian
and the Zurich Sub-Custodian. See Inspection of Platinum . 

The
Custodian, as instructed by the Trustee on behalf of the Trust, is authorized to accept, on behalf of the Trust, deposits of palladium
in unallocated form. Acting on standing instructions specified in the Custody Agreements, the Custodian will or will require the
Zurich Sub-Custodian to allocate palladium deposited in unallocated form with the Trust by selecting plates or ingots of palladium
for deposit to the Trust Allocated Account. All physical palladium allocated to the Trust must conform to the rules, regulations,
practices and customs of the LPPM, and the Custodian must replace any non-conforming palladium with conforming palladium as soon
as practical upon a determination by the Custodian any palladium is non-conforming. 

The
process of withdrawing palladium from the Trust for a redemption of a Basket follows the same general procedure as for depositing palladium
with the Trust for a creation of a Basket, only in reverse. Each transfer of palladium between the Trust Allocated Account
and the Trust Unallocated Account connected with a creation or redemption of a Basket may result in a small amount of palladium
being held in the Trust Unallocated Account after the completion of the transfer. In making deposits and withdrawals between the
Trust Allocated Account and the Trust Unallocated Account, the Custodian will use commercially reasonable efforts to minimize
the amount of palladium held in the Trust Unallocated Account as of the close of each business day. See Creation and
Redemption of Shares. 

United
States Federal Income Tax Consequences 

The
following discussion of the material US federal income tax consequences generally applies to the purchase, ownership and disposition
of Shares by a US Shareholder (as defined below), and certain US federal income tax consequences that may apply to an investment in Shares by a Non-US
Shareholder (as defined below). The discussion is based on the United States Internal Revenue Code of 1986 as amended (the
 Code ). The discussion below is based on the Code, United States Treasury Regulations Treasury
Regulations promulgated under the Code and judicial and administrative interpretations of the Code, all as in effect on the
date of this annual report and all of which are subject to change either prospectively or retroactively. The tax treatment of
Shareholders may vary depending upon their own particular circumstances. Certain Shareholders (including broker-dealers, traders,
banks and other financial institutions, insurance companies, real estate investment trusts, tax-exempt entities, Shareholders whose
functional currency is not the U.S. Dollar or other investors with special circumstances) may be subject to special rules not
discussed below. In addition, the following discussion applies only to investors who hold Shares as capital assets 
within the meaning of Code section 1221 and not as part of a straddle, hedging transaction or a conversion or constructive sale
transaction. Moreover, the discussion below does not address the effect of any state, local or foreign tax law or any transfer tax
on an owner of Shares. Purchasers of Shares are urged to consult their own tax advisors with respect to all federal, state, local
and foreign tax law or any transfer tax considerations potentially applicable to their investment in Shares. 

19 

For
purposes of this discussion, a US Shareholder is a Shareholder that is: 

An
individual who is a citizen or resident of the United States; 

A
corporation (or other entity treated as a corporation for US federal tax purposes) created or organized in or under the laws of
the United States or any political subdivision thereof; 

An
estate, the income of which is includible in gross income for US federal income tax purposes regardless of its source; or 

A
trust, if a court within the United States is able to exercise primary supervision over the administration of the trust and one
or more US persons have the authority to control all substantial decisions of the trust. 

A
Shareholder that is not a US Shareholder as defined above (other than a partnership, or an entity treated as a partnership for
US federal tax purposes) generally is considered a Non-US Shareholder for purposes of this discussion. For US federal
income tax purposes, the treatment of any beneficial owner of an interest in a partnership, including any entity treated as a
partnership for US federal income tax purposes, generally depends upon the status of the partner and upon the activities of the
partnership. Partnerships and partners in partnerships should consult their tax advisors about the US federal income tax consequences
of purchasing, owning and disposing of Shares. 

Taxation
of the Trust 

The
Trust is classified as a grantor trust for US federal income tax purposes. As a result, the Trust itself is not
subject to US federal income tax. Instead, the Trust s income and expenses flow through to the Shareholders,
and the Trustee reports the Trust s income, gains, losses and deductions to the Internal Revenue Service IRS on that basis. 

Taxation
of US Shareholders 

Shareholders
generally are treated, for US federal income tax purposes, as if they directly owned a pro rata share of the underlying assets
held by the Trust. Shareholders are also treated as if they directly received their respective pro rata share of the Trust s
income, if any, and as if they directly incurred their respective pro rata share of the Trust s expenses. In the case of
a Shareholder that purchases Shares for cash, its initial tax basis in its pro rata share of the assets held by the Trust at the
time it acquires its Shares is equal to its cost of acquiring the Shares. In the case of a Shareholder that acquires its Shares
as part of a creation of a Basket, the delivery of palladium to the Trust in exchange for the Shares is not a taxable event
to the Shareholder, and the Shareholder s tax basis and holding period for the Shares are the same as its tax basis and
holding period for the palladium delivered in exchange therefore (except to the extent of any cash contributed for such Shares).
For purposes of this discussion, it is assumed that all of a Shareholder s Shares are acquired on the same date and at the
same price per Share. Shareholders that hold multiple lots of Shares, or that are contemplating acquiring multiple lots of Shares,
should consult their tax advisors. 

When
the Trust sells or transfers palladium, for example to pay expenses, a Shareholder generally will recognize a gain or loss in
an amount equal to the difference between (1) the Shareholder s pro rata share of the amount realized by the Trust upon
the sale or transfer and (2) the Shareholder s tax basis for its pro rata share of the palladium that was sold or transferred.
Such gain or loss will generally be long-term or short-term capital gain or loss, depending upon whether the Shareholder has a
holding period in its Shares of longer than one year. A Shareholder s tax basis for its share of any palladium sold by the
Trust generally will be determined by multiplying the Shareholder s total basis for its Shares immediately prior to the
sale, by a fraction the numerator of which is the amount of palladium sold, and the denominator of which is the total amount of
the palladium held by the Trust immediately prior to the sale. After any such sale, a Shareholder s tax basis for its pro
rata share of the palladium remaining in the Trust will be equal to its tax basis for its Shares immediately prior to the sale,
less the portion of such basis allocable to its share of the palladium that was sold. 

20 

Upon
a Shareholder s sale of some or all of its Shares, the Shareholder will be treated as having sold a pro rata share of the palladium
held in the Trust at the time of the sale. Accordingly, the Shareholder generally will recognize a gain or loss on the sale
in an amount equal to the difference between (1) the amount realized pursuant to the sale of the Shares, and (2) the Shareholder s
tax basis for the Shares sold, as determined in the manner described in the preceding paragraph. 

A
redemption of some or all of a Shareholder s Shares in exchange for the underlying palladium represented by the Shares
redeemed generally will not be a taxable event to the Shareholder. The Shareholder s tax basis for the palladium received
in the redemption generally will be the same as the Shareholder s tax basis for the Shares redeemed. The Shareholder s
holding period with respect to the palladium received should include the period during which the Shareholder held the Shares
redeemed. A subsequent sale of the palladium received by the Shareholder will be a taxable event. 

An
Authorized Participant and other investors may be able to re-invest, on a tax-deferred basis, in-kind redemption proceeds received
from exchange-traded products that are substantially similar to the Trust in the Trust s Shares. Authorized Participants
and other investors should consult their tax advisors as to whether and under what circumstances the reinvestment in the Shares
of proceeds from substantially similar exchange-traded products can be accomplished on a tax-deferred basis. 

Under
current law, gains recognized by individuals, estates or trusts from the sale of collectibles, including physical
palladium, held for more than one year are taxed at a maximum federal income tax rate of 28 , rather than the 20 rate applicable
to most other long-term capital gains. For these purposes, gains recognized by an individual upon the sale of Shares held for
more than one year, or attributable to the Trust s sale of any physical palladium which the Shareholder is treated
(through its ownership of Shares) as having held for more than one year, generally will be taxed at a maximum rate of 28 . The
tax rates for capital gains recognized upon the sale of assets held by an individual US Shareholder for one year or less or by
a corporate taxpayer are generally the same as those at which ordinary income is taxed. 

In
addition, high-income individuals and certain trusts and estates are subject to a 3.8 Medicare contribution tax that is imposed
on net investment income and gain. Shareholders should consult their tax advisor regarding this tax. 

Brokerage
Fees and Trust Expenses 

Any
brokerage or other transaction fees incurred by a Shareholder in purchasing Shares is treated as part of the Shareholder s
tax basis in the Shares. Similarly, any brokerage fee incurred by a Shareholder in selling Shares reduces the amount realized
by the Shareholder with respect to the sale. 

Shareholders
will be required to recognize gain or loss upon a sale of palladium by the Trust (as discussed above), even though some or
all of the proceeds of such sale are used by the Trustee to pay Trust expenses. Shareholders may deduct their respective pro rata
share of each expense incurred by the Trust to the same extent as if they directly incurred the expense. Shareholders who are
individuals, estates or trusts, however, may be required to treat some or all of the expenses of the Trust, to the extent that
such expenses may be deducted, as miscellaneous itemized deductions. Miscellaneous itemized deductions, including expenses for
the production of income, will not be deductible for either regular federal income tax or alternative minimum tax purposes for
taxable years beginning after December 31, 2017 and before January 1, 2026 and thereafter generally are (i) deductible only to
the extent that the aggregate of a Shareholder s miscellaneous itemized deductions exceeds 2 of such Shareholder s adjusted gross
income for federal income tax purposes, (ii) not deductible for the purposes of the alternative minimum tax and (iii) are subject
to the overall limitation on itemized deductions under the Code. 

21 

Investment
by Regulated Investment Companies 

Mutual
funds and other investment vehicles which are regulated investment companies within the meaning of Code section
851 should consult with their tax advisors concerning (1) the likelihood that an investment in Shares, although they are a security 
within the meaning of the Investment Company Act of 1940, may be considered an investment in the underlying palladium for
purposes of Code section 851(b), and (2) the extent to which an investment in Shares might nevertheless be consistent with preservation
of their qualification under Code section 851. In administrative guidance, the IRS stated that it will no longer issue rulings
under Code section 851(b) relating to the determination of whether or not an instrument or position is a security ,
but, instead, intends to defer to guidance from the SEC for such determination. 

United
States Information Reporting and Backup Withholding Tax for US and Non-US Shareholders 

The
Trustee or the appropriate broker will file certain information returns with the IRS, and provides certain tax-related information
to Shareholders, in accordance with applicable Treasury Regulations. Each Shareholder will be provided with information regarding
its allocable portion of the Trust s annual income (if any) and expenses. 

A
US Shareholder may be subject to US backup withholding tax in certain circumstances unless it provides its taxpayer identification
number and complies with certain certification procedures. Non-US Shareholders may have to comply with certification procedures
to establish that they are not a US person in order to avoid the backup withholding tax. 

The
amount of any backup withholding tax will be allowed as a credit against a Shareholder s US federal income tax liability
and may entitle such a Shareholder to a refund, provided that the required information is furnished to the IRS. 

Income
Taxation of Non-US Shareholders 

The
Trust does not expect to generate taxable income except for gains (if any) upon the sale of palladium. A Non-US Shareholder generally
is not subject to US federal income tax with respect to gains recognized upon the sale or other disposition of Shares, or upon
the sale of palladium by the Trust, unless (1) the Non-US Shareholder is an individual and is present in the United States
for 183 days or more during the taxable year of the sale or other disposition, and the gain is treated as being from United States
sources; or (2) the gain is effectively connected with the conduct by the Non-US Shareholder of a trade or business in the United
States. 

Taxation
in Jurisdictions other than the United States 

Prospective
purchasers of Shares that are based in or acting out of a jurisdiction other than the United States are advised to consult their
own tax advisers as to the tax consequences, under the laws of such jurisdiction (or any other jurisdiction not being the United
States to which they are subject), of their purchase, holding, sale and redemption of or any other dealing in Shares and, in particular,
as to whether any value added tax, other consumption tax or transfer tax is payable in relation to such purchase, holding, sale,
redemption or other dealing. 

ERISA
and Related Considerations 

The
Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, as amended ERISA ), and/or Code section 4975 impose certain requirements
on certain employee benefit plans and certain other plans and arrangements, including individual retirement accounts and annuities,
Keogh plans, and certain commingled investment vehicles or insurance company general or separate accounts in which such plans
or arrangements are invested (collectively, Plans ), and on persons who are fiduciaries with respect to the investment
of plan assets of a Plan. Government plans and some church plans are not subject to the fiduciary responsibility
provisions of ERISA or the provisions of section 4975 of the Code, but may be subject to substantially similar rules under other
federal law, or under state or local law Other Law ). 

22 

In
contemplating an investment of a portion of Plan assets in Shares, the Plan fiduciary responsible for making such investment should
carefully consider, taking into account the facts and circumstances of the Plan and the Risk Factors discussed above
and whether such investment is consistent with its fiduciary responsibilities under ERISA or Other Law, including, but not limited
to: (1) whether the investment is permitted under the Plan s governing documents, (2) whether the fiduciary has the authority
to make the investment, (3) whether the investment is consistent with the Plan s funding objectives, (4) the tax effects
of the investment on the Plan, and (5) whether the investment is prudent considering the factors discussed in this report. In
addition, ERISA and Code section 4975 prohibit a broad range of transactions involving assets of a plan and persons who are parties
in interest under ERISA or disqualified persons under section 4975 of the Code. A violation of these rules
may result in the imposition of significant excise taxes and other liabilities. Plans subject to Other Law may be subject to similar
restrictions. 

It
is anticipated that the Shares will constitute publicly offered securities as defined in the Department of Labor
 Plan Asset Regulations, 2510.3-101 (b)(2) as modified by section 3(42) of ERISA. Accordingly, pursuant to
the Plan Asset Regulations, only Shares purchased by a Plan, and not an interest in the underlying assets held in the Trust, should
be treated as assets of the Plan, for purposes of applying the fiduciary responsibility rules of ERISA and the prohibited
transaction rules of ERISA and the Code. Fiduciaries of plans subject to Other Law should consult legal counsel to determine
whether there would be a similar result under the Other Law. 

Investment
by Certain Retirement Plans 

Code
section 408(m) provides that the acquisition of a collectible by an individual retirement account IRA or a participant-directed account maintained under any plan that is tax-qualified under Code section 401(a) Tax Qualified
Account is treated as a taxable distribution from the account to the owner of the IRA, or to the participant for whom
the Tax Qualified Account is maintained, of an amount equal to the cost to the account of acquiring the collectible. The term
 collectible is defined to include, with certain exceptions, any metal or gem . The IRS has issued several
private letter rulings to the effect that a purchase by an IRA, or by a participant-directed account under a Code section 401(a)
plan, of publicly-traded shares in a trust holding precious metals will not be treated as resulting in a taxable distribution
to the IRA owner or Tax Qualified Account participant under Code section 408(m). However the private letter rulings provide that,
if any of the Shares so purchased are distributed from the IRA or Tax Qualified Account to the IRA owner or Tax Qualified Account
participant, or if any precious metal is received by such IRA or Tax Qualified Account upon the redemption of any of the
Shares purchased by it, the Shares or precious metal so distributed will be subject to federal income tax in the year
of distribution, to the extent provided under the applicable provisions of Code sections 408(d), 408(m) or 402. Accordingly, potential
IRA or Tax Qualified Account investors are urged to consult with their own professional advisors concerning the treatment of an
investment in Shares under Code section 408(m). 

Item
1A. Risk Factors 

Shareholders
should consider carefully the risks described below before making an investment decision. Shareholders should also refer to the
other information included in this report, including the Trust s financial statements and the related notes. 

RISKS
RELATED TO PALLADIUM 

The
price of palladium may be affected by the sale of ETVs tracking the palladium markets. 

To
the extent existing exchange traded vehicles ETVs tracking the palladium markets represent a significant proportion
of demand for physical palladium bullion, large redemptions of the securities of these ETVs could negatively affect physical palladium
bullion prices and the price and NAV of the Shares. 

23 

Crises
may motivate large-scale sales of palladium which could decrease the price of palladium and adversely affect an investment in
the Shares. 

The
possibility of large-scale distress sales of palladium in times of crisis may have a short-term negative impact on the price of
palladium and adversely affect an investment in the Shares. For example, the 2008 financial credit crisis resulted in significantly
depressed prices of palladium largely due to forced sales and deleveraging from institutional investors such as hedge funds and
pension funds as expectations of economic growth slumped. Crises in the future may impair palladium s price performance
which would, in turn, adversely affect an investment in the Shares. 

Several
factors may have the effect of causing a decline in the prices of palladium and a corresponding decline in the price of Shares.
Among them: 

A
 significant increase in palladium hedging activity by palladium producers. Should there
 be an increase in the level of hedge activity of palladium producing companies, it could
 cause a decline in world palladium prices, adversely affecting the price of the Shares. 

A
 significant change in the attitude of speculators, investors and central banks towards
 palladium. Should the speculative community take a negative view towards palladium or
 central banking authorities determine to sell national palladium reserves, either event
 could cause a decline in world palladium prices, negatively impacting the price of the
 Shares. 

A
 widening of interest rate differentials between the cost of money and the cost of palladium
 could negatively affect the price of palladium which, in turn, could negatively affect
 the price of the Shares. 

A
 combination of rising money interest rates and a continuation of the current low cost
 of borrowing palladium could improve the economics of selling palladium forward. This
 could result in an increase in hedging by palladium mining companies and short selling
 by speculative interests, which would negatively affect the price of palladium. Under
 such circumstances, the price of the Shares would be similarly affected. 

Autocatalysts,
 automobile components that use palladium, accounted for approximately 83 of the net
 global demand in palladium in 2021. While the automotive sector in China and the US is
 showing signs of recovery, the European market is currently experiencing declining demand
 and, in certain cases, solvency concerns. Reduced automotive industry sales in Europe
 may result in a decline in autocatalyst demand. 

A
 decline in the global automotive industry may impact the price of palladium and affect
 the price of the Shares. 

Conversely,
several factors may trigger a temporary increase in the price of palladium prior to your investment in the Shares. For example,
sudden increased investor interest in palladium may cause an increase in world palladium prices, increasing the price of the Shares.
If that is the case, you will be buying Shares at prices affected by the temporarily high prices of palladium, and you may incur
losses when the causes for the temporary increase disappear. 

A
decline in the automobile industry or a shift from gasoline-powered to electric vehicles may have the effect of causing a decline
in the price of palladium and a corresponding decline in the price of Shares. 

Autocatalysts,
automobile components for emissions control that use palladium, accounted for approximately 83 of the global demand in palladium
in 2021. Reduced automotive industry sales or a shift from gasoline-powered to electric vehicles may result in a decline in autocatalyst
demand. A contraction in the global automotive industry or more widespread acceptance of electric vehicles may impact the price
of palladium and the price of Shares. 

24 

The
value of the Shares relates directly to the value of the palladium held by the Trust and fluctuations in the price of palladium
could materially adversely affect an investment in the Shares. 

The
Shares are designed to mirror as closely as possible the performance of the price of palladium bullion, and the value of the Shares
relates directly to the value of the palladium held by the Trust, less the Trust s liabilities (including estimated accrued
but unpaid expenses). The price of palladium has fluctuated widely over the past several years. Several factors may affect the
price of palladium, including: 

Global
palladium supply, which is influenced by such factors as production and cost levels in major palladium-producing countries such as Russia
and South Africa. Recycling, autocatalyst demand, industrial demand, jewelry demand and investment demand are also important
drivers of palladium supply and demand. Sales of existing stockpiles of palladium have been a key source of supply in the past decade
and could potentially soon be exhausted, placing a higher burden on new mine supply; 

Currency
exchange rates; 

Interest
rates; 

Investment
and trading activities of hedge funds and commodity funds 

Global
or regional political, economic or financial events and situations; and 

A
significant change in investor interest, including in response to online campaigns or other activities specifically targeting
investments in palladium. 

In
addition, investors should be aware that there is no assurance that palladium will maintain its long-term value in terms of purchasing
power in the future. In the event that the price of palladium declines, the Sponsor expects the value of an investment in the
Shares to decline proportionately. 

RISKS
RELATED TO THE SHARES 

The
sale of the Trust s palladium to pay expenses not assumed by the Sponsor, or unexpected liabilities affecting the Trust,
at a time of low palladium prices could adversely affect the value of the Shares. 

The
Trustee sells palladium held by the Trust to pay Trust expenses not assumed by the Sponsor on an as-needed basis irrespective
of then-current palladium prices. The Trust is not actively managed and no attempt will be made to buy or sell palladium to protect
against or to take advantage of fluctuations in the price of palladium. Consequently, the Trust s palladium may be sold
at a time when the palladium price is low, resulting in the sale of more palladium than would be required if the Trust sold when
prices were higher. The sale of the Trust s palladium to pay expenses not assumed by the Sponsor, or unexpected liabilities affecting
the Trust, at a time of low palladium prices could adversely affect the value of the Shares. 

The
value of the Shares will be adversely affected if the Trust is required to indemnify the Sponsor or the Trustee under the Trust
Agreement. 

Under
the Trust Agreement, each of the Sponsor and the Trustee has a right to be indemnified from the Trust for any liability or expense
it incurs without gross negligence, bad faith, willful misconduct, willful malfeasance or reckless disregard on its part. That
means the Sponsor or the Trustee may require the assets of the Trust to be sold in order to cover losses or liability suffered
by it. Any sale of that kind would reduce the NAV of the Trust and the value of the Shares. 

The
Shares may trade at a price which is at, above or below the NAV per Share and any discount or premium in the trading price relative
to the NAV per Share may widen as a result of non-concurrent trading hours between the NYSE Arca and London, Zurich and COMEX. 

The
Shares may trade at, above or below the NAV per Share. The NAV per Share fluctuates with changes in the market value of the Trust s
assets. The trading price of the Shares fluctuates in accordance with changes in the NAV per Share as well as market supply and
demand. The amount of the discount or premium in the trading price relative to the NAV per Share may be influenced by non-concurrent
trading hours between the NYSE Arca and the major palladium markets. While the Shares trade on the NYSE Arca until 4:00 p.m. New
York time, liquidity in the market for palladium is reduced after the close of the major world palladium markets, including London,
Zurich and the COMEX. As a result, during this time, trading spreads, and the resulting premium or discount on the Shares, may
widen. 

25 

A
possible short squeeze due to a sudden increase in demand of Shares that largely exceeds supply may lead to price
volatility in the Shares. 

Investors
may purchase Shares to hedge existing palladium exposure or to speculate on the price of palladium. Speculation on the price of
palladium may involve long and short exposures. To the extent aggregate short exposure exceeds the number of Shares available
for purchase (for example, in the event that large redemption requests by Authorized Participants dramatically affect Share liquidity),
investors with short exposure may have to pay a premium to repurchase Shares for delivery to Share lenders. Those repurchases
may in turn, dramatically increase the price of the Shares until additional Shares are created through the creation process. This
is often referred to as a short squeeze. A short squeeze could lead to volatile price movements in Shares that are
not directly correlated to the price of palladium. 

Purchasing
activity in the palladium market associated with Basket creations or selling activity following Basket redemptions may affect
the price of palladium and Share trading prices. These price changes may adversely affect an investment in the Shares. 

Purchasing
activity associated with acquiring the palladium required for deposit into the Trust in connection with the creation of Baskets
may temporarily increase the market price of palladium, which will result in higher prices for the Shares. Temporary increases
in the market price of palladium may also occur as a result of the purchasing activity of other market participants. Other market
participants may attempt to benefit from an increase in the market price of palladium that may result from increased purchasing
activity of palladium connected with the issuance of Baskets. Consequently, the market price of palladium may decline immediately
after Baskets are created. If the price of palladium declines, the trading price of the Shares may also decline. 

Selling
activity associated with sales of palladium withdrawn from the Trust in connection with the redemption of Baskets may temporarily
decrease the market price of palladium, which will result in lower prices for the Shares. Temporary decreases in the market price
of palladium may also occur as a result of the selling activity of other market participants. If the price of palladium declines,
the trading price of the Shares may also decline. 

The
Sponsor is unable to ascertain whether the palladium price movements since the commencement of the Trust s initial public
offering on January 8, 2010 were attributable to the Trust s Basket creation and redemption process or independent metal
market forces or both. Nevertheless, the Trust and the Sponsor cannot assure Shareholders that future Basket creations or redemptions
will have no effect on the palladium metal prices and, consequently, Share trading prices. 

Since
there is no limit on the amount of palladium that the Trust may acquire, the Trust, as it grows, may have an impact on the supply
and demand of palladium that ultimately may affect the price of the Shares in a manner unrelated to other factors affecting the
global market for palladium. 

The
Trust Agreement places no limit on the amount of palladium the Trust may hold. Moreover, the Trust may issue an unlimited number
of Shares, subject to registration requirements, and thereby acquire an unlimited amount of palladium. The global market for palladium
is characterized by supply and demand constraints that are generally not present in the markets for other precious metals such
as gold and silver. From 2017 to 2021, world palladium mine supply averaged 6.7 million ounces, while world gross demand averaged
10.4 million ounces. If the amount of palladium acquired by the Trust is large enough in relation to global palladium supply and
demand, further in-kind creations and redemptions of Shares could have an impact on the supply and demand of palladium unrelated
to other factors affecting the global market for palladium. Such an impact could affect the price for palladium that would directly
affect the price at which Shares are traded on the Exchange or the price of future Baskets created or redeemed by the Trust. The
Trust and the Sponsor cannot provide Shareholders any assurance that increased metal holdings by the Trust in the future will
have no such long-term metal price impact thereby affecting Share trading prices. 

26 

The
Shares and their value could decrease if unanticipated operational or trading problems arise. 

There
may be unanticipated problems or issues with respect to the mechanics of the Trust s operations and the trading of the Shares
that could have a material adverse effect on an investment in the Shares. In addition, although the Trust is not actively managed 
by traditional methods, to the extent that unanticipated operational or trading problems or issues arise, the Sponsor s
past experience and qualifications may not be suitable for solving these problems or issues. 

Discrepancies,
disruptions or unreliability of the LME PM Fix could impact the value of the Trust s palladium and the market price of the
Shares. 

The
Trustee values the Trust s palladium pursuant to the LME PM Fix. In the event that the LME PM Fix proves to be an inaccurate
benchmark, or the LME PM Fix varies materially from the prices determined by other mechanisms for valuing palladium, the value
of the Trust s palladium and the market price of the Shares could be adversely impacted. Any future developments in the
LME PM Fix, to the extent it has a material impact on the LME PM Fix, could adversely impact the value of the Trust s palladium
and the market price of the Shares. It is possible that electronic failures or other unanticipated events may occur that could
result in delays in the announcement of, or the inability of the benchmark to produce, the LME PM Fix on any given date. Furthermore,
any actual or perceived disruptions that result in the perception that the LME PM Fix is vulnerable to actual or attempted manipulation
could adversely affect the behavior of market participants, which may have an effect on the price of palladium. If the LME PM
Fix is unreliable for any reason, the price of palladium and the market price for the Shares may decline or be subject to greater
volatility. 

If
the process of creation and redemption of Baskets encounters any unanticipated difficulties, the possibility for arbitrage transactions
intended to keep the price of the Shares closely linked to the price of palladium may not exist and, as a result, the price of
the Shares may fall. 

If
the processes of creation and redemption of Shares (which depend on timely transfers of palladium to and by the Custodian) encounter
any unanticipated difficulties, potential market participants who would otherwise be willing to purchase or redeem Baskets to
take advantage of any arbitrage opportunity arising from discrepancies between the price of the Shares and the price of the underlying
palladium may not take the risk that, as a result of those difficulties, they may not be able to realize the profit they expect.
If this is the case, the liquidity of Shares may decline and the price of the Shares may fluctuate independently of the price
of palladium and may fall. Additionally, redemptions could be suspended for any period during which (1) the NYSE Arca is closed
(other than customary weekend or holiday closings) or trading on the NYSE Arca is suspended or restricted, or (2) an emergency
exists as a result of which delivery, disposal or evaluation of the palladium is not reasonably practicable. 

The
liquidity of the Shares may be affected by the withdrawal from participation of one or more Authorized Participants. 

In
the event that one or more Authorized Participants having substantial interests in Shares or otherwise responsible for a significant
portion of the Shares daily trading volume on the Exchange withdraw from participation, the liquidity of the Shares will
likely decrease which could adversely affect the market price of the Shares and result in Shareholders incurring a loss on their
investment. 

Shareholders
do not have the protections associated with ownership of shares in an investment company registered under the Investment Company
Act of 1940 or the protections afforded by the Commodity Exchange Act CEA ). 

The
Trust is not registered as an investment company under the Investment Company Act of 1940 and is not required to register under
such act. Consequently, Shareholders do not have the regulatory protections provided to investors in investment companies.
The Trust does not and will not hold or trade in commodity futures contracts, commodity interests or any other instruments
regulated by the CEA, as administered by the CFTC and the National Futures Association NFA ). Furthermore, the Trust
is not a commodity pool for purposes of the CEA and the Shares are not commodity interests , and neither the Sponsor
nor the Trustee is subject to regulation by the CFTC as a commodity pool operator or a commodity trading advisor in connection
with the Trust or the Shares. Consequently, Shareholders do not have the regulatory protections provided to investors in CEA-regulated
instruments or commodity pools operated by registered commodity pool operators or advised by registered commodity trading advisors. 

27 

The
Trust may be required to terminate and liquidate at a time that is disadvantageous to Shareholders. 

If
the Trust is required to terminate and liquidate, such termination and liquidation could occur at a time which is disadvantageous
to Shareholders, such as when palladium prices are lower than the palladium prices at the time when Shareholders purchased
their Shares. In such a case, when the Trust s palladium is sold as part of the Trust s liquidation, the resulting
proceeds distributed to Shareholders will be less than if palladium prices were higher at the time of sale. 

The
lack of an active trading market for the Shares may result in losses on investment at the time of disposition of the Shares. 

Although
Shares are listed for trading on the NYSE Arca, it cannot be assumed that an active trading market for the Shares will develop
or be maintained. If an investor needs to sell Shares at a time when no active market for Shares exists, such lack of an active
market will most likely adversely affect the price the investor receives for the Shares (assuming the investor is able to sell
them). 

Shareholders
do not have the rights enjoyed by investors in certain other vehicles. 

As
interests in an investment trust, the Shares have none of the statutory rights normally associated with the ownership of shares
of a corporation (including, for example, the right to bring oppression or derivative actions). In
addition, the Shares have limited voting and distribution rights (for example, Shareholders do not have the right to elect directors
or approve amendments to the Trust Agreement and do not receive dividends). 

An
investment in the Shares may be adversely affected by competition from other methods of investing in palladium. 

The
Trust competes with other financial vehicles, including traditional debt and equity securities issued by companies in the palladium
industry and other securities backed by or linked to palladium, direct investments in palladium and investment vehicles similar
to the Trust. Market and financial conditions, and other conditions beyond the Sponsor s control, may make it more attractive
to invest in other financial vehicles or to invest in palladium directly, which could limit the market for the Shares and
reduce the liquidity of the Shares. 

The
amount of palladium represented by each Share will decrease over the life of the Trust due to the recurring deliveries of palladium
necessary to pay the Sponsor s Fee in-kind and potential sales of palladium to pay in cash the Trust expenses not assumed
by the Sponsor. Without increases in the price of palladium sufficient to compensate for that decrease, the price of the
Shares will also decline proportionately over the life of the Trust. 

The
amount of palladium represented by each Share decreases each day by the Sponsor s Fee. In addition, although the Sponsor
has agreed to assume all organizational and certain administrative and marketing expenses incurred by the Trust (the Trustee s
monthly fee and out-of-pocket expenses, the Custodian s fee and reimbursement of the Custodian s expenses under the Custody Agreements,
Exchange listing fees, SEC registration fees, printing and mailing costs, audit fees and up to 100,000 per annum in legal expenses),
in exceptional cases certain Trust expenses may need to be paid by the Trust. Because the Trust does not have any income, it must
either make payments in-kind by deliveries of palladium (as is the case with the Sponsor s Fee) or it must sell palladium
to obtain cash (as in the case of any exceptional expenses). The result of these sales of palladium and recurring deliveries
of palladium to pay the Sponsor s Fee in-kind is a decrease in the amount of palladium represented by each Share.
New deposits of palladium, received in exchange for new Shares issued by the Trust, will not reverse this trend. 

A
decrease in the amount of palladium represented by each Share results in a decrease in each Share s price even if the
price of palladium bullion does not change. To retain the Share s original price, the price of palladium
must increase. Without that increase, the lesser amount of palladium represented by the Share will have a correspondingly
lower price. If this increase does not occur, or is not sufficient to counter the lesser amount of palladium represented
by each Share, Shareholders will sustain losses on their investment in Shares. 

28 

An
increase in Trust expenses not assumed by the Sponsor, or the existence of unexpected liabilities affecting the Trust, will require
the Trustee to sell larger amounts of palladium, and will result in a more rapid decrease of the amount of palladium represented
by each Share and a corresponding decrease in its value. 

RISKS
RELATED TO THE CUSTODY OF PALLADIUM 

The
Trust s palladium may be subject to loss, damage, theft or restriction on access. 

There
is a risk that part or all of the Trust s palladium could be lost, damaged or stolen. Access to the Trust s palladium
could also be restricted by natural events (such as an earthquake) or human actions (such as a terrorist attack). Any of these
events may adversely affect the operations of the Trust and, consequently, an investment in the Shares. 

The
Trust s lack of insurance protection and the Shareholders limited rights of legal recourse against the Trust, the
Trustee, the Sponsor, the Custodian, the Zurich Sub-Custodian and any other sub-custodian exposes the Trust and its Shareholders
to the risk of loss of the Trust s palladium for which no person is liable. 

The
Trust does not insure its palladium. The Custodian maintains insurance with regard to its business on such terms and conditions
as it considers appropriate in connection with its custodial obligations and is responsible for all costs, fees and expenses arising
from the insurance policy or policies. The Trust is not a beneficiary of any such insurance and does not have the ability to dictate
the existence, nature or amount of coverage. Therefore, Shareholders cannot be assured that the Custodian maintains adequate insurance
or any insurance with respect to the palladium held by the Custodian on behalf of the Trust. In addition, the Custodian and
the Trustee do not require the Zurich Sub-Custodian or any other direct or indirect sub-custodians to be insured or bonded with
respect to their custodial activities or in respect of the palladium held by them on behalf of the Trust. Further, Shareholders 
recourse against the Trust, the Trustee and the Sponsor under New York law, the Custodian, the Zurich Sub-Custodian and any other
sub-custodian under English law, and any other sub-custodian under the law governing their custody operations is limited. Consequently,
a loss may be suffered with respect to the Trust s palladium which is not covered by insurance and for which no person
is liable in damages. 

The
Custodian s limited liability under the Custody Agreements and English law may impair the ability of the Trust to recover
losses concerning its palladium and any recovery may be limited, even in the event of fraud, to the market value of the palladium
at the time the fraud is discovered. 

The
liability of the Custodian is limited under the Custody Agreements. Under the Custody Agreements between the Trustee and the Custodian
which establish the Trust s unallocated palladium account Unallocated Account and the Trust s
allocated palladium account Allocated Account ), the Custodian is only liable for losses that are the direct
result of its own negligence, fraud or willful default in the performance of its duties. Any such liability is further limited
to the market value of the palladium lost or damaged at the time such negligence, fraud or willful default is discovered
by the Custodian provided the Custodian notifies the Trust and the Trustee promptly after the discovery of the loss or damage.
Under each Authorized Participant Unallocated Bullion Account Agreement (between the Custodian and an Authorized Participant
establishing an Authorized Participant Unallocated Account), the Custodian is not contractually or otherwise liable for any losses
suffered by any Authorized Participant or Shareholder that are not the direct result of its own gross negligence, fraud or willful
default in the performance of its duties under such agreement, and in no event will its liability exceed the market value of the
balance in the Authorized Participant Unallocated Account at the time such gross negligence, fraud or willful default is discovered
by the Custodian. For any Authorized Participant Unallocated Bullion Account Agreement between an Authorized Participant and another
palladium clearing bank, the liability of the palladium clearing bank to the Authorized Participant may be greater or lesser than
the Custodian s liability to the Authorized Participant described in the preceding sentence, depending on the terms of the
agreement. In addition, the Custodian will not be liable for any delay in performance or any non-performance of any of its obligations
under the Allocated Account Agreement, the Unallocated Account Agreement or the Authorized Participant Unallocated Bullion
Account Agreement by reason of any cause beyond its reasonable control, including acts of God, war or terrorism. As a result,
the recourse of the Trustee or a Shareholder, under English law, is limited. Furthermore, under English common law, the Custodian, the
Zurich Sub-Custodian, or any other sub-custodian will not be liable for any delay in the performance or any non-performance of
its custodial obligations by reason of any cause beyond its reasonable control. 

29 

The
obligations of the Custodian, the Zurich Sub-Custodian and any other sub-custodians are governed by English law, which may
frustrate the Trust in attempting to seek legal redress against the Custodian, the Zurich Sub-Custodian or any other sub-custodian
concerning its palladium. 

The
obligations of the Custodian under the Custody Agreements are, and the Authorized Participant Unallocated Bullion Account
Agreements may be, governed by English law. The Custodian has entered into arrangements with the Zurich Sub-Custodian and may
enter into arrangements with any other sub-custodians for the temporary custody of the Trust s palladium, which arrangements
may also be governed by English law. The Trust is a New York common law trust. Any United States, New York or other court situated
in the United States may have difficulty interpreting English law (which, insofar as it relates to custody arrangements, is largely
derived from court rulings rather than statute), LPPM rules or the customs and practices in the London custody market. It
may be difficult or impossible for the Trust to sue the Zurich Sub-Custodian or any other sub-custodian in a United States,
New York or other court situated in the United States. In addition, it may be difficult, time consuming and/or expensive for the
Trust to enforce in a foreign court a judgment rendered by a United States, New York or other court situated in the United States. 

Although
the relationship between the Custodian and the Zurich Sub-Custodian concerning the Trust s allocated palladium is expressly
governed by English law, a court hearing any legal dispute concerning their arrangement may disregard that choice of law and apply
Swiss law, in which case the ability of the Trust to seek legal redress against the Zurich Sub-Custodian may be frustrated. 

The
obligations of the Zurich Sub-Custodian under its arrangement with the Custodian with respect to the Trust s allocated palladium
is expressly governed by English law. Nevertheless, a court in the United States, England or Switzerland may determine that English
law should not apply and, instead, apply Swiss law to that arrangement. Not only might it be difficult or impossible for a United
States or English court to apply Swiss law to the Zurich Sub-Custodian s arrangement, but application of Swiss law may, among
other things, alter the relative rights and obligations of the Custodian and the Zurich Sub-Custodian to the extent that a loss
to the Trust s palladium may not have adequate or any legal redress. Further, the ability of the Trust to seek legal
redress against the Zurich Sub-Custodian may be frustrated by application of Swiss law. 

The
Trust may not have adequate sources of recovery if its palladium is lost, damaged, stolen or destroyed. 

If
the Trust s palladium is lost, damaged, stolen or destroyed under circumstances rendering a party liable to the Trust,
the responsible party may not have the financial resources sufficient to satisfy the Trust s claim. For example, as to a
particular event of loss, the only source of recovery for the Trust might be limited to the Custodian, the Zurich Sub-Custodian
or any other sub-custodian or, to the extent identifiable, other responsible third parties (e.g., a thief or terrorist), any of
which may not have the financial resources (including liability insurance coverage) to satisfy a valid claim of the Trust. 

Shareholders
and Authorized Participants lack the right under the Custody Agreements to assert claims directly against the Custodian, the Zurich
Sub-Custodian, and any other sub-custodian. 

Neither
the Shareholders nor any Authorized Participant have a right under the Custody Agreements to assert a claim of the Trust against
the Custodian, the Zurich Sub-Custodian or any other sub-custodian. Claims under the Custody Agreements may only be asserted by
the Trustee on behalf of the Trust. 

30 

The
Custodian is reliant on the Zurich Sub-Custodian for the safekeeping of all or a substantial portion of the Trust s palladium.
Furthermore, the Custodian has limited obligations to oversee or monitor the Zurich Sub-Custodian. As a result, failure by any
Zurich Sub-Custodian to exercise due care in the safekeeping of the Trust s palladium could result in a loss to the Trust. 

Palladium
generally trades on a loco London or loco Zurich basis whereby the physical palladium is held in vaults located in London or Zurich
or is transferred into accounts established in London or Zurich. The Custodian does not have a vault in Zurich and is reliant
on the Zurich Sub-Custodian for the safekeeping of all or a substantial portion of the Trust s allocated palladium. Other
than obligations to (1) use reasonable care in appointing the Zurich Sub-Custodian, (2) require any Zurich Sub-Custodian to segregate
the palladium held by it for the Trust from any other palladium held by it for the Custodian and any other customers of the Custodian
by making appropriate entries in its books and records and (3) ensure that the Zurich Sub-Custodian provides confirmation to the
Trustee that it has undertaken to segregate the palladium held by it for the Trust, the Custodian is not liable for the acts or
omissions of the Zurich Sub-Custodian. Other than as described above, the Custodian does not undertake to monitor the performance
by the Zurich Sub-Custodian of its custody functions. The Trustee s obligation to monitor the performance of the Custodian
is limited to receiving and reviewing the reports of the Custodian. The Trustee does not monitor the performance of the Zurich
Sub-Custodian or any other sub-custodian. In addition, the ability of the Trustee and the Sponsor to monitor the performance of
the Custodian may be limited because under the Custody Agreements, the Trustee and the Sponsor have only limited rights to visit
the premises of the Custodian or the Zurich Sub-Custodian for the purpose of examining the Trust s palladium and certain
related records maintained by the Custodian or Zurich Sub-Custodian. 

As
a result of the above, any failure by any Zurich Sub-Custodian to exercise due care in the safekeeping of the Trust s palladium
may not be detectable or controllable by the Custodian, the Sponsor or the Trustee and could result in a loss to the Trust. 

The
Custodian relies on its Zurich Sub-Custodian to hold the palladium allocated to the Trust Allocated Account and used to settle
redemptions. As a result, settlement of palladium in connection with redemptions loco London may require more than two business
days. 

The
Custodian is reliant on its Zurich Sub-Custodian to hold the palladium allocated to the Trust Allocated Account in order to effect
redemption of Shares. As a result, in the case for redemption orders electing palladium deliveries to be received loco London,
it may take longer than two business days for palladium to be credited to the Authorized Participant Unallocated Account, which
may result in a delay of settlement of the redemption order that is settled loco London. 

Because
the Trustee does not, and the Custodian has limited obligations to, oversee or monitor the activities of sub-custodians who may
hold the Trust s palladium, failure by the sub-custodians to exercise due care in the safekeeping of the Trust s palladium
could result in a loss to the Trust. 

Under
the Allocated Account Agreement, the Custodian may appoint from time to time one or more sub-custodians to hold the Trust s
palladium on a temporary basis pending delivery to the Custodian. The Custodian currently uses UBS AG for palladium. The Custodian may also use LPPM market-making members that provide bullion vaulting
and clearing services to third parties. The Custodian selects the Zurich Sub-Custodian, and
the Zurich Sub-Custodian maintains custody of all of the Trust s allocated palladium to be held in Zurich for the Custodian.
The Custodian is required under the Allocated Account Agreement to use reasonable care in appointing the Zurich Sub-Custodian
and any other sub-custodians, making the Custodian liable only for negligence or bad faith in the selection of such sub-custodians,
and has an obligation to use commercially reasonable efforts to obtain delivery of the Trust s palladium from any sub-custodians
appointed by the Custodian. Otherwise, the Custodian is not liable for the acts or omissions of its sub-custodians. These sub-custodians
may in turn appoint further sub-custodians, but the Custodian is not responsible for the appointment of these further sub-custodians.
The Custodian does not undertake to monitor the performance by sub-custodians of their custody functions or their selection of
further sub-custodians. The Trustee does not monitor the performance of the Custodian other than to review the reports provided
by the Custodian pursuant to the Custody Agreements and does not undertake to monitor the performance of any sub-custodian. Furthermore,
except for the Zurich Sub-Custodian, the Trustee may have no right to visit the premises of any sub-custodian for the purposes
of examining the Trust s palladium or any records maintained by the sub-custodian, and no sub-custodian will be obligated
to cooperate in any review the Trustee may wish to conduct of the facilities, procedures, records or creditworthiness of such
sub-custodian. In addition, the ability of the Trustee to monitor the performance of the Custodian and the Zurich Sub-Custodian
may be limited because under the Allocated Account Agreement and the Unallocated Account Agreement the Trustee has only limited
rights to visit the premises of the Custodian and the Zurich Sub-Custodian for the purpose of examining the Trust s palladium
and certain related records maintained by the Custodian and the Zurich Sub-Custodian. 

31 

The
obligations of any sub-custodian of the Trust s palladium are not determined by contractual arrangements but by LPPM rules
and London palladium market customs and practices, which may prevent the Trust s recovery of damages for losses on its palladium
custodied with sub-custodians. 

Except
for the Custodian s arrangement with the Zurich Sub-Custodian, there are expected to be no written contractual arrangements
between sub-custodians that hold the Trust s palladium and the Trustee or the Custodian because traditionally such arrangements
are based on the LPPM s rules and on the customs and practices of the London bullion market. In the event of a legal dispute
with respect to or arising from such arrangements, it may be difficult to define such customs and practices. The LPPM s
rules may be subject to change outside the control of the Trust. Under English law, neither the Trustee nor the Custodian would
have a supportable breach of contract claim against a sub-custodian for losses relating to the safekeeping of palladium. If the
Trust s palladium is lost or damaged while in the custody of a sub-custodian, the Trust may not be able to recover damages
from the Custodian or the sub-custodian. Whether a sub-custodian will be liable for the failure of sub-custodians appointed by
it to exercise due care in the safekeeping of the Trust s palladium will depend on the facts and circumstances of the particular
situation. Shareholders cannot be assured that the Trustee will be able to recover damages from sub-custodians whether appointed
by the Custodian or by another sub-custodian for any losses relating to the safekeeping of palladium by such sub-custodians. 

Palladium
bullion allocated to the Trust in connection with the creation of a Basket may not meet the London/Zurich Good Delivery Standards
and, if a Basket is issued against such palladium, the Trust may suffer a loss. 

Neither
the Trustee nor the Custodian independently confirms the fineness of the palladium allocated to the Trust in connection with the
creation of a Basket. The palladium bullion allocated to the Trust by the Custodian may be different from the reported fineness
or weight required by the LPPM s standards for palladium plates or ingots delivered in settlement of a palladium trade (London/Zurich
Good Delivery Standards), the standards required by the Trust. If the Trustee nevertheless issues a Basket against such palladium,
and if the Custodian fails to satisfy its obligation to credit the Trust the amount of any deficiency, the Trust may suffer a
loss . 

Palladium
held in the Trust s unallocated palladium account and any Authorized Participant s unallocated palladium account is
not segregated from the Custodian s assets. If the Custodian becomes insolvent, its assets may not be adequate to satisfy
a claim by the Trust or any Authorized Participant. In addition, in the event of the Custodian s insolvency, there may be
a delay and costs incurred in identifying the bullion held in the Trust s allocated palladium account. 

Palladium
which is part of a deposit for a purchase order or part of a redemption distribution is held for a time in the Trust Unallocated
Account and, previously or subsequently in, the Authorized Participant Unallocated Account of the purchasing or redeeming Authorized
Participant. During those times, the Trust and the Authorized Participant, as the case may be, have no proprietary rights to any
specific plates or ingots of palladium held by the Custodian and are each an unsecured creditor of the Custodian with respect
to the amount of palladium held in such unallocated accounts. In addition, if the Custodian fails to allocate the Trust s
palladium in a timely manner, in the proper amounts or otherwise in accordance with the terms of the Unallocated Account Agreement,
or if a sub-custodian fails to so segregate palladium held by it on behalf of the Trust, unallocated palladium will not be segregated
from the Custodian s assets, and the Trust will be an unsecured creditor of the Custodian with respect to the amount so
held in the event of the insolvency of the Custodian. In the event the Custodian becomes insolvent, the Custodian s assets
might not be adequate to satisfy a claim by the Trust or the Authorized Participant for the amount of palladium held in their
respective unallocated palladium accounts. 

In
the case of the insolvency of the Custodian, a liquidator may seek to freeze access to the palladium held in all of the accounts
held by the Custodian, including the Trust Allocated Account. Although the Trust would be able to claim ownership of properly
allocated palladium, the Trust could incur expenses in connection with asserting such claims, and the assertion of such a claim
by the liquidator could delay creations and redemptions of Baskets. 

32 

In
issuing Baskets, the Trustee relies on certain information received from the Custodian which is subject to confirmation after
the Trustee has relied on the information. If such information turns out to be incorrect, Baskets may be issued in exchange for
an amount of palladium which is more or less than the amount of palladium which is required to be deposited with the
Trust. 

The
Custodian s definitive records are prepared after the close of its business day. However, when issuing Baskets, the Trustee
relies on information reporting the amount of palladium credited to the Trust s accounts which it receives from the
Custodian during the business day and which is subject to correction during the preparation of the Custodian s definitive
records after the close of business. If the information relied upon by the Trustee is incorrect, the amount of palladium
actually received by the Trust may be more or less than the amount required to be deposited for the issuance of Baskets. 

GENERAL
RISKS 

The
Trust relies on the information and technology systems of the Trustee, the Custodian, the Marketing Agent and, to a lesser degree,
the Sponsor, which could be adversely affected by information systems interruptions, cybersecurity attacks or other disruptions
which could have a material adverse effect on the Trust s record keeping and operations. 

The
Custodian, the Trustee, the Marketing Agent and the Sponsor depend upon information technology infrastructure, including network,
hardware and software systems to conduct their business as it relates to the Trust. A cybersecurity incident, or a failure to
protect their computer systems, networks and information against cybersecurity threats, could result in a loss of information
and adversely impact their ability to conduct their business, including their business on behalf of the Trust. Despite implementation
of network and other cybersecurity measures, their security measures may not be adequate to protect against all cybersecurity
threats. 

War,
a major terrorist attack and other geopolitical events, including but not limited to the war between Russia and Ukraine, outbreaks
or public health emergencies (as declared by the World Health Organization), the continuation or expansion of war or other hostilities,
or a prolonged government shutdown may cause volatility in the price of Bullion due to the importance of a country or region to
the Bullion markets, market access restrictions imposed on some local Bullion producers and refiners, potential impacts to global
transportation and shipping and other supply chain disruptions. These events are unpredictable and may lead to extended periods
of price volatility. 

The
operations of the Trust, the exchanges, brokers and counterparties with which the Trust does business, and the markets in which
the Trust does business, could be severely disrupted in the event of war, a major terrorist attack and other geopolitical events,
including but not limited to, the war between Russia and Ukraine, outbreaks or public health emergencies (as declared by the World
Health Organization), the continuation or expansion of war or other hostilities, or a prolonged government shutdown. Such events
may cause volatility in the price of Bullion due to the importance of a country or region to the Bullion markets, market access
restrictions imposed on some local Bullion producers and refiners, or potential impacts to global transportation, shipping, and
other supply chain disruptions. 

In
late February 2022, Russia invaded Ukraine, significantly amplifying already existing geopolitical tensions among Russia and other
countries in the region and in the West. The responses of countries and political bodies to Russia s actions, the larger overarching
tensions, and Ukraine s military response and the potential for wider conflict may increase financial market volatility generally,
have severe adverse effects on regional and global economic markets, and cause volatility in the price of palladium and the share price
of the Trust. The conflict in Ukraine, along with global political fallout and implications including sanctions, shipping disruptions,
collateral war damage, and a potential expansion of the conflict beyond Ukraine s borders, could disturb the Bullion markets.
Russia is one of the world s largest producers of gold, palladium, platinum and silver. On March 7, 2022, the LBMA suspended its
accreditation of six Russian refiners of gold and silver, and, on April 8, 2022, the LPPM suspended its accreditation of two Russian
refiners of platinum and palladium. The LBMA and LPPM each stated that existing bars produced by the refiners before their suspension
will still be accepted as good delivery. Following an announcement at the G7 Summit to collectively ban the import of Russian
gold, the UK passed regulations which prohibit the direct or indirect (i) import of gold that originated in Russia, (ii) acquisition
of gold that originated in Russia or is located in Russia and (iii) supply or delivery of gold that originated in Russia, all
after July 21, 2022. Similarly, US regulations prohibit the import of gold of Russian origin into the United States on or after
June 28, 2022 and EU regulations prohibit the direct or indirect import, purchase or transfer of gold if it originates in Russia
and has been exported from Russia after July 22, 2022. War and other geopolitical events in eastern Europe, including but not
limited to Russia and Ukraine, may cause volatility in commodity prices including precious metals prices. These events are unpredictable
and may lead to extended periods of price volatility. 

33 

The
Trust as well as the Sponsor and its service providers are vulnerable to the effects of public health crises, including the ongoing
novel coronavirus pandemic. 

The
COVID-19 pandemic has caused major disruptions to economies and markets around the world, including the markets in which the Trust
invests, and which has and may continue to negatively impact the value of certain of the Trust s investments. Although vaccines
for COVID-19 and variants thereof are becoming more widely available, the COVID-19 pandemic and impacts thereof may continue for
an extended period of time and may vary from market to market. To the extent the impacts of COVID-19 continue, the Trust may experience
negative impacts to its business that could exacerbate other risks to which the Trust is subject. Policy and legislative changes
in countries around the world are affecting many aspects of financial regulation, and governmental and quasi-governmental authorities
and regulators throughout the world have previously responded to serious economic disruptions with a variety of significant fiscal
and monetary policy changes. 

Potential
conflicts of interest may arise among the Sponsor or its affiliates and the Trust. 

Conflicts
of interest may arise among the Sponsor and its affiliates, on the one hand, and the Trust and its Shareholders, on the other
hand. As a result of these conflicts, the Sponsor may favor its own interests and the interests of its affiliates over the Trust
and its Shareholders. As an example, the Sponsor, its affiliates and their officers and employees are not prohibited from engaging
in other businesses or activities, including those that might be in direct competition with the Trust.

Introduction 

The
abrdn Standard Palladium ETF Trust (the Trust is a trust formed under the laws of the State of New York. The Trust
does not have any officers, directors, or employees, and is administered by The Bank of New York Mellon (the Trustee acting as trustee pursuant to the Depositary Trust Agreement (the Trust Agreement between the Trustee and abrdn
ETFs Sponsor LLC, the sponsor of the Trust (the Sponsor ). The Trust issues shares Shares representing
fractional undivided beneficial interests in its net assets. The assets of the Trust consist of palladium bullion held by a custodian
as an agent of the Trust and responsible only to the Trustee. 

37 

The
Trust is a passive investment vehicle and the objective of the Trust is for the value of each Share to approximately reflect,
at any given time, the price of the palladium bullion owned by the Trust, less the Trust s liabilities (anticipated to be
principally for accrued operating expenses), divided by the number of outstanding Shares. The Trust does not engage in any activities
designed to obtain a profit from, or ameliorate losses caused by, changes in the price of palladium. 

The
Trust issues and redeems Shares only in exchange for palladium, only in aggregations of 25,000 Shares effective April 1, 2019
(prior to April 1, 2019, the number of Shares that constituted a Basket was 50,000 Shares) or integral multiples thereof (each,
a Basket ), and only in transactions with registered broker-dealers (or other securities market participants not
required to register as broker-dealers, such as a bank or other financial institution) that (1) are participants in DTC and (2)

Investing
in the Shares does not insulate the investor from certain risks, including price volatility. The following table illustrates the
movement in the NAV of the Shares against the corresponding palladium price (per 1/10 of an oz. of palladium) since inception: 

NAV
per Share vs. Palladium Price from December 30, 2009 (the Date of Inception) to December 31, 2022 

The
divergence of the NAV per Share from the palladium price over time reflects the cumulative effect of the Trust expenses that arise
if an investment had been held since inception. 

Critical
Accounting Policy 

The
financial statements and accompanying notes are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United
States of America. The preparation of these financial statements relies on estimates and assumptions that impact the Trust s
financial position and results of operations. These estimates and assumptions affect the Trust s application of accounting
policies. Below we describe the valuation of palladium bullion, a critical accounting policy that we believe is important to understanding
the results of operations and financial position. In addition, please refer to Note 2 to the Financial Statements for further
discussion of our accounting policies.

Valuation
of Palladium 

Palladium
is held by JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. (the Custodian on behalf of the Trust, at its London, England vaulting premises.
Palladium may also be held by UBS AG, or any other firm selected by the Custodian to hold the Trust s palladium in the Trust s
allocated account in the firm s Zurich vault premises and whose appointment has been approved by the Sponsor, at its Zurich,
Switzerland vaulting premises. Palladium is recorded at fair value. The cost of palladium is determined according to the average
cost method and the fair value is based on the LME PM Fix (the afternoon session of LME s twice daily electronic price fixing
process). Realized gains and losses on transfers of palladium, or palladium distributed for the redemption of Shares, are calculated
on a trade date basis as the difference between the fair value and cost of palladium transferred .

Inspection
of Palladium 

Under
the Custody Agreements, the Trustee, the Sponsor and the Trust s auditors and inspectors may, only up to twice a year, visit
the premises of the Custodian and the Zurich Sub-Custodian for the purpose of examining the Trust s palladium and certain
related records maintained by the Custodian. Under the Allocated Account Agreement, the Custodian agreed to procure similar
inspection rights from the Zurich Sub-Custodian. Any such inspection rights with respect to the Zurich Sub-Custodian are expected
to be granted in accordance with the normal course of dealing between the Custodian and the Zurich Sub-Custodian. Visits by auditors
and inspectors to the Zurich Sub-Custodian s facilities will be arranged through the Custodian. Other than with respect
to the Zurich Sub-Custodian, the Trustee and the Sponsor have no right to visit the premises of any sub-custodian for the purposes
of examining the Trust s palladium or any records maintained by the sub-custodian, and no sub-custodian is obligated
to cooperate in any review the Trustee or the Sponsor may wish to conduct of the facilities, procedures, records or creditworthiness
of such sub-custodian. 

The
Sponsor has exercised its right to visit the Custodian and the Zurich Sub-Custodian, in order to examine the palladium and
the records maintained by them. Inspections were conducted by Bureau Veritas Commodities UK Ltd, a leading commodity inspection
and testing company retained by the Sponsor, as of June 30, 2022 and December 31, 2022. 

There
can be no guarantee that the Sponsor or the Trust s auditors and inspectors will be able to perform physical inspections
of the Trust s palladium as planned. Local policies, regulations, or ordinances, as well as polices or restrictions
adopted by the Custodian or a sub-custodian, may temporarily prevent, or otherwise impair the ability of, the Sponsor or the Trust s
auditors and inspectors, from performing a physical inspection of the Trust s palladium on a desired date. In those
situations, the Sponsor or the Trust s auditors and inspectors may seek to verify the palladium held by the Trust by
alternate means, including through virtual inspections of the Trust s palladium and/or a review of pertinent records. 

Liquidity

The
Trust is not aware of any trends, demands, conditions, events or uncertainties that are reasonably likely to result in material
changes to its liquidity needs. In exchange for the Sponsor s Fee, the Sponsor has agreed to assume most of the expenses
incurred by the Trust. As a result, the only expense of the Trust during the period covered by this report was the Sponsor s
Fee. The Trust s only source of liquidity is its transfers and sales of palladium. 

The
Trustee will, at the direction of the Sponsor or in its own discretion, sell the Trust s palladium as necessary
to pay the Trust s expenses not otherwise assumed by the Sponsor. The Trustee will not sell palladium to pay the Sponsor s
Fee but will pay the Sponsor s Fee through in-kind transfers of palladium to the Sponsor. At December 31, 2022
and 2021, the Trust did not have any cash balances.

Item
9A. Controls and Procedures 

The
Trust maintains disclosure controls and procedures that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in its
Exchange Act reports is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the Securities and Exchange
Commission s rules and forms, and that such information is accumulated and communicated to the Chief Executive Officer and
Chief Financial Officer of the Sponsor, and to the audit committee, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required
disclosure. 

Under
the supervision and with the participation of the Chief Executive Officer and the Chief Financial Officer of the Sponsor, the
Sponsor conducted an evaluation of the Trust s disclosure controls and procedures, as defined under Exchange Act Rules 13a-15(e)
and 15d-15(e). Based on this evaluation, the Chief Executive Officer and the Chief Financial Officer of the Sponsor concluded
that, as of December 31, 2022, the Trust s disclosure controls and procedures were effective. 

Internal
controls over financial reporting have been maintained throughout the Trust s fiscal year ended December 31, 2022. There
have been no changes that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, the Trust s or Sponsor s
internal control over financial reporting. 

Management s
Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting 

The
Sponsor s management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting,
as defined under Exchange Act Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f). The Trust s internal control over financial reporting is a
process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial
statements for external purposes in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. Internal control
over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that: 

(1) pertain
 to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect
 the transactions and dispositions of the Trust s assets; 

(2) provide
 reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation
 of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles,
 and that the Trust s receipts and expenditures are being made only in accordance
 with appropriate authorizations; and 

(3) provide
 reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition,
 use, or disposition of the Trust s assets that could have a material effect on
 the financial statements. 

Because
of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections
of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become ineffective because of changes
in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. 

The
Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer of the Sponsor assessed the effectiveness of the Trust s internal control
over financial reporting as of December 31, 2021. In making this assessment, they used the criteria set forth by the Committee
of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO) in Internal Control Integrated Framework (2013) . Their
assessment included an evaluation of the design of the Trust s internal control over financial reporting and testing of
the operational effectiveness of its internal control over financial reporting. Based on their assessment and those criteria,
the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer of the Sponsor concluded that the Trust maintained effective internal
control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2022.

KPMG
LLP, the independent registered public accounting firm that audited and reported on the financial statements included in this

Report of Independent
Registered Public Accounting Firm 

To the Sponsor, Trustee and Shareholders 
abrdn Palladium
ETF Trust: 

Opinion on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting 

 We have audited abrdn Palladium ETF Trust's (known as
Aberdeen Standard Palladium ETF Trust prior to March 31, 2022) (the Trust) internal control over financial reporting as of December 31,
2022, based on criteria established in Internal Control Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring
Organizations of the Treadway Commission. In our opinion, the Trust maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over
financial reporting as of December 31, 2022, based on criteria established in Internal Control Integrated Framework (2013)
 issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. 

We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the
Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the statements of assets and liabilities of the Trust, including the
schedules of investments, as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, the related statements of operations and changes in net assets and the financial
highlights for each of the years in the three-year period ended December 31, 2022, and the related notes (collectively, the financial
statements), and our report dated February 28, 2023 expressed an unqualified opinion on those financial statements. 

Basis for Opinion 

 The Trust s management is responsible for maintaining
effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting,
included in the accompanying Management s Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express
an opinion on the Trust s internal control over financial reporting based on our audit. We are a public accounting firm registered
with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Trust in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the
applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. 

We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards
of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal
control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audit of internal control over financial reporting included
obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing
and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk. Our audit also included performing
such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion. 

Definition and Limitations of Internal Control Over Financial
Reporting 

 A company s internal control over financial reporting
is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial
statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company s internal control over
financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail,
accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions
are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and
that receipts and expenditures of the 

company are being made only in
accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or
timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company s assets that could have a material effect on the
financial statements. 

Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial
reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject
to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or
procedures may deteriorate.

To the Sponsor, Trustee and Shareholders 
abrdn Palladium
ETF Trust: 

Opinion on the Financial Statements 

 We have audited the accompanying statements of assets and
liabilities of abrdn Palladium ETF Trust (known as Aberdeen Standard Palladium ETF Trust prior to March 31, 2022) (the Trust), including
the schedules of investments, as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, the related statements of operations and changes in net assets and the
financial highlights for each of the years in the three-year period ended December 31, 2022, and the related notes (collectively, the
financial statements). In our opinion, the financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the
Trust as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, and the results of its operations, changes in its net assets and financial highlights for each
of the years in the three-year period ended December 31, 2022, in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. 

We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the
Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the Trust s internal control over financial reporting as of December
31, 2022, based on criteria established in Internal Control Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring
Organizations of the Treadway Commission, and our report dated February 28, 2023 expressed an unqualified opinion on the effectiveness
of the Trust s internal control over financial reporting. 

Basis for Opinion 

 These financial statements are the responsibility of the Trust s
management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting
firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Trust in accordance with the U.S. federal securities
laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. 

We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the
PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements
are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. Our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material
misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures
included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audits also included
evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation
of the financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion. 

Critical Audit Matter 

 The critical audit matter communicated below is a matter
arising from the current period audit of the financial statements that was communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee
and that: (1) relates to accounts or disclosures that are material to the financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging,
subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of a critical audit matter does not alter in any way our opinion on the financial
statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matter below, providing a separate opinion on the critical
audit matter or on the accounts or disclosures to which it relates. 

Evaluation of the evidence pertaining to the existence of the
palladium holdings 

 As presented on the December 31, 2022 schedule of investments
and in Note 2.2, the fair value of the Trust s investment in palladium is 295,638 thousand, representing 100.05 of the Trust s
net assets, and 166,556 ounces of palladium holdings. The investment in palladium was held by a third-party custodian or sub-custodian
(collectively, the custodian). 

We identified the evaluation of the evidence pertaining
to the existence of the palladium holdings as a critical audit matter. Given the nature and volume of the palladium holdings, subjective
auditor judgment was required to evaluate the extent and nature of evidence obtained to assess the existence of palladium held by the
custodian. 

The following are the primary procedures we performed to address
this critical audit matter. We evaluated the design and tested the operating effectiveness of certain internal controls related to the
critical audit matter. This included controls over (1) the comparison of the Trust s records of palladium held to the custodian s
records, (2) the approval of palladium deposits and withdrawals by the trustee of the Trust and (3) the physical counts of the Trust s
palladium holdings performed at the custodian s locations by a third party engaged by the Trust s sponsor. We obtained a schedule
directly from the custodian of the Trust s palladium holdings held by the custodian as of December 31, 2022. We compared the total
ounces on such schedule to the Trust s record of palladium holdings. We also attended and observed a part of the physical counts
of the Trust s palladium holdings. We obtained and read the physical counts results reports of the third party and reconciled those
reports to both the Trust s and custodian s records.

Notes to the Financial Statements 

Shares (also referred to as Baskets in exchange for deposits of palladium and distributes palladium in connection with the redemption of Baskets. Shares
represent units of fractional undivided beneficial interest in and ownership of the Trust which are issued by the Trust. The Sponsor
is a Delaware limited liability company and a wholly-owned subsidiary of abrdn Inc. abrdn Inc. is a wholly-owned indirect subsidiary
of abrdn (formerly known as Standard Life Aberdeen) plc. The Trust is governed by the Trust Agreement. 

The
investment objective of the Trust is for the Shares to reflect the performance of the price of palladium, less the Trust s
expenses and liabilities. The Trust is designed to provide an individual owner of beneficial interests in the Shares (a Shareholder an opportunity to participate in the palladium market through an investment in securities. 

Effective
June 25, 2021, Christopher Demetriou resigned as President and Chief Executive Officer of the Sponsor. Mr. Demetriou had served
as Principal Executive Officer of the Registrant. Effective June 25, 2021, Steven Dunn was appointed President and Chief Executive
Officer of the Sponsor. Mr. Dunn will serve as Principal Executive Officer of the Registrant. 

of the Trust s palladium
was held by one or more sub-custodians. 

The
Trust s palladium is recorded at fair value. The cost of palladium is determined according to the average cost method and the
fair value is based on the afternoon session of the twice daily fix of an ounce of palladium administered by the London Metal
Exchange LME (the LME PM Fix ). Realized gains and losses on transfers of palladium, or palladium
distributed for the redemption of Shares, are calculated on a trade date basis as the difference between the fair value and average cost
of palladium transferred. 

The
LME is responsible for the administration of the electronic palladium price fixing system LMEbullion that
replicates electronically the manual London palladium fix processes previously employed by the London Platinum and Palladium Fixing
Company Ltd LPPFCL ), as well as providing electronic market clearing processes for palladium bullion transactions
at the fixed prices established by the LME pricing mechanism. LMEbullion, like the previous London palladium fix processes, establishes
and publishes fixed prices for troy ounces of palladium twice each London trading day during fixing sessions beginning at 9:45
a.m. London time (the LME AM Fix and 2:00 p.m. London time (the LME PM Fix ). 

Once
the value of palladium has been determined, the net asset value (the NAV is computed by the Trustee
by deducting all accrued fees, expenses and other liabilities of the Trust, including the remuneration due to the Sponsor (the
 Sponsor s Fee ), from the fair value of the palladium and all other assets held by the Trust. 

The
Trust recognizes changes in fair value of the investment in palladium as changes in unrealized gains or losses on investment
in palladium through the Statement of Operations. 

The
per Share amount of palladium exchanged for a purchase or redemption is calculated daily by the Trustee using the LME PM
Fix to calculate the palladium amount in respect of any liabilities for which covering palladium sales have not yet
been made, and represents the per Share amount of palladium held by the Trust, after giving effect to its liabilities, to
cover expenses and liabilities and any losses that may have occurred. 

Fair
Value Hierarchy 

ASC
820 establishes a hierarchy that prioritizes inputs to valuation techniques used to measure fair value. The three levels of inputs
are as follows: 

Level
1. Unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities that the Trust has the ability to access. 

Level
2. Observable inputs other than quoted prices included in level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability either directly
or indirectly. These inputs may include quoted prices for the identical instrument on
an inactive market, prices for similar instruments and similar data. 

Level
3. Unobservable inputs for the asset or liability to the extent that relevant observable inputs are not available, representing
the Trust s own assumptions about the assumptions that a market participant would use in valuing the asset or liability,
and that would be based on the best information available. 

To
the extent that valuation is based on models or inputs that are less observable or unobservable in the market, the determination
of fair value requires more judgment. Accordingly, the degree of judgment exercised in determining fair value is greatest for
instruments categorized in level 3. 

The
inputs used to measure fair value may fall into different levels of the fair value hierarchy. In such cases, for disclosure purposes,
the level in the fair value hierarchy within which the fair value measurement falls in its entirety is determined based on the
lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement in its entirety. 

The
Trust s investment in palladium is classified as a level 1 asset, as its value is calculated using unadjusted
quoted prices from primary market sources. 

There were no transfers between levels during the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021.

Shares).
The Trust issues Shares in Baskets to Authorized Participants on an ongoing basis. Individual investors cannot purchase or redeem
Shares in direct transactions with the Trust. An Authorized Participant is a person who (1) is a registered broker-dealer or other
securities market participant such as a bank or other financial institution which is not required to register as a broker-dealer
to engage in securities transactions; (2) is a participant in The Depository Trust Company; (3) has entered into an Authorized
Participant Agreement with the Trustee and the Sponsor; and (4) has established an Authorized Participant Unallocated Account
with the Trust s Custodian or other palladium bullion clearing bank. An Authorized Participant Agreement is an agreement
entered into by each Authorized Participant, the Sponsor and the Trustee which provides the procedures for the creation and redemption
of Baskets and for the delivery of the palladium required for such creations and redemptions. An Authorized Participant
Unallocated Account is an unallocated palladium account, either loco London or loco Zurich, established with the Custodian
or a palladium bullion clearing bank by an Authorized Participant. 

The
creation and redemption of Baskets is only made in exchange for the delivery to the Trust or the distribution by the Trust of
the amount of palladium represented by the Baskets being created or redeemed, the amount of which is based on the combined
NAV of the number of Shares included in the Baskets being created or redeemed determined on the day the order to create or redeem
Baskets is properly received. 

Authorized
Participants may, on any business day, place an order with the Trustee to create or redeem one or more Baskets. The typical settlement
period for Shares is two business days. In the event of a trade date at period end, where a settlement is pending, a respective
account receivable and/or payable will be recorded. When palladium is exchanged in settlement of a redemption, it is considered
a sale of palladium for financial statement purposes. 

The
amount of palladium represented by the Baskets created or redeemed can only be settled to the nearest 1/1000th of an ounce.
As a result, the value attributed to the creation or redemption of Shares may differ from the value of palladium to
be delivered or distributed by the Trust. In order to ensure that the correct amount of palladium is available at all times
to back the Shares, the Sponsor accepts an adjustment to its management fees in the event of any shortfall or excess on each transaction.
For each transaction, this amount is not more than 1/1000th of an ounce of palladium. 

As
the Shares of the Trust are subject to redemption at the option of Authorized Participants, the Trust has classified the outstanding
Shares as Net Assets. Changes in the number of Shares outstanding are presented in the Statement of Changes in Net Assets. 

reserves for uncertain tax positions are required as of December 31, 2022 or December 31, 2021.

The
Sponsor has agreed to assume administrative and marketing expenses incurred by the Trust, including the Trustee s monthly
fee and out of pocket expenses, the Custodian s fee and the reimbursement of the Custodian s expenses, exchange listing
fees, United States Securities and Exchange Commission (the SEC registration fees, printing and mailing costs,
audit fees and up to per annum in legal expenses.

At December
31, 2022 and at December 31, 2021, the fees payable to the Sponsor were and , respectively. 

With
respect to expenses not otherwise assumed by the Sponsor, the Trustee will, at the direction of the Sponsor or in its own discretion,
sell the Trust s palladium as necessary to pay these expenses. When selling palladium to pay expenses, the Trustee
will endeavor to sell the smallest amounts of palladium needed to pay these expenses in order to minimize the Trust s
holdings of assets other than palladium. Other than the Sponsor s Fee, the Trust had expenses during the years ended December
31, 2022 and 2021. 

Unless
otherwise directed by the Sponsor, when selling palladium the Trustee will endeavor to sell at the price established by the
LME PM Fix. The Trustee will place orders with dealers (which may include the Custodian) through which the Trustee expects to
receive the most favorable price and execution of orders. The Custodian may be the purchaser of such palladium only if the
sale transaction is made at the next LME PM Fix or such other publicly available price that the Sponsor deems fair, in each case
as set following the sale order. A gain or loss is recognized based on the difference between the selling price and the average
cost of the palladium sold. Neither the Trustee nor the Sponsor is liable for depreciation or loss incurred by reason of
any sale. 

Realized
gains and losses result from the transfer of palladium for Share redemptions and / or to pay expenses and are recognized
on a trade date basis as the difference between the fair value and average cost of palladium transferred.
