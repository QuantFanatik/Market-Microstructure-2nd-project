 Our global project pipeline 
 Newmont s project pipeline supports stable production with improving margins and mine life. Near-term development capital projects are presented below. Additional projects represent incremental improvements to production and cost guidance. 
 Ahafo North, Africa. This project expands our existing footprint in Ghana with four open pit mines and a stand-alone mill located approximately 30 kilometers from the Company s Ahafo South operations and will deliver value through the open pit mining and processing of over three million ounces of gold over a 13-year mine life. The project is expected to add between 275,000 and 325,000 ounces per year for the first five full years of production beginning in 2026. Capital costs for the project are estimated to be between 950 and 1,050 with an expected commercial production date in late 2025. Development capital costs (excluding capitalized interest) since approval were 212, of which 145 related to 2022. 
 Tanami Expansion 2, Australia. This project secures Tanami s future as a long-life, low-cost producer with potential to extend mine life to 2040 through the addition of a 1,460 meter hoisting shaft and supporting infrastructure to achieve higher production and provide a platform for future growth. The expansion is expected to increase average annual gold production by approximately 150,000 to 200,000 ounces per year for the first five years beginning in 2026 and is expected to reduce operating costs by approximately 10 percent. Capital costs for the project are estimated to be between 1,200 and 1,300 with an expected commercial production date in late 2025. Development capital costs (excluding capitalized interest) since approval were 499, of which 215 related to 2022. 
 We manage our wider project portfolio to maintain flexibility to address the development risks associated with our projects including permitting, local community and government support, engineering and procurement availability, technical issues, escalating costs and other associated risks that could adversely impact the timing and costs of certain opportunities.

PART I 
 
 ITEM 1. BUSINESS (dollars in millions, except per share, per ounce and per pound amounts) 
 
 Introduction 
 Newmont Corporation was incorporated in 1921 and is primarily a gold producer with significant operations and/or assets in the United States, Canada, Mexico, Dominican Republic, Peru, Suriname, Argentina, Chile, Australia and Ghana. At December 31, 2022, Newmont had attributable proven and probable gold reserves of 96.1 million ounces, attributable measured and indicated gold resources of 75.3 million ounces, attributable inferred gold resources of 36.1 million ounces, and an aggregate land position of approximately 23,700 square miles (61,500 square kilometers). Newmont is also engaged in the production of copper, silver, lead and zinc. As the world s leading gold company, Newmont remains committed to creating value and improving lives through sustainable and responsible mining. 
 Newmont s corporate headquarters are in Denver, Colorado, U.S. In this report, Newmont, the Company, our and we refer to Newmont Corporation together with our affiliates and subsidiaries, unless the context otherwise requires. 
 
 Segment Information 
 Our operations are organized in five geographic regions: North America, South America, Australia, Africa and Nevada. Our North America segment consists primarily of Cripple Creek Victor CC V in the U.S., Musselwhite, Porcupine and l onore in Canada and Pe asquito in Mexico. Our South America segment consists primarily of Yanacocha in Peru, Merian in Suriname, Cerro Negro in Argentina and our 40 equity interest in the Pueblo Viejo mine in the Dominican Republic. Our Australia segment consists primarily of Boddington and Tanami in Australia. Our Africa segment consists primarily of Ahafo and Akyem in Ghana. Our Nevada segment consists of our 38.5 interest in Nevada Gold Mines ("NGM") in the U.S., which is accounted for using the proportionate consolidation method. 
 In January 2023, Newmont launched certain initiatives to reassess accountabilities of the senior leadership team and the Company's operating strategies for its operations. Depending on the timing and outcome of this assessment, the Company may change its reportable segments in 2023. 
 For information on acquisitions and asset sales impacting the comparability of our results, refer to Notes 1 and 8 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, respectively. 
 Refer to Item 1A, Risk Factors, below, and Note 3 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further information relating to our reportable segments. Refer to Note 4 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for information relating to domestic and export sales and lack of dependence on a limited number of customers. 
 
 Products 
 References in this report to attributable means that portion of gold, copper, silver, lead or zinc produced, sold or included in proven and probable reserves and measured, indicated and inferred resources based on our proportionate ownership, unless otherwise noted. 
 Gold 
 General. We had consolidated gold production from continuing operations of 5.8 million ounces (6.0 million attributable gold ounces) in 2022, 5.9 million ounces (6.0 million attributable gold ounces) in 2021 and 5.8 million ounces (5.9 million attributable gold ounces) in 2020. Attributable gold ounces produced includes 0.3, 0.3, and 0.4 million attributable gold ounces for the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively, related to the Pueblo Viejo mine, which is 40 owned by Newmont and accounted for as an equity method investment. Of our 2022 consolidated gold production, approximately 25 came from North America, 16 from South America, 22 from Australia, 17 from Africa and 20 from Nevada. 
 For 2022, 2021 and 2020, 87 , 86 and 90 , respectively, of our Sales were attributable to gold. Most of our Sales come from the sale of refined gold. The end product at our gold operations, however, is generally dor bars. Dor is an alloy consisting primarily of gold but also containing silver and other metals. Dor is sent to refiners to produce bullion that meets the required market standard of 99.95 gold. Under the terms of our refining agreements, the dor bars are refined for a fee, and our share of the refined gold and the separately-recovered silver is credited to our account or delivered to buyers. A portion of gold sold from Pe asquito in North America and Boddington in Australia is sold in a concentrate containing other metals such as copper, silver, lead and/or zinc. 
 Gold Uses. Gold generally is used for fabrication or investment. Fabricated gold has a variety of end uses, including jewelry, electronics, dentistry, industrial and decorative uses, medals, medallions and official coins. Gold investors buy gold bullion, official coins and jewelry. 
 Gold Supply. A combination of mine production, recycling and draw-down of existing gold stocks held by governments, financial institutions, industrial organizations and private individuals make up the annual gold supply. Based on public information

Table of Contents 

available, for the years 2020 through 2022, mine production has averaged approximately 75 of the annual gold supply with the remainder primarily sourced from recycled gold. 
 Gold Price. The following table presents the annual high, low and average daily afternoon LBMA Gold Price over the past ten years on the London Bullion Market /ounce): 
 Year High Low Average 2023 (through February 16, 2023) 
 1,955 1,835 1,891 2022 2,039 1,629 1,800 2021 1,943 1,684 1,799 2020 2,067 1,474 1,770 2019 1,546 1,270 1,393 2018 1,355 1,178 1,268 2017 1,346 1,151 1,257 2016 1,366 1,077 1,251 2015 1,296 1,049 1,160 2014 1,385 1,142 1,266 2013 1,694 1,192 1,411 
 On February 16, 2023, the afternoon LBMA gold price was 1,837 per ounce. 
 Refer to Note 2 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for information on how we recognize revenue for gold sales from dor production. 
 Other Co-product Metals 
 Generally, if a metal expected to be mined represents more than 10 to 20 of the life of mine sales value of all the metal expected to be mined, the metal is considered a co-product and recognized as Sales in the Consolidated Financial Statements. 
 Copper production at Boddington and silver, lead and zinc production at Pe asquito are considered co-products. Copper, silver, lead and zinc sales are generally in the form of concentrate that is sold to smelters for further treatment and refining. 
 The following table details consolidated co-product production and the percentage of Sales that was attributable to copper, silver, lead and zinc for the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021, and 2020: 
 2022 2021 2020 Co-product Production Sales as of Total Sales Co-product Production Sales as of Total Sales Co-product Production Sales as of Total Sales Copper (pounds/millions) (1) 
 84 3 71 2 56 1 Silver (ounces/millions) (2) 
 29.7 5 31.4 5 27.8 5 Lead (pounds/millions) (2) 
 149 1 177 2 179 1 Zinc (pounds/millions) (2) 
 377 4 435 5 381 3 ____________________________ 
 (1) All of our copper co-product production came from Australia. 
 (2) All of our silver, lead and zinc co-product production came from North America. 
 By-product Metals 
 If a metal expected to be mined falls below the co-product sales value percentages, the metal is considered a by-product. Revenues from by-product sales are credited to Costs applicable to sales in the Consolidated Financial Statements. 
 Aside from the co-product sales at Boddington and Pe asquito, copper and silver produced at other Newmont sites are by-product metals. 
 Gold and Other Metals Processing Methods 
 Dor . Gold is extracted from naturally-oxidized ores by either milling or heap leaching, depending on the amount of gold contained in the ore, the amenability of the ore to treatment and related capital and operating costs. Higher grade oxide ores are generally processed through mills, where the ore is ground into a fine powder and mixed with water into a slurry, which then passes through a carbon-in-leach circuit to recover the gold. Lower grade oxide ores are generally processed using heap leaching. Heap leaching consists of stacking crushed or run-of-mine ore on impermeable, synthetically lined pads where a weak cyanide solution is applied to the surface of the heap to dissolve the gold contained within the ore. In both cases, the gold-bearing solution is then collected and pumped to process facilities to remove the gold by collection on carbon or by zinc precipitation.

Gold contained in ores that are not naturally-oxidized can be directly milled if the gold is liberated and amenable to cyanidation, generally known as free milling ores. Ores that are not amenable to cyanidation, known as refractory ores, require more costly and complex processing techniques than oxide or free milling ore. Higher grade refractory ores are processed through either roasters or autoclaves. Roasters heat finely ground ore to a high temperature, burn off the carbon and oxidize the sulfide minerals that prevent efficient leaching. Autoclaves use heat, oxygen and pressure to oxidize sulfide ores. 
 Some gold sulfide ores may be processed through a flotation plant. In flotation, ore is finely ground, turned into slurry, then placed in a tank known as a flotation cell. Chemicals are added to the slurry causing the gold-containing sulfides to attach to air bubbles and float to the top of the tank. The sulfides are removed from the cell and converted into a concentrate that can then be processed in an autoclave or roaster to recover the gold. 
 Concentrate. At Pe asquito, sulfide ore is delivered to a crushing and grinding plant which feeds a sulfide processing plant. The sulfide processing plant primarily comprises lead and zinc flotation stages. In the lead and zinc flotation, the slurry is conditioned with reagents to activate the desired minerals and produce lead and zinc concentrate. The lead concentrate is highly enriched in gold and silver, with a smaller fraction of the precious metal recovered in the zinc concentrate. The resulting concentrate is sold to smelters or traders for further processing. 
 At Boddington, ore containing copper and gold is crushed to a coarse size at the mine and then transported via conveyor to a process plant, where it is further crushed and then finely ground as a slurry. The ore is initially treated by successive stages of flotation resulting in a gold/copper concentrate containing approximately 15 to 20 copper. The flotation tailings have a residual gold content that is recovered in a carbon-in-leach circuit. 
 
 Competition 
 The top 10 producers of gold comprise approximately twenty-five percent of total worldwide mined gold production. We currently rank as the top gold producer with approximately five percent of estimated total worldwide mined gold production. Our competitive position is based on the size and grade of our ore bodies anchored in favorable mining jurisdictions and our ability to manage costs compared with other producers. We have a diverse portfolio of mining operations with varying ore grades and cost structures. Our costs are driven by the location, grade and nature of our ore bodies, and the level of input costs, including energy, labor and equipment. The metals markets are cyclical, and our ability to maintain our competitive position over the long term is based on our ability to acquire and develop quality deposits, hire and retain a skilled workforce, and to manage our costs. 
 
 Licenses and Concessions 
 Other than operating licenses for our mining and processing facilities, there are no third party patents, licenses or franchises material to our business. In many countries, however, we conduct our mining and exploration activities pursuant to concessions granted by, or under contracts with, the host government. These countries include, among others, the United States, Canada, Mexico, Peru, Suriname, Argentina, Australia and Ghana. Refer to Item 2, Properties, below for further information on licenses and concessions by property. The concessions and contracts are subject to the political risks associated with the host country. Refer to Item 1A, Risk Factors, below for further information. 
 
 Condition of Physical Assets and Insurance 
 Our business is capital intensive and requires ongoing capital investment for the replacement, modernization or expansion of equipment and facilities. Refer to Results of Consolidated Operations and Liquidity and Capital Resources within Part II, Item 7, MD A, for further information. 
 We maintain insurance policies against property loss and business interruption and insure against risks that are typical in the operation of our business, in amounts that we believe to be reasonable. Such insurance, however, contains exclusions and limitations on coverage, particularly with respect to environmental liability and political risk. There can be no assurance that claims would be paid under such insurance policies in connection with a particular event. Refer to Item 1A, Risk Factors, below for further information. 
 
 Environmental, Social and Governance 
 ESG Overview. Focusing on leading environmental, social and governance ("ESG") practices are a core part of Newmont s business. Widely recognized for our principled ESG practices, we have been consistently ranked as a leader in the mining and metal sector S P Global, and we have been listed on the Dow Jones Sustainability World Index DJSI World since 2007. 
 ESG is a key part of how we make investment decisions and central to our culture and purpose to create value and improve lives through sustainable and responsible mining. Sustainability and safety are integrated into the business at all levels of the organization through our global policies, standards, strategies, business plans and remuneration plans. In 2022, we refreshed our Sustainability and External Relations Strategy with the review and oversight of our Board and Safety Sustainability Committee to better reflect how ESG practices and expectations have evolved with a vision to generate shared value and serve as a catalyst for sustainable development. In support of our vision, our updated strategy is made up of four strategic pillars: 
 7 

Table of Contents 

Leadership Demonstrate consistent and courageous leadership through our words and actions 
 Integration Integrate leading sustainability practices into our overall business processes and decision-making 
 Engagement Build trust and credibility through respectful and meaningful engagement, communication and transparent reporting 
 Performance Deliver leading environmental and social performance to manage risk and achieve beneficial outcomes 
 Driving our sustainability practices and supporting our ability to meet the ambitions of each strategic pillar are the following critical enablers: 
 Environmental stewardship Leading practices through the enhancement of shared resources and reduction of long-term liabilities incorporating nature, water and climate 
 Social responsibility Leading practices that mitigate impacts, generate value for local communities and governments, and promote transparent and meaningful engagement to build credibility and support our reputation 
 Governance Leading practices through an effective standardized framework that includes global policies and standards integrated risk management systems; metrics and targets to measure our performance; and processes to enable transparent reporting and improved collaboration and ensure optimal decision-making and resource allocation 
 ESG Stakeholder Engagement . We engage regularly with relevant stakeholders, who we consider to be any person or organization potentially impacted by our activities or influential to our success, which allows us to gain a greater understanding of their needs, interests and perspectives while, at the same time, encouraging shared decision making to promote mutually beneficial outcomes. These engagements also inform what information is most useful for stakeholders for the purposes of our non-financial reporting. Newmont also engages with a variety of organizations at a global, regional, national and local level to adhere to high standards of governance, social and environmental policies and performance. These memberships and voluntary commitments reflect our values, support our approach to working collaboratively on best practices across several key matters and allow external stakeholders to hold us accountable. Our participation in industry initiatives, wherein we often take a leadership role, allows us to inform and influence global standards and practices, as well as gain insight into emerging expectations and issues. 
 ESG Reporting . We believe that transparency and accountability are key attributes of governance. Since 2003, Newmont has been reporting on how we manage the sustainability issues of relevance to stakeholders around the globe. Our sustainability report provides an annual review of non-financial performance updates on governance, strategy and management approach, risk management, and performance and targets in key areas that include health, safety and security, workforce, the environment, supply chain, social acceptance, business integrity and compliance, value sharing, and equity, inclusion and diversity domains. Our sustainability report is compiled in accordance with the Global Reporting Initiative ("GRI") 2021 Universal Standards Core option, the GRI Mining and Metals Sector Supplement, and the SASB Metals Mining standards, is externally assured, and reflects Newmont s commitment to transparency and reporting obligations as a founding member of the International Council on Mining and Metals ("ICMM") and as an early adopter of the United Nations ("UN") Guiding Principles Reporting Framework. Additionally, our sustainability report aligns with the ICMM's Mining Principles' Performance Expectations, GISTM and the World Gold Council's Responsible Gold Mining Principles. 
 Newmont s sustainability reporting suite also includes our climate report, sustainability-linked bond framework, ESG data tables, conflict-free gold report, policy influence disclosures, political spending disclosures, economic impact reports, taxes and royalties contributions report, CDP (formerly, Carbon Disclosure Project responses, and other reports and responses, which can be found on our website at www.newmont.com/sustainability. The information on our website, including, without limitation, in the annual sustainability report and climate report, should not be deemed incorporated by reference into this annual report or otherwise filed for purposes of Section 18 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, or otherwise subject to the liabilities of that section. 
 
 Environmental Practices 
 Climate Change. We accept the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change s ("IPCC") assessment of climate science, and we acknowledge that human activities contribute to climate change and business has an important role in addressing this global challenge. It is our firm belief that climate change is one of the greatest global challenges of our time. For a discussion of climate-related risks, refer to Item 1A, Risk Factors. 
 Climate Targets and Initiatives to Achieve. As the world s leading gold mining company, we believe that value-creation industries like mining have a responsibility to drive bold actions and innovation to transition us to a low-carbon economy. In an effort to play our part in addressing climate change, in 2020 we announced science-based, GHG emissions reduction targets of 32 for Scope 1 and Scope 2 and 30 for Scope 3 by 2030 ("2030 climate targets"), with an ultimate goal of being carbon neutral by 2050. Our 2030 targets have been approved and validated by the Science-Based Targets initiative, which ensures that our targets support the Paris Agreement s goal of limiting global warming to well below 2 degrees Celsius compared to pre-industrial levels.

Our most significant opportunities to reduce emissions exist in building or deploying cleaner energy solutions at the mine sites, as well as the greening of the electrical grid that supplies energy to our operations. Since announcing our 2030 climate targets, we have taken steps to invest in climate change initiatives in support of our goal. As part of these initiatives, in November 2021, Newmont announced a strategic alliance with Caterpillar Inc. CAT with the aim to develop and implement a comprehensive all-electric autonomous mining system to achieve safer and more productive operations while also supporting Newmont in achieving our climate targets. Newmont pledged an investment of 100 to CAT, of which 39 has been paid as of December 31, 2022. These dollars fund collaborative work to develop and deploy electric equipment for surface and underground mining at Newmont s Cripple Creek Victor mine in Colorado, U.S. and Tanami mine in Northern Territory, Australia. Other investments supporting our climate change initiatives are expected to include emissions reduction projects and renewable energy opportunities as we seek to achieve these climate targets. 
 We also see sustainable finance as a way to further demonstrate Newmont's commitment to achieving our 2030 climate targets. In December 2021, Newmont became the first in the mining industry to issue a sustainability-linked bond, with the registered public offering of 1 billion aggregate principal amount of 2.6 Sustainability-Linked Senior Notes due 2032 (the "Notes"), with the coupon linked to Newmont s performance against key ESG commitments regarding 2030 climate targets and the representation of women in senior leadership roles target. In connection with the issuance of the Notes, Newmont published a Sustainability-Linked Bond Framework and obtained a second party opinion on the framework from Institutional Shareholder Services group of companies ("ISS") ESG. This follows Newmont s decision earlier in 2021 to amend its revolving credit facility to include an interest rate margin adjustment based on the Company s ESG external ratings. The Notes and Revolver align Newmont s business and financing with its commitments and values by creating a direct link between its sustainability performance and funding strategies. 
 In addition to our focus on reducing carbon emissions, we believe that access to clean, safe water is a human right, and reliable water supplies are vital for hygiene, sanitation, livelihoods and the health of the environment. Because water is also critical to our business, we recognize the need to use water efficiently, protect water resources, and collaborate with the stakeholders within the watersheds where we operate to effectively manage this shared resource. We operate in water-stressed areas with limited supply and increasing population and water demand. Increasing pressure on water use may occur due to increased populations in and around communities in proximity to our operations. We have set annual water efficiency targets through 2023 to reduce freshwater consumption and developed water action plans in support of our goal to achieve water stewardship. 
 Biodiversity. Our operations span four continents in a range of ecosystems that include tropical, desert and arctic climates. We understand the impact our activities can have on the environment and are committed to protect and prevent or otherwise minimize, mitigate and remediate those impacts in the areas where we operate through responsible management during all aspects of the mine lifecycle and collaboration with stakeholders to develop integrated approaches to land use. 
 Our Environmental Impact. We conduct our operations so as to protect public health and the environment and believe our operations are in compliance with applicable laws and regulations in all material respects. Our mining and exploration activities are subject to various laws and regulations in multiple jurisdictions governing the protection of the environment. These laws and regulations are continually changing and are generally becoming more restrictive. 
 Our Environmental Reclamation and Remediation Commitments. Each operating mine has a reclamation plan in place that meets, in all material respects, applicable legal and regulatory requirements. We are also involved in several matters concerning environmental obligations associated with former, primarily historic, mining activities. Generally, these matters concern developing and implementing remediation plans at the various sites. The reclamation and remediation stage is a multifaceted process with complex risks. Successfully closing and reclaiming mines is crucial for gaining stakeholder trust and maintaining social acceptance. Notably, Newmont is committed to the implementation of the GISTM and all tailing storage facilities are expected to be in conformance with the GISTM by 2025. Compliance with GISTM remains on-going and has and may continue to result in further increases to our sustaining costs and estimated closure costs. Additionally, laws, regulations and permit requirements focused on water management and discharge requirements for operations and water treatment in connection with closure are becoming increasingly stringent. Compliance with water management and discharge quality remains dynamic and has and may continue to result in further increases to our estimated closure costs. For a discussion of the most significant reclamation and remediation activities, refer to Note 5 and Note 25 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. For discussion of regulatory, tailings storage facilities, water, climate and other environmental risks, refer to Item 1A, Risk Factors, for additional information. 
 
 Social Practices 
 Our People. At Newmont, one of the strategic pillars is people. 
 The success of our business comes from the accomplishments and well-being of our employees and contractors. That is why we strive to build a workplace culture that fosters leaders where everyone belongs, thrives, and is valued. 
 At December 31, 2022, approximately 14,600 people were employed by Newmont and Newmont subsidiaries and approximately 17,800 people were working as contractors in support of Newmont s operations and attainment of our objectives. Additionally, at December 31, 2022, approximately 33 of our workforce were members of a union or participated in collective bargaining. We are committed to fostering solid relationships with all members of our workforce based on trust, treating workers fairly and providing them with safe and healthy working conditions. For a discussion of related risks, refer to Item 1A, Risk Factors.

In 2022, the full Board reviewed and approved our refreshed global people strategy. Our people strategy represents a multi-year journey, and its three pillars and respective aspirations include: (i) leadership grow and attract exceptional leaders for our Company, the industry and beyond; (ii) inclusion, diversity and equity - through bold actions cultivate an inclusive, diverse and engaged workforce; and (iii) people experiences - foster a meaningful work experience that enables our culture and strategy to flourish. The Board of Directors Leadership Development and Compensation Committee holds reviews with management every quarter and on an ad hoc basis as needed to ensure appropriate management of human capital and progress against our stated goals. 
 The people who work on our behalf give us a competitive advantage. Through our global people strategy, we align our talent management efforts with the overall business strategy. The strategy s focus areas include enhancing the employee experience and evolving for future workforce needs; building our bench strength and leadership capabilities; developing effective labor relations that align stakeholders with a shared future; and improving inclusion, including reaching gender parity. 
 Inclusion and Diversity. We believe that progressing an inclusive workplace culture is a critical part of tackling the challenge of attracting and retaining diverse employees. We are also active participants in the Paradigm for Parity framework, a coalition of business leaders committed to a workplace where women and men have equal power, status and opportunity in senior leadership, and we are committed to advancing the UN Sustainable Development Goal to achieve gender equality. Newmont has committed to increasing women in senior leadership roles to 50 by 2030 in line with Paradigm for Parity objectives. 
 In 2022, we did significant work to identify those practices that would most significantly improve diverse representation and advancement in our business. Enterprise-wide female representation at the end of 2022 increased from 14 percent in 2021 to 15 percent despite challenges associated with the pandemic and shifts in the labor market. Site-based action plans were established and overall representation of females in operations increased from 8 to 9 in 2022. Female representation in senior leadership roles also increased from 26 to 30 in 2022. Female representation at the Board level in 2022 was 45 of independent directors with 70 of independent directors being either gender or ethnically diverse. 
 In our annual sustainability report, Newmont voluntarily reports workforce and labor information in accordance with GRI Standards, including data on workforce demographics, compensation and equal remuneration, gender diversity, union representation, labor relations, employee turnover, hiring representation, and training and development. Newmont also reports employment data in U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission EEO-1 reports which can be found on our website. The information in our sustainability report and on our website is not incorporated by reference in this annual report. 
 ESG Performance-based Compensation. The importance of ESG performance is emphasized with our workforce through our training and development programs and our compensation design. Employees eligible for our short-term incentive plan are held accountable for the Company s health, safety and sustainability performance through Newmont s performance-based compensation structure. ESG will comprise 30 of the Company s Short-term Incentive Plan payout for 2022, with 20 allocated to health safety metrics and 10 to sustainability performance based upon key public indices. In 2022, Newmont generated strong above target results in our health and safety and our sustainability measures with all sites and regions having performed above target for manager/supervisor critical control verifications and manager coaching to support fatality risk management, and strong recognition by external rating agencies in connection with sustainability, including with S P Global CSA (DJSI) ranking Newmont as the co-leader in the Mining Metals sector. 
 Additional information regarding the Company s compensation programs and performance will be provided in the 2023 Proxy Statement. 
 Health and Safety. We believe that our operations are in compliance with applicable laws and regulations in all material respects. We continue to sustain robust controls at our operations and offices around the globe, including a risk-based application of controls in connection with COVID-19 to protect both our workforce and the local communities in which we operate. In addition, the Company has an established Health Safety Management System and Health, Safety and Security Standards that in most cases exceed regulatory requirements in the jurisdictions in which we operate. The quality of our Health Safety Management System is audited regularly as part of our assurance and governance process. 
 In 2022, we launched a refreshed three-year Health, Safety and Security Strategy that advances our journey toward a fatality, injury and illness-free workplace. The updated strategy recognizes the progress we have made while also acknowledging the need to further improve our performance. The strategy links our health, safety and security work together across three themes: 
 Act on risk Control future outcomes by acting to reduce risks and minimize potential impacts. 
 Actively care Consistently take action to engage and support our employees and business partners. 
 Apply knowledge Foster a knowledge-sharing mindset, apply what we learn and inspire innovation. 
 Supporting and extending the impact of our strategy are the following three amplifiers: 
 Data Consolidating the various data systems into a data warehouse we can analyze and obtain insights. 
 10 

Table of Contents 

Technology Leverage new and existing technology and innovation to provide data, reduce risk, improve decision making and engage our people. 
 Communication Encourage communications with employees and contractors (particularly those on site with the greatest exposure to risks) to remain focused on the right work and retain agility based on our changing environment and risk profile. 
 The strategy will track efforts to build (identifying capabilities, frameworks and tools we need to develop), embed (penetrating, engaging and sustaining impacts) and expand (growing and collaborating) work across the health, safety and security programs. 
 The quality and quantity of critical control verifications ("CCVs") in the field are important leading indicators for preventing fatalities and significant potential events ("SPEs"). In 2022, we completed over 620,000 CCVs in the field (a 31 increase compared to 2021). More than 69,000 controls were identified as absent or failed, which means we were able to implement the control in the field and prevent a serious event. SPEs were down 36 compared to 2021. 
 Commitments to Communities. Newmont aims to better understand both the positive and negative impacts that our activities have on host communities, and to engage impacted communities and groups to mitigate or optimize these impacts in a manner that is culturally appropriate and with the consent of those impacted. We strive to build meaningful relationships with stakeholders and recognize the need to understand, minimize and mitigate our impacts and to build long-term, positive partnerships. We also recognize our responsibility to respect and promote human rights. At our sites on or adjacent to Indigenous Peoples territories, we respect and acknowledge the individual and collective rights and interests of Indigenous Peoples in line with the International Labour Organization ("ILO") Convention 169 and the UN Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples. 
 Governance Practices 
 Board of Directors Oversight. Newmont believes that strong corporate governance, with management accountability and active oversight from an experienced Board of Directors, is essential for mitigating risk, serving in the best interests of all stakeholders and creating long-term value. The highest level of oversight at Newmont resides with Newmont s Board of Directors (the Board ). The Board plays a critical role, overseeing the Company s business strategy and the overall goal of delivering long-term value creation for shareholders and other stakeholders. The members of Newmont s Board bring a broad range of backgrounds, experiences and talents, along with ethnic, racial and gender diversity, to our governance process. As of December 31, 2022, the Board was comprised of 12 directors (11 independent non-executive directors and one executive director) with more than 70 of the independent directors with a form of ethnic, racial or gender diversity to the Board, with 45 female representation among independent directors. 
 Four core Board committees, Audit, Corporate Governance and Nominating, Leadership Development and Compensation, and Safety and Sustainability, provide oversight and guidance in key areas. Each committee assists the Board in carrying out responsibilities such as assessing major risks, ensuring high standards of ethical business conduct, succession planning and talent management, and approving and providing oversight of the sustainability strategy, which includes commitments to adoption of best practices in promotion of a healthy and safe work environment, and environmentally sound and socially responsible mining and resource development. All members of these four core Committees are independent, as defined in the listing standards of the New York Stock Exchange and Newmont s Corporate Governance Guidelines. More information on Newmont s Board, governance practices and risk oversight can be found in our annual Proxy Statement. 
 Code of Conduct. Our global Code of Conduct (the Code ), which was adopted and approved by Newmont s Board, forms the foundation for our integrity expectations, and six overarching policies, along with our standards on Anti-Corruption, Conflicts of Interest, Gifts and Entertainment and U.S. Export Compliance, state the minimum requirements for conducting business honestly, ethically and in the best interests of Newmont. Our Code reflects our belief that as important as what we do is how we do it. It requires all representatives of Newmont to demonstrate our values safety, integrity, sustainability, inclusion and responsibility in every aspect of our professional lives and ultimately, to live up to our purpose, which is to create value and improve lives through sustainable and responsible mining. 
 Governance Materials. Our Corporate Governance Guidelines, Proxy Statement, policies, and the charters for the Committees of Board of Directors are available on our website, www.newmont.com, and are available free of charge upon request to Investor Relations at our principal executive office. We also file with the New York Stock Exchange an annual certification that our Chief Executive Officer is unaware of any violation of the NYSE s corporate governance standards. We make available free of charge through our website this annual report on Form 10-K, quarterly reports on Form 10-Q, current reports on Form 8-K and amendments to those reports filed or furnished pursuant to Section 13(a) or 15(d) of the Exchange Act, as soon as reasonably practicable after such material is electronically filed with or furnished to the SEC. The information on our website is not incorporated by reference in this report. 
 
 COVID-19 Pandemic 
 The outbreak of coronavirus ("COVID-19") was declared a pandemic by the World Health Organization in 2020. As a global business, we are committed to doing our part to combat the COVID-19 pandemic and protect people and their livelihoods. Newmont engaged its Rapid Response process early in connection with the on-going COVID-19 pandemic and continues to proactively take steps

 ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS (dollars in millions, except per share, per ounce and per pound amounts) 
 
 Our business activities are subject to significant risks, including those described below. You should carefully consider these risks. If any of the described risks actually occurs, our business, financial position and results of operations could be materially adversely affected. Such risks are not the only ones we face and additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us or that we currently deem immaterial may also affect our business. This report contains forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties. Our actual results could differ materially from those anticipated in the forward-looking statements as a result of a number of factors, including the risks described below. See Forward-Looking Statements. 
 Risks Related to Our Operations and Business 
 A substantial or extended decline in gold, silver, copper, zinc or lead prices would have a material adverse effect on us. 
 Our business is dependent on the prices of gold, silver, copper, zinc and lead, which fluctuate on a daily basis and are affected by numerous factors beyond our control. Factors tending to influence prices include: 
 Gold sales, purchases or leasing by governments and central banks; 
 Speculative short positions taken by significant investors or traders in gold, copper, silver, lead, zinc or other metals; 
 The relative strength of the U.S. dollar; 
 The monetary policies employed by the world s major Central Banks; 
 The fiscal policies employed by the world s major industrialized economies; 
 Expectations of the future rate of inflation; 
 Interest rates; 
 Recession or reduced economic activity in the United States, China, India and other industrialized or developing countries; 
 Decreased industrial, jewelry, base metal or investment demand; 
 Increased import and export taxes; 
 Increased supply from production, disinvestment and scrap; 
 Forward sales by producers in hedging or similar transactions; 
 Availability of cheaper substitute materials; and 
 Changing investor or consumer sentiment, including in connection with transition to a low-carbon economy, investor interest in crypto currencies and other investment alternatives and other factors.

Average gold prices for 2022 were 1,800 per ounce (2021: 1,799; 2020: 1,770), average copper prices for 2022 were 3.99 per pound (2021: 4.23; 2020: 2.80), average silver prices for 2022 were 21.73 per ounce (2021: 25.12; 2020: 20.55), average lead prices for 2022 were 0.98 per pound (2021: 1.00; 2020: 0.83) and average zinc prices for 2022 were 1.58 per pound (2021: 1.36; 2020: 1.03). Any decline in our realized prices adversely impacts our revenues, net income and operating cash flows, particularly in light of our strategy of not engaging in hedging transactions with respect to sales of gold, silver, copper, lead or zinc. We have recorded impairments in the current year and may experience additional impairments in future years as a result of lower gold, silver, copper, zinc or lead prices. 
 In addition, sustained lower gold, silver, copper, zinc or lead prices can: 
 Reduce revenues further through production declines due to cessation of the mining of deposits, or portions of deposits, that become uneconomic at sustained lower metal prices; 
 Reduce or eliminate the profit that we currently expect from ore stockpiles and ore on leach pads and increase the likelihood and amount that the Company might be required to record write downs related to the carrying value of its stockpiles and ore on leach pads; 
 Halt or delay the development of new projects; 
 Reduce funds available for exploration and advanced projects with the result that depleted reserves may not be replaced; and 
 Reduce existing reserves by removing ores from reserves that can no longer be economically processed at prevailing prices 
 We may be unable to replace gold, silver, copper, zinc or lead reserves as they become depleted. 
 Mining companies must continually replace reserves depleted by production to maintain production levels over the long term and provide a return on invested capital. Depleted reserves can be replaced in several ways, including expanding known ore bodies, by locating new deposits or acquiring interests in reserves from third parties. Exploration is highly speculative in nature, involves many risks and uncertainties and is frequently unsuccessful in discovering significant mineralization. Accordingly, our current or future exploration programs may not result in new mineral producing operations. Even if significant mineralization is discovered, it will likely take many years from the initial phases of exploration until commencement of production, during which time the economic feasibility of production may change. 
 We may consider, from time to time, the acquisition of ore reserves from others related to development properties and operating mines. Such acquisitions are typically based on an analysis of a variety of factors including historical operating results, estimates of and assumptions regarding the extent of ore reserves, the timing of production from such reserves and cash and other operating costs. Other factors that affect our decision to make any such acquisitions may also include our assumptions for future gold, silver, copper, zinc or lead prices or other mineral prices and the projected economic returns and evaluations of existing or potential liabilities associated with the property and its operations and projections of how these may change in the future. In addition, in connection with any acquisitions we may rely on data and reports prepared by third parties (including ability to permit and compliance with existing regulations) and which may contain information or data that we are unable to independently verify or confirm. Other than historical operating results, all of these factors are uncertain and may have an impact on our revenue, our cash flow and other operating issues, as well as contributing to the uncertainties related to the process used to estimate reserves and resources. In addition, there may be intense competition for the acquisition of attractive mining properties. 
 As a result of these uncertainties, our exploration programs and any acquisitions which we may pursue may not result in the expansion or replacement of our current production with new ore reserves or operations, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, prospects, results of operations and financial position. 
 Estimates of proven and probable reserves and measured, indicated and inferred resources are uncertain and the volume and grade of ore actually recovered may vary from our estimates. 
 The reserves stated in this report represent the amount of gold, copper, silver, lead and zinc that we estimated, at December 31, 2022, could be economically and legally extracted or produced at the time of the reserve determination. Estimates of proven and probable reserves are subject to considerable uncertainty. Such estimates are, or will be, to a large extent, based on the prices of gold, silver, copper, zinc and lead and interpretations of geologic data obtained from drill holes and other exploration techniques, which data may not necessarily be indicative of future results. If our reserve estimations are required to be revised due to significantly lower gold, silver, zinc, copper and lead prices, increases in operating costs, reductions in metallurgical recovery or other modifying factors, this could result in material write-downs of our investment in mining properties, goodwill and increased amortization, reclamation and closure charges. 
 Producers use feasibility studies for undeveloped ore bodies to derive estimates of capital and operating costs based upon anticipated tonnage and grades of ore to be mined and processed, the predicted configuration of the ore body, expected recovery rates of metals from the ore, the costs of comparable facilities, the costs of operating and processing equipment and other factors. Actual operating and capital cost and economic returns on projects may differ significantly from original estimates. Further, it may take many years from the initial phases of exploration until commencement of production, during which time, the economic feasibility of production may change.

Additionally, resources do not indicate proven and probable reserves as defined by the SEC or the Company s standards. Estimates of measured, indicated and inferred resources are subject to further exploration and development, and are, therefore, subject to considerable uncertainty. Inferred resources, in particular, have a great amount of uncertainty as to their existence and their economic and legal feasibility. The Company cannot be certain that any part or parts of the resource will ever be converted into reserves. 
 In addition, if the price of gold, silver, copper, zinc or lead declines from recent levels, if production costs increase, grades decline, recovery rates decrease or if applicable laws and regulations are adversely changed, the indicated level of recovery may not be realized or mineral reserves or resources might not be mined or processed profitably. If we determine that certain of our mineral reserves have become uneconomic, this may ultimately lead to a reduction in our aggregate reported reserves and resources. Consequently, if our actual mineral reserves and resources are less than current estimates, our business, prospects, results of operations and financial position may be materially impaired. 
 Reserves and resources disclosed in this Form 10-K have been prepared in accordance with the Regulation S-K 1300. In 2021, the Company transitioned its approach to reporting and internal methodologies to take into account the required change from the SEC s Industry Guide 7 to Regulation S-K 1300. To the extent that regulators adopt new requirements and issue or modify related guidance and interpretations in the future, it could results in changes to mineral reserve and mineral resource information. 
 Estimates relating to projects and mine plans of existing operations are uncertain and we may incur higher costs and lower economic returns than estimated. 
 Mine development and expansion projects typically require a number of years and significant expenditures during the development phase before production is possible. Such projects could experience unexpected problems and delays during development, construction and mine start-up. Our decision to develop a project is typically based on the results of studies, which estimate the anticipated economic returns of a project. The actual project profitability or economic feasibility may differ from such estimates as a result of any of the following factors, among others: 
 Changes in tonnage, grades and metallurgical characteristics of ore to be mined and processed; 
 Changes in input commodity and labor costs; 
 The quality of the data on which engineering assumptions were made; 
 Increases in development capital and investment costs; 
 Adverse geotechnical conditions; 
 Availability of adequate and skilled labor force; 
 Availability, supply and cost including: water, reagents, and power; 
 Costs related to environmental management and sales including waste management, monitoring and transport and storage of product sales; 
 Fluctuations in inflation and currency exchange rates; 
 Availability and terms of financing; 
 Delays in obtaining environmental or other government permits or approvals or changes in the laws and regulations related to our operations or project development; 
 Changes in tax laws, the laws and/or regulations around royalties and other taxes due to the regional and national governments and royalty agreements; 
 Government instability, including but not limited to decreased support for development of mining projects; 
 Weather or severe climate impacts, including, without limitation, prolonged or unexpected precipitation, drought and/or sub-zero temperatures; 
 Potential delays and restrictions in connection with health and safety issues, including pandemics (such as COVID-19 and related variants) and other infectious diseases; 
 Potential delays relating to social and community issues, including, without limitation, issues resulting in protests, road blockages or work stoppages; and 
 Potential challenges to mining activities or to permits or other approvals or delays in development and construction of projects based on claims of disturbance of cultural resources or the inability to secure consent for such disturbance. 
 New projects require, among other things, the successful completion of feasibility studies, attention to various fiscal, tax and royalty matters, obtainment of, and compliance with, required governmental permits and arrangements for necessary surface and other land rights. We may also have to identify adequate sources of water and power for new projects, ensure that appropriate community 
 17

infrastructure (for example, reliable rail, ports, roads, and bridges) is developed to support the project and secure appropriate financing to fund a new project. These infrastructures and services are often provided by third parties whose operational activities are outside of our control. Establishing infrastructure for our development projects requires significant resources, identification of adequate sources of raw materials and supplies, and the cooperation of national and regional governments, none of which can be assured. In addition, new projects have no operating history upon which to base estimates of future financial and operating performance, including future cash flow. Thus, it is possible that actual costs may increase significantly and economic returns may differ materially from our estimates. Consequently, our future development activities may not result in the expansion or replacement of current production with new production, or one or more of these new production sites or facilities may be less profitable than currently anticipated or may not be profitable at all, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial position. 
 For our existing operations, we base our mine plans on geological and metallurgical assumptions, financial projections and commodity price estimates. These estimates are periodically updated to reflect changes in our operations, including modifications to our proven and probable reserves and resources, revisions to environmental obligations, changes in legislation and/or our political or economic environment, and other significant events associated with mining operations. Further, future positive revisions, if any, remain subject to improvements in costs, recovery, commodity price or a combination of these and other factors. Additionally, we review our operations for events and circumstances that could indicate that the carrying value of our long-lived assets may not be recoverable. If indicators of impairment are determined to exist at our mine operations, and an impairment charge is incurred, such charges are not reversible at a later date even when favorable modifications to our proven and probable reserves and measured, indicated and inferred resources, favorable revisions to environmental obligations, favorable changes in legislation and/or our political or economic environment, and other favorable events occur. As a result of these uncertainties, actual results may be less favorable than estimated returns and initial financial outlook. 
 Increased operating and capital costs could affect our profitability. 
 Costs at any particular mining location are subject to variation due to a number of factors, such as variable ore grade, changing metallurgy and revisions to mine plans in response to the physical shape and location of the ore body, as well as the age and utilization rates for the mining and processing related facilities and equipment. In addition, costs are affected by the price and availability of input commodities, such as fuel, electricity, labor, chemical reagents, explosives, steel, concrete and mining and processing related equipment and facilities. Commodity costs are, at times, subject to volatile price movements, including increases that could make production at certain operations less profitable. Further, changes in laws and regulations can affect commodity prices, uses, and transport. Reported costs may also be affected by changes in accounting standards. A material increase in costs at any significant location could have a significant effect on our profitability and operating cash flow. 
 Our operational costs, including, without limitation, labor costs, can be impacted by inflation. Certain of our operations are located in countries that have in the past experienced high rates of inflation, such as in Argentina, Suriname, and Ghana. It is possible that in the future, high inflation in the countries in which we operate may result in an increase in operational costs in local currencies (without a concurrent devaluation of the local currency of operations against the dollar or an increase in the dollar price of gold, silver, copper, zinc or lead). A material increase in costs at any significant location could have a significant effect on our profitability and operating cash flow. 
 We could have significant increases in capital and operating costs over the next several years in connection with new projects, costs related to closure reclamation activities, and in the sustaining and/or expansion of existing mining and processing operations. Costs associated with capital expenditures may increase in the future as a result of factors beyond our control. Increased capital expenditures may have an adverse effect on the profitability of and cash flow generated from existing operations, as well as the economic returns anticipated from new projects. Significantly higher and sustained increases in operational costs or capital expenditures could result in the deferral or closure of projects and mines in the event that costs become prohibitive. 
 Mine closure, reclamation and remediation costs for environmental liabilities may exceed the provisions we have made. 
 Natural resource extractive companies are required to close their operations and rehabilitate the lands that they mine in accordance with a variety of environmental laws and regulations. Estimates of the total ultimate closure and rehabilitation costs for gold, silver, copper, zinc and lead mining operations are significant and based principally on current legal and regulatory requirements and mine closure plans that may change materially. 
 Additionally, we may be held responsible for the costs of addressing contamination at the site of current or former activities or at third party sites or be held liable to third parties for exposure to hazardous substances should those be identified in the future. Under the U.S. Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act of 1980 CERCLA and its state law equivalents, current or former owners of properties may be held jointly and severally liable for the costs of site cleanup or required to undertake remedial actions in response to unpermitted releases of hazardous substances at such property, in addition to, among other potential consequences, liability to governmental entities for the cost of damages to natural resources, which may be significant. These subject properties are referred to as superfund sites. For example, the inactive Midnite uranium mine is a superfund site subject to CERCLA. It is possible that certain of our other current or former operations, projects or exploration locations in the U.S. could be designated as a superfund site in the future, exposing us to potential liability under CERCLA.

The laws and regulations governing mine closure and reclamation in a particular jurisdiction are subject to review at any time and may be amended to impose additional requirements and conditions which may cause our provisions for environmental liabilities to be underestimated and could materially affect our financial position or results of operations. For a more detailed description of potential environmental liabilities, see the discussion in Environmental Matters in Note 25 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. In addition, regulators are increasingly requesting security in the form of cash collateral, credit, trust arrangements or guarantees to secure the performance of environmental obligations, which could have an adverse effect on our financial position. Any underestimated or unanticipated retirement and rehabilitation costs could materially affect our financial position, results of operations and cash flows. Environmental liabilities are accrued when they become known, are probable and can be reasonably estimated. Whenever a previously unrecognized remediation liability becomes known, or a previously estimated reclamation cost is increased, the amount of that liability and additional cost will be recorded at that time and could materially reduce our consolidated net income attributable to Newmont stockholders and potentially result in impairments. 
 For example, in early 2015 and again in June 2017, the Peruvian government agency responsible for certain environmental regulations, the Ministry of the Environment MINAM ), issued proposed modifications to water quality criteria for designated beneficial uses which apply to mining companies, including Yanacocha. These criteria modified the in-stream water quality criteria pursuant to which Yanacocha has been designing water treatment processes and infrastructure. In 2017, Yanacocha submitted a modification to its previously approved compliance achievement plan to the Mining Ministry MINEM ). The Company did not receive a response or comments to this submission until 2021 and is in the process of updating its compliance achievement plan to address these comments. During this interim period, Yanacocha separately submitted an Environmental Impact Assessment modification considering the ongoing operations and the projects to be developed and obtained authorization from MINEM for such projects. This authorization included a deadline for compliance with the modified water quality criteria by January 2024. In May 2022, Yanacocha submitted a proposal modification to this plan requesting an extension of time for coming into full compliance with the new regulations in 2027. In the event that MINEM does not grant Yanacocha an extension of the previously authorized timeline for, and agree to, the updated compliance achievement plan, fines and penalties relating to non-compliance may result beyond January 2024. 
 The Company is conducting detailed studies to better estimate water management and other closure activities that will ensure water quality and quantity discharge requirements, including the modifications promulgated by MINAM, as referenced above, will be met. This also includes performing a comprehensive update to the Yanacocha reclamation plan to address changes in closure activities and estimated closure costs while preserving optionality for potential future projects at Yanacocha. These ongoing studies, which will extend beyond the current year, were progressed in the fourth quarter of 2022 as the study team continued to evaluate and revise assumptions and estimated costs of changes to the reclamation plan. While certain estimated costs remain subject to revision, in conjunction with the Company s annual 2022 update process for all asset retirement obligations, the Company recorded an increase of 511 to the Yanacocha reclamation liability based on the progress of the closure studies with a corresponding non-cash charge of 529 recorded to reclamation expense related to portions of site operations no longer in production with no expected substantive future economic value and 18 recorded as a decrease to the asset retirement cost for producing areas of the operation. The annual 2022 update included an initial consideration of known risks (including the associated risk that water treatment estimates could change in the future as more work is completed). However, these and other risks and contingencies that are the subject of ongoing studies could result in future material increases to the reclamation obligation at Yanacocha, including, but not limited to, a comprehensive review of our tailings storage facility management, review of Yanacocha s water balance and storm water management system and review of post-closure management costs. The ongoing Yanacocha closure studies are expected to be progressed in 2023 and continue in the future. Future material increases or decreases to the asset retirement obligation could occur as additional analyses are completed and further refinements to water quality and volume modeling are completed. Additionally, revisions to the Yanacocha reclamation plan may change in connection with the Company s ultimate submission and review of the plan with Peruvian regulators. Refer to Notes 5 and 25 of our Consolidated Financial Statements for information regarding reclamation and remediation, and Note 1 of our Consolidated Financial Statements regarding the Company s interest in Yanacocha. 
 Our operations and business have been affected by the COVID-19 pandemic, and may be materially and adversely impacted in the future by pandemics, epidemics and other health emergencies. 
 The Company faces risks related to health epidemics and other outbreaks of communicable diseases, which could significantly disrupt operations and may materially and adversely affect its business and financial conditions. The global COVID-19 pandemic has had major impacts on the world, our industry and our Company. Despite protocols we have developed and deployed, COVID-19 and its variants present ongoing risks and challenges, and could continue to impact our people, operations and surrounding Communities. Efforts to control the spread of COVID-19 impacted the operation of Newmont s mines and the development of projects and exploration activities and may continue to do so in the future. The governments in many of the jurisdictions in which we operate implemented restrictive measures such as travel bans, quarantine and self-isolation at various times during the pandemic and may do so again in the future. The scope and duration of any such restrictions remains outside of the Company s control. The Company carefully considers government restrictions and the needs of its employees and host communities. Additionally, based upon evolving contagion rates or occurrences at our operating sites, senior management or the Board may be required to or decide to reduce or limit operational activities to essential care and maintenance procedures including the management of critical environmental systems. For example, in order to protect nearby communities and align with government travel restrictions or health considerations certain of Newmont s operations were temporarily put into care and maintenance resulting in a temporary decrease in production at these sites in 2020 and 2021. Additionally, the majority of our sites experienced pandemic-related absenteeism in 2021 and early 2022. Reductions in our operational activities due to COVID-19, or another pandemic, epidemic or health outbreak, could result in additional sites being placed 
 19 

Table of Contents 

into care and maintenance for extended periods of time and/or have a material adverse impact on our business, or financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. If the majority of our sites are placed into care and maintenance, this could significantly reduce our cash flow and impact our ability to meet certain covenants related to our revolving credit facility and borrowing capacity. 
 The Company incurred, and could continue to incur costs as a result of actions taken to protect against the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic and to comply with local mandates, including but not limited additional health screenings, incremental travel, security and employee-related costs. Other impacts of changing government restrictions and the evolving health environment in connection with pandemics, epidemics or health outbreaks and emergencies could include prolonged travel restraints, more stringent shipment restraints, delays in product refining and smelting due to restrictions or temporary closures, other supply chain disruptions and workforce interruptions, including loss of life, and reputational damage in connection with challenges or reactions to action or perceived inaction by the Company, which could have a material adverse effect on the Company s cash flows, earnings, results of operations and financial position. 
 Damage to our reputation may result in decreased investor confidence, challenges in maintaining positive community relations and can pose additional obstacles to our ability to develop our projects, which may result in a material adverse impact on our business, financial position, results of operations and growth prospects. 
 Damage to our reputation can be the result of the actual or perceived occurrence of a variety of events and circumstances, and could result in negative publicity (for example, with respect to handling of environmental, employee, safety and security matters, dealings with local community organizations or individuals, community commitments, handling of cultural sites or resources, and various other matters). 
 We have also provided greater transparency on environmental, social and governance performance in response to stakeholder engagement and requests in recent years, and provide supplemental disclosures in our Annual Sustainability Report and other sustainability reports on our website in connection with stakeholder concerns and issues. Such increased transparency may result in greater scrutiny and impact how the Company is perceived. 
 Our Code of Conduct (the Code forms the foundation of our internal governance structure as well as our commitment to responsible mining. We encourage employees and others to promptly report incidents of possible violations of the Code and/or our global policies and standards, including in the areas of business integrity, social and environmental, community relations and human rights. Employees and non-employees, including suppliers and community members, can anonymously report concerns via our third-party helpline. Each mine site has a complaints and grievances register to record matters raised by local stakeholders. When necessary, we use independent mechanisms agreed to by the complainants, such as a local leader or committee, to facilitate resolution of such matters before they require public or legal intervention. However, we are not always able to resolve these matters before they are raised publicly or in legal or regulatory proceedings and in the future we may not be able to meet the growing demands of stakeholders through these mechanisms. Such matters once publicized may negatively impact our reputation and may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial position and results of operations. 
 The growing use of social media to generate, publish and discuss community news and issues and to connect with others has made it significantly easier, among other things, for individuals and groups to share their opinions of us and our activities, whether true or not. We do not have direct control over how we are perceived by others and any resulting loss of reputation could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial position and results of operations. 
 We are dependent upon information technology and operational technology systems, which are subject to disruption, damage, failure and risks associated with implementation, upgrade, operation and integration. 
 We are dependent upon information technology and operational technology systems. The operating and control systems at our mines increasingly leverage technology-based solutions based on a combination of on-premises and cloud-based platforms. These systems are crucial for operating our mines safely and efficiently. Our systems, and those of our third-party service providers and vendors, may be targeted by increasing ly sophisticated threat actors. These threat s include continually evolving cybersecurity risks from a variety of sources, including, without limitation, malware, computer viruses, cyber threats, extortion, employee error, malfeasance, security breaches, cyber-attacks, natural disasters and defects in design. Cybersecurity risk is increasingly difficult to identify and quantify and cannot be fully mitigated because of the rapidly evolving nature of the threats, and the increasing sophistication of the threat actors. Additionally, unauthorized parties may attempt to gain access to these systems for company information through fraud or other means of deceiving our third-party service providers, employees or vendors. We have experienced attempts by external parties to compromise our networks and systems. For example, in 2020, we detected a cyberattack on our systems. Although we were able to respond quickly to stop the continued spread of the threat, it took significant time and resources to fully identify the scope of the attack and to recover our systems and data. The cost of responding to and remediating such event was immaterial. Although the 2020 attempts and other cyber incidents to date have not resulted in any material breaches, disruptions, or loss of business-critical information, our systems and procedures for preparing and protecting against such attempts and mitigating such risks may prove to be insufficient against future attacks. Any future material compromise or breach of our IT systems could have an adverse impact on our business and operations, including damage to our reputation and competitiveness, remediation costs, litigation or regulatory actions. Given the unpredictability of the timing, nature and scope of information technology disruptions, we could potentially be subject to production downtimes, operational delays, the compromising of confidential or otherwise protected information, destruction or 
 20 

Table of Contents 

corruption of data, security breaches, other manipulation or improper use of our systems and networks or financial losses from remedial actions. Outages in our operational technology may affect operations related to health and safety and could result in putting lives at risk of harm or death. In addition, as technologies evolve and these cybersecurity attacks become more sophisticated, we may incur significant costs to upgrade or enhance our security measures to protect against such attacks and we may face difficulties in fully anticipating or implementing adequate preventive measures or mitigating potential harm. Such efforts may prove insufficient to deter future cybersecurity attacks or prevent all security breaches. While we maintain general insurance, we no longer maintain specific insurance policies covering cybersecurity risk due to increased premium costs and restrictions to coverage, and, as such, any events for which we are not insured may results in additional costs and could affect our results of operations and financial position. 
 We could also be adversely affected by system or network disruptions if new or upgraded information technology systems are defective, not installed properly or not properly integrated into our operations. System modification failures could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial position and results of operations and could, if not successfully implemented, adversely impact the effectiveness of our internal controls over financial reporting. 
 To the extent we hold or acquire interests in any joint ventures or enter into any joint ventures, our interest in these properties is subject to the risks normally associated with the conduct of joint ventures. 
 To the extent we hold or acquire interests in any joint ventures or enter into any joint ventures in the future, the existence or occurrence of one or more of the following circumstances and events could have a material adverse impact on our profitability or the viability of our interests held through joint ventures, which could have a material adverse impact on our future cash flows, earnings, results of operations and financial condition: 
 inconsistent economic, political or business interests or goals between partners or disagreements with partners on strategy for the most efficient development or operation of mines; 
 inability to control certain strategic decisions made in respect of properties; 
 exercise of majority rights by our partners so as to take actions for which we may not believe to be in the joint venture s best interests, including but not limited to decisions related to day to day operations, labor relations, litigation, government relations, political contributions, community relations, project approval and project funding mechanisms; 
 inability of partners to meet their financial and other obligations to the joint venture or third parties; and 
 litigation between partners regarding management, funding or other decisions related to the joint venture. 
 To the extent that we are not the operator of a joint venture properties, such that we will be unable to control the activities of the operator, the success of such operations will be beyond our control. In many cases we will be bound by the decisions made by the operator in the operation of such property, and will rely on the operator to manage the property and to provide accurate information related to such property. We can provide no assurance that all decisions of operators of properties we do not control will achieve the expected results. 
 For example, our joint ventures, including the joint venture that combines our and Barrick Gold Corporation s Barrick respective Nevada operations, forming NGM, pursuant to the operating agreement entered into on July 1, 2019 between Barrick, Newmont and their wholly-owned subsidiaries party thereto (the Nevada JV Agreement ), may not be as beneficial to us as expected, whether due to the above-described risks, unfavorable global economic conditions, increases in construction costs, integration challenges, political risks, labor disputes or other factors. Pursuant to the terms of the Nevada JV Agreement, we hold a 38.5 percent economic interest and Barrick holds a 61.5 percent economic interest in NGM. Barrick operates NGM with overall management responsibility and is subject to the supervision and direction of NGM s Board of Managers, which is comprised of three managers appointed by Barrick and two managers appointed by Newmont. Outside of certain prescribed matters, decisions of the Board of Managers will be determined by majority vote, with the managers appointed by each company having voting power in proportion to such company s economic interests in NGM. Because we beneficially own less than a majority of the ownership and governance interests in NGM, we have limited control of NGM s operations, and we depend on Barrick to operate NGM. In the event that Barrick has interests, objectives and incentives with respect to NGM that differ from our own, there can be no assurance that we will be able to resolve such disagreement in our favor. Any such disagreement could have a material adverse effect on our interest in NGM, the business of NGM or the portion of our growth strategy related to NGM. Additionally, to the extent NGM is subject to liabilities or litigation, we would be responsible for a proportional share of certain liabilities and/or NGM s operations could be impacted, which could have an adverse impact on the Company s cash flows, earnings, results of operations and financial position. 
 Additionally, the Company is subject to certain funding requirements in connection with its joint ventures. Joint venture funding requirements, as well as the ability of partners to meet their financial and other obligations, may result in increases to our costs and required capital expenditures. Refer to Note 15 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for more information including with respect to loan agreements with Pueblo Viejo.

Financial Risk 
 Increased exposure to foreign exchange fluctuations and capital controls may adversely affect Newmont s costs, earnings and the value of some of our assets. 
 Our reporting currency is the U.S. dollar and the majority of our earnings and cash flows are denominated in U.S. dollars. We conduct certain business in currencies other than the U.S. dollar. A portion of our operating expenses are incurred in local currencies. The appreciation of those local currencies against the U.S. dollar increases our costs of production in U.S. dollar terms at mines located outside the United States. The foreign currencies that primarily affect our results of operations are the Australian Dollar and the Canadian Dollar. Our consolidated earnings and cash flows may also be impacted by movements in the exchange rates. Change in the value of the currencies of the Australian Dollar, Canadian Dollar, the Mexican Peso, the Argentine Peso, the Ghana Cedi, the Chilean Peso or Surinamese Dollar versus the U.S. dollar could negatively impact our earnings. For information concerning the sensitivity of our Costs applicable to sales to changes in foreign currency exchange rates and more information our exposure to foreign exchange rate fluctuations, see Foreign Currency Exchange Rates section in Part II, Item 7, Management s Discussion and Analysis of Consolidated Financial Condition and Results of Operations. 
 In addition, from time to time, countries in which we operate adopt measures to restrict the availability of the local currency or the repatriation of capital across borders. These measures are imposed by governments or central banks, in some cases during times of economic instability, to prevent the removal of capital or the sudden devaluation of local currencies or to maintain in-country foreign currency reserves. In addition, many emerging market countries require consents or reporting processes before local currency earnings can be converted into U.S. dollars or other currencies and/or such earnings can be repatriated or otherwise transferred outside of the operating jurisdiction. These measures may have a number of negative effects on Newmont, reducing the immediately available capital that we could otherwise deploy for investment opportunities or the payment of expenses. In addition, measures that restrict the availability of the local currency or impose a requirement to operate in the local currency may create other practical difficulties for Newmont. For example, Argentina has been considered a hyperinflationary environment with a cumulative inflation rate of over 100 for the last four years. In recent years, Argentina s central bank enacted a number of foreign currency controls in an effort to stabilize the local currency. These restrictions directly impact the timing of Cerro Negro's ability to remit cash from gold sales and pay interest and principal portions of intercompany debt to the Company. For more information, see Results of Consolidated Operations and Foreign Currency Exchange Rates sections in Item 7, Management s Discussion and Analysis of Consolidated Financial Condition and Results of Operations. See also risk factors under the headings Our operations in Argentina are susceptible to risk as a result of economic and political instability in Argentina and labor unrest , Our operations at Ahafo and Akyem in Ghana are subject to political, economic and other risks and Our Merian operation in Suriname is subject to political and economic risks below. 
 Future funding requirements may affect our business, our ability to pursue new business opportunities, invest in existing and new projects, pay cash dividends or engage in share repurchase transactions. 
 Potential future investments, including projects in the Company s project pipeline, acquisitions and other investments, will require significant funds for capital expenditures. Depending on gold, silver, copper, zinc and lead prices, our operating cash flow may not be sufficient to meet all of these expenditures, depending on the timing of development of these and other projects. As a result, new sources of capital may be needed to meet the funding requirements of these investments, fund our ongoing business activities, and fund construction and operation of potential future projects. Our ability to raise and service significant new sources of capital will be a function of macroeconomic conditions, future gold, silver, copper, zinc and lead prices as well as our operational performance, current cash flow and debt position, among other factors. We may determine that it may be necessary or preferable to issue additional equity or other securities, defer projects or sell assets. However, U.S. and global markets have, from time to time, experienced significant dislocations and liquidity disruptions, For example, the COVID-19 pandemic and events related to the conflict and related sanctions in Ukraine, Russia and/or Belarus increased, and may continue to increase, volatility and pricing in the capital markets. Additional financing may not be commercially available when needed or, if available, the terms of such financing may not be favorable to us and, if raised by offering equity securities, any additional financing may involve substantial dilution to existing shareholders. In the event of lower gold, silver, copper, zinc or lead prices, unanticipated operating or financial challenges, or new funding limitations, our ability to pursue new business opportunities, invest in existing and new projects, fund our ongoing business activities, retire or service all outstanding debt, fund share repurchase programs and transactions and pay dividends could be significantly constrained. See also the risk factor under the heading Holders of our common stock may not receive dividends . In addition, our joint venture partners may not have sufficient funds or borrowing ability in order to make their capital commitments. In the case that our partners do not make their economic commitments, the Company may be prevented from pursuing certain development opportunities or may assume additional financial obligations, which may require new sources of capital. 
 Our long-lived assets and goodwill could become impaired, which could have a material non-cash adverse effect on our results of operations. 
 We review our operations for events and circumstances that could indicate that the carrying value of our long-lived assets may not be recoverable. If indicators of impairment are determined to exist at our mine operations, we review the recoverability of the carrying value of long-lived assets by estimating the future undiscounted cash flows expected to result from the use and eventual disposition of the asset. We also review our goodwill for impairment annually and when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value. Management makes multiple assumptions in estimating future cash

flows, which include production levels based on life of mine plans, future costs of production, estimates of future production levels based on value beyond proven and probable reserves at our operations, prices of metals, the historical experience of our operations and other factors. There are numerous uncertainties inherent in estimating production levels of gold, silver, copper, zinc and lead and the costs to mine recoverable reserves, including many factors beyond our control that could cause actual results to differ materially from expected financial and operating results or result in future impairment charges. We may be required to recognize material non-cash charges relating to impairments of long-lived assets and/or goodwill in the future if actual results differ materially from management s estimates, which include metal prices, our ability to reduce or control production costs or capital costs through strategic mine optimization initiatives, increased costs or decreased production due to regulatory issues or if we do not realize the mineable reserves, resources or exploration potential at our mining properties. Additions to asset retirement costs could result in impairment charges. 
 The Company continues to evaluate strategic priorities and deployment of capital to projects in the pipeline. A decision to reprioritize, sell or abandon a development project could result in a future impairment charge. For example, in response to the current challenging market conditions, which include inflationary pressures and supply chain disruptions, in the third quarter of 2022 the Company announced the delay of the full-funds investment decision for the Yanacocha Sulfides project in Peru. The Company is currently in the process of assessing project plan options for the Yanacocha Sulfides project. The Company also periodically updates the economic model for its Conga project to understand changes to the estimated capital costs, cash flows, and economic returns from the project. Certain decisions or changes in circumstances could result in determinations that carrying value is not recoverable and could result in impairment. See Part II, Item 7 under the heading Critical Accounting Estimates Carrying value of long-lived assets and Carrying value of Conga for additional information. 
 If an impairment charge is incurred, such charges are not reversible at a later date even when favorable modifications to our proven and probable reserves and measured, indicated and inferred resources, favorable revisions to environmental obligations, favorable changes in legislation and/or our political or economic environment, or other favorable events occur. As a result of these uncertainties, our operating results may be significantly impacted from both the impairment and the underlying trends in the business that triggered the im pairment, and actual results may be less favorable than estimated returns and initial financial outlook. For additional information regarding goodwill, refer to Note 19 to our Consolidated Financial Statements. 
 Our ability to recognize the benefits of deferred tax assets is dependent on future cash flows and taxable income. 
 We recognize the expected future tax benefit from deferred tax assets when the tax benefit is considered to be more likely than not of being realized, otherwise, a valuation allowance is applied against deferred tax assets. Assessing the recoverability of deferred tax assets requires management to make significant estimates related to expectations of future taxable income. Estimates of future taxable income are based on historical results of operations, forecasted cash flows from operations, and the application of existing tax laws in each jurisdiction. To the extent that future cash flows and taxable income differ significantly from estimates, our ability to realize the deferred tax assets could be impacted. In the future, our estimates could change requiring a valuation allowance or impairment of our deferred tax assets. Additionally, future changes in tax laws could limit our ability to obtain the future tax benefits represented by our deferred tax assets. Refer to Note 10 to our Consolidated Financial Statements under the heading Income and Mining Taxes - Valuation of Deferred Tax Assets and Note 2 under the heading Summary of Significant Accounting Policies - Valuation of Deferred Tax Assets for additional information and factors that could impact the Company s ability to realize the deferred tax assets. For additional information regarding Newmont s non-current deferred tax assets, refer to Note 10 to our Consolidated Financial Statements. 
 Any downgrade in the credit ratings assigned to our debt securities could increase our future borrowing costs and adversely affect the availability of new financing. 
 There can be no assurance that any rating currently assigned by Standard Poor s Rating Services or Moody s Investors Service to Newmont will remain unchanged for any given period of time or that a rating will not be lowered if, in that rating agency s judgment, future circumstances relating to the basis of the rating so warrant. If we are unable to maintain our outstanding debt and financial ratios at levels acceptable to the credit rating agencies, or should our business prospects or financial results deteriorate, our ratings could be downgraded by the rating agencies. The Company s credit ratings have been subject to change over the years. We currently maintain a Standard Poor s rating of BBB+ (stable outlook) and a Moody s Investors Service rating of Baa1 (stable). We cannot make assurances regarding how long these ratings will remain unchanged or regarding the outcome of the rating agencies future reviews (including following any planned or future business combinations). A downgrade by the rating agencies could adversely affect the value of our outstanding securities, our existing debt and our ability to obtain new financing on favorable terms, if at all, and increase our borrowing costs, which in turn could impair our results of operations and financial position. 
 Returns for investments in pension plans are uncertain. 
 We maintain pension plans for certain employees which provide for specified payments after retirement. The Company s qualified pension plans are funded with cash contributions in compliance with IRS rules and regulations. The Company s non-qualified and other benefit plans are currently not funded, but exist as general corporate obligations. Refer to Note 11 to our Consolidated Financial Statements under the heading Pension and Other Benefit Plans for additional information regarding the funding status of qualified and non-qualified plans. The Company reviews its retirement benefit programs on a regular basis and will consider market 
 23 

Table of Contents 

conditions and the funded status of its qualified pension plans in determining whether additional contributions are appropriate. The ability of the pension plans to provide the specified benefits depends on our funding of the plans and returns on investments made by the plans. Returns, if any, on investments are subject to fluctuations based on investment choices and market conditions. A sustained period of low returns or losses on investments could require us to fund the pension plans to a greater extent than anticipated. If future plan investment returns are not sufficient, we may be required to increase the amount of future cash contributions. 
 Risks Related to Our Industry 
 We may experience increased costs or losses resulting from the hazards and uncertainties associated with mining. 
 The exploration for natural resources and the development and production of mining operations are activities that involve a high level of uncertainty. These can be difficult to predict and are often affected by risks and hazards outside of our control. These factors include, but are not limited to: 
 Environmental hazards, including discharge of metals, concentrates, pollutants or hazardous chemicals; 
 Industrial accidents, including in connection with the operation of mining equipment, milling equipment and/or conveyor systems and accidents associated with the preparation and ignition of large-scale blasting operations, milling and processing; 
 Accidents in connection with transportation, including transportation of chemicals, explosions or other materials, transportation of large mining equipment and transportation of employees and business partners to and from sites; 
 Social, community or labor force disputes resulting in work stoppages or shipping delays, such as at Pe asquito, Cerro Negro, Merian and Akyem, or related loss of social acceptance of community support; 
 Changes and/or increasingly stringent legal and regulatory requirements; 
 Delays in permitting due to reduced resources and capacity for review and formulation of permits at regulatory agencies; 
 Security incidents, including activities of illegal or artisanal miners, gold bullion or concentrate theft, including in transport, and corruption and fraud; 
 Shortages in materials or equipment and energy and electrical power supply interruptions or rationing; 
 Failure of unproven or evolving technologies or loss of information integrity or data; 
 Unexpected geological formations or conditions (whether in mineral or gaseous form); 
 Metallurgical conditions and gold, silver, copper, lead, zinc and other metal recovery, including unexpected decline of ore grade; 
 Unanticipated changes in inventory levels at heap-leach operations; 
 Ground and surface water conditions; 
 Fall-of-ground accidents in underground operations; 
 Failure of mining pit slopes and tailings dam walls; 
 Seismic activity; 
 Surface or underground fires or floods; and 
 Other natural phenomena, such as lightning, cyclonic or tropical storms, floods or other inclement weather conditions, including those impacting operations or the ability to access and supply sites. 
 The occurrence of one or more of these events in connection with our exploration activities, development and production and closure of mining operations may result in the death of, or personal injury to, our employees, other personnel or third parties, the loss of mining equipment, damage to or destruction of mineral properties or production facilities, monetary losses, deferral or unanticipated fluctuations in production, environmental damage and potential legal liabilities, all of which may adversely affect our reputation, business, prospects, results of operations and financial position. 
 We compete with other natural resource companies, and shortage of critical parts and equipment may adversely affect our operations and development projects. 
 We compete with other natural resource companies for specialized equipment and supplies necessary for exploration and development, as well as for rights to mine properties containing gold, silver, copper, zinc, lead and other minerals. The mining industry has been impacted, from time to time, by increased demand for critical resources such as input commodities, drilling equipment, trucks, shovels and tires. These shortages have, at times, impacted the efficiency of our operations, and resulted in cost increases and delays in construction of projects; thereby impacting operating costs, capital expenditures and production and construction schedules. We may be unable to obtain the services of skilled personnel and contractors or specialized equipment or supplies, or to acquire additional rights to mine properties, which could have an adverse effect on our competitive position or adversely impact our results of operations.

We may be unable to obtain or retain necessary permits and leases, which could adversely affect our operations. 
 Our mining and processing operations and development and exploration activities are subject to extensive permitting requirements. The requirements to obtain and/or achieve or maintain full compliance with such permits can be costly and involve extended timelines. While we strive to obtain and comply with all permits required of us, there can be no assurance that we will obtain all such permits and/or achieve or maintain full compliance with such permits at all times. Previously obtained permits may be suspended or revoked for a number of reasons, including through government or court action. Failure to obtain and/or comply with required permits can have serious consequences, including damage to our reputation; cessation of the development of a project; increased costs of development or production and litigation or regulatory action, any of which could materially adversely affect our business, results of operations or financial condition. 
 Our ability to obtain the required permits and approvals to explore for, develop and operate mines and to successfully operate near communities in the jurisdictions in which we operate depends in part on our ability to develop, operate and close mines in a manner that is consistent with the creation of social and economic benefits in the surrounding communities, which may or may not be required by law. Our ability to obtain permits and approvals and to operate near certain communities may be adversely impacted by real or perceived detrimental events associated with our activities or those of other mining companies affecting the environment, health and safety of communities in which we operate. Key permits and approvals may be revoked or suspended or may be adjusted in a manner that adversely affects our operations, including our ability to explore or develop properties, commence production or continue operations. Permit review and approval could be delayed, adversely impacting project implementation due to delays in review and development of permits from limited resources at the regulatory agencies. 
 Certain of our mining and processing operations, including tailings storage, and project expansion and development activities require the lease of land, rights and properties. Obtaining and/or maintain and renewing lease arrangements can be costly, and no assurance can be provided that all necessary lease arrangements and renewals will be achieved or maintained at all times. For example, additional tailings capacity is needed to support future growth and sustainability of Boddington operations beyond 2025. Boddington s existing tailings facility is expected to reach the permitted capacity in 2026. As the Company continues to work through incorporating the requirements of the GISTM, the life of mine tailings study has been re-initiated to explore options for tailings deposition. This study is due to be completed in 2023 and requires extensive environmental assessment. As such, the cost and viability of other options remains uncertain at this time. Further, the Boddington operation is primarily located on mining leases with renewal dates commencing in 2028 and no assurances can be provided that such renewals and additional lease scope for further tailings capacity will be secured at similar cost or at all. Failure to obtain necessary leases can have serious consequences, including cessation of operations and processing or the development of a project and/or increased costs, litigation or regulatory action, any of which could materially adversely affect our business, results of operations or financial condition. See also the risk factors under the headings Our Company and the mining industry are facing continued geotechnical challenges, which could adversely impact our production and profitability , and Title to some of our properties may be insufficient, defective, or challenged . 
 Mining companies are increasingly required to consider and provide benefits to the communities and countries in which they operate in order to maintain operations. 
 Greater scrutiny on the private sector broadly and multi-national companies specifically, to contribute to sustainable outcomes in the places where they operate, has led to a proliferation of standards and reporting initiatives focused on environmental stewardship, social performance and transparency. Extractive industries, and mining in particular, have seen significant increases in stakeholder expectations. These businesses are increasingly required to meaningfully engage with impacted stakeholders; understand and avoid or mitigate negative impacts while optimizing economic development and employment opportunities associated with their operations. The expectation is for companies to create shared value for shareholders, employees, governments, local communities and host countries. Such expectations tend to be particularly focused on companies whose activities are perceived to have high socio-economic and environmental impacts. In response, Newmont has over many years developed and continues to evolve a robust system of ESG management that includes standards, guidance, assurance, participation in international organizations focused on improved performance and outcomes for host communities and the environment. In Ghana, for instance, in response to resettlement-related complaints, Newmont worked with national and local government authorities, traditional leaders, impacted farmers/landowners and other concerned stakeholders to analyze impacts, extend programs to support vulnerable households and provide enhanced livelihood support. Despite the Company s commitment to on-going engagement with communities and stakeholders, no assurances can be provided that increased stakeholder expectations will not result in adverse financial and operational impacts to the business, including, without limitation, operational disruption, increased costs, increased investment obligations and increased taxes and royalties payable to governments. 
 Illegal mining and artisanal mining occurs on or adjacent to certain of our properties exposing such sites to security risks. 
 Artisanal and illegal miners have been active on, or adjacent to, some of Newmont s African and South American properties, including in Suriname and Ghana in recent years. For example, in Ghana in 2019, illegal miners attacked a field team of security guards employed by a security contractor, tragically resulting in a fatality. Illegal mining, which involves trespass into the development or operating area of the mine, is both a security and safety issue, which may present a security threat to property and human life. The illegal miners from time to time have clashed with security staff and law enforcement personnel who have attempted to move them 
 25 

Table of Contents 

away from the facilities. Although, under certain circumstances, artisanal mining may be a legally sanctioned activity, artisanal mining is also associated with a number of negative impacts, including environmental degradation, poor working practices, erosion of civil society, human rights abuse and funding of conflict. The environmental, social, safety and health impacts of artisanal and illegal mining are frequently attributed to formal large scale mining activity, and it is often assumed that artisanally-mined gold is channeled through large-scale mining operators, even though artisanal and large-scale miners normally have separate and distinct supply chains. These misconceptions impact negatively on the reputation of the industry. The activities of the illegal miners could cause damage to Newmont s properties or result in inappropriate or unlawful use of force for which Newmont could potentially be held responsible. The presence of illegal miners could lead to exploration and project delays and disputes regarding the development or operation of commercial gold deposits. Illegal mining and theft could also result in lost gold production and reserves, mine and development stoppages, and have a material adverse effect on financial condition or results of operations or project development. 
 Civil disturbances and criminal activities can disrupt business and expose the Company to liability. 
 Civil disturbances and criminal activities such as trespass, illegal mining, sabotage, theft, blockades, organized crime and vandalism may cause disruptions and could result in the suspension of operations, delays to project development and negative impacts on exploration activities at certain sites. Incidents of such activities have occasionally led to conflict with security personnel and/or police, which in some cases resulted in injuries including in Ghana, Peru, Mexico and Suriname. Additionally, some areas in which we conduct operations, develop projects and exploration activities are affected by persistent violence and organized crime involving significant drug cartels, such as in Mexico. 
 Although security measures have been implemented by the Company to protect employees, community members, property and assets, such measures will not guarantee that such civil disturbances and criminal activities will not continue to occur in the future, or result in harm to employees, community members or trespassers, decrease operational efficiency or construction delays, increase community tensions or result in liabilities or reputational harm to Newmont. Security incidents, in the future, may have a material adverse effect on our operations, development projects, exploration and reclamation activities, especially if criminal activity and violence continue to escalate. Such incidents may halt or delay production, increase operating costs; result in harm to employees, contractors, visitors or community members; decrease operational efficiency due to employee absenteeism and other factors; increase community tensions or otherwise adversely affect our ability to conduct business. The manner in which the Company s personnel, national police or other security forces respond to civil disturbances and criminal activities can give rise to additional risks where those responses are not conducted in a manner consistent with international and Newmont standards relating to the use of force and respect for human rights. Newmont takes seriously our obligation to respect and promote human rights, is a signatory to and active participant in the Voluntary Principles on Security and Human Rights, and has adopted a Sustainability and Stakeholder Engagement Policy and Human Rights Standard in-line with the UN Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights. Nonetheless, although the Company has implemented a number of significant measures and safeguards which are intended to ensure that personnel understand and uphold these standards, the implementation of these measures will not guarantee that personnel, national police or other security forces will uphold these standards in every instance. The evolving expectations related to human rights, indigenous rights, and environmental protections may result in opposition to our current and future operations, the development of new projects and mines, and exploration activities. Such opposition may take the form of legal or administrative proceedings or manifestations such as protests, roadblocks or other forms of public expression against our activities, and may have a negative impact on our local or global reputation and operations. Opposition by community and activist groups to our operations may require modification of, or preclude the operation or development of, our projects and mines or may require us to enter into agreements with such groups or local governments with respect to our projects and mines or exploration activities, in some cases, causing increased costs and significant delays to the advancement of our projects. For example, in Peru, our Conga project faced opposition from anti-mining activists, after which we suspended construction on the project s mining facilities and eventually reclassified Conga s reserves to resource as the result of certain operating and construction permits expiring at the end of 2015. The failure to conduct operations in accordance with Company standards can result in harm to employees, community members or trespassers, increase community tensions, reputational harm to Newmont or result in criminal and/or civil liability and/or financial damages or penalties. 
 Our operations face substantial regulation of health and safety. 
 Our operations are subject to extensive and complex laws and regulations governing worker health and safety across our operating regions and our failure to comply with applicable legal requirements can result in substantial penalties. Future changes in applicable laws, regulations, permits and approvals or changes in their enforcement or regulatory interpretation could substantially increase costs to achieve compliance, lead to the revocation of existing or future exploration or mining rights or otherwise have an adverse impact on our results of operations and financial position. 
 Our mines are inspected on a regular basis by government regulators who may issue citations and orders when they believe a violation has occurred under local mining regulations. If inspections result in an alleged violation, we may be subject to fines, penalties or sanctions and our mining operations could be subject to temporary or extended closures. 
 In addition to potential government restrictions and regulatory fines, penalties or sanctions, our ability to operate (including the effect of any impact on our workforce) and thus, our results of operations and our financial position (including because of potential related fines and sanctions), could be adversely affected by accidents, injuries, fatalities or events detrimental (or perceived to be detrimental) to the health and safety of our employees, the environment or the communities in which we operate.

Our operations are subject to extensive environmental laws and regulations. 
 Our exploration, development, mining and processing operations, and closed facilities are subject to extensive laws and regulations governing land use and the protection of the environment, which generally apply to air and water, protection of endangered, protected or other specified species, hazardous and non-hazardous waste management and reclamation. Many of the countries in which we operate have laws and regulations related to water (quality and quantity), nature and greenhouse gas GHG") emissions which are becoming increasingly more stringent. We have made, and expect to make in the future, significant expenditures to comply with such laws and regulations. Compliance with these laws and regulations imposes substantial costs and burdens, and can cause delays in obtaining, failure to obtain or renew, or cancellation of, government permits and approvals which may adversely impact our operations and closure processes. Increased global attention or regulation on consumption of shared resources and use products or development of waste that have the potential to impact human health and the environment could similarly have an adverse impact on our results of operations and financial position due to increased compliance and input costs. 
 Our operations are subject to a range of risks related to transitioning the business to meet regulatory, societal and investor expectations for operating in a low-carbon economy. 
 Climate change and the transition to a low-carbon economy is expected to impact Newmont in a number of ways. Producing gold is an energy-intensive business, currently resulting in a significant carbon footprint. Transitioning to a lower-carbon economy will require significant investment and may entail extensive policy, legal, technology, and market changes to address mitigation and adaptation requirements related to climate change. Depending on the nature, speed, focus and jurisdiction of these changes, transition risks may pose varying levels of financial and reputational risk to the business. 
 A number of governments or governmental bodies have introduced or are contemplating regulatory changes in response to the potential impacts of climate change that are viewed as the result of emissions from the combustion of carbon-based fuels. At the 21st Conference of the Parties of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change UNFCC held in Paris in 2015, the Paris Agreement was adopted which was intended to govern emission reductions beyond 2020. Newmont supports the UNFCC goal of limiting global warming to well below 2 o C compared to pre-industrial levels and plans to transition its operations to meet this goal by 2030, with an aspiration of carbon neutrality by 2050. In 2020, Newmont also announced plans to significantly invest in climate change initiatives in support of this goal, and additional material investments and capital expenditures will be required in order to meet our climate targets in the future. Inconsistent implementation or significant delay in the implementation of country-level policy related to the Paris Agreement and enhanced framework objectives announced at the most recent annual UN Climate Change Conference of the Parties (COP27) in November 2022 are likely to increase the risk for future regulatory impacts and rapid shifts to low-carbon technologies. 
 Policy and regulatory risk related to actual and proposed changes in climate- and water-related laws, regulations and taxes developed to regulate the transition to a low-carbon economy may result in increased costs for our operations, venture partners and our suppliers, including increased energy, capital equipment, environmental monitoring and reporting and other costs to comply with such regulations. Regulatory uncertainty may incur higher costs and lower economic returns than originally estimated for new development projects and operations, including closure reclamation obligations. For example, operational and capital expenses are expected to increase in order to meet renewable portfolio standard requirements by 50 or greater from current costs over the next 10 years in Australia, Canada, Mexico and the U.S. Carbon taxes, fuel switching and the transition to cleaner purchased power and/or on-site renewable energy generation will require significant upfront capital expenditures and may also increase operating costs. As another example, the carbon tax in Canada of C 30/tonne of CO 2 increased to C 50/tonne in 2022, impacting operating costs at our Canadian operations. We expect the potential for similar tax increases in other jurisdictions. Additionally, we do not maintain insurance policies against such climate-related risks or taxes. 
 The development and deployment of technological improvements or innovations will be required to support the transition to a low-carbon economy, which could result in write-offs and early retirement of existing assets, increased costs to adopt and deploy new practices and processing including planning and design for mines, development of alternative power sources, site level efficiencies and other capital investments. We will also consider the limited use of carbon offsets to support meeting our 2050 carbon neutral goal by neutralizing hard to abate residual emissions. 
 There will be varied and complex market impacts due to climate change and the transition to a low-carbon economy. There will be shifts in supply and demand for certain commodities, products and services in connection with evolving consumer and investor sentiments. Market perceptions of the mining sector, and, in particular, the role that certain metals will or will not play in the transition to a low-carbon economy remains uncertain. Potential financial impacts may include reduced investment in gold due to shift in investor sentiment, increased production costs due to changing input prices, re-pricing of land valuation and assets, increased global competition for key materials needed for new technologies (lithium, copper, rare earth minerals used in solar technology, etc.), potential cost increases by insurers and lenders, and potential increases in taxation of the mining and metals sector. 
 Should the mining and metals sector not respond quickly enough to meeting globally accepted science-based reductions required to mitigate the long-term impacts of climate change, industry members may be subject to an increased risk of future climate litigation. In the U.S. and Canada, lawsuits have been filed against oil and gas companies to assign liability for climate-related impacts. Over time, litigation may also apply to other resource intensive sectors that fail to set and/or meet long-term reduction targets. While 
 27 

Table of Contents 

the Company is not currently subject to any lawsuits related to climate, no assurances can be provided that similar suits will not be brought in the future. 
 A failure to meet our climate strategy commitments and/or societal or investor expectations could also result in damage to our reputation, decreased investor confidence and challenges in maintaining positive community relations, which can pose additional obstacles to our ability to conduct our operations and develop our projects, which may result in a material adverse impact on our business, financial position, results of operations and growth prospects. Further, the Company s financing strategy is tied to its ESG commitments. The interest rate of Newmont s 1 billion aggregate principal amount of 2.600 Sustainability-Linked Senior Notes due 2032 (the Notes is linked to Newmont s performance against key ESG commitments regarding 2030 emissions reduction targets and the representation of women in senior leadership roles target. The interest rate margin of Newmont s 3.0 billion sustainability-linked revolving credit facility is also subject to adjustment based on the Company s ESG scores. As such, a failure to meet our climate and sustainability targets can result in further expense and impact our liquidity and financial condition. 
 Our targets are uniquely tailored to our business, operations and capabilities, which do not easily lend to benchmarking against similar sustainability performance targets, and the related performance, of other companies. We will review our targets and sustainability framework from time to time, which may result in amendments in the future. Newmont may choose to adopt more ambitious targets in the future in connection with evolving best practices and market demand, which may be increasingly challenging and costly to achieve. Additionally, the methodologies that we use to calculate our Scope 1, Scope 2 and Scope 3 GHG emissions may change over time based upon changing industry standards, which may impact, positively or negatively, our ability to satisfy our targets, which could in turn adversely affect our reputation. Any major acquisition, merger, consolidation or divestiture or any series of related acquisitions, mergers, consolidations or divestitures by or involving us may impact our ability to achieve our targets and commitments. There is currently no generally accepted global definition (legal, regulatory or otherwise) of, nor market consensus as to what criteria qualify as, green, social, sustainable or sustainability-linked (and, in addition, the requirements of any such label may evolve from time to time), and therefore no assurance is or can be given that Newmont will meet any or all investor expectations. 
 Our operations are subject to a range of transitional and physical risks related to climate change. 
 We believe that climate change has the potential to impact the regions and sites in which Newmont operates, as well as the surrounding communities. Long-term potential physical climate risks include, but are not limited to, higher temperature in all regions, higher intensity storm events in all regions, impacts to annual precipitation depending upon the latitude and proximity of the site to oceans, and more extreme heat for sites near the equator or in Australia. 
 Physical risks related to extreme weather events such as extreme precipitation, flooding, longer wet or dry seasons, increased temperatures and drought, landslides, wildfires or brushfires, or more severe storms may have financial implications for the business. For example, we experienced severe flooding in early 2017 at our Tanami mine in Australia which led to shutdown of operations for several weeks. In 2019, Tanami completed the construction of a natural gas pipeline to deliver fuel to the site to replace diesel fuel that is trucked to the site on roads that regularly flood due to increasing seasonal rainfall. Our operations in Suriname and Peru have also experienced delays in the connection with the delivery of key production supplies due to temporary flooding. There is also the potential for disruption to transport routes associated with the distribution of our products. Severe storm events can also result in unpermitted off-site discharges, slope instability, mine pit erosion and structural failures, tailings storage facility overtopping and other impacts, including water storage and treatment facility capacity considerations. Extended dry seasons or unseasonal dry conditions could exacerbate dust generation from operating activities that may require additional controls for continued operation or result in compliance breaches. Changing climatic conditions may also affect the likelihood of meeting closure success criteria and require adjustments to mine site rehabilitation and closure plans. The higher potential for extreme heat conditions may affect equipment efficiency. For additional information, see risk factors under the headings Our operations are dependent on the availability of sufficient water supplies and subject to water-related risks and Our Company and the mining industry are facing continued geotechnical challenges, which could adversely impact our production and profitability. 
 Such events can temporarily slow or halt operations due to physical damage to assets, reduced worker productivity for safety protocols on site related to extreme temperatures or lightening events, worker aviation and bus transport to or from the site, and local or global supply route disruptions that may limit transport of essential materials, chemicals and supplies, which could have an adverse impact on our results of operations and financial position. Additional financial impacts could include increased capital or operating costs to increase water storage and treatment capacity, obtain or develop maintenance and monitoring technologies, increase resiliency of facilities and establish supplier climate resiliency and contingency plans. 
 An increase in frequency and duration of extreme weather conditions can be followed by extended power outages. Energy disruptions can have an adverse impact on our results of operations and financial position due to production delays or additional costs to ensure business continuity through reliable sources of on-site power generation. Energy transmission and supply may be impacted by wildfires, such as those that occurred in Australia in 2020, which may interrupt electrical power transmission lines to mine sites, and that may pose risks to on-site facilities and energy generators, fuel dispensing systems and supplies. In jurisdictions that rely on purchased hydroelectric power, such as in Ghana and Peru, extreme drought and extended dry seasons may impact the electric utility s

water supplies needed to generate hydroelectric power purchased by the mine to run operations, which would result in higher costs and/or limit energy availability for continuity of operations as well as impact our environmental systems and processes. 
 Our Company and the mining industry are facing continued geotechnical challenges, which could adversely impact our production and profitability. 
 Newmont and the mining industry are facing continued geotechnical challenges due to the older age of certain of our mines and a trend toward mining deeper pits and more complex deposits. This leads to higher pit walls, more complex underground environments and increased exposure to geotechnical instability and hydrogeological impacts. As our operations are maturing, the open pits at many of our sites are getting deeper and we have experienced geotechnical failures (such as pit wall and slope failures) at some of our mines, including, without limitation, at our operations in Australia, Ghana, Peru, Canada, Colorado and at NGM, in Nevada. See also the risk factor under the heading Mining companies are increasingly required to consider and provide benefits to the communities and countries in which they operate in order to maintain operations . 
 Unanticipated adverse geotechnical and hydrogeological conditions, may occur. For example, seismic activity, such as seismic activity experienced at our l onore mine, surface or underground fires, floods, landslides and pit wall failures, can be difficult to predict. Such conditions are often affected by risks and hazards outside of our control, such as severe weather and considerable rainfall, which may lead to periodic floods, mudslides, wall instability and seismic activity, which may result in slippage of material. Such events may not be detected in advance. 
 In addition, Newmont has both operational (active and inactive) and closed tailings storage facilities ("TSFs") in a variety of climatic and geographic settings. Annually, Newmont manages and disposes more than 100 million tonnes of milled rock slurry, referred to as tailings, that are placed within engineered, surface containment facilities, or placed as structural backfill paste in underground mines. Newmont has experienced seepage at site TSFs in the past which required us to re-evaluate our emergency response systems and make facility and storage modifications. TSF seepage or failures event could occur in the future. The failure of a TSF embankment or a water storage dam at one of our mine sites could cause severe, and in some cases catastrophic, property and environmental damage and loss of life. For example, in early 2019, the extractive industry experienced a large-scale tailings dam failure at an unaffiliated mine in Brazil, which resulted in numerous fatalities and caused extensive property, environmental and reputational damage. Recognizing this risk, Newmont continues to review our existing practices and supported the International Council on Mining Metals and the co-convenors in development of the Global Industry Standard on Tailings Management GISTM ). Newmont is committed to the implementation of the GISTM. We are working to bring our priority facilities (those with 'very high' or 'extreme' consequence classification) in conformance by August 2023, and all other TSFs are expected to be in conformance with the GISTM in the second half of 2025. Compliance with the GISTM remains on-going and has and may continue to result in increases to our estimated sustaining costs and closure costs for existing facilities. Despite these efforts, no assurance can be given that TSF failure events will not occur in the future. 
 A geotechnical failure of a TSF, dam, or pit slope could result in limited or restricted access to mine sites, suspension of operations, government investigations, regulatory actions or penalties, increased monitoring costs, remediation costs and other impacts, which could result in a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial position. See also the risk factors under the heading We may experience increased costs or losses resulting from the hazards and uncertainties associated with mining and Damage to our reputation may result in decreased investor confidence, challenges in maintaining positive community relations and can pose additional obstacles to our ability to develop our projects, which may result in a material adverse impact on our business, financial position, results of operations and growth prospects . 
 Our operations may be adversely affected by rising energy prices or energy shortages. 
 Our mining operations and development projects require significant amounts of energy. Some of our operations are in remote locations requiring long-distance transmission of power, and in some locations we compete with other companies for access to third party power generators or electrical supply networks. A disruption in the transmission of energy, inadequate energy transmission infrastructure or the termination of any of our energy supply contracts could interrupt our energy supply and adversely affect our operations. 
 Our principal energy sources are purchased electricity, diesel fuel, gasoline, natural gas and coal. Increasing global demand for energy, concerns about nuclear power and the limited growth of new energy sources are affecting the price and supply of energy. A variety of factors, including higher energy usage in emerging market economies, actual and proposed taxation of carbon emissions as well as concerns surrounding unrest and the war in Ukraine and conflict elsewhere, could result in increased demand or limited supply of energy and/or sharply escalating diesel fuel, gasoline, natural gas and other energy prices. Availability of renewable power sources or conflicting government regulations, such as the proposed reform of the energy market in Mexico, may have an impact on our ability to meet our reduction targets with a specific timeline. Changes in energy laws and regulations in various jurisdictions, restrictions on energy supply and increased energy prices could negatively impact our operating costs and cash flow. 
 As our operations move to reduce our GHG emissions, power sources and technology at our operations will continue to be evaluated and implemented. Such transitions are likely to require capital expenditures and may result in additional costs. Certain of our operations may also become more dependent upon access to electrical power supply as certain mines advance projects aimed at the electrification of large haulage fleets. The availability to access renewable power (with greater competition) and the readiness of

technology to support decarbonization with the timeframe of the 2030 and 2050 targets remains subject to uncertainties, which could impact ability to achieve targets. See the risk factor above under the heading Our operations are subject to a range of risks related to transitioning the business to meet regulatory, societal and investor expectations for operating in a low-carbon economy . 
 Our operations are dependent on the availability of sufficient water supplies and subject to water-related risks. 
 We recognize the right to clean, safe water and that reliable water supplies are vital for hygiene, sanitation, livelihoods and the health of the environment. Water is also critical to our business, and the increasing pressure on water resources requires us to consider both current and future conditions in our management approach. We have set annual water efficiency targets at each of our operating sites. Additionally, we aim to achieve ambitious long-term water stewardship actions, which integrate our operations and value chain and support collective management of water through external partnerships and collaborations. A failure to meet our water targets and/or societal or investor expectations could also result in damage to our reputation, decreased investor confidence and challenges in maintaining positive community relations, which can pose additional obstacles to our ability to develop our projects, which may result in a material adverse impact on our business, financial position, results of operations and growth prospects. 
 Across the globe, water is a shared and regulated resource. Newmont operates in areas where watersheds are under stress with limited supply, increasing population and water demand, and impacted water in various forms. Increasing pressure on water use may occur due to in-migration of communities and increased populations in proximity to our operations. Although each of our operations currently has sufficient water rights, claims and contracts to cover its operational demands, we cannot predict the potential outcome of pending or future legal proceedings or community negotiations relating to our water rights, claims, contracts and uses. 
 Water shortages and surplus may also result from weather or climate impacts outside of the Company s control. Changes in the quantity of water, whether in excess or deficient amounts, may impact exploration and development activities, mining and processing operations, water management and treatment facilities, tailings storage facilities, closure and reclamation efforts, and may increase levels of dust in dry conditions and land erosion and slope stability in case of prolonged wet conditions. Our Pe asquito and CC V operations are situated in areas with high baseline water stress. CC V in Colorado must purchase water supply in order to meet site needs and augmentation requirements. Pe asquito in Mexico takes its water supply from the Cedros Aquifer which has limited and declining yield as it is located in a dry and arid area that is prone to drought, and also is relied upon by nearby communities as a water supply for drinking water and agriculture. The water supply at Pe asquito is thus subject to a significant degree of regulatory and community scrutiny, and Pe asquito has made long-term commitments to provide safe community water supplies. Seasonality and changes in the levels of rainfall can also impact our operations. For example, in January 2023, our Tanami site in Australia experienced unexpected and significant rain resulting in flooding and road closure limiting our ability to get supplies to the site, causing mill backup and impacts to production. Similarly, at Boddington in Australia severe weather and heavy rainfall at Boddington caused delays and impacted productivity the third quarter of 2021 and 2022. There is also a risk at Boddington that extended below average rainfall or the occurrence of drought in southwest Australia could impact raw water supply for the site. While we have incorporated systems to address the impact of the dry season and water shortages as part of our operating plans, we can make no assurances that those systems will be sufficient to address all shortages in water supply, which could result in production and processing interruptions. 
 Increased precipitation and severe storm events may potentially impact tailings storage facilities in the future by exceeding water management capacity, overtopping the facility, and/or undermining the geotechnical stability of the structure. We have experienced impacts at various sites in recent years due to heavy rainfall and severe storms. For example, in 2022, Yanacocha experienced heavy rainfall, above average historical levels, which resulted in significant water balance stress and required active emergency management. Refer to Note 25 to the Consolidated Financial Statements under the heading Environmental Matters - Minera Yanacocha S.R.L , for additional information. Increased amounts of water may also result in flooding of mine pits, maintenance and storage facilities; or may exceed current water management and treatment capacity to store and treat water, physical conditions resulting in an unintended overflow and discharge either on or off of the mine site property. See the risk factor above under the heading Our operations are subject to a range of risks related to transitioning the business to meet regulatory, societal and investor expectations for operating in a low-carbon economy for additional information. 
 Operations have identified seepage from infrastructure (tailings, waste rock and seepage) that may have an impact on groundwater. We are currently managing this risk through monitoring, collection and treatment systems. There is a risk that the seepage could have an impact on beneficial use of groundwater resulting in increased requirements for collection and treatment as well as the potential requirement to provide alternative water sources. See also the risk factor under the heading Our Company and the mining industry are facing continued geotechnical challenges, which could adversely impact our production and profitability. 
 Laws and regulations may be introduced in some jurisdictions in which we operate which could limit our access to sufficient water resources in our operations, thus adversely affecting our operations. Additionally, laws, regulations and permit requirements focused on water management and discharge requirements for operations and water treatment in closure are becoming increasingly stringent. For example, at our Pe asquito operation, regulators have asserted non-conformance of water wells and subsequent use of ground water. A failure to resolve such allegations of non-compliance with regulators could result in loss of permits and restriction of such wells, which could impact our ability to operate the site. We are also seeing increasingly stringent regulations of surface and groundwater at a number of our sites resulting in increased monitoring and potentially the need for pump back systems and treatment in the future. New requirements and regulation have resulted or may result in increased costs and could negatively impact our operating costs and cash flows in the future.

 Risks Related to the Jurisdictions in Which We Operate 
 Our operations are subject to risks of doing business in multiple jurisdictions. 
 Exploration, development, production and mine closure activities are subject to regional, political, economic, community and other risks of doing business in multiple jurisdictions, including: 
 Potential instability of foreign governments and changes in government policies, including relating to or in response to changes of U.S. laws or foreign policies; 
 Expropriation or nationalization of property; 
 Restrictions on the ability to pay dividends offshore or to otherwise repatriate funds; 
 Restrictions on the ability of local operating companies to sell gold and other metals offshore for U.S. dollars, or on the ability of such companies to hold U.S. dollars or other foreign currencies in offshore bank accounts; 
 Import and export regulations, including restrictions on the export of gold, silver, copper, zinc and/or lead; 
 Disadvantages relating to submission to the jurisdiction of foreign courts or arbitration panels or enforcement or appeals of judgments at foreign courts or arbitration panels against a sovereign nation within its own territory; 
 Royalty and tax increases or claims, including retroactive increases and claims and requests to renegotiate terms of existing investment agreements, contracts of work, leases, royalties and taxes, by governmental entities, including such increases, claims and/or requests by the governments of Argentina, Australia, Canada, Chile, the Dominican Republic, Ghana, Mexico, Peru, Suriname, the State of Colorado and the State of Nevada in the U.S.; 
 Changes in laws or regulations in the jurisdictions in which we operate, including in changes resulting from changes in political administrations; 
 Risk of increased taxation related to impacts to government revenue as a result of challenging socioeconomic conditions, including recessions and/or in connection with heath and community emergencies, such as COVID-19 and other pandemics, epidemics or outbreaks; 
 Fines, fees, and sanctions imposed for failure to comply with the laws and regulations of the jurisdictions in which we operate; 
 Risk of loss due to inability to access our properties or operations; 
 Other risks arising out of foreign sovereignty over the areas in which our operations are conducted, including risks inherent in contracts with government owned entities such as unilateral cancellation or renegotiation of contracts, licenses or other mining rights; 
 Delays in obtaining or renewing, or the inability to obtain, maintain or renew, necessary governmental permits, mining or operating leases and other agreements and/or approvals; 
 Risk of loss due to civil strife, acts of war, guerrilla activities, insurrection and terrorism; 
 Claims for increased mineral royalties or ownership interests by local or indigenous communities; 
 Risk of loss due to criminal activities such as trespass, blockade, local artisanal or illegal mining, organized crime by drug cartels, theft and vandalism; 
 Delays in obtaining or renewing collective bargaining or certain labor agreements; 
 Disadvantages of competing against companies from countries that are not subject to the rigorous laws and regulations of the U.S. or other jurisdictions, including without limitation, the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, the U.K. Bribery Act and the Dodd-Frank Act; 
 Increases in training and other costs and challenges relating to requirements by governmental entities to employ the nationals of the country in which a particular operation is located; 
 Increased financing costs; 
 Currency fluctuations, particularly in countries with high inflation; 
 Foreign exchange controls; 
 Increases in costs relating to, or restrictions or prohibitions on, the use of ports for concentrate storage and shipping, such as in relation to our Boddington operation where use of alternative ports is not currently economical, or in relation to our ability to procure economically feasible ports for developing projects; 
 31 

Table of Contents 

Risk of disruption, damage or failure of information technology systems, and risk of loss and operational delays due to impacts to operational technology systems, such as due to cyber-attacks, malicious software computer viruses, security breaches, design failures and natural disasters; 
 Risk of loss due to disease, such as malaria or the zika virus, and other potential medical endemic or pandemic issues, such as Ebola or COVID-19, as a result of the potential related impact to employees, disruption to operations, supply chain delays, trade restrictions and impact on economic activity in affected countries or regions; and 
 Disadvantage and risk of loss due to the limitations of certain local health systems and infrastructure to contain diseases and potential endemic health issues. 
 Consequently, our exploration, development and production activities may be affected by these and other factors, many of which are beyond our control, some of which could materially adversely affect our financial position or results of operations. 
 New or changing legislation and tax risks in certain operating jurisdictions could negatively affect us. 
 We have operations and conduct business in a number of jurisdictions, which may increase our susceptibility to sudden tax changes. For instance, a 12 export duty was imposed by the Argentine government in 2018, revised down to 8 thereafter, which could affect our Argentine operations. In the province of Santa Cruz, Argentina, a local procurement law was passed in 2021 requiring extractive industries to procure at least 50 of their goods and services from registered local providers, which could further impact our operational results. In the State of Zacatecas, Mexico, environmental taxes became effective in 2017 with little clarity on how the taxes are to be calculated. An ecological tax agreement was ratified in 2021 which provides clarity for 2021 to 2024, after which, the Company, along with other companies in the State of Zacatecas, will need to engage with governmental authorities to understand how the environmental tax would be levied year-over-year. Also, in Mexico, a 2021 tax reform bill proposed federal fees on revenue generated from mining which could impact our operations if passed. Furthermore, a new Economic Plan for 2022 (the "Proposal") was enacted. While the changes under the Proposal are not substantive in nature (in the sense that they do not create new taxes or increase applicable rates), they may increase the future cost of our compliance and pose additional uncertainties in application of the law. In the United States, at the federal and state level, regulatory changes which may be implemented in the area of tax reform remain uncertain and may adversely affect companies in the mining sector. For example, NGM could be impacted by the resolutions before the State of Nevada Legislature to amend the State Constitution to increase mining taxes. An example of this was the passing of Assembly Bill 495 in 2021 that results in a new excise tax on mining companies engaged in the business of extracting gold and silver in the state of Nevada. Taxation laws and other regulations of the jurisdictions in which we operate are complex, subject to varying interpretations and applications by the relevant tax authorities and subject to changes and revisions in the ordinary course. It is difficult to predict whether proposed changes to regulations will be passed or to what extend they will impact the Company. Any additional and/or unexpected taxes imposed on us could have a material and adverse impact on our Company. See also the risk factor under the heading Our operations are subject to a range of risks related to transitioning the business to meet regulatory, societal and investor expectations for operating in a low-carbon economy for a discussion of uncertainties and potential tax increases in connection with climate change considerations. 
 Changes in mining or investment policies or shifts in political and social attitudes in the jurisdictions in which we operate may adversely affect our operations or profitability. 
 Our operations may be affected in a number of ways by laws and regulations related, but not limited to: restrictions on production; price controls; export controls; import restrictions, such as restrictions applicable to, among other things, equipment, services and supplies, currency remittance, income taxes, expropriation of property, foreign investment, maintenance of mineral claims, environmental legislation, land use, surface land access, land claims of local communities, water use, and mine safety. Failure to comply strictly with applicable laws, regulations and local practices relating to mineral right applications and tenure could result in loss, reduction or expropriation of entitlements, or the imposition of additional local or foreign parties as partners with carried or other interests, any of which may adversely affect our operations or profitability. 
 In addition, as governments continue to struggle with deficits and concerns over the potential and actual effects of depressed economic conditions (including in connection with COVID-19 impacts), many of them have targeted the mining and metals sector in order to raise revenue. Governments are continually assessing the fiscal terms of the economic rent for a mining company to exploit resources in their countries. Numerous countries have implemented changes to their mining regimes that reflect increased government control over or participation in the mining sector, including, but not limited to, changes of law affecting foreign ownership and takeovers, mandatory government participation in mining enterprises, taxation and royalties, working conditions, rates of exchange, exchange controls, exploration licensing, export duties, requirements to sell to the government, repatriation of income or return of capital, environmental protection, as well as requirements intended to boost the local economy, including usage of local goods and employment of local and community staff or contractors, among other benefits to be provided to local residents. The effects of the various requirements and uncertainties related to the economic risks of operating in foreign jurisdictions cannot be accurately predicted and could have a material adverse effect on our financial position or results of operations. Some concern exists with respect to investments in parts of the world where civil unrest, war, nationalist movements, political violence or economic crises are possible. These countries may also pose heightened risks of expropriation of assets, business interruption, increased taxation or unilateral modification of concessions and contracts. We do not maintain insurance policies against political risk. Occurrence of events for which we are not insured may affect our results of operations and financial position.

Our operations at Yanacocha and the development of our Conga project in Peru are subject to political and social unrest risks. 
 Minera Yanacocha S.R.L. Yanacocha ), including the mining operations at Yanacocha and the Conga project in Peru, has been the target of local political and community protests, some of which blocked the road between the Yanacocha mine and Conga project complexes and the City of Cajamarca in Peru and resulted in vandalism and equipment damage. While recently roadblocks and protests have diminished and focused on local political activism and labor disputes, we cannot predict whether similar or more significant incidents will occur in the future. The recurrence of significant political or community opposition or protests could continue to adversely affect the Conga Project s development, other new projects in the area and the continued operation of Yanacocha. 
 Construction activities on our Conga project were suspended in 2011, at the request of Peru s central government following protests in Cajamarca by anti-mining activists led by the regional president. At the request of the Peruvian central government, the environmental impact assessment prepared in connection with the project was reviewed by independent experts in an effort to resolve allegations around the environmental viability of Conga. This review concluded that the environmental impact assessment complied with international standards and provided recommendations to improve water management. Based on the Company's internal project portfolio evaluation process, we have reprioritized other projects ahead of the Conga project, and therefore do not anticipate developing Conga in the next ten years. Due to the uncertainty surrounding the project s development timeline, we have allocated our exploration and development capital to other projects in our portfolio. As a result, the Conga project is currently in care and maintenance and we will continue to evaluate long-term options to progress development of the Conga project. Should the Company be unable to develop the Conga project or conclude that future development is not in the best interest of the business, a future impairment charge may result. 
 The prior Central Government of Peru supported responsible mining as a vehicle for the growth and future development of Peru. However, following the presidential election in 2021, there has been considerable political unrest in Peru. In a close and contested election, Pedro Castillo was declared the president-elect of Peru in July 2021, which resulted in a period of protests, unrest and uncertainty around the political and social environment in Peru and Cajamarca. Amidst political turmoil and instability, Castillo made numerous changes to his cabinet, including ministers of mining, work and interior, and of prime ministers. Castillo was ultimately removed from office in late 2022 due to his attempt to dissolve the legislative body and install an emergency government. Political turmoil and division has continued in Peru as protest and demonstrations against the current President Dina Boluarte escalated in early 2023 resulting in clashes with security forces and violence. 
 The current Central Government s legislative priorities and support for responsible mining in Peru remains uncertain. Previous regional governments of Cajamarca and other political parties actively opposed certain mining projects in the past, including by protests, community demands and road blockages, which may occur again in the future. We are unable to predict the positions that will be taken by the Central or regional government and neighboring communities in the future and whether such positions or changes in law will affect current operations and new projects at Yanacocha or Conga. Risks related to mining and foreign investment under the new administration include, without limitation, risks to mining concessions, land tenure and permitting, increased taxes and royalties, nationalization of mining assets and increased labor regulations, environmental and other regulatory requirements. Any change in government positions or laws on these issues could adversely affect the assets and operations of Yanacocha or Conga, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial position. Additionally, the inability to develop Conga or operate or expand at Yanacocha could have an adverse impact on our growth and production in the region. See also the risk factor under the heading Mine closure, reclamation and remediation costs for environmental liabilities may exceed the provisions we have made and refer to Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements regarding the Company s interest in Yanacocha. 
 Our Merian operation in Suriname is subject to political and economic risks. 
 We hold a 75 interest in the Merian gold mine Merian in the mid-eastern part of Suriname. Suriname has experienced political instability and uncertainty in the past which may continue in future years. Suriname is faced with high debts to foreign creditors, significant inflation rates and has experienced a hyperinflationary economy. Significant devaluation of the Surinamese dollar against the U.S. dollar in recent years has resulted in an increase of the prices of certain goods and services within Suriname, including without limitation, the price of fuel, which had been subsidized by successive governments. The government of Suriname recently passed a new law to introduce Value Added Tax, which came into effect on January 1, 2023 and has drastically increased the cost of living and negatively impacts the purchasing power of the residents of Suriname, including our employees. These impacts and negative economic trends can cause social unrest, which may present risks for our operations in Suriname. 
 Operations and development in Suriname are governed by a mineral agreement with the Republic of Suriname. The mineral agreement was approved by parliament and requires approval by parliament to change. However, in 2021, the government made requests for prepayment of taxes and special solidarity payments in light of budgetary concerns, it is possible that the government may request changes to the mineral agreement in the future. While the government is generally considered by the Company to be mining friendly, it is possible that the current or future government may adopt substantially different policies, make changes in taxation treatment or regulations, take arbitrary action which might halt operations, increase costs, or otherwise impact mining and exploration rights and/or permits, any of which could have a material and adverse effect on the Company's future cash flows, earnings, results of operations and/or financial condition.

The government of Suriname previously exercised an option to participate in a fully-funded 25 percent equity ownership stake in Merian. Suriname manages its participation through Staatsolie Maatschappij Suriname N.V. Staatsolie ), a Surinamese corporation with the Republic of Suriname as sole shareholder. If Staatsolie does not have sufficient funds or borrowing ability to make their capital commitments in accordance with the terms of the partnership agreement our operations in Suriname could be impacted. See the risk factor under the heading Future funding requirements may affect our business, our ability to pay cash dividends or our ability to engage in share repurchase transactions. earlier in this section under Risks Related to Our Business . 
 Our operations at Ahafo and Akyem in Ghana are subject to political, economic and other risks. 
 Newmont operates in Ghana pursuant to a Revised Investment Agreement ratified by Ghana s Parliament in 2015, which established a fixed fiscal and legal regime, including fixed royalty and tax rates, for Newmont operations in Ghana. The financial and tax stability periods established by such agreements expire as early as 2025 for Ahafo and 2027 for Akyem. The Republic of Ghana has experienced worsening socioeconomic conditions in recent years. The Ghanaian cedi has experienced significant depreciation with inflation accelerating to 54.1 at the end of 2022. Ghana s credit rating worsened to speculative grade, at near default to default levels, as the Ghanaian Finance Ministry announced suspension of debt service payments in December 2022 on the majority of its external debt, including commercial and bilateral loans, and that Ghana was seeking to restructure its debt. Efforts in early 2023 to put in place a domestic debt exchange program have faced setbacks from pension funds and by individual bond holders leading to amended terms. Continued economic recession and/or unfavorable macroeconomic indicators have also resulted in pressures from the Government of Ghana to obtain more revenue and benefits from mining companies on the back of anti-mining sentiment and perceived inequities that the industry is not contributing its fair share. To address budgetary deficits, the Government of Ghana has in the past, and is expected in 2023, to initiate measures to generate additional revenue from the mining industry and other sectors of the economy as it attempts to increase revenue collection through various tax audits and investigations, proposed new fees, increased revenue and tax initiatives and other vehicles, such as the proposed Growth and Stabilization Levy as well as new local content regulation. Other risks include impacts to supply chain, restrictions and local procurement requirements, increase in key commodity prices, more restrictive local banking requirements including requirements for repatriation of proceeds to banks domiciled in Ghana, limitations on capacity of banks to provide reclamation bonds, requests for further local employment requirements, requests for contract renegotiation and increases in contract rates and other costs. Additionally, the government may grant artisanal mining rights or alternative mining rights, such as sand and gravel, in locations in which the Company has land rights, but no active operations, impacting the Company s non-operational land positions. Economic setbacks and anti-mining sentiment can also result in an increase in community frustration and friction with artisanal small-scale mining resulting in conflicts, which can negatively impact our operations in Ghana. 
 Our operations in Argentina are susceptible to risk as a result of economic and political instability in Argentina and labor unrest. 
 There continue to be risks relating to the uncertain and unpredictable political and economic environment in Argentina, especially at the provincial level in Santa Cruz where our Cerro Negro mine is located. Inflation remains a challenge in Argentina and Argentina s central bank enacted a number of foreign currency controls in 2019 and 2020 in an effort to stabilize the local currency. For information on Argentina s foreign currency controls and their effect on our operations, see the section titled Foreign Currency Exchange Rates in Item 7, Management s Discussion and Analysis of Consolidated Financial Condition and Results of Operations. Maintaining operating revenues in Argentine pesos could expose us to the risks of peso devaluation and high domestic inflation. 
 In recent years, we experienced work stoppages by miners represented by unions at the Cerro Negro Mine. Disruptions may arise again in the future with the unions at the Cerro Negro mine or with the local communities and unions that could adversely affect access to, and operations at, the Cerro Negro Mine. 
 Risks Related to Our Workforce 
 Our business depends on good relations with our employees. 
 Production at our mines is dependent upon the efforts of our employees and, consequently, our maintenance of good relationships with our employees. Due to union activities or other employee actions, we could experience labor disputes, work stops or other disruptions in production that could adversely affect us. For example, in recent years, there have been work stoppages by miners represented by unions at our Cerro Negro and Merian mines, which have disrupted operations. At December 31, 2022, various unions represented approximately 33 of our employee workforce worldwide. In 2022, Newmont implemented a new employment model in Ghana converting permanent employees into two-year fixed term contracts. Although 99.8 of eligible employees accepted the new fixed term contract and, received severance for their years of service, following implementation of the new employment model, the two unions requested and were granted a new collective bargaining certificates from Ghana s Chief Labor Officer. Both certificates have been placed on hold to engage in proper process in accordance with Ghana s Labor laws, and until Newmont and the unions agree on the class of workers to be represented. The outcome of that engagement and whether such certificates will be granted remains to be determined. In Peru, our two labor agreements expire in 2026 and 2027. In Suriname, the previous labor agreement held with the union for our Merian mine expired in 2021, and negotiations remain in progress. In Argentina where there are two unions; one union has an expired agreement under negotiation and another has an agreement in place until 2024. In Timmins, Ontario, we renegotiated a three-year collective bargaining agreement for our Porcupine mine with the United Steelworkers Union which will be in effect through

October 2023. In Mexico, following negotiations, we reached a profit sharing agreement in 2022 whereby union represented workforce will participate in uncapped profit-sharing bonus up to 10 , which will result in increased labor costs in the future. A failure to successfully enter into new contracts or resolve ongoing union complaints could result in future labor disputes, work stoppages or other disruptions in production that could adversely affect our operations and financial performance. Future disputes at the Company s operations, projects or joint ventures may not be resolved without disruptions. 
 We may not be able to operate successfully if we are unable to recruit, hire, retain and develop key personnel and a qualified and diverse workforce. In addition, we are dependent upon our employees being able to perform their jobs in a safe and respectful work environment. 
 We depend upon the services of a number of key executives and management personnel. Our success is also dependent on the contributions of our highly skilled and experienced workforce. Our ability to achieve our operating goals depends upon our ability to recruit, hire, retain and develop qualified and diverse personnel to execute on our strategy. We are fundamentally committed to creating and maintaining a work environment in which employees are treated fairly, with dignity, decency, respect and in accordance with all applicable laws. We recognize that bullying, sexual harassment and harassment based on other protected categories, including race, have been prevalent in every industry, including the mining industry. Features of the mining industry, such as being a historically hierarchical and male-dominated culture, create risk factors for harmful workplace behavior. While we do not tolerate discrimination and harassment of any kind (including but not limited to sexual orientation, gender identity, race, religion, ethnicity, age, or disability, among others), our policies and processes may not prevent or detect all potential harmful workplace behaviors. We occasionally identify or are apprised of information or allegations that certain employees, affiliates, agents or associated persons may have engaged in harmful behaviors and improper, inappropriate or unlawful conduct, including but not limited to bullying, discrimination and harassment. If the Company fails to maintain a safe, respectful and inclusive work environment, it could impact our ability to retain talent and maintain a diverse workforce and damage the Company s reputation. There continues to be competition over highly skilled personnel in our industry. If we lose key personnel, or one or more members of our senior management team, and we fail to develop adequate succession plans, or if we fail to hire, retain and develop qualified and diverse employees, our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows could be harmed. 
 Our business is dependent upon our workforce being able to safely perform their jobs, including the potential for physical injuries or illness. If we experience periods where our employees are unable to perform their jobs for any reason, including as a result of illness (such as COVID-19), our operations could be adversely affected. See the risk factor under the heading Our operations and business have been affected by the COVID-19 pandemic, and may be materially and adversely impacted in the future. In addition to physical safety, protecting the psychological safety of our employees is necessary to maintaining a safe, respectful and inclusive work environment. If the Company fails to maintain a safe environment that is free of harassment, discrimination or bullying, it could adversely impact employee engagement, performance and productivity, result in potential legal claims and/or damage the Company s reputation, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial position and results of operations or adversely affect the Company s market value. See also the risk factor under the heading " Damage to our reputation may result in decreased investor confidence, challenges in maintaining positive community relations and can pose additional obstacles to our ability to develop our projects, which may result in a material adverse impact on our business, financial position, results of operations and growth prospects . 
 We rely on contractors to conduct a significant portion of our operations and construction projects. 
 A significant portion of our operations and construction projects are currently conducted in whole or in part by contractors. As a result, our operations are subject to a number of risks, some of which are outside our control, including: 
 Negotiating agreements with contractors on acceptable terms; 
 New legislation limiting or altering the ability to utilize contractors or outsourced resources; 
 The inability to replace a contractor and its operating equipment in the event that either party terminates the agreement; 
 Reduced control over those aspects of operations which are the responsibility of the contractor; 
 Failure of a contractor to perform under its agreement; 
 Interruption of operations or increased costs in the event that a contractor ceases its business due to insolvency or other unforeseen events; 
 Failure of a contractor to comply with applicable legal and regulatory requirements, to the extent it is responsible for such compliance; and 
 Problems of a contractor with managing its workforce, labor unrest or other employment issues; 
 Liability to third parties as a result of the actions of our contractors. 
 In addition, law and regulations relating to the use of contractors may vary in the jurisdictions in which we operate, and changes in legal and regulatory restrictions may also impact our ability to utilize contractors and outsourcing services. For example,

new mining industry regulations recently came into effect in Ghana, Africa, which require that the supply of specific products and services, and certain roles, be reserved for citizens, which may limit the pool of available contractors and service providers and restrict our ability to utilize certain contractors. Additionally, the Mexican government enacted labor and tax laws in April 2021, significantly restricting certain subcontracting and outsourcing of personnel, which has required the conversion of certain contractors to employee status and resulted in increased labor costs. Further changes in law and the occurrence of one or more of these risks could adversely affect our results of operations and financial position. 
 Legal Risks 
 Our business is subject to the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and other extraterritorial and domestic anti-bribery laws and regulations, a breach or violation of which could lead to substantial sanctions and civil and criminal prosecution, as well as fines and penalties, litigation, loss of licenses or permits and other collateral consequences and reputational harm. 
 We operate in certain jurisdictions that have experienced governmental and private sector corruption to some degree, and, in certain circumstances, compliance with anti-bribery laws and heightened expectations of enforcement authorities may be in tension with certain local customs and practices. The U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and other laws with extraterritorial reach, including the U.K. Bribery Act, and anti-bribery laws in other jurisdictions in which we operate generally prohibit companies and their intermediaries from making improper payments for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business or other commercial advantage. We have a business integrity and compliance program which includes our Code of Conduct, Business Integrity Policy and other policies and standards, all of which mandate compliance with these anti-bribery laws by the Company and its affiliates and their personnel, and also by third parties when they are engaged on our behalf. Our program also includes a well-publicized helpline for raising complaints, questions and concerns as well as processes for evaluating and investigating such concerns and assurances of non-retaliation for persons who raise concerns in good faith. We report regularly to the executive leadership team and the Audit Committee of our Board of Directors on such programs and the results of investigations conducted. 
 We could be held responsible if our internal control policies and procedures fail to protect us from misinterpretation of or noncompliance with applicable anti-bribery laws, regulations and internal policies, recklessness, fraudulent behavior, dishonesty or other inappropriate acts committed by the our affiliates, employees, agents or associated persons for which we might be claimed to be responsible. As such, our corporate policies and processes may not prevent or detect all potential breaches of law or other governance practices. In addition, the compliance mechanisms and monitoring programs adopted and implemented by Goldcorp prior to our acquisition of Goldcorp in April 2019 may not have adequately prevented or detected possible violations of the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and the Corruption of Foreign Officials Act (Canada) attributable to Goldcorp prior to our acquisition of Goldcorp and we may be held liable for any such violations. We occasionally identify or are apprised of information or allegations that certain employees, affiliates, agents or associated persons may have engaged in improper or unlawful conduct for which we might be held responsible. Our policy when receiving credible information or allegations is to conduct internal investigations and compliance reviews to evaluate that information, determine compliance with applicable anti-bribery laws and regulations and company policies and take such remedial steps as may be warranted. In appropriate circumstances, we communicate with authorities in the United States and elsewhere about those investigations and reviews. Violations of these laws, or allegations of such violations, could lead to substantial sanctions and civil and criminal prosecution, as well as fines and penalties, litigation, loss of operating licenses or permits and other collateral consequences, and may damage the Company s reputation, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial position and results of operations or cause the market value of our common shares to decline. 
 Title to some of our properties may be insufficient, defective, or challenged. 
 The sufficiency or validity of the Company's rights, titles, or interests in and to its properties ("Legal Title") may be uncertain or challenged by third parties, including governmental authorities, Indigenous or communal peoples, or private parties. For example, at our Conga project in Peru, we continue to seek resolution to a land dispute with local residents. In Mexico, exploration and mining rights are granted through a mining concession, pertaining to the mineral estate, and do not include rights of ownership, possession, or access in or to the corresponding surface estate. Such rights in and to the surface estate are acquired through purchase, lease, or easement from private parties, local communities, or governmental authorities. We enter into temporary occupation agreements ranging from five to 30 years with the Ejido communities, which allow us to use the surface of the lands for our mining operations, and at any particular time we may be involved in negotiations to enter into new temporary occupation agreements or other surface access agreements or amend existing agreements. Failure to reach new agreements or disputes regarding existing agreements may cause, blockades, suspension of operations, delays to projects, and on occasion, may lead to legal disputes. 
 In addition, certain Australian and Canadian properties are owned by Indigenous peoples or are subject to certain inherent aboriginal rights, treaty rights, and/or asserted rights in and to their traditional territories, and our ability to acquire necessary rights to explore, develop, or mine these properties is dependent on agreements with them. Our ability to secure such agreements may be dependent on formal determinations of Indigenous or Native title rights issued by governmental authorities, the lack or delay of which may impede the Company s ability to explore, develop, or mine. In French Guiana, Ghana and Suriname, our Legal Title may be subject to challenge based on the presence and activities of artisanal miners. See the risk factor under the heading Illegal mining and artisanal mining occurs on or adjacent to certain of our properties exposing such sites to security risks below for further information. A determination of insufficient or defective Legal Title or risks in connection with a challenge to our Legal Title could result in loss of Legal

Title, litigation, insurance claims, the impairment, preclusion, or cessation of exploration, development, or mining operations, and potential losses affecting the Company's business as a whole. 
 Risks Related to Our Common Stock 
 The price of our common stock may be volatile, which may make it difficult for you to resell the common stock when you want or at prices you find attractive. 
 As a publicly traded company listed on the NYSE and TSX, the market price and volume of our common stock may be subject to significant fluctuations due not only to general stock market conditions but also to a change in sentiment in the market regarding our operations, business prospects or liquidity. Among the factors that could affect the price of our common stock are: (i) changes in gold, and to a lesser extent, silver, copper, zinc or lead prices; (ii) operating and financial performance that vary from the expectations of management, securities analysts and investors or our financial outlook; (iii) developments in our business or in the mining sector generally; (iv) regulatory changes affecting our industry generally or our business and operations; (v) the operating and stock price performance of companies that investors consider to be comparable to us; (vi) announcements of strategic developments, acquisitions and other material events by us or our competitors; (vii) our ability to integrate and operate the companies and the businesses that we acquire; (viii) the perception of the Company s ESG performance and its ability to deliver on ESG commitments and expectations, including in connection with the Company's climate strategy; (ix) response to activism; and (x) changes in global financial markets and global economies and general market conditions, such as interest or foreign exchange rates, stock, commodity, credit or asset valuations or volatility. The stock markets in general have experienced extreme volatility that has at times been unrelated to the operating performance of particular companies, and the COVID-19 pandemic has increased, and may continue to increase, volatility and pricing in the capital markets. These broad market fluctuations may adversely affect the trading price of our common stock. 
 Holders of our common stock may not receive dividends. 
 Holders of our common stock are entitled to receive only such dividends as our Board of Directors may declare out of funds legally available for such payments. We are incorporated in Delaware and governed by the Delaware General Corporation Law. Delaware law allows a corporation to pay dividends only out of surplus, as determined under Delaware law or, if there is no surplus, out of net profits for the fiscal year in which the dividend was declared and for the preceding fiscal year. Under Delaware law, however, we cannot pay dividends out of net profits if, after we pay the dividend, our capital would be less than the capital represented by the outstanding stock of all classes having a preference upon the distribution of assets. Our ability to pay dividends will be subject to our future earnings, capital requirements, financial condition, compliance with covenants and financial ratios related to existing or future indebtedness and other factors deemed relevant by our Board of Directors. Although we have historically declared cash dividends on our common stock, we are not required to declare cash dividends on our common stock. An annualized dividend payout level has not been declared by the Board of Directors, and the declaration and payment of future dividends, including future quarterly dividends, remains at the discretion of the Board of Directors. Our dividend framework is non-binding, and our Board of Directors may modify the dividend framework or reduce, defer or eliminate our common stock dividend in the future.

(100 owned) Pe asquito is an open pit operation located in the northeast corner of Zacatecas State, Mexico, approximately 125 miles (200 kilometers) northeast of the city of Zacatecas and is accessible by paved roads with a private airport close to the site. The property began production in 2009, with commercial production being achieved in 2010. Goldcorp acquired its ownership in the mine in 2006 when it acquired Glamis. In 2019, Newmont acquired Goldcorp, obtaining full ownership interest in Pe asquito. Pe asquito consists of the Pe asco and Chile Colorado open pit mines. 
 
 Pe asquito is comprised of 20 mining concessions for operations comprising 113,231 acres (45,823 hectares) and 60 mining concessions for exploration of 107,456 acres (43,486 hectares). Surface rights in the vicinity of the Pe asco and Chile Colorado open pits are held by three ejidos: Ejido Cedros, Ejido Mazapil and Ejido Cerro Gordo. Pe asquito has signed land use agreements with each ejidos, valid through 2035 and 2036, and the relevant private owners. 

In August 2020, the Company and Cedros General Assembly ratified the definitive agreement that was reached on April 22, 2020 and resolved all outstanding disputes between Pe asquito and the San Juan de Cedros community (Cedros). In addition, easements have been granted in association with the La Pardita-Cedros Highway and the El Salero-Pe asquito powerline. All necessary permits have been granted. 
 In July 2007, Goldcorp and Wheaton Precious Metals Corp. (then Silver Wheaton Corp.) entered into a silver streaming agreement. The Company is obligated to sell 25 of silver production from the Pe asquito mine to Wheaton Precious Metals Corporation at the lesser of market price or a fixed contract price, subject to an annual inflation adjustment of up to 1.65 .

 A 2 net smelter return royalty is owed to Royal Gold Inc. from both the Chile Colorado and Pe asco open pits of the Pe asquito mine. Since January 1, 2014, the Mexican Government levies a 7.5 mining royalty that is imposed on earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization. There is also a 0.5 environmental erosion fee payable on precious metal production, based on revenues. In December 2016, the State of Zacatecas in Mexico approved new environmental taxes Ecological Taxes that became effective January 1, 2017. The Ecological Taxes are calculated based on a predetermined formula and the volume of carbon emissions, as well as other environmental variables, at Pe asquito. The Company's payment of the Ecological Taxes primarily relates to the volume of carbon emissions at Pe asquito from fixed and mobile sources. 
 The mineralization at Pe asquito contains gold, silver, lead and zinc. Deposits currently mined within the Pe asquito operations are considered to be examples of breccia pipes developed as a result of intrusion-related hydrothermal activity. 
 Process facilities include a sulfide processing plant, comprising four stages of flotation: carbon, lead, zinc and pyrite. The carbon pre-flotation circuit was added in 2018 ahead of lead flotation to remove organic carbon associated with sedimentary ores. In the lead and zinc flotation, the slurry is conditioned with reagents to activate the desired minerals and produce lead and zinc concentrates. The pyrite circuit flotation was added at the end of 2018, which treats the zinc tailings in a pyrite flotation leach, and Merrill Crowe process to recover additional silver and gold in the form of dor . The tailings from the leach circuit undergoes cyanide destruction and combines with final flotation tailings for final deposition in the tailings storage facility. 
 The available mining fleet consists of five rope shovels, three hydraulic shovels, three loaders, and 82 haul trucks, each with a 312-tonne payload. The fleet is supported by 9 blast hole production drills, as well as track dozers, rubber tire dozers, excavators, and graders.

Commercial production was achieved in January 2013 and the Pueblo Viejo Mine completed its ramp-up to full design capacity in 2014. In March 2006, Barrick acquired the Pueblo Viejo mine as a result of their acquisition of Placer Dome Inc and subsequently sold 40 to Goldcorp. Newmont obtained the 40 ownership of Pueblo Viejo when Newmont acquired Goldcorp in 2019. We report our interest in Pueblo Viejo on an equity method basis. 
 
 The Pueblo Viejo mine is an open pit conventional truck and shovel mining operation located approximately 60 miles (100 kilometers) northwest of Santo Domingo, Dominican Republic. The Pueblo Viejo mine is situated on the Montenegro Fiscal Reserve, an area specially designated by Presidential Decree for the leasing of minerals and mine development, which covers an area of approximately 19,756 acres (7,995 hectares) in aggregate. The property is accessible year-round by paved road from Santo Domingo. 

A special lease agreement SLA between the Dominican State and Pueblo Viejo governs the development and operation of the Pueblo Viejo mine. The SLA provides the right to operate the Pueblo Viejo mine for a 25-year period commencing on February 26, 2008, with one extension by right for 25 years and a second 25-year extension by mutual agreement of the parties, allowing a possible total term of 75 years. Pueblo Viejo pays the Dominican Republic government a net smelter return royalty of 3.2 based on gross revenues for gold and silver, a net profits interest of 28.75 based on an adjusted taxable cash flow, a corporate income tax of 25 based on adjusted net income, a withholding tax on interest paid on loans and on payments abroad, and other general tax obligations which include a graduated minimum tax. 
 The Pueblo Viejo deposits are located in two major areas, the Monte Negro pit and the Moore pit, and consists of high sulfidation or acid sulfate epithermal gold, silver, copper and zinc mineralization. Process facilities include a conventional mill which consists of a crushing and grinding circuit, autoclaves, and a carbon-in-leach circuit. Pueblo Viejo is continuing to advance a plant expansion and tailings storage facility designed to extend its life to 2040 and beyond. In 2013, Pueblo Viejo commissioned a combined cycle reciprocating engine power plant, together with a transmission line connecting the plant to the mine site. The power plant is located near the port city of San Pedro de Macoris and will provide the long-term power supply for the Pueblo Viejo mine. In 2019, Pueblo Viejo signed a 10-year natural gas supply contract with AES Andres DR, S.A. AES in the Dominican Republic who also completed a new gas pipeline to the facility. 
 The available mining fleet consists of three shovels, five front loaders, 46 haul trucks, and seven drills. 
 The Company's attributable portion of Pueblo Viejo s gross property, plant and mine development is 1,687 at December 31, 2022. We report our 40 interest in Pueblo Viejo on an equity method basis under U.S. GAAP and as a result our attributable portion of Pueblo Viejo's gross property, plant and mine development is included in the carrying value of our equity method investment at December 31, 2022. 
 Pueblo Viejo produced 285,000 attributable ounces of gold in 2022. As of December 31, 2022 and 2021, the Company's attributable portion of gold reserve reported by Pueblo Viejo is 8.2 million and 3.6 million ounces of attributable gold reserves, respectively. The increase in reserves is primarily due the completion of the pre-feasibility study for the Tailings Storage Facility which resulted in the conversion of resources to reserves. As of December 31, 2022 and 2021, Pueblo Viejo reported 2.1 million and 7.3 million attributable ounces of gold resources, respectively. The decrease to resources is primarily due to the conversion of resources to reserves.

Australia 
 The Australia region maintains its headquarters in Perth, Australia and operates two sites, Boddington and Tanami. 
 Aboriginal land rights in Australia, which recognize the traditional rights and customs of Aboriginal people, are governed by the Commonwealth Native Title Act and certain other Acts specific to individual states and territories. The Commonwealth Native Title Act was enacted in 1993 following a decision in the High Court of Australia, which held that Aboriginal people, who have maintained a continuing connection with their land according to their traditional laws and customs, may hold certain rights which should be recognized under Australian common law. In the Northern Territory, where the Tanami operation is located, the Aboriginal Land Rights Act ALRA was introduced in 1976, which established an Aboriginal Land rights regime. Under the ALRA, approximately 50 of the land in the Northern Territory is Aboriginal freehold land. 
 All of Newmont s operations in Australia take place on land that falls under the custodianship of Aboriginal people. Newmont does not consider that native title claims or determined areas where rights have been established are an impediment to the operation of existing mines. Newmont has existing agreements with the traditional owners of the land utilized by our Tanami and Boddington operations. Any future agreements would depend on a determination of native title, which is likely to take many years. If successful, a native title determination could give rights to compensation claims in the future. Throughout Australia, new exploratory and mining tenements may require native title agreements to be entered into and will be subject to a negotiation process, which often gives rise to compensation payments and heritage survey protocols. 
 In Australia, various ad valorem royalties and taxes are paid to state and territorial governments, typically based on a percentage of gross revenues or earnings. Aboriginal groups have negotiated compensation/royalty payments as a condition to granting access to areas where native title rights are determined or where they own the land. 
 Boddington, Australia. (100 owned) Boddington is located 81 miles (130 kilometers) southeast of Perth in Western Australia and is accessible primarily by paved road. Boddington has been wholly owned since June 2009 when Newmont acquired the final 33.33 interest from AngloGold Ashanti Australia Limited. 
 
 The Boddington project area comprises 52,506 acres (21,249 hectares) of mining tenure leased from the State of Western Australia, of which 26,910 acres (10,890 hectares) is subleased from the South 32 Worsley Joint Venturers ("Worsley JV"). The total project area is comprised of multiple leases that expire between 2023 and 2041. Royalties are paid to the state government at 2.5 for gold and 5 for copper based on revenue. Shipping and treatment and refining costs are allowable deductions from revenue for royalty calculations for copper. Newmont owns 74,474 acres (30,139 hectares) of rural freehold property, some of which overlaps existing mining tenure. The majority of its current operational area is located on its freehold property. 

The subleases from the Worsley JV expire immediately prior to the expiry of the relevant mining leases. Newmont holds rights to renew the subleases. The mining leases are renewable upon application to the State of Western Australia by the Worsley JV. As these mining leases are in their third term, renewal of these mining leases is at the discretion of the State. The subleases do not confer an express right to require the Worsley JV to seek application to renew the mining leases. Newmont is entitled to all gold and other non-bauxite mineralization conferred by the mining leases. The Worsley JV retains the rights to bauxite mineralization. The relationship between the Worsley JV bauxite operations and the Boddington gold operations are regulated through a cross-operation agreement. This agreement confers priority on the bauxite operations such that the bauxite/alumina mining operations of the Worsley JV will take priority over the gold mining operations and Newmont is required to take reasonable measures to conserve bauxite including by mining and stockpiling bauxite on behalf of the Worsley JV. 
 Boddington consists of greenstone diorite hosted mineralization and exploration activities continue to develop the known reserve. The mine operates two pits (North and South Pits), utilizing two electric rope shovels, a diesel powered face shovel and an electric hydraulic shovel as its prime ex-pit material movers with a fleet of 36 production autonomous haulage trucks. Boddington has a current capacity to mine approximately 150,000 to 200,000 tonnes of material per day. The milling plant includes a three-stage crushing facility (two primary crushers, six secondary crushers and four high-pressure grinding rolls), four ball mills, a flotation circuit and a carbon-in-leach circuit. The flotation circuit process recovers gold-copper concentrate before the material is then processed by a traditional carbon-in-leach circuit where the remaining gold is recovered to produce dor . Mining operations consist of two open pit operations located adjacent to each other. 
 Power for the operation is sourced through the local power grid under a long-term power purchase agreement with Bluewaters Power. The power supply contract with Bluewaters commenced in 2006 with a term of 17 years and includes an option to extend.

Boddington s gross property, plant and mine development at December 31, 2022 was 4,612. 
 Boddington produced 798,000 ounces of gold and 227,000 gold equivalent ounces of other metals in 2022. As of December 31, 2022 and 2021, Boddington reported 10.6 million and 11.6 million ounces of gold reserves, respectively, and 1,160 million and 1,290 million pounds of copper reserves. respectively. The overall reduction in gold reserves is primarily due to depletion. 
 As of December 31, 2022 and 2021, Boddington reported 4.6 million and 4.8 million ounces of gold resources, respectively, and 660 million and 680 million pounds of copper resources, respectively. The gold resources remained consistent. 
 Brownfield exploration and development for new reserves is ongoing. 
 Tanami, Australia. (100 owned) Tanami is located in the Northern Territory approximately 342 miles (550 kilometers) northwest of Alice Springs. The underground mining infrastructure and operation is located at Dead Bullock Soak DBS ). The processing infrastructure is located 25 miles (40 kilometers) to the east of the mining operations at the Granites. Ore is transported by road train from DBS underground to the processing facility at the Granites. 
 The Newmont Tanami Operations are comprised of exploration licenses encompassing a total area of 1,620,332 acres (655,725 hectares) including 677,736 acres (274,270 hectares) relating to the Tobruk and Monza Joint Ventures entered into with Prodigy Gold, for which Newmont is the operator, and 11,025 acres (4,462 hectares) of mineral leases granted pursuant to the Northern Territory Mineral Titles Act. Additionally, Newmont operates through agreements with the Central Land Council who represent the Warlpiri people. 
 Tanami consists of sediment hosted sheeted quartz vein mineralization. Tanami, as an underground mining operation, has a fleet of ten underground loaders and 22 haul trucks, each with 60 to 65-tonne payloads. Processing plant facilities currently consist of a crushing plant, a grinding circuit, gravity carbon in pulp tanks and a conventional tailings disposal facility. Tanami s gross property, plant and mine development at December 31, 2022 was 2,608. Tanami produced 484,000 ounces of gold in 2022 and reported 5.7 million ounces of gold reserves at December 31, 2022. 
 Brownfield exploration and development for new reserves is ongoing with the main focus being underground ore definition drilling of the Auron, Federation and Liberator ore bodies as well as exploration of the Oberon deposit. 
 
 Africa 
 The Africa region maintains its headquarters in Accra, Ghana and operates two sites, Ahafo and Akyem. 
 In December 2003, Ghana s Parliament unanimously ratified an Investment Agreement IA between Newmont and the government of Ghana. The IA established a fixed fiscal and legal regime, including fixed royalty and tax rates, for the life of any Newmont project in Ghana. In December 2015, Ghana s Parliament ratified the Revised Investment Agreements Ghana Investment Agreements or Revised IAs ). Currently, the maximum corporate income tax rate remains at 32.5 and royalties are paid on a sliding scale system that is based on average monthly gold prices. The rates range from 3 to 5 of revenues (plus an additional 0.6 for any production from forest reserve areas). The government of Ghana is also entitled to receive 10 of a project s net cash flow after reaching specific production milestones by receiving 1/9th of the total amount paid as dividends to Newmont parent. When the average quoted gold price exceeds 1,300 per ounce within a calendar year, an advance payment on these amounts of 0.6 of total revenues is required. The Ghana Investment Agreements also contain commitments with respect to job training for local Ghanaians, community development, purchasing of local goods and services and environmental protection. 
 The Ghana Investment Agreements also include a change in tax stabilization from life of mine to 15 years from commercial production for each mine. In October 2017, the government of Ghana approved Newmont s request to extend the stability period of the Revised IAs at the Ahafo operations for five years to December 31, 2025. The extension was approved based on Newmont s commitment to invest at least 300 for the Subika Underground and Ahafo Mill Expansion projects. This commitment was completed during the fourth quarter of 2018. 
 The Ahafo and Akyem mines operate using electrical power generated by the Volta River Authority along with supplemental power generation capacity built by Newmont.

Ahafo, Ghana. (100 owned) Our current Ahafo operation ("Ahafo South") is located near Kenyasi in the Ahafo Region of Ghana, approximately 180 miles (290 kilometers) northwest of the national capital city of Accra, and is largely accessible by paved roads. In 2002, Newmont acquired 50 of Ahafo South as a result of the merger with Normandy. In 2003, Newmont purchased the remaining interest from Moydow Mines International Inc. Moydow ), thereby making it a wholly owned subsidiary. The Ahafo South mine commenced commercial production in 2006 and currently operates a mill, two pits and an underground operation. In July 2021, the Board of Directors approved full funding for the Ahafo North project which will expand our existing footprint in Ghana with four open pit mines and a stand-alone mill located approximately 30 kilometers from our current Ahafo South operations. 

The Ahafo South operations are comprised of three mining leases issued under the Ghanaian Mining Act encompassing a total area of approximately 137,000 acres (55,000 hectares) with current mine take area of approximately 13,200 acres (5,300 hectares) that has been fully compensated and approximately 10,700 acres (4,300 hectares) of mining area that has not been fully compensated (e.g. payment would be necessary to move people from their land). The mining leases grant the exclusive rights to work, develop and produce gold in the lease area, including the processing, storing and transportation of mineral and materials. The mining leases require Ahafo South to respect or perform certain financial and statutory reporting obligations and expire in 2031 and are renewable subject to certain conditions. Ahafo South pays a royalty of 2 on net smelter returns to Franco-Nevada for all gold ounces recovered from areas previously owned by Moydow and a sliding scale royalty based on the average monthly gold price up to 5 on gold production to the government of Ghana. 
 The Ahafo South mine is composed of three orogenic gold deposits that have oxide and primary mineralization. Gold occurs primarily in pyrite and secondarily as native gold in quartz veins. Ahafo South has two active open pits, Subika and Awonsu. Subika added an underground operation, which reached commercial production in November 2018, and Awonsu completed a layback in November 2019. The available mining fleet for surface mining consists of three shovels and 36 haul trucks, each with 141-tonne payload. The available mining fleet for underground mining consists of eight underground loaders and 12 haul trucks, with payload ranging from 50 to 55-tonnes. The daily production rate is approximately 95,000 tonnes. The original processing plant was commissioned in 2006. The Ahafo Mill Expansion, which was completed in October 2019, expanded the plant capacity to process approximately 11 million tonnes per year. The current processing plant consists of two crushing plants, two grinding circuits, carbon-in-leach circuits, elution circuit, counter current decantation circuit, a tailings disposal facility and an analytical laboratory managed by a third party. 
 Brownfield exploration and development for new reserves is ongoing. 
 Ahafo South s gross property, plant and mine development at December 31, 2022 was 3,052. 
 Ahafo South produced 574,000 ounces of gold in 2022. As of December 31, 2022 and 2021, Ahafo South reported 5.7 million and 6.1 million ounces of gold reserves respectively. The overall reduction in gold reserves is primarily due to depletion. 
 As of December 31, 2022 and 2021, Ahafo South reported 5.2 million and 5.0 million ounces of gold resources respectively. The overall increase in gold resources is primarily due to exploration additions and positive net revisions partially offset by conversion to reserves. 
 Akyem, Ghana . (100 owned) Akyem, located in Birim North District of the Eastern Region of Ghana, approximately 80 miles (125 kilometers) northwest of the national capital city of Accra, is an open pit mining operation comprised of two mining leases issued under the Ghanaian Mining Act, encompassing an area of approximately 16,000 acres (6,000 hectares).

Nevada 
 NGM, Nevada, U.S. (38.5 owned) Nevada Gold Mines ("NGM") is located in Elko, Nevada. On July 1, 2019, Newmont and Barrick consummated the Nevada JV Agreement, which combined the Company s Nevada mining operations with Barrick s Nevada mining operations resulting in the establishment of NGM; a joint venture with Barrick who is the operator. NGM operations are primarily accessible by paved road and is comprised of 180,921 acres (73,217 hectares) in aggregate including Cortez 53,999 acres (21,853 hectares), Carlin 58,255 acres (23,575 hectares), Turquoise Ridge 26,679 acres (10,797 hectares), Phoenix 17,900 acres (7,244 hectares), and Long Canyon 24,088 acres (9,748 hectares). 

All sites at NGM contain open pit operations while Cortez, Carlin, and Turquoise Ridge also include underground operations. At Cortez, mineralization is sedimentary rock-hosted and consists of submicron to micrometer-sized gold particles and gold in solid solution in pyrite. Refractory ore is transported to Carlin for processing. Phoenix is a skarn-hosted polymetallic massive sulfide replacement deposit. The Phoenix mill produces a gravity gold concentrate and a copper/gold flotation concentrate and recovers additional gold from cyanide leaching of the flotation tails. Carlin, Turquoise Ridge, and Long Canyon are a sediment-hosted disseminated gold deposit. Additionally, at Long Canyon, oxide ore with suitable cyanide solubility is treated on a heap leach pad. Gold recovered from the leach pad is transferred as gold-bearing carbon to Carlin for refining and shipment. 
 In Nevada, mining taxes are assessed on up to 5 of net proceeds of a mine. During 2021, the Nevada legislature enacted a new excise tax which is assessed up to 1.1 of gross revenues. 
 NGM owns, or controls through leases, fee ownership, and unpatented mining claims, all of the minerals and surface area within the boundaries of the present Nevada mining operations. The long-term leases extend for at least the anticipated mine life of those deposits. With respect to a significant portion of the Gold Quarry mine at Carlin, NGM pays a net smelter royalty equivalent to 16.2 of the mineral production. NGM wholly-owns or controls the remainder of the Gold Quarry mineral rights, in some cases subject to additional royalties. With respect to certain smaller deposits in Nevada, NGM is obligated to pay royalties on production to third parties that vary from 1 to 8 of production. 
 Each site has its own process facilities which include: an oxide mill, which consists of a crushing and grinding circuit and carbon-in-leach circuit, and two heap leach pads at Cortez; an autoclave, two roasters, an oxide mill/flotation circuit and four heap leach pads at Carlin; the Sage autoclave, an oxide mill, and three heap leach pads at Turquoise Ridge; a flotation mill, a carbon-in-leach plant, a copper leach pad and a solvent extraction electrowinning SX/EW plant at Phoenix; and a heap leach pad at Long Canyon. NGM has a current capacity across all sites to mine approximately 340,000 tonnes of material per day. The milling facilities were commissioned over a range of years beginning in the 1990 s. They undergo routine maintenance each year with process improvements implemented as the projects are identified and approved. Power is either purchased in the open market or supplied by the power plants owned and operated by NGM. 
 The NGM operations include, in aggregate, an open pit mining fleet consisting of 28 shovels and 155 haul trucks with an average payload of 261 tonnes, and an underground mining fleet consisting of 51 underground loaders and 76 haul trucks, with an average payload of 30 tonnes. 
 Newmont s share of NGM s gross property, plant and mine development at December 31, 2022 was 8,081. 
 NGM produced 1,169,000 attributable ounces of gold in 2022. As of December 31, 2022 and 2021, the Company's attributable portion of gold reserve reported by NGM is 18.6 million and 19.3 million attributable ounces of gold reserves, respectively. The decrease in reserves is primarily due to mining depletion, which offset net positive revisions. As of December 31, 2022 and 2021, NGM reported 19.2 million and 16.2 million attributable ounces of gold resources, respectively. The increase to resources is primarily due to exploration additions and positive net revisions. 
 Brownfield exploration and development for new reserves is ongoing.

 Proven and Probable Reserves 
 All of our reserves are located on land (i) we own or control, or (ii) that is owned or controlled by business entities established with our joint venture partners, in which the Company owns its pro-rata share of the capital stock, membership units, or interests. The risks that could affect title to our property are included above in Item 1A, Risk Factors. 
 A mineral reserve is an estimate of tonnage and grade or quality of indicated and measured mineral resources that, in the opinion of the qualified person, can be the basis of an economically viable project. More specifically, it is the economically mineable part of a measured or indicated mineral resource, which includes diluting materials and allowances for losses that may occur when the material is mined or extracted. The term economically viable, as used in the definition of reserve, means that the qualified person has analytically determined that extraction of the mineral reserve is economically viable under reasonable investment and market assumptions. 
 The term proven reserves means the economically mineable part of a measured mineral resource and can only result from conversion of a measured mineral resource. The term probable reserves means reserves for which quantity and grade are computed from information similar to that used for proven reserves, but the sites for sampling are farther apart or are otherwise less closely spaced. The degree of assurance, although lower than that for proven reserves, is high enough to assume continuity between points of observation. Proven and probable reserves include gold, copper, silver, lead, zinc or molybdenum attributable to Newmont s ownership or economic interest. 
 Proven and probable reserves are based on extensive drilling, sampling, mine modeling and metallurgical testing from which we determined economic feasibility. The reference point for mineral reserves is the point of delivery to the process plant. Metal price assumptions, adjusted for our exchange rate assumption, are based on considering such factors as market forecasts, industry consensus and management estimates. The price sensitivity of reserves depends upon several factors including grade, metallurgical recovery, operating cost, waste-to-ore ratio and ore type. Metallurgical recovery rates vary depending on the metallurgical properties of each deposit and the production process used. The reserve tables below list the average metallurgical recovery rate for each deposit, which takes into account the relevant processing methods. The cut-off grade, or lowest grade of mineralization considered economic to process, varies between deposits depending upon prevailing economic conditions, mineability of the deposit, by-products, amenability of the ore to gold, copper, silver, lead, zinc or molybdenum extraction and type of milling or leaching facilities available. Reserve estimates may have non-material differences in comparison to our joint venture partners due to differences in classification and rounding methodology. 
 The proven and probable reserve figures presented herein are estimates based on information available at the time of calculation. No assurance can be given that the indicated levels of recovery of gold, copper, silver, lead, zinc and molybdenum will be realized. Ounces of gold or silver or pounds of copper, lead, zinc or molybdenum included in the proven and probable reserves are those contained prior to losses during metallurgical treatment. Reserve estimates may require revision based on actual production. Market fluctuations in the price of gold, copper, silver, lead, zinc and molybdenum, as well as increased production costs or reduced metallurgical recovery rates, could render certain proven and probable reserves containing higher cost reserves uneconomic to exploit and might result in a reduction of reserves. 
 We had attributable proven and probable gold reserves of 96.1 million ounces at December 31, 2022. In the fourth quarter of 2022, the Company raised the reserves gold pricing assumption from 1,200 in 2021 to 1,400. The increase in reserves gold pricing assumption is based on the Company s assessment of multiple factors, including historical gold pricing trends, consensus price forecasts, impacts of inflation and resulting high-interest rate environment, the ongoing impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic, and the Russian invasion of Ukraine. These volatile market conditions have created a high degree of uncertainty in the global markets, which 
 50

have historically positively impacted gold prices. We estimate our 2022 reserves would increase by 3 (3.3 million ounces), or decline by 7 (7.2 million ounces), if estimated at a 1,500 and 1,300 per ounce gold price, respectively, with all other assumptions remaining constant. 
 We publish reserves annually, and will recalculate reserves at December 31, 2023, taking into account metal prices, changes, if any, to future production and capital costs, divestments and depletion as well as any acquisitions and additions during 2023. 
 The Company has internal controls for reviewing and documenting the information supporting the mineral reserve and mineral resource estimates, describing the methods used, and ensuring the validity of the estimates. These internal control processes were not materially impacted by the adoption of S-K 1300 in 2021. Information that is utilized to compile mineral reserves and resources is prepared and certified by appropriately qualified persons at the mine site level and is subject to our internal review process which includes review by the Newmont-designated region and the Qualified Person QP based in our corporate office in Denver, Colorado. Additionally, all material sites are audited every other year and the non-material sites on a three-year cycle by subject matter experts for compliance to internal standards and guidelines as well as regulatory requirements. The QP presents the mineral reserve and mineral resource information to the Audit Committee and the Disclosure Committee on an annual basis for further review. 
 The following tables detail gold proven and probable reserves reflecting only those reserves attributable to Newmont s ownership or economic interest at December 31, 2022 and 2021:

 Measured, Indicated, and Inferred Resources 
 All of our resources are located on land (i) we own or control, or (ii) that is owned or controlled by business entities established with our joint venture partners, in which the Company owns its pro-rata share of the capital stock, membership units, or interests. The risks that could affect title to our property are included above in Item 1A, Risk Factors. 
 The measured, indicated, and inferred resource figures presented herein are estimates based on information available at the time of calculation and are exclusive of reserves. A mineral resource is a concentration or occurrence of solid material of economic interest in or on the Earth s crust in such form, grade, or quality and quantity that there are reasonable prospects for eventual economic extraction. The location, quantity, grade or quality, continuity and other geological characteristics of a mineral resource are known, estimated or interpreted from specific geological evidence and knowledge, including sampling. The reference point for mineral

resources is in situ. Mineral resources are sub-divided, in order of increasing geological confidence, into inferred, indicated and measured categories. Ounces of gold and silver or pounds of copper, zinc, lead, and molybdenum included in the measured, indicated and inferred resources are those contained prior to losses during metallurgical treatment. The terms "measured resource," "indicated resource," and "inferred resource" mean that part of a mineral resource for which quantity and grade or quality are estimated on the basis of geological evidence and sampling that is considered to be comprehensive, adequate, or limited, respectively. 
 Market fluctuations in the price of gold, silver, copper, zinc, lead and molybdenum, as well as increased production costs or reduced metallurgical recovery rates, could change future estimates of resources. Metal price assumptions are based on approximately a fifteen to twenty-five percent premium over reserve prices. 
 Our exploration efforts are directed to the discovery of new resources and converting it into proven and probable reserves. We conduct brownfield exploration around our existing mines and greenfield exploration in other regions globally. Brownfield exploration can result in the discovery of additional deposits, which may receive the economic benefit of existing operating, processing and administrative infrastructures. In contrast, the discovery of mineralization through greenfield exploration efforts will require capital investment to build a stand-alone operation. Our Exploration expense was 231, 209 and 187 in 2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively. 
 We had attributable measured and indicated gold resources of 75.3 million ounces and attributable inferred gold resources of 36.1 million ounces at December 31, 2022. For 2022 and 2021, attributable measured, indicated, and inferred gold resources were estimated at a gold price assumption of 1,600 and 1,400 per ounce, respectively. The increase in the resource gold pricing assumption in 2022 from 2021 is based on the Company s assessment of multiple factors, including historical gold pricing trends, consensus price forecasts, impacts of inflation and resulting high-interest rate environment, the ongoing impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic, and the Russian invasion of Ukraine. These volatile market conditions have created a high degree of uncertainty in the global markets, which have historically positively impacted gold prices. 
 The resource figures presented herein do not include that part of our resources that have been converted to Proven and Probable Reserves as shown above, as they are reported exclusive of reserves, and have been estimated based on information available at the time of calculation. 
 The Company has internal controls for reviewing and documenting the information supporting the mineral reserve and mineral resource estimates, describing the methods used, and ensuring the validity of the estimates. Refer to Proven and Probable Reserves above for further information on these internal controls. 
 We publish measured, indicated, and inferred resources annually, and will recalculate them at December 31, 2023, taking into account metal prices, changes, if any, in future production and capital costs, divestments and conversion to reserves, as well as any acquisitions and additions during 2023. 
 The following tables detail measured, indicated, and inferred resources reflecting only those that are attributable to Newmont s ownership or economic interest at December 31, 2022 and 2021.

ITEM 3. LEGAL PROCEEDINGS 
 Information regarding legal proceedings is contained in Note 25 to the Consolidated Financial Statements contained in this Report and is incorporated herein by reference. The Company has elected to apply a threshold of 1 million pursuant to Item 103(c)(3)(iii) of Regulation S-K in connection with environmental proceedings to which a governmental authority is a party. 
 
 ITEM 4. MINE SAFETY DISCLOSURES 
 At Newmont, safety is a core value, and we strive for superior performance. Our health and safety management system, which includes detailed standards and procedures for safe production, addresses topics such as employee training, risk management, workplace inspection, emergency response, accident investigation and program auditing. In addition to strong leadership and involvement from all levels of the organization, these programs and procedures form the cornerstone of safety at Newmont, ensuring that employees are provided a safe and healthy environment and are intended to reduce workplace accidents, incidents and losses, comply with all mining-related regulations and provide support for both regulators and the industry to improve mine safety. 
 In addition, we have established our Rapid Response crisis management process to mitigate and prevent the escalation of adverse consequences if existing risk management controls fail, particularly if an incident may have the potential to seriously impact the safety of employees, the community or the environment. This process provides appropriate support to an affected site to complement their technical response to an incident, so as to reduce the impact by considering the environmental, strategic, legal, financial and public image aspects of the incident, to ensure communications are being carried out in accordance with legal and ethical requirements and to identify actions in addition to those addressing the immediate hazards. 
 The health and safety of our people and our host communities is paramount. This is why Newmont engaged its Rapid Response process early in connection with the on-going COVID-19 pandemic and continues to sustain robust controls at our operations and offices globally. For steps taken by the Company, refer to "COVID-19 Pandemic" in Item 1, Business. 
 The operation of our U.S. based mine is subject to regulation by the Federal Mine Safety and Health Administration MSHA under the Federal Mine Safety and Health Act of 1977 (the Mine Act ). MSHA inspects our mine on a regular basis and issues various citations and orders when it believes a violation has occurred under the Mine Act. Following passage of The Mine Improvement and New Emergency Response Act of 2006, MSHA significantly increased the numbers of citations and orders charged against mining operations. The dollar penalties assessed for citations issued has also increased in recent years. 
 Newmont is required to report certain mine safety violations or other regulatory matters required by Section 1503(a) of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act and Item 104 of Regulation S-K, and that required information is included in Exhibit 95 and is incorporated by reference into this Annual Report. It is noted that the Nevada mines owned by NGM, in which the Company holds a 38.5 interest, are not included in the Company s Exhibit 95 mine safety disclosure reporting as such sites are operated by our joint venture partner, Barrick.

 The following Management s Discussion and Analysis of Consolidated Financial Condition and Results of Operations MD A provides information that management believes is relevant to an assessment and understanding of the consolidated financial condition and results of operations of Newmont Corporation, a Delaware corporation, and its subsidiaries (collectively, Newmont, the Company, our and we ). We use certain non-GAAP financial measures in our MD A. For a detailed description of each of the non-GAAP measures used in this MD A, please refer to the discussion under Non-GAAP Financial Measures. This item should be read in conjunction with our Consolidated Financial Statements and the notes thereto included in this annual report. 
 The following MD A generally discusses our consolidated financial condition and results of operations for 2022 and 2021 and year-to-year comparisons between 2022 and 2021. Discussions of our consolidated financial condition and results of operations for 2020 and year-to-year comparisons between 2021 and 2020 are included in Item 7, Management s Discussion and Analysis of Consolidated Financial Condition and Results of Operations, in the Company s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2021, filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission on February 24, 2022. 
 
 Overview 
 Newmont is the world s leading gold company and is the only gold company included in the S P 500 Index and the Fortune 500 list of companies. We have been included in the Dow Jones Sustainability Index-World since 2007 and have adopted the World Gold Council s Conflict-Free Gold Policy. Since 2015, Newmont has been ranked as the mining and metal sector s top gold miner by the S P Global Corporate Sustainability Assessment. Newmont has been ranked the top miner in 3BL Media s 100 Best Corporate Citizens list which ranks the 1,000 largest publicly traded U.S. companies on ESG transparency and performance since 2020. We are primarily engaged in the exploration for and acquisition of gold properties, some of which may contain copper, silver, lead, zinc or other metals. We have significant operations and/or assets in the U.S., Canada, Mexico, Dominican Republic, Peru, Suriname, Argentina, Chile, Australia and Ghana. Our goal is to create value and improve lives through sustainable and responsible mining. 
 Refer to the Consolidated Financial Results, Results of Consolidated Operations, Liquidity and Capital Resources and Non-GAAP Financial Measures for information about the continued impacts from the COVID-19 pandemic, the Russian invasion of Ukraine, and the resulting significant inflation experienced globally, as well as the effects of certain counter measures taken by central banks, on the Company. Also refer to discussion of Risk and Uncertainties within Note 2 of the Consolidated Financial Statements, relating to inflationary pressures and supply chain disruptions, with particular consideration on the outlook for increased costs specific to labor, materials, consumables and fuel and energy on operations, as well as impacts on the timing and cost of capital expenditures and the risk of potential impairment to certain assets. 
 In the third quarter of 2022, as a result of these challenging market conditions, record inflation rates, the rising prices for commodities and raw materials, prolonged supply chain disruptions, competitive labor markets and consideration of capital allocation, the Company announced the delay of the full-funds investment decision for the Yanacocha Sulfides project in Peru. With the delay of the Yanacocha Sulfides project, management will focus its efforts on optimizing its allocation of funds to current operations and other capital commitments, while also assessing execution options and project plans options, up to and including transitioning Yanacocha operations into full closure. Refer to Note 2 of the Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion 
 In the first quarter of 2022, the Company completed the acquisition of Buenaventura's 43.65 noncontrolling interest in Minera Yanacocha S.R.L. ("Yanacocha") (the "Yanacocha Transaction") and sold its 46.94 ownership interest in Minera La Zanja S.R.L. ("La Zanja"). The Company acquired the remaining 5 interest previously held by Sumitomo in the second quarter of 2022. At December 31, 2022, the Company holds 100 ownership interest in Yanacocha. Refer to Note 1 of the Consolidated Financial Statements for further details regarding these transactions.

 The decrease in Net income (loss) from continuing operations attributable to Newmont stockholders during the year ended December 31, 2022, compared to the same period in 2021, is primarily due to higher Impairment charges resulting from impairment of goodwill at Cerro Negro and Porcupine and impairment of long-lived assets at CC V, higher Costs applicable to sales predominately resulting from cost inflation impacts and 70 related to the profit-sharing agreement entered into by the Company in 2022 at Pe asquito (the "Pe asquito Profit-Sharing Agreement") related to 2021 site performance, and lower sales volumes for all metals except copper, partially offset by lower Reclamation and remediation, lower income tax expense, and the Loss on assets held for sale in 2021 related to the Conga mill assets.

 The increase in Costs applicable to sales during the year ended December 31, 2022, compared to the same period in 2021, is primarily due to (i) impacts from cost inflation due to higher input commodity prices, notably fuel and energy costs, and increased labor costs (ii) higher inventory adjustments primarily at NGM, Yanacocha, CC V, and Akyem (iii) the Pe asquito Profit-Sharing Agreement and (iv) lower by-product credits, partially offset by lower sales volumes.

 The decrease in Depreciation and amortization during the year ended December 31, 2022, compared to the same period in 2021, is primarily due to the ramp down of mining at NGM for Long Canyon and lower production volumes at Pe asquito and l onore as a result of lower ore grade mined and at NGM as a result of lower leach pad production and ore grade mined, partially offset by higher production at Ahafo, Akyem, and Boddington as a result of higher ore grade milled. 
 For discussion regarding other significant drivers impacting Depreciation and amortization by site, refer to Results of Consolidated Operations below. 
 
 Exploration expense was 231, 209 and 187 in 2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively. Exploration expense increased in 2022, compared to 2021, primarily due to an increase in drilling projects in the current year, particularly at South America, NGM and Africa, as a result of projects being delayed from prior years due to COVID-19 and higher drilling costs due to cost inflation. 
 Advanced projects, research and development expense was 229, 154 and 122 in 2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively. Advanced projects, research and development expense increased in 2022 compared to 2021, primarily due to payments made as part of the strategic alliance with Caterpillar Inc. ("CAT") relating to the Company's climate change initiatives and project spend relating to certain development projects at Cerro Negro in South America and Galore Creek in Corporate and Other. Advanced projects, research and development expense includes development project management costs, feasibility studies and other project expenses that do not qualify for capitalization.

General and administrative expense was 276, 259 and 269 in 2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively. General and administrative expense increased in 2022, compared to 2021, primarily due to increased labor costs. General and administrative expense as a percentage of Sales was 2.3 , 2.1 and 2.3 for 2022, 2021 and 2020 respectively. 
 
 Interest expense, net was 227, 274 and 308 in 2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively. Capitalized interest totaled 69, 38, and 24 in each year, respectively. Interest expense, net decreased in 2022, compared to 2021, as a result of the repayment of debt in 2021 and 2022 and higher capitalization of interest. 
 
 Income and mining tax expense (benefit) was 455, 1,098, and 704 in 2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively. The effective tax rate is driven by a number of factors and the comparability of our income tax expense for the reported periods will be primarily affected by (i) variations in our income before income taxes; (ii) geographic distribution of that income; (iii) impacts of the changes in tax law; (iv) valuation allowances on tax assets; (v) percentage depletion; (vi) fluctuation in the value of the United States dollar and foreign currencies; and (vii) the impact of specific transactions and assessments including a significant impairment of goodwill during 2022. As a result, the effective tax rate will fluctuate, sometimes significantly, year to year. This trend is expected to continue in future periods. Refer to Note 10 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion of income taxes.

 Recently Enacted Legislation. 
 In August 2022, the U.S. government enacted the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 (the "IRA") into law. The IRA introduced an excise tax on stock repurchases of 1 and a corporate alternative minimum tax (the "Corporate AMT") of 15 on the adjusted financial statement income ("AFSI") of corporations with average AFSI exceeding 1 billion over a three-year period. The IRA is effective for fiscal periods beginning 2023. While waiting on pending Department of Treasury regulatory guidance, we are continuing to monitor developments.

 Foreign Currency Exchange Rates 
 Our foreign operations sell their gold, copper, silver, lead and zinc production based on USD metal prices. Therefore, fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates do not have a material impact on our revenue. Despite selling gold and silver in London, we have no exposure to the euro or the British pound.

Foreign currency exchange rates can increase or decrease profits to the extent costs are paid in foreign currencies, including the Australian dollar, the Mexican peso, the Canadian dollar, the Argentine peso, the Peruvian sol, the Surinamese dollar and the Ghanaian cedi. In 2022, approximately 49 of Costs applicable to sales were paid in currencies other than the U.S. dollar as follows: 
 Year Ended December 31, 2022 Australian Dollar 16 Mexican Peso 13 Canadian Dollar 12 Argentine Peso 4 Peruvian Sol 3 Surinamese Dollar 1 Ghanaian Cedi 
 Variations in the local currency exchange rates in relation to the U.S. dollar at our foreign mining operations decreased Costs applicable to sales by 34 per ounce in 2022, compared to 2021, primarily in Argentina, Australia, and Canada. 
 Our Cerro Negro mine, located in Argentina, is a USD functional currency entity. Argentina has a hyperinflationary economy with a cumulative inflation rate of over 216 for the last three years. In recent years, Argentina s central bank enacted a number of foreign currency controls in an effort to stabilize the local currency, including requiring the Company to convert USD proceeds from metal sales to local currency within 60 days from shipment date or five business days from receipt of cash, whichever happens first, as well as restricting payments to foreign-related entities denominated in foreign currency, such as dividends or distributions to the parent and related companies and royalties and other payments to foreign beneficiaries. These restrictions directly impact Cerro Negro's ability to pay principal portions of intercompany debt to the Company. We continue to monitor the foreign currency exposure risk and the limitations of repatriating cash to the U.S. Currently, these currency controls are not expected to have a material impact on our financial statements. 
 Our Merian mine, located in the country of Suriname, is a USD functional currency entity. Suriname has experienced significant inflation over the last three years and has a highly inflationary economy. In 2021, the Central Bank took steps to stabilize the local currency, while the government introduced new legislation to narrow the gap between government revenues and spending. The measures to increase government revenue mainly consist of tax increases; however, Newmont and the Republic of Suriname have a Mineral Agreement in place that supersedes such measures. The Central Bank of Suriname adopted a controlled floating rate system, which resulted in a concurrent devaluation of the Surinamese dollar. The majority of Merian s activity has historically been denominated in USD; as a result, the devaluation of the Surinamese dollar has resulted in an immaterial impact on our financial statements. Therefore, future devaluation of the Surinamese dollar is not expected to have a material impact on our financial statements. 
 
 Liquidity and Capital Resources 
 Liquidity Overview 
 We have a disciplined cash allocation strategy of maintaining financial flexibility to execute our capital priorities and generate long-term value for our shareholders. Consistent with that strategy, we aim to self-fund development projects and make strategic partnerships focused on profitable growth, while reducing our debt and returning cash to stockholders through dividends and share repurchases. 
 The continued impacts from the COVID-19 pandemic, the Russian invasion of Ukraine, and the resulting significant inflation experienced globally, as well as the effects of certain countermeasures taken by central banks, have been and are expected to continue to adversely affect the Company. Depending on the duration and extent of the impact of these events, commodity prices and the prices for gold and other metals could continue to experience volatility; transportation industry disruptions could continue, including limitations on shipping produced metals; our supply chain could continue to experience disruption; cost inflation rates could further increase; or we could incur credit related losses of certain financial assets, which could materially impact the Company s results of operations, cash flows and financial condition. As of December 31, 2022, we believe our available liquidity allows us to manage the short- and, possibly, long-term material adverse impacts of these events on our business. Refer to Note 2 of the Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion on risks and uncertainties. 
 At December 31, 2022, the Company had 2,877 in Cash and cash equivalents. The majority of our cash and cash equivalents are invested in a variety of highly liquid investments with original maturities of three months or less. During the third quarter of 2022, the Company began investing in time deposits with a maturity of more than three months but less than one year, and at December 31, 2022 the Company had 829 of these time deposits, which are included in Time deposits and other investments . Our Cash and cash equivalents and time deposits are highly liquid and low-risk investments that are able to fund our operations as necessary. We may have investments in prime money market funds that are classified as cash and cash equivalents; however, we continually monitor the need for reclassification under the SEC requirements for money market funds, and the potential that the shares of such funds could 
 84 

Table of Contents 

have a net asset value less than their par value. We believe that our liquidity and capital resources are adequate to fund our operations and corporate activities. 
 At December 31, 2022, 907 of Cash and cash equivalents was held in foreign subsidiaries and is primarily held in U.S. dollar denominated accounts with the remainder in foreign currencies readily convertible to USD. Cash and cash equivalents denominated in Argentine Peso are subject to regulatory restrictions. Refer to Foreign Currency Exchange Rates above for further information. At December 31, 2022, 658 in consolidated cash and cash equivalents was held at certain foreign subsidiaries that, if repatriated, may be subject to withholding taxes. We expect that there would be no additional tax burden upon repatriation after considering the cash cost associated with any potential withholding taxes. 
 We believe our existing consolidated Cash and cash equivalents , time deposits, available capacity on our revolving credit facility, and cash generated from continuing operations will be adequate to satisfy working capital needs, fund future growth, meet debt obligations and meet other liquidity requirements for the foreseeable future. At December 31, 2022, our borrowing capacity on our revolving credit facility was 3,000, and we had no borrowings outstanding under the revolving credit facility. We continue to remain compliant with covenants and do not currently anticipate any events or circumstances that would impact our ability to access funds available on this facility. Refer to Note 20 of the Consolidated Financial Statements for further information on our Debt .

 (2) Net debt is a non-GAAP financial measure used by management to evaluate financial flexibility and strength of the Company's balance sheet. Refer to Non-GAAP Financial Measures below. 
 
 Cash Flows 
 Net cash provided by (used in) operating activities of continuing operations was 3,198 in 2022, a decrease in cash provided of 1,068 from the year ended December 31, 2021, primarily due to an increase in operating cash expenditures resulting from the impacts of cost inflation due to higher input commodity prices, notably fuel and energy costs, and increased labor costs; lower sales volumes, and payments related to: (i) increased reclamation and remediation obligations, (ii) the Pe asquito Profit-Sharing Agreement, (iii) previously accrued employee severance resulting from a recent employment model change in Ghana, and (iv) our strategic alliance with CAT. 
 Net cash provided by (used in) investing activities of continuing operations was (2,983) in 2022, an increase in cash used of 1,115 from the year ended December 31, 2021, primarily due to an increase in the purchase of time deposits and higher capital expenditures in 2022, partially offset by the acquisition of GT Gold in 2021. 
 Net cash provided by (used in) financing activities was (2,356) in 2022, a decrease in cash used of 602 from the year ended December 31, 2021, primarily due to higher stock repurchases in 2021 and higher net repayments of debt in 2021, partially offset by the acquisition of non-controlling interest in Yanacocha in 2022. 
 
 Capital Resources 
 In February 2023, the Board declared a dividend of 0.40 per share, determined under the dividend framework. This framework is non-binding and is periodically reviewed and reassessed by the Board of Directors. The declaration and payment of future dividends remains at the full discretion of the Board and will depend on the Company s financial results, cash requirements, future prospects and other factors deemed relevant by the Board. 
 The Company's stock repurchase program for up to 1 billion of common stock expired on December 31, 2022. We repurchased 525 under the plan, all of which was completed in 2021. 
 
 Capital Expenditures 
 Cash generated from operations is used to execute our capital priorities, which include sustaining and developing our global portfolio of long-lived assets. Our near-term development capital projects include Tanami Expansion 2 and Ahafo North, which are being funded from existing liquidity and will continue to be funded from future operating cash flows. Capital costs are estimated to be 
 85 

Table of Contents 

between 1,200 and 1,300 for Tanami Expansion 2 and between 950 and 1,050 for Ahafo North, with the first full year of commercial production expected to be 2026 for both projects. 
 We consider sustaining capital as those capital expenditures that are necessary to maintain current production and execute the current mine plan. Capital expenditures to develop new operations or related to projects at existing operations, where these projects will enhance production or reserves, are considered non-sustaining or development capital. The Company s decision to reprioritize, sell or abandon a development project, which may include returning mining concessions to host governments, could result in a future impairment charge. 
 The Company continues to evaluate strategic priorities and deployment of capital to projects in the pipeline to ensure we execute on our capital priorities and provide long-term value to shareholders. Included in the Company's continuous evaluation is consideration of current market opportunities or pressures. In response to the current challenging market conditions, which include inflationary pressures and supply chain disruptions, in the third quarter of 2022 the Company announced the delay of the full-funds investment decision for the Yanacocha Sulfides project in Peru. Refer to Note 2 of the Consolidated Financial Statements for further information. 
 In 2020, we announced climate targets to reduce GHG emissions and plans to invest in climate change initiatives in support of this goal, which may be capital in nature. As part of these initiatives, in November 2021, Newmont announced a strategic alliance with CAT with the aim to develop and implement a comprehensive all-electric autonomous mining system to achieve zero emissions mining. To support this alliance, Newmont pledged a preliminary investment of 100, of which 39 has been paid as of December 31, 2022 and is recognized in Advanced projects, research and development within our Consolidated Statements of Operations, to CAT in connection with automation and electrification goals for surface and underground mining infrastructures and haulage fleets. The remaining pledged amount is anticipated to be paid as certain milestones are reached through 2025. 
 Other investments supporting our climate change initiatives are expected to include emissions reduction projects and renewable energy opportunities as we seek to achieve these climate targets. For risks related to climate-related capital expenditures, refer to Part I, Item 1A Risk Factors.

Supplemental Guarantor Information 
 The Company filed a shelf registration statement with the SEC on Form S-3 under the Securities Act, of 1933, as amended, which enables us to issue an indeterminate number or amount of common stock, preferred stock, depository shares, debt securities, guarantees of debt securities, warrants and units (the Shelf Registration Statement ). Under the Shelf Registration Statement, our debt securities may be guaranteed by Newmont USA Limited Newmont USA ), one of our consolidated subsidiaries (Newmont, as issuer, and Newmont USA, as guarantor, are collectively referred to here-within as the "Obligor Group"). These guarantees are full and unconditional, and none of our other subsidiaries guarantee any security issued and outstanding. The cash provided by operations of the Obligor Group, and all of its subsidiaries, is available to satisfy debt repayments as they become due, and there are no material restrictions on the ability of the Obligor Group to obtain funds from subsidiaries by dividend, loan, or otherwise, except to the extent of any rights noncontrolling interests, foreign currency or regulatory restrictions limiting repatriation of cash. Net assets attributable to noncontrolling interests were 179 at December 31, 2022. All noncontrolling interests relate to non-guarantor subsidiaries. 
 Newmont and Newmont USA are primarily holding companies with no material operations, sources of income or assets other than equity interest in their subsidiaries and intercompany receivables or payables. Newmont USA s primary investments are comprised of its 38.5 interest in NGM. For further information regarding these and our other operations, refer to Note 3 of the Consolidated Financial Statements and Results of Consolidated Operations, above. 
 In addition to equity interests in subsidiaries, the Obligor Group s balance sheets consisted primarily of the following intercompany assets, intercompany liabilities and external debt. The remaining assets and liabilities of the Obligor Group are considered immaterial at December 31, 2022. 
 December 31, 2022 Obligor Group Newmont USA Current intercompany assets 13,982 5,815 Non-current intercompany assets 520 506 Current intercompany liabilities 13,118 1,907 Current external debt Non-current external debt 5,564 
 Newmont USA's subsidiary guarantees (the subsidiary guarantees are general unsecured senior obligations of Newmont USA and rank equal in right of payment to all of Newmont USA's existing and future senior unsecured indebtedness and senior in right of payment to all of Newmont USA's future subordinated indebtedness. The subsidiary guarantees are effectively junior to any secured indebtedness of Newmont USA to the extent of the value of the assets securing such indebtedness. 
 At December 31, 2022, Newmont USA had approximately 5,564 of consolidated indebtedness (including guaranteed debt), all of which relates to the guarantees of indebtedness of Newmont. 
 Under the terms of the subsidiary guarantees, holders of Newmont s securities subject to such subsidiary guarantees will not be required to exercise their remedies against Newmont before they proceed directly against Newmont USA. 
 Newmont USA will be released and relieved from all its obligations under the subsidiary guarantees in certain specified circumstances, including, but not limited to, the following: 
 upon the sale or other disposition (including by way of consolidation or merger), in one transaction or a series of related transactions, of a majority of the total voting power of the capital stock or other interests of Newmont USA (other than to Newmont or any of Newmont s affiliates); 
 upon the sale or disposition of all or substantially all the assets of Newmont USA (other than to Newmont or any of Newmont s affiliates); or 
 upon such time as Newmont USA ceases to guarantee more than 75 aggregate principal amount of Newmont s debt (at December 31, 2022, Newmont USA guaranteed 600 aggregate principal amount of debt of Newmont that did not contain a similar fall-away provision). 
 Newmont s debt securities are effectively junior to any secured indebtedness of Newmont to the extent of the value of the assets securing such indebtedness, and structurally subordinated to all debt and other liabilities of Newmont s non-guarantor subsidiaries. At December 31, 2022, (i) Newmont s total consolidated indebtedness was approximately 6,132, none of which was secured (other than 561 of Lease and other financing obligations), and (ii) Newmont s non-guarantor subsidiaries had 5,211 of total liabilities (including trade payables, but excluding intercompany, external debt and reclamation and remediation liabilities), which would have been structurally senior to Newmont s debt securities. 
 For further information on our debt, refer to Note 20 of the Consolidated Financial Statements.

 ____________________________ 
 (1) Debt includes principal of 5,624 and estimated interest payments of 3,351 on Senior Notes, assuming no early extinguishment. 
 (2) Finance lease and other financing obligations includes finance lease payments of 744 and additional payments of 5 for finance leases that have not yet commenced. 
 (3) Mining operations are subject to extensive environmental regulations in the jurisdictions in which they operate. Pursuant to environmental regulations, we are required to close our operations and reclaim and remediate the lands that operations have disturbed. The estimated undiscounted cash outflows of these Reclamation and remediation liabilities are reflected here. For more information regarding reclamation and remediation liabilities, refer to Note 5 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. 
 (4) Contractual obligations for Employee-related benefit s include severance, workers participation, pension and other benefit plans. Pension plan and other benefit payments beyond 2032 cannot be reasonably estimated given variable market conditions and actuarial assumptions and are not included. 
 (5) We are unable to reasonably estimate the timing of our uncertain income tax liabilities and interest payments due to uncertainties in the timing of the effective settlement of tax positions. 
 (6) Operating lease and other obligations includes operating lease payments of 133 and additional payments of 4 for operating leases that have not yet commenced. 
 (7) Minimum royalty payments are related to continuing operations and are presented net of recoverable amounts. 
 (8) Purchase obligations are not recorded in the Consolidated Financial Statements. Purchase obligations represent contractual obligations for purchase of power, materials and supplies, consumables, inventories and capital projects. 
 (9) Other includes service contracts and other obligations not recorded in our Consolidated Financial Statements, as well as the Norte Abierto and Galore Creek deferred payment obligations accrued in Other current liabilities and Other non-current liabilities . 
 
 Environmental 
 Our mining and exploration activities are subject to various federal and state laws and regulations governing the protection of the environment. We have made, and expect to make in the future, expenditures to comply with such laws and regulations, but cannot predict the full amount of such future expenditures. We perform a comprehensive review of our reclamation and remediation liabilities annually and review changes in facts and circumstances associated with these obligations at least quarterly. Notably, Newmont is committed to the implementation of GISTM and all tailing storage facilities are expected to be in conformance with the GISTM by 2025. Compliance with GISTM remains on-going and has and may continue to result in further increases to our estimated sustaining costs and closure costs for existing operations and non-operating sites. Additionally, laws, regulations and permit requirements focused on water management and discharge requirements for operations and water treatment in connection with closure are becoming increasingly stringent. Compliance with water management and discharge quality remains dynamic and has and may continue to result in further increases to our estimated closure costs. 
 At December 31, 2022 and 2021, 6,731 and 5,768, respectively, were accrued for reclamation costs relating to currently or recently producing or development stage mineral properties, of which 482 and 213, respectively, were classified as current liabilities. 
 In addition, we are involved in several matters concerning environmental obligations associated with former, primarily historic, mining activities. Based upon our best estimate of our liability for these matters, 373 and 344 were accrued for such obligations at December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively, of which 44 and 60, respectively, were classified as current liabilities. We spent 56, 43 and 25 during 2022, 2021, and 2020, respectively, for environmental obligations related to the former mining activities. 
 Reclamation and remediation adjustments during 2022 primarily related to (i) increased water management costs at portions of our Yanacocha and Porcupine site operations that are no longer in production and with no expected substantive future economic value (i.e., non-operating) (ii) increased costs due to closure plan design changes at our Porcupine site operations (iii) higher waste disposal costs and project execution delays at the Midnite mine and Dawn mill sites and (iv) higher estimated closure costs due to cost inflation. Reclamation and remediation adjustments during 2021 primarily related to (i) increased water treatment costs at non-

 operating portions of our Yanacocha site operation and (ii) higher estimated closure costs at various other non-operating sites arising from recent tailings management review and monitoring requirements set forth by GISTM. 
 During the year ended 2022, 2021, and 2020, capital expenditures were approximately 29, 13, and 23, respectively, to comply with environmental regulations. 
 Our sustainability strategy is a foundational element in achieving our purpose to create value and improve lives through sustainable and responsible mining. Sustainability and safety are integrated into the business at all levels of the organization through our global policies, standards, strategies, business plans and remuneration plans. For more information on the Company s reclamation and remediation liabilities, refer to Notes 5 and 25 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. For discussion of regulatory, tailings, water, climate and other environmental risks, refer to Part I, Item 1A. Risk Factors, for additional information. 
 
 Forward-Looking Statements 
 The foregoing discussion and analysis, as well as certain information contained elsewhere in this Annual Report, contain forward-looking statements within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, and are intended to be covered by the safe harbor created thereby. For a more detailed discussion of risks and other factors that might impact forward-looking statements and other important information about forward-looking statements, refer to the discussion in Forward-Looking Statements in Part I, Item 1, Business and Part I, Item 1A, Risk Factors. 
 
 Non-GAAP Financial Measures 
 Non-GAAP financial measures are intended to provide additional information only and do not have any standard meaning prescribed by GAAP. These measures should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for measures of performance prepared in accordance with GAAP. Unless otherwise noted, we present the Non-GAAP financial measures of our continuing operations in the tables below. For additional information regarding our discontinued operations, refer to Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. 
 
 Earnings before interest, taxes and depreciation and amortization and Adjusted earnings before interest, taxes and depreciation and amortization 
 Management uses earnings before interest, taxes and depreciation and amortization EBITDA and EBITDA adjusted for non-core or certain items that have a disproportionate impact on our results for a particular period Adjusted EBITDA as non-GAAP measures to evaluate the Company s operating performance. EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA do not represent, and should not be considered an alternative to, net income (loss), operating income (loss), or cash flow from operations as those terms are defined by GAAP, and do not necessarily indicate whether cash flows will be sufficient to fund cash needs. Although Adjusted EBITDA and similar measures are frequently used as measures of operations and the ability to meet debt service requirements by other companies, our calculation of Adjusted EBITDA is not necessarily comparable to such other similarly titled captions of other companies. The Company believes that Adjusted EBITDA provides useful information to investors and others in understanding and evaluating our operating results in the same manner as our management and Board of Directors. Management s determination of the components of Adjusted EBITDA are evaluated periodically and based, in part, on a review of non-GAAP financial measures used by mining industry analysts. Net income (loss) attributable to Newmont stockholders is reconciled to EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA as follows:

 Free Cash Flow 
 Management uses Free Cash Flow as a non-GAAP measure to analyze cash flows generated from operations. Free Cash Flow is Net cash provided by (used in) operating activities less Net cash provided by (used in) operating activities of discontinued operations less Additions to property, plant and mine development as presented on the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows. The Company believes Free Cash Flow is also useful as one of the bases for comparing the Company s performance with its competitors. Although Free Cash Flow and similar measures are frequently used as measures of cash flows generated from operations by other companies, the Company s calculation of Free Cash Flow is not necessarily comparable to such other similarly titled captions of other companies. 
 The presentation of non-GAAP Free Cash Flow is not meant to be considered in isolation or as an alternative to net income as an indicator of the Company s performance, or as an alternative to cash flows from operating activities as a measure of liquidity as those terms are defined by GAAP, and does not necessarily indicate whether cash flows will be sufficient to fund cash needs. The Company s definition of Free Cash Flow is limited in that it does not represent residual cash flows available for discretionary expenditures due to the fact that the measure does not deduct the payments required for debt service and other contractual obligations or payments made for business acquisitions. Therefore, the Company believes it is important to view Free Cash Flow as a measure that provides supplemental information to the Company s Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows. 
 The following table sets forth a reconciliation of Free Cash Flow, a non-GAAP financial measure, to Net cash provided by (used in) operating activities , which the Company believes to be the GAAP financial measure most directly comparable to Free Cash Flow, as well as information regarding Net cash provided by (used in) investing activities and Net cash provided by (used in) financing activities.

 Net Debt 
 Management uses Net Debt to measure the Company s liquidity and financial position. Net Debt is calculated as Debt and Lease and other financing obligations less Cash and cash equivalents and time deposits included in Time deposits and other investments , as presented on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. Cash and cash equivalents and time deposits are subtracted from Debt and Lease and other financing obligations as these are highly liquid, low-risk investments and could be used to reduce the Company's debt obligations. The Company believes the use of Net Debt allows investors and others to evaluate financial flexibility and strength of the Company's balance sheet. Net Debt is intended to provide additional information only and does not have any standardized meaning prescribed by GAAP and should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for measures of liquidity prepared in accordance with GAAP. Other companies may calculate this measure differently. 
 The following table sets forth a reconciliation of Net Debt, a non-GAAP financial measure, to Debt and Lease and other financing obligations , which the Company believes to be the GAAP financial measures most directly comparable to Net Debt.

 Costs applicable to sales per ounce/gold equivalent ounce 
 Costs applicable to sales per ounce/gold equivalent ounce are non-GAAP financial measures. These measures are calculated by dividing the costs applicable to sales of gold and other metals by gold ounces or gold equivalent ounces sold, respectively. These measures are calculated for the periods presented on a consolidated basis. We believe that these measures provide additional information to management, investors and others that aids in the understanding of the economics of our operations and performance compared to other producers and provides investors visibility into the direct and indirect costs related to production, excluding depreciation and amortization, on a per ounce/gold equivalent ounce basis. Costs applicable to sales per ounce/gold equivalent ounce statistics are intended to provide additional information only and do not have any standardized meaning prescribed by GAAP and should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for measures of performance prepared in accordance with GAAP. The measures are not necessarily indicative of operating profit or cash flow from operations as determined under GAAP. Other companies may calculate these measures differently. 
 The following tables reconcile these non-GAAP measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures.

 All-In Sustaining Costs 
 Current GAAP measures used in the mining industry, such as cost of goods sold, do not capture all of the expenditures incurred to discover, develop and sustain production. Therefore, Newmont calculates All-In Sustaining Costs AISC based on the definition published by the World Gold Council. The World Gold Council is a market development organization for the gold industry comprised of and funded by gold mining companies around the world and a regulatory organization. 
 AISC is a metric that expands on GAAP measures, such as cost of goods sold, and non-GAAP measures, such as costs applicable to sales per ounce, to provide visibility into the economics of our mining operations related to expenditures, operating performance and the ability to generate cash flow from our continuing operations. We believe that AISC is a non-GAAP measure that provides additional information to management, investors and others that aids in the understanding of the economics of our operations and performance compared to other producers and provides investors visibility by better defining the total costs associated with production. 
 AISC amounts are intended to provide additional information only and do not have any standardized meaning prescribed by GAAP and should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for measures of performance prepared in accordance with GAAP. The measures are not necessarily indicative of operating profit or cash flow from operations as determined under GAAP. Other companies may calculate these measures differently as a result of differences in the underlying accounting principles, policies applied and in accounting frameworks such as in IFRS, or by reflecting the benefit from selling non-gold metals as a reduction to AISC. Differences may also arise related to definitional differences of sustaining versus development (i.e. non-sustaining) activities based upon each company s internal policies. 
 The following disclosure provides information regarding the adjustments made in determining the All-In Sustaining Costs measure: 
 Costs applicable to sales . Includes all direct and indirect costs related to current production incurred to execute the current mine plan. We exclude certain exceptional or unusual amounts from CAS, such as significant revisions to recovery amounts. CAS includes by-product credits from certain metals obtained during the process of extracting and processing the primary ore-body. CAS is accounted for on an accrual basis and excludes Depreciation and amortization and Reclamation and remediation , which is consistent with our presentation of CAS on the Consolidated Statements of Operations. In determining AISC, only the CAS associated with producing and selling an ounce of gold is included in the measure. Therefore, the amount of gold CAS included in AISC is derived from the CAS presented in the Company s Consolidated Statements of Operations less the amount of CAS attributable to the production of other metals. The other metals' CAS at those mine sites is disclosed in Note 3 of the Consolidated Financial Statements. The allocation of CAS between gold and other metals is based upon the relative sales value of gold and other metals produced during the period. 
 Reclamation costs . Includes accretion expense related to reclamation liabilities and the amortization of the related ARC for the Company s operating properties. Accretion related to the reclamation liabilities and the amortization of the ARC assets for reclamation does not reflect annual cash outflows but are calculated in accordance with GAAP. The accretion and amortization reflect the periodic costs of reclamation associated with current production and are therefore included in the measure. The allocation of these costs to gold and other metals is determined using the same allocation used in the allocation of CAS between gold and other metals. 
 Advanced projects, research and development and exploration . Includes incurred expenses related to projects that are designed to sustain current production and exploration. We note that as current resources are depleted, exploration and advanced projects are necessary for us to replace the depleting reserves or enhance the recovery and processing of the current reserves to sustain production at existing operations. As these costs relate to sustaining our production, and are considered a continuing cost of a mining company, these costs are included in the AISC measure. These costs are derived from the Advanced projects, research and development and Exploration amounts presented in the Consolidated Statements of Operations less incurred expenses related to the 
 97 

Table of Contents 

 development of new operations, or related to major projects at existing operations where these projects will materially benefit the operation in the future. The allocation of these costs to gold and other metals is determined using the same allocation used in the allocation of CAS between gold and other metals. We also allocate these costs incurred at the Other North America, Other Australia and Corporate and Other locations using the proportion of CAS between gold and other metals. 
 General and administrative . Includes costs related to administrative tasks not directly related to current production, but rather related to supporting our corporate structure and fulfilling our obligations to operate as a public company. Including these expenses in the AISC metric provides visibility of the impact that general and administrative activities have on current operations and profitability on a per ounce basis. We allocate these costs to gold and other metals at the Other North America, Other Australia and Corporate and Other locations using the proportion of CAS between gold and other metals. 
 Other expense, net . For Other expense, net we include care and maintenance costs relating to direct operating costs incurred at the mine sites during the period that these sites were temporarily placed into care and maintenance in response to the COVID-19 pandemic and exclude certain exceptional or unusual expenses, such as restructuring, as these are not indicative to sustaining our current operations. Furthermore, this adjustment to Other expense, net is also consistent with the nature of the adjustments made to Net income (loss) attributable to Newmont stockholders as disclosed in the Company s non-GAAP financial measure Adjusted net income (loss). The allocation of these costs to gold and other metals is determined using the same allocation used in the allocation of CAS between gold and other metals. 
 Treatment and refining costs . Includes costs paid to smelters for treatment and refining of our concentrates to produce the salable metal. These costs are presented net as a reduction of Sales on the Consolidated Statements of Operations. The allocation of these costs to gold and other metals is determined using the same allocation used in the allocation of CAS between gold and other metals. 
 Sustaining capital and finance lease payments . We determined sustaining capital and finance lease payments as those capital expenditures and finance lease payments that are necessary to maintain current production and execute the current mine plan. We determined development (i.e. non-sustaining) capital expenditures and finance lease payments to be those payments used to develop new operations or related to projects at existing operations where those projects will materially benefit the operation and are excluded from the calculation of AISC. The classification of sustaining and development capital projects and finance leases is based on a systematic review of our project portfolio in light of the nature of each project. Sustaining capital and finance lease payments are relevant to the AISC metric as these are needed to maintain the Company s current operations and provide improved transparency related to our ability to finance these expenditures from current operations. The allocation of these costs to gold and other metals is determined using the same allocation used in the allocation of CAS between gold and other metals. We also allocate these costs incurred at the Other North America, Other Australia and Corporate and Other locations using the proportion of CAS between gold and other metals.

 Accounting Developments 
 For a discussion of Recently Adopted and Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements, refer to Note 2 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. 
 
 Critical Accounting Estimates 
 Our discussion of financial condition and results of operations is based upon the information reported in our Consolidated Financial Statements. The preparation of these Consolidated Financial Statements in conformity with GAAP requires us to make assumptions and estimates that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues, and expenses, as well as the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities as of the date of our financial statements. We have identified the accounting estimates listed below as critical to understanding and evaluating the financial results reported in our Consolidated Financial Statements. These accounting estimates require the application of significant management judgment and are critical due to the significant level of estimation uncertainty regarding the assumptions involved and the magnitude of the asset, liability, revenue or expense being reported. We base our assumptions and estimates on historical experience and various other sources that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances. We review the underlying factors used in our estimates regularly, including reviewing the significant accounting policies impacting the estimates, to ensure compliance with GAAP. However, due to the uncertainty inherent in our estimates, actual results may materially differ from the estimates we calculate due to changes in circumstances, global economics and politics, and general business conditions. A summary of our significant accounting policies is detailed in Note 2 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. 
 Depreciation and amortization 
 Expenditures for new facilities or equipment and expenditures that extend the useful lives of existing facilities or equipment are capitalized and depreciated using the straight-line method at rates sufficient to amortize such costs over the estimated future lives of such facilities or equipment and their components. Facilities and equipment acquired as a part of a finance lease, build-to-suit or other financing arrangement are recorded based on the contractual lease terms. The facilities and equipment are depreciated using the straight-line method at rates sufficient to depreciate such costs over the lesser of the lease terms or the estimated productive lives of such facilities. These lives do not exceed the estimated mine life based on proven and probable reserves as the useful lives of these assets are considered to be limited to the life of the relevant mine. 
 Costs incurred to develop new properties are capitalized as incurred where it has been determined that the property can be economically developed based on the existence of proven and probable reserves. At our surface mines, these costs include costs to further delineate the ore body and remove overburden to initially expose the ore body. At our underground mines, these costs include the cost of building access ways, shaft sinking and access, lateral development, drift development, ramps and infrastructure development. All such costs are amortized using the UOP method over the estimated life of the ore body based on estimated recoverable ounces or pounds to be produced from proven and probable reserves. 
 Major mine development costs incurred after the commencement of production that are capitalized are amortized using the UOP method based on estimated recoverable ounces or pounds to be produced from proven and probable reserves. To the extent that such costs benefit the entire ore body, they are amortized over the estimated recoverable ounces or pounds in proven and probable reserves of the entire ore body. Costs incurred to access specific ore blocks or areas that only provide benefit over the life of that block or area are amortized over the estimated recoverable ounces or pounds in proven and probable reserves of that specific ore block or area. 
 Capitalized asset retirement costs incurred are amortized according to how the related assets are being depreciated. Open pit and underground mining costs are amortized using the UOP method based on recoverable ounces by source. Other costs, including leaching facilities, tailing facilities, and mills and other infrastructure costs, are amortized using the straight-line method over the same estimated future lives of the associated assets. 
 The calculation of the UOP rate of amortization, and therefore the annual amortization charge to operations, could be materially impacted to the extent that actual production in the future is different from current forecasts of production based on proven and probable reserves. This would generally occur to the extent that there were significant changes in any of the factors or assumptions used in determining reserves. These changes could include: (i) an expansion of proven and probable reserves through exploration activities; (ii) differences between estimated and actual costs of production, due to differences in grade, metal recovery rates and foreign currency exchange rates; and (iii) differences between actual commodity prices and commodity price assumptions 
 104

 used in the estimation of reserves. If reserves decreased significantly, amortization charged to operations would increase; conversely, if reserves increased significantly, amortization charged to operations would decrease. Such changes in reserves could similarly impact the useful lives of assets depreciated on a straight-line basis, where those lives are limited to the life of the mine, which in turn is limited to the life of the proven and probable reserves. 
 The expected useful lives used in depreciation and amortization calculations are determined based on applicable facts and circumstances, as described above. Significant judgment is involved in the determination of useful lives, and no assurance can be given that actual useful lives will not differ significantly from the useful lives assumed for the purpose of depreciation and amortization calculations. 
 Carrying value of stockpiles 
 Stockpiles represent ore that has been extracted from the mine and is available for further processing. Mine sequencing may result in mining material at a faster rate than can be processed. We generally process the highest ore grade material first to maximize metal production; however, a blend of ore stockpiles may be processed to balance hardness and/or metallurgy in order to maximize throughput and recovery. Processing of lower grade stockpiled ore may continue after mining operations are completed. Sulfide copper ores are subject to oxidation over time which can reduce expected future recoveries. Stockpiles are measured by estimating the number of tons added and removed from the stockpile, the number of contained ounces or pounds (based on assay data), and the estimated metallurgical recovery rates (based on the expected processing method). Stockpile ore tonnages are verified by periodic surveys. Costs are added to stockpiles based on current mining costs, including applicable overhead and depreciation and amortization relating to mining operations and removed at each stockpile s average cost per recoverable unit as material is processed. 
 We record stockpiles at the lower of average cost or net realizable value, and carrying values are evaluated at least quarterly. Net realizable value represents the estimated future sales price based on short-term and long-term metals price assumptions that are applied to expected short-term (12 months or less) and long-term sales from stockpiles, less estimated costs to complete production and bring the product to sale. The primary factors that influence the need to record write-downs of stockpiles include declines in short-term or long-term metals prices, increases in costs for production inputs such as labor, fuel and energy, materials and supplies, as well as realized mineral grades and recovery rates. The significant assumption in determining the stockpile net realizable value for each mine site at December 31, 2022 is a long-term gold price of 1,600 per ounce. A decrease of 100 per ounce in the long-term gold price assumption could result in an impairment of the carrying value of our stockpiles of up to approximately 70. 
 Other assumptions include future operating and capital costs, metal recoveries, production levels, commodity prices, proven and probable reserve quantities, engineering data and other factors unique to each operation based on the life of mine plans, as well as long-term commodity prices and applicable U.S. dollar long-term exchange rates. If short-term and long-term commodity prices decrease, estimated future processing costs increase, or other negative factors occur, it may be necessary to record a write-down of stockpiles. A high degree of judgment is involved in determining such assumptions and estimates and no assurance can be given that actual results will not differ significantly from those estimates and assumptions. 
 Refer to Note 17 of the Consolidated Financial Statements for further information regarding stockpiles. 
 Carrying value of ore on leach pads 
 Ore on leach pads represent ore that has been mined and placed on leach pads where a solution is applied to the surface of the heap to dissolve the gold, copper or silver. Costs are added to ore on leach pads based on current mining costs, including applicable depreciation and amortization relating to mining operations. Costs are removed from ore on leach pads as ounces or pounds are recovered based on the average cost per estimated recoverable ounce of gold or silver or pound of copper on the leach pad. 
 Estimates of recoverable ore on the leach pads are calculated from the quantities of ore placed on the leach pads (measured tons added to the leach pads), the grade of ore placed on the leach pads (based on assay data) and a recovery percentage (based on ore type). In general, leach pads recover between 50 and 95 of the recoverable ounces in the first year of leaching, declining each year thereafter until the leaching process is complete. 
 Although the quantities of recoverable metal placed on the leach pads are reconciled by comparing the grades of ore placed on pads to the quantities of metal actually recovered (metallurgical balancing), the nature of the leaching process inherently limits the ability to precisely monitor inventory levels. As a result, the metallurgical balancing process is constantly monitored and estimates are refined based on actual results over time. Historically, our operating results have not been materially impacted by variations between the estimated and actual recoverable quantities of metal on our leach pads. Variations between actual and estimated quantities resulting from changes in assumptions and estimates that do not result in write-downs to net realizable value are accounted for on a prospective basis. The significant assumption in determining the net realizable value for each mine site at December 31, 2022 is a long-term gold price of 1,600 per ounce. A decrease of 100 per ounce in the long-term gold price assumption would not result in a material write-down of the carrying value of the leach pads. 
 Other assumptions include future operating and capital costs, metal recoveries, production levels, proven and probable reserve quantities, engineering data and other factors unique to each operation based on the life of mine plans, as well as a long-term metal 
 105 

Table of Contents 

 prices. If short-term and long-term commodity prices decrease, estimated future processing costs increase, or other negative factors occur, it may be necessary to record a write-down of ore on leach pads to net realizable value. 
 Refer to Note 17 of the Consolidated Financial Statements for further information regarding ore on leach pads. 
 Carrying value of long-lived assets 
 We review and evaluate our long-lived assets for impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the related carrying amounts may not be recoverable. Significant negative industry or economic trends, adverse social or political developments, declines in our market capitalization, geotechnical difficulties, reduced estimates of future cash flows from our reporting segments or other disruptions to our business are a few examples of events that we monitor, as they could indicate that the carrying value of the Company s long-lived assets, including development projects, may not be recoverable. In such cases, a recoverability test may be necessary to determine if an impairment charge is required. 
 For development projects, including our Conga project which is discussed further below, we review and evaluate changes to project plans and timing to determine continued technical, economic and social viability of the projects. If the Company determines to sell or abandon a project due to uncertainty from changes in circumstances related to technical, economic, social, political or community factors, or other evolving circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable, then a recoverability test is performed to determine if an impairment charge should be recorded. 
 An impairment loss is measured and recorded based on the estimated fair value of the long-lived assets being tested for impairment and their carrying amounts. Fair value is typically determined through the use of an income approach utilizing estimates of discounted pre-tax future cash flows or a market approach utilizing recent transaction activity for comparable properties. These approaches are primarily considered Level 3 fair value measurements. Occasionally, such as when an asset is held for sale, market prices are used. We believe our estimates and models used to determine fair value are similar to what a market participant would use. 
 The estimated undiscounted cash flows used to assess recoverability of long-lived assets and to measure the fair value of our mining operations are derived from current business plans, which are developed using short-term price forecasts reflective of the current price environment and our projections for long-term average metal prices. In addition to short- and long-term metal price assumptions, other assumptions include estimates of commodity-based and other input costs; proven and probable mineral reserves estimates, including the timing and cost to develop and produce the reserves; value beyond proven and probable reserve estimates; estimated future closure costs; the use of appropriate discount rates; and applicable U.S. dollar long-term exchange rates. Refer to Item 7A, Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk. 
 The significant assumption in determining the future cash flows for each mine site at December 31, 2022 is a long-term gold price of 1,600 per ounce. A decrease of 100 per ounce in the long-term gold price assumption could result in an impairment of our long-lived assets, including goodwill, of up to approximately 2,800 before consideration of other value beyond proven and probable reserves which may significantly decrease the amount of any potential impairment charge. 
 As discussed above under Depreciation and amortization, various factors could impact our ability to achieve our forecasted production schedules from proven and probable reserves which could impact the carrying value of our long-lived assets. The ability to achieve the estimated quantities of recoverable minerals from exploration stage mineral interests involves further risks in addition to those factors applicable to mineral interests where proven and probable reserves have been identified, due to the lower level of confidence that the identified measured, indicated and inferred resources could ultimately be mined economically. Assets classified as exploration potential have the highest level of risk that the carrying value of the asset can be ultimately realized, due to the still lower level of geological confidence and economic modeling. 
 Events that could result in additional impairment of our long-lived assets include, but are not limited to, decreases in future metal prices, unfavorable changes in foreign exchange rates, increases in future closure costs, and any event that might otherwise have a material adverse effect on mine site cash flows. 
 Goodwill 
 Goodwill represents the excess of the purchase price over the estimated fair value of the net assets acquired in a business acquisition. Goodwill is allocated to reporting units and tested for impairment annually as of December 31, 2022 and when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value. Each operating mine is considered a distinct reporting unit for purposes of goodwill impairment testing. 
 The Company may elect to perform a qualitative assessment when it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is higher than its carrying value. At the Company's election or if it is determined to be more likely than not that the fair value is less than the carrying value, a quantitative goodwill impairment test is performed to determine the fair value of the reporting unit. The fair value of a reporting unit is determined using either the income approach utilizing estimates of discounted future cash flows or the market valuation approach utilizing recent transaction activity for comparable properties. These approaches are considered Level 3 fair value measurements. If the carrying amount of the reporting unit exceeds its fair value, an impairment loss is recognized in an amount equal to that excess, limited to the total amount of goodwill allocated to that reporting unit. Any impairment loss recognized in the 
 106 

Table of Contents 

 current period is not reversed in future periods. The Company recognizes its pro rata share of Goodwill and any subsequent goodwill impairment losses recorded by entities that are proportionately consolidated. 
 When the income approach is utilized to determine fair value, the estimated cash flows used to assess the fair value of a reporting unit are derived from the Company s current business plans, which are developed using short-term price forecasts reflective of the current price environment and management s projections for long-term average metal prices. The significant assumption in determining the future cash flows for each mine site at December 31, 2022 is a long-term gold price of 1,600 per ounce. In addition to short- and long-term metal price assumptions, other assumptions include estimates of commodity-based and other input costs; proven and probable mineral reserves estimates, including the timing and cost to develop and produce the reserves; value beyond proven and probable estimates; estimated future closure costs; the use of appropriate discount rates; and applicable U.S. dollar long-term exchange rates. Refer to Item 7A, Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk.. 
 Fair value determinations require considerable judgment and are sensitive to changes in underlying assumptions and factors. For testing purposes of our reporting units, management's best estimates of the expected future results are the primary driver in determining the fair value. However, there can be no assurance that the estimates and assumptions made for purposes of the goodwill impairment tests will prove to be an accurate prediction of the future. Examples of events or circumstances that could reasonably be expected to negatively affect the underlying key assumptions and ultimately impact the estimated fair value of our reporting units include, but are not limited to, such items as: (i) a decrease in forecasted production levels if we are unable to realize the mineable reserves, resources and exploration potential at our mining properties and extend the life of mine (ii) increased production or capital costs (iii) adverse changes in macroeconomic conditions including the market price of metals and changes in the equity and debt markets or country specific factors which could result in higher discount rates, (iv) significant unfavorable changes in tax rates including increased corporate income or mining tax rates, and (v) negative changes in regulation, legislation, and political environments which could impact our ability to operate in the future. While historical performance and current expectations have resulted in fair values of our reporting units equal to or in excess of carrying values, if our assumptions are not realized, it is possible that an impairment charge may need to be recorded in the future. 
 Carrying value of Conga 
 We review and evaluate the Company s Conga development project for recoverability whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable. We have considered a variety of technical, economic, social and political developments related to the Conga project during our evaluation of impairment indicators since November 2011, when construction and development activities at the project were largely suspended. Project activities in recent years have focused on continued engagement with the local communities and maintaining and protecting existing project infrastructure and equipment through our active care and maintenance program. Although we have reclassified Conga reserves to resources and reallocated exploration and development capital to other projects, we continue to evaluate long-term options to progress development of the Conga project and improve social and political acceptance. While we have reprioritized the Yanacocha Sulfides project ahead of the Conga project, we have delayed the full-funds decision and are currently in the process of assessing project plan options for the Yanacocha Sulfides project. The Company also periodically updates the economic model for its Conga project to understand changes to the estimated capital costs, cash flows, and economic returns from the project. As of December 31, 2022, we have not identified events or changes in circumstances that indicate that the carrying value of the Conga project is not recoverable. 
 Derivative Instruments 
 All financial instruments that meet the definition of a derivative are recorded on the balance sheet at fair value. Changes in the fair value of derivatives are recorded in the Consolidated Statements of Operations, except for the portion of the change in fair value of derivatives that are designated as cash flow hedges. Management applies judgment in estimating the fair value of instruments that are highly sensitive to assumptions such as commodity prices, market volatilities, foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates. Variations in these factors could materially affect amounts credited or charged to earnings to reflect the changes in fair value of derivatives. Certain derivative contracts are designated as effective cash flow hedges, whereby the changes in fair value of these instruments are deferred in Accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) and are reclassified to income in the Consolidated Statements of Operations when the underlying transaction designated as the hedged item impacts earnings. To the extent that management determines that the forecasted transactions are no longer probable of occurring, gains and losses deferred in Accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) would be reclassified to the Consolidated Statements of Operations immediately. 
 Refer to Note 14 of the Consolidated Financial Statements for further information regarding derivative instruments. 
 Reclamation and remediation obligations 
 The Company records the estimated asset retirement obligations associated with operating and non-operating mine sites when an obligation is incurred and the fair value can be reasonably estimated. Fair value is measured as the present value of expected cash flow estimates, after considering inflation, our credit-adjusted risk-free rates and a market risk premium appropriate for our operations. Reclamation costs are allocated to expense over the life of the related assets and are periodically adjusted to reflect changes in the estimated present value resulting from the passage of time and revisions to the estimates of either the timing or amount of the reclamation costs. Reclamation obligations are based on our best estimate of when the expected spending for an existing environmental disturbance will occur. Our cost estimates are reflected on a third-party cost basis and comply with our legal obligation

 to retire long-lived assets in the period incurred. Changes in reclamation estimates at non-operating mines where the mine or portion of the mine site has entered the closure phase and has no substantive future economic value are reflected in earnings in the period an estimate is revised. Costs included in estimated asset retirement obligations are discounted to their present value and are estimated over a period of up to fifty years. We review, on at least an annual basis, the reclamation obligation at each mine. 
 Remediation costs are accrued when it is probable that an obligation has been incurred and the cost can be reasonably estimated. Such cost estimates may include ongoing care, maintenance and monitoring costs. Changes in remediation estimates at non-operating mines are reflected in earnings in the period an estimate is revised. Water treatment costs included in environmental remediation obligations are discounted to their present value and are estimated over a period of up to fifty years. 
 Accounting for reclamation and remediation obligations requires management to make estimates unique to each mining operation of the future costs the Company expects to incur to complete the reclamation and remediation work required to comply with existing laws and regulations. These estimates require considerable judgment and are sensitive to changes in underlying inputs and assumptions. Such changes, including, but not limited to, (i) changes to environmental laws and regulations, which could increase the scope and extent of work required, (ii) changes in the timing of reclamation and remediation activities, which could occur over an extended future period and (iii) changes in the methods and technology utilized to settle reclamation and remediation obligations, could have a material impact on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. 
 Refer to Note 5 of the Consolidated Financial Statements for further information regarding reclamation and remediation obligations. 
 Income and mining taxes 
 We account for income taxes using the liability method, recognizing certain temporary differences between the financial reporting basis of our liabilities and assets and the related income tax basis for such liabilities and assets. This method generates either a net deferred income tax liability or asset for us, as measured by the statutory tax rates in effect. We derive our deferred income tax charge or benefit by recording the change in either the net deferred income tax liability or asset balance for the year. The financial statement effects of changes in tax law are recorded as discrete items in the period enacted as part of income tax expense or benefit from continuing operations, regardless of the category of income or loss to which the deferred taxes relate. We have exposure to the impact of foreign exchange fluctuations on tax positions in certain jurisdictions, such movements are recorded within Income and mining tax benefit (expense) related to deferred income tax assets and liabilities, as well as non-current uncertain tax positions, while foreign exchange fluctuations impacting current tax positions are recorded within Other income (loss), net as foreign currency exchange gains (losses). With respect to the earnings that we derive from the operations of our consolidated subsidiaries, in those situations where the earnings are indefinitely reinvested, no deferred taxes have been provided on the unremitted earnings (including the excess of the carrying value of the net equity of such entities for financial reporting purposes over the tax basis of such equity) of these consolidated companies. 
 Mining taxes represent state and provincial taxes levied on mining operations and are classified as income taxes as such taxes are based on a percentage of mining profits. 
 Our operations are in multiple jurisdictions where uncertainties arise in the application of complex tax regulations. Some of these tax regimes are defined by contractual agreements with the local government, while others are defined by general tax laws and regulations. We are subject to reviews of our income tax filings and other tax payments, and disputes can arise with the taxing authorities over the interpretation of its contracts or laws. We recognize potential liabilities and record tax liabilities for anticipated tax audit issues in the U.S. and other tax jurisdictions based on our estimate of whether it is more likely than not, and the extent to which, additional taxes will be due. We adjust these reserves in light of changing facts and circumstances; however, due to the complexity of some of these uncertainties, the ultimate resolution may result in a payment that is materially different from our current estimate of the tax liabilities. If our estimate of tax liabilities proves to be less than the ultimate assessment, an additional charge to expense would result. If the estimate of tax liabilities proves to be greater than the ultimate assessment, a tax benefit would result. We recognize interest and penalties, if any, related to unrecognized tax benefits in Income and mining tax benefit (expense) . In certain jurisdictions, we must pay a portion of the disputed amount to the local government in order to formally appeal the assessment. Such payment is recorded as a receivable if we believe the amount is ultimately collectible. 
 Valuation of deferred tax assets 
 Our deferred income tax assets include certain future tax benefits. We record a valuation allowance against any portion of those deferred income tax assets when we believe, based on the weight of available evidence, it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred income tax asset will not be realized. We review the likelihood that we will realize the benefit of our deferred tax assets and therefore the need for valuation allowances on a quarterly basis, or more frequently if events indicate that a review is required. In determining the requirement for a valuation allowance, the historical and projected financial results of the legal entity or consolidated group recording the net deferred tax asset is considered, along with all other available positive and negative evidence. 
 108 

Table of Contents 

 Certain categories of evidence carry more weight in the analysis than others based upon the extent to which the evidence may be objectively verified. We look to the nature and severity of cumulative pretax losses (if any) in the current three-year period ending on the evaluation date or the expectation of future pretax losses and the existence and frequency of prior cumulative pretax losses. 
 We utilize a rolling twelve quarters of pre-tax income or loss as a measure of our cumulative results in recent years. Concluding that a valuation allowance is not required is difficult when there is significant negative evidence which is objective and verifiable, such as cumulative losses in recent years. However, a cumulative three year loss is not solely determinative of the need for a valuation allowance. We also consider all other available positive and negative evidence in our analysis. 
 Other factors considered in the determination of the probability of the realization of the deferred tax assets include, but are not limited to: 
 Earnings history; 
 Projected future financial and taxable income based upon existing reserves and long-term estimates of commodity prices; 
 The duration of statutory carry forward periods; 
 Prudent and feasible tax planning strategies readily available that may alter the timing of reversal of the temporary difference; 
 Nature of temporary differences and predictability of reversal patterns of existing temporary differences; and 
 The sensitivity of future forecasted results to commodity prices and other factors. 
 The Company assesses available positive and negative evidence to estimate if sufficient future taxable income will be generated to utilize the existing deferred tax assets. A significant piece of objective negative evidence is recent pretax losses and/or expectations of future pretax losses. Such objective evidence limits the ability to consider other subjective evidence including projections for future growth. On the basis of this evaluation, a valuation allowance has been recorded in Peru. The amount of the deferred tax asset considered realizable, however, could be adjusted if estimates of future taxable income during the carryforward period are increased or if objective negative evidence in the form of cumulative losses is no longer present and additional weight may be given to subjective evidence such as our projections for growth. 
 Refer to Note 10 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional detail on the valuation allowance. 
 For additional risk factors that could impact the Company s ability to realize the deferred tax assets, refer to Note 2 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. 
 
 ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK (dollars in millions, except per ounce and per pound amounts). 
 
 Metal Prices 
 Changes in the market price of gold significantly affect our profitability and cash flow. Gold prices can fluctuate widely due to numerous factors, such as demand; forward selling by producers; central bank sales, purchases and lending; investor sentiment; the strength of the USD; inflation, deflation, or other general price instability; and global mine production levels. Changes in the market price of copper, silver, lead and zinc also affect our profitability and cash flow. These metals are traded on established international exchanges and prices generally reflect market supply and demand, but can also be influenced by speculative trading in the commodity or by currency exchange rates. The Company does not currently hold instruments that are designated to hedge against the potential impacts due to market price changes in metals. Consideration of these impacts are discussed below. 
 Decreases in the market price of metals can significantly affect the value of our product inventory, stockpiles and leach pads, and it may be necessary to record a write-down to the net realizable value, as well as significantly impact the carrying value of our long-lived assets and goodwill. For information concerning the sensitivity of our impairment analysis over long-lived assets and goodwill to changes in metal price, refer to Critical Accounting Estimates within Item 7, MD A, and Notes 2, 6 and 19 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. 
 Net realizable value represents the estimated future sales price based on short-term and long-term metals prices, less estimated costs to complete production and bring the product to sale. The primary factors that influence the need to record write-downs of our stockpiles, leach pads and product inventory include short-term and long-term metals prices and costs for production inputs such as labor, fuel and energy, materials and supplies as well as realized ore grades and recovery rates. The significant assumptions in determining the stockpile, leach pad and product inventory adjustments for each mine site reporting unit at December 31, 2022 included production cost and capitalized expenditure assumptions unique to each operation, and the following short-term and long-term assumptions: 
 109 

Table of Contents 

 Short-term Long-term Gold price (per ounce) 1,726 1,600 Copper price (per pound) 3.63 3.50 Silver price (per ounce) 21.17 20.00 Lead price (per pound) 0.95 1.05 Zinc price (per pound) 1.36 1.30 AUD to USD exchange rate 0.66 0.75 CAD to USD exchange rate 0.74 0.80 MXN to USD exchange rate 0.05 0.04 
 The net realizable value measurement involves the use of estimates and assumptions unique to each mining operation regarding current and future operating and capital costs, metal recoveries, production levels, commodity prices, proven and probable reserve quantities, engineering data and other factors. A high degree of judgment is involved in determining such assumptions and estimates and no assurance can be given that actual results will not differ significantly from those estimates and assumptions. For information concerning the sensitivity of our stockpiles and ore on leach pads to changes in metal price, refer to Critical Accounting Estimates within Item 7, MD A. 
 
 Interest Rate Risk 
 We are subject to interest rate risk related to the fair value of our senior notes which consist of fixed rates. For fixed rate debt, changes in interest rates generally affect the fair value of the debt instrument, but not our earnings or cash flows. The terms of our fixed rate debt obligations do not generally allow investors to demand payment of these obligations prior to maturity. Therefore, we do not have significant exposure to interest rate risk for our fixed rate debt; however, we do have exposure to fair value risk if we repurchase or exchange long-term debt prior to maturity which could be material. Refer to Note 13 to our Consolidated Financial Statements for further information pertaining to the fair value of our fixed rate debt. 
 
 Foreign Currency 
 In addition to our operations in the U.S., we have significant operations and/or assets in Canada, Mexico, Dominican Republic, Peru, Suriname, Argentina, Chile, Australia and Ghana. All of our operations sell their gold, copper, silver, lead and zinc production based on USD metal prices. Foreign currency exchange rates can fluctuate widely due to numerous factors, such as supply and demand for foreign and U.S. currencies and U.S. and foreign country economic conditions. Fluctuations in the local currency exchange rates in relation to the U.S. dollar can increase or decrease profit margins, cash flow and Costs applicable to sales per ounce/pound to the extent costs are paid in local currency at foreign operations. 
 We performed a sensitivity analysis to estimate the impact to Costs applicable to sales per ounce arising from a hypothetical 10 adverse movement to local currency exchange rates at December 31, 2022 in relation to the U.S. dollar at our foreign mining operations. The sensitivity analyses indicated that a hypothetical 10 adverse movement would result in an approximate 33 increase to Costs applicable to sales per ounce at December 31, 2022. 
 
 Hedging 
 In October 2022, the Company entered into A 574 of AUD-denominated fixed forward contracts to mitigate variability in the USD functional cash flows related to the AUD-denominated capital expenditures expected to be incurred in 2023 and 2024 during the construction and development phase of the Tanami Expansion 2 project included in the Company's Australia segment. The Company has designated the forward contracts as foreign currency cash flow hedges against the forecasted AUD-denominated Tanami Expansion 2 capital expenditures. 
 By using hedges, we are affected by market risk, credit risk, and market liquidity risk. Market risk is the risk that the fair value of a derivative might be adversely affected by a change in currency exchange rates, and that this in turn affects our financial condition. We manage market risk by establishing and monitoring parameters that limit the types and degree of market risk that may be undertaken. We mitigate this potential risk to our financial condition by establishing trading agreements with counterparties under which we are not required to post any collateral or be subject to any margin calls on our derivatives. Our counterparties cannot require settlement solely because of an adverse change in the fair value of a derivative. We have performed a sensitivity analysis as of December 31, 2022, using a modeling technique that measures the change in the fair values arising from a hypothetical 10 adverse movement in the AUD foreign currency exchange rates relative to the U.S. dollar, with all other variables held constant. The analysis covered all of our AUD-denominated fixed forward contracts. The foreign currency exchange rates we used in performing the sensitivity analysis were based on AUD market rates in effect at December 31, 2022. The sensitivity analyses indicated that a hypothetical 10 adverse movement in foreign currency exchange rates would result in an approximate decrease in the fair value of the hedging derivative instruments of 40 at December 31, 2022.

 Credit risk is the risk that a third party might fail to fulfill its performance obligations under the terms of a financial instrument. We mitigate credit risk by entering into derivatives with high credit quality counterparties, limiting the amount of exposure to each counterparty and monitoring the financial condition of the counterparties. 
 Market liquidity risk is the risk that a derivative cannot be eliminated quickly, by either liquidating it or by establishing an offsetting position. Under the terms of our trading agreements, counterparties cannot require us to immediately settle outstanding derivatives, except upon the occurrence of customary events of default such as covenant breaches, including financial covenants, insolvency or bankruptcy. We further mitigate market liquidity risk by spreading out the maturity of our derivatives over time. 
 Refer to Note 14 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further information on our derivative instruments. 
 
 Commodity Price Exposure 
 Our provisional concentrate sales contain an embedded derivative that is required to be separated from the host contract for accounting purposes. The host contract is the receivable from the sale of the respective metal concentrates at the prevailing indices prices at the time of sale. The embedded derivative, which is not designated for hedge accounting, is marked to market through earnings each period prior to final settlement. 
 We perform an analysis on the provisional concentrate sales to determine the potential impact to Net income (loss) attributable to Newmont stockholders for each 10 change to the average price on the provisional concentrate sales subject to final pricing over the next several months. Refer below for our analysis as of December 31, 2022.

 REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM 
 To the Board of Directors and Stockholders of Newmont Corporation 
 Opinion on the Financial Statements 
 We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Newmont Corporation (the Company) as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, the related consolidated statements of operations, comprehensive income (loss), changes in equity and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2022, the related notes and the financial statement schedule in Item 15(a)(2) (collectively referred to as the consolidated financial statements ). In our opinion, based on our audits and the report of other auditors, the consolidated financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company at December 31, 2022 and 2021, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2022, in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. 
 We did not audit the financial statements of Nevada Gold Mines LLC, a 38.5 owned investment which is proportionately consolidated, which reflects total assets constituting 19 and 19 at December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively, and sales constituting 18 , 19 , and 21 in 2022, 2021, and 2020, respectively, of the related consolidated totals. Those statements were audited by other auditors whose report has been furnished to us, and our opinion, insofar as it relates to the amounts included for Nevada Gold Mines LLC, is based solely on the report of the other auditors. 
 We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the Company's internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2022, based on criteria established in Internal Control-Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission 2013 framework, and our report dated February 23, 2023 expressed an unqualified opinion thereon, based on our audit and the report of the other auditors. 
 Basis for Opinion 
 These financial statements are the responsibility of the Company's management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company s financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. 
 We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. Our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe that our audits and the report of other auditors provide a reasonable basis for our opinion. 
 Critical Audit Matters 
 The critical audit matters communicated below are matters arising from the current period audit of the financial statements that were communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that: (1) relate to accounts or disclosures that are material to the financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective or complex judgments. The communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion on the consolidated financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matters below, providing separate opinions on the critical audit matters or on the accounts or disclosures to which they relate. Reclamation liabilities 
 Description of the Matter As discussed in Notes 2, 5 and 25 of the consolidated financial statements, the Company s mining and exploration activities are subject to various domestic and international laws and regulations governing the protection of the environment. Reclamation obligations are recognized when incurred and recorded as liabilities at fair value. Reclamation liabilities are periodically adjusted to reflect changes in the estimated present value resulting from revisions to the estimates of either the timing or amount of the reclamation costs. 
 
 Auditing management s accounting for reclamation liabilities was especially challenging, as significant judgment is required by the Company to estimate required cash flows to meet obligations established by mining permit, local statutes and promissory estoppel at the end of mine life as well as estimation uncertainty inherent in the cash flows. The significant judgment was primarily related to the inherent estimation uncertainty relating to the extent of future reclamation activities and related costs. 

113 

Table of Contents 

 How We Addressed the Matter in Our Audit We obtained an understanding, evaluated the design, and tested the operating effectiveness of the controls over the Company s accounting for reclamation liabilities, including controls over management s review of estimated future costs, premiums for uncertainty and the reclamation liability calculation. 
 
 To test the reclamation liabilities, among other procedures, we evaluated the methodology, significant assumptions and the underlying data used by the Company in its estimate. To assess the estimates of reclamation activities and cash flows, we evaluated significant changes from the prior estimate, verified consistency between timing of reclamation activities and projected mine life, compared anticipated costs across the Company s mines, verified cost rates against third-party information or internal cost records and recalculated management s estimate. We also evaluated the significant assumptions included in the fair value calculation, including market risk premium, cost inflation, and credit-adjusted risk-free rate. We involved our reclamation specialists to interview members of the Company s engineering staff, assess the completeness of the mine reclamation estimates with respect to meeting mine closure and post closure requirements, and evaluate the reasonableness of the engineering estimates and assumptions. 
 
 Impairment of goodwill 
 Description of the Matter As discussed in Notes 2, 6, and 13 to the consolidated financial statements, management conducts a goodwill impairment assessment annually at December 31, and when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value. The fair value of a reporting unit is determined through the use of the income approach using estimates of future cash flows attributable to the respective reporting units. As a result of the annual impairment assessment, the Company recognized 800 million of goodwill impairment charges related to the Cerro Negro and Porcupine reporting units. 
 
 Auditing management s fair value assessment was especially challenging, as significant judgment is required by the company to estimate future cash flows attributable to the respective reporting units, and changes in management s assumptions could have a significant impact on either the fair value, the amount of impairment charge, or both. The estimated future cash flows used to determine the fair values of reporting units are derived from current business plans, which are developed using short-term price forecasts reflective of the current price environment and management s projections for long-term metal prices, and proven and probable mineral reserves estimates, including the timing and cost to develop and produce the reserves. A high degree of auditor judgment and an increased extent of effort was required when performing audit procedures to evaluate the reasonableness of management s estimates and assumptions. 

How We Addressed the Matter in Our Audit We obtained an understanding, evaluated the design, and tested the operating effectiveness of the controls over the assessment of goodwill impairment, including those over the determination of fair value, such as controls related to management s development of future cash flows and the cost of capital. 
 
 To test the estimated fair value of each reporting unit, we performed audit procedures that included, among others, the evaluation of significant assumptions and the underlying data used by the Company in its estimate. To assess the reasonableness of estimated future cash flows, we compared the Company s short-term and long-term metal price projections to third-party sources and verified the consistency between management s projections and the Company s qualified person s estimate of proven and probable reserves and resources. We also evaluated management s projections, including timing and costs to develop and produce the reserves, against historical operating results, and evaluated management s ability to accurately forecast future cash flows by comparing actual results to historical forecasts. We involved our valuation specialist to assist in reviewing the valuation methods selected by management.

 We have served as the Company s auditor since 2014.

 REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM 
 To the Board of Managers and Members of Nevada Gold Mines LLC 
 
 Opinions on the Financial Statements and Internal Control over Financial Reporting 
 We have audited the consolidated balance sheets of Nevada Gold Mines LLC and its subsidiaries (together, the Joint Venture) as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, and the related consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive income, of changes in members equity and of cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2022, including the related notes (collectively referred to as the consolidated financial statements) (not presented herein). We also have audited the Joint Venture s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2022, based on criteria established in Internal Control Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO). 
 In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Joint Venture as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2022 in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. Also in our opinion, the Joint Venture maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2022, based on criteria established in Internal Control Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the COSO. 
 Basis for Opinions 
 The Joint Venture s management is responsible for these consolidated financial statements, for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting, and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in the Management s Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting (not presented herein). Our responsibility is to express opinions on the Joint Venture s consolidated financial statements and on the Joint Venture s internal control over financial reporting based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB) and are required to be independent with respect to the Joint Venture in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. 
 We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audits to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud, and whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. 
 Our audits of the consolidated financial statements included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the consolidated financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the consolidated financial statements. Our audit of internal control over financial reporting included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk. Our audits also included performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinions. 
 Definition and Limitations of Internal Control over Financial Reporting 
 An entity s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. An entity s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (i) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the entity; (ii) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the entity are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the entity; and (iii) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the entity s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements. 
 Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

Table of Contents 

 Critical Audit Matters 
 The critical audit matter communicated below is a matter arising from the current period audit of the consolidated financial statements that was communicated or required to be communicated to the Board of Managers (acting in a role equivalent to the audit committee) and that (i) relates to accounts or disclosures that are material to the consolidated financial statements and (ii) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion on the consolidated financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matter below, providing a separate opinion on the critical audit matter or on the accounts or disclosures to which it relates. 
 Qualitative Goodwill Impairment Assessment 
 As described in note 2 to the Joint Venture s consolidated financial statements, the Joint Venture s goodwill balance was 696 million (at a 100 percent economic interest) as of December 31, 2022. Goodwill is allocated to reporting units and assessed for impairment annually, in the fourth quarter of the fiscal year, and when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value. The Joint Venture has five reporting units. The Joint Venture s management first assesses qualitative factors to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount (qualitative goodwill impairment assessment). If it is determined that the fair value is more likely than not to be lower than the carrying value, a quantitative goodwill impairment test is performed. Management uses judgment in assessing the qualitative factors in the qualitative goodwill impairment assessment for each reporting unit, including significant adverse changes to future gold prices, future operating and capital costs, future production levels and mineral reserves and mineral resources. Management uses future production levels and mineral reserves and mineral resources based on information compiled by qualified persons (management s specialists). 
 The principal considerations for our determination that performing procedures relating to the qualitative goodwill impairment assessment is a critical audit matter are the judgment by management in assessing the qualitative factors in the qualitative goodwill impairment assessment for each reporting unit to determine whether further quantitative impairment testing is required, and a high degree of auditor judgment, subjectivity and effort in performing procedures and evaluating management s assessment of qualitative factors in the qualitative goodwill impairment assessment for each reporting unit with respect to significant adverse changes to future gold prices, future operating and capital costs, future production levels and mineral reserves and mineral resources. 
 Addressing the matter involved performing procedures and evaluating audit evidence in connection with forming our overall opinion on the consolidated financial statements. These procedures included testing the effectiveness of controls relating to management s qualitative goodwill impairment assessment. These procedures also included, among others, evaluating the reasonableness of management s qualitative goodwill impairment assessment for each reporting unit with respect to significant adverse changes to future gold prices and future operating and capital costs by (i) comparing gold prices to external industry data; (ii) comparing operating and capital costs to recent actual operating and capital costs incurred; and (iii) considering consistency with evidence obtained in other areas of the audit.

 and of the recoverable ounces in the first year of leaching, declining each year thereafter until the leaching process is complete. 
 Although the quantities of recoverable metal placed on the leach pads are reconciled by comparing the grades of ore placed on pads to the quantities of metal actually recovered (metallurgical balancing), the nature of the leaching process inherently limits the ability to precisely monitor inventory levels. As a result, the metallurgical balancing process is constantly monitored and estimates are refined based on actual results over time. Historically, the Company s operating results have not been materially impacted by variations between the estimated and actual recoverable quantities of metal on its leach pads. Variations between actual and estimated quantities resulting from changes in assumptions and estimates that do not result in write-downs to net realizable value are accounted for on a prospective basis. 
 In-process Inventory 
 In-process inventories represent material that is currently in the process of being converted to a saleable product. Conversion processes vary depending on the nature of the ore and the specific processing facility, but include mill in-circuit, flotation, leach and carbon-in-leach. In-process material is measured based on assays of the material fed into the process and the projected recoveries of the respective processing plants. In-process inventories are valued at the lower of the average cost of the material fed into the process attributable to the source material coming from the mines, stockpiles and/or leach pads, plus the in-process conversion costs, including applicable amortization relating to the process facilities incurred to that point in the process or net realizable value. 
 Precious Metals Inventory 
 Precious metals inventories include gold dor and/or gold bullion. Precious metals that result from the Company s mining and processing activities are valued at the lower of the average cost of the respective in-process inventories incurred prior to the refining process, plus applicable refining costs or net realizable value. 
 Concentrate Inventory 
 Concentrate inventories represent gold, silver, lead, zinc and copper concentrate available for shipment or in transit for further processing when the sales process has not been completed. The Company values concentrate inventory at average cost, including an allocable portion of support costs and amortization. Costs are added and removed to the concentrate inventory based on metal in the concentrate and are valued at the lower of average cost or net realizable value. 
 Materials and Supplies 
 Materials and supplies are valued at the lower of average cost or net realizable value. Cost includes applicable taxes and freight.

 gold. Under the terms of the Company s refining agreements, the dor bars are refined for a fee, and the Company s share of the refined gold and the separately-recovered silver is credited to its bullion account. Gold from dor bars credited to its bullion account is typically sold to banks or refiners. 
 A portion of gold sold from certain sites is sold in the form of concentrate. The Company s Sales also come from the sale of copper, silver, lead, and zinc. Sales from these metals are generally in the form of concentrate, which is sold to smelters for further treatment and refining. 
 Generally, if a metal expected to be mined represents more than to of the life of mine sales value of all the metal expected to be mined, co-product accounting is applied. When the Company applies co-product accounting at an operation, revenue is recognized for each co-product metal sold, and shared costs applicable to sales are allocated based on the relative sales values of the co-product metals produced. Generally, if metal expected to be mined is less than the to of the life of mine sales value, by-product accounting is applied. Revenues from by-product sales, which are immaterial, are credited to Costs applicable to sales as a by-product credit. Silver, lead and zinc are produced as co-products at Pe asquito. Copper is produced as a co-product at Boddington. Aside from the co-product sales at Boddington and Pe asquito, copper and silver produced at other Newmont sites are by-product metals. 
 Gold Sales from Dor Production 
 The Company recognizes revenue for gold from dor production when it satisfies the performance obligation of transferring gold inventory to the customer, which generally occurs upon transfer of gold bullion credits as this is the point at which the customer obtains control the ability to direct the use and obtains substantially all of the remaining benefits of ownership of the asset. 
 The Company generally recognizes the sale of gold bullion credits when the credits are delivered to the customer. The transaction price is determined based on the agreed upon market price and the number of ounces delivered. Payment is due upon delivery of gold bullion credits to the customer s account. 
 Sales from Concentrate Production 
 The Company recognizes revenue for gold, copper, silver, lead, and zinc from concentrate production, net of treatment and refining charges, when it satisfies the performance obligation of transferring control of the concentrate to the customer. This generally occurs as material passes over the vessel's rail at the port of loading based on the date from the bill of lading, as the customer has the ability to direct the use of and obtain substantially all of the remaining benefits from the material and the customer has the risk of loss. Newmont has elected to account for shipping and handling costs for concentrate contracts as fulfillment activities and not as promised goods or services; therefore these activities are not considered separate performance obligations. 
 The Company generally sells metal concentrate based on the monthly average market price for a future month, dependent on the relevant contract, following the month in which the delivery to the customer takes place. The amount of revenue recognized for concentrates is initially recorded on a provisional basis based on the forward prices for the estimated month of settlement and the Company s estimated metal quantities based on assay data. The Company s sales based on a provisional price contain an embedded derivative that is required to be separated from the host contract for accounting purposes. The host contract is the receivable from the sale of the concentrates at the forward price at the time of sale. The embedded derivative, which is not designated for hedge accounting, is primarily marked to market through Sales each period prior to final settlement. The Company also adjusts estimated metal quantities used in computing provisional sales using new information and assay data from the smelter as it is received (if any).

Stock-Based Compensation 
 The Company records stock-based compensation awards exchanged for employee services at fair value on the date of the grant and expenses the awards in the Consolidated Statements of Operations over the requisite employee service period. The fair value of stock options is determined using the Black-Scholes valuation model. The fair value of RSUs are based on the Newmont stock price on the date of grant. The fair value of PSUs is determined using a Monte Carlo simulation model. Stock-based compensation expense related to all awards, including awards with a market or performance condition that cliff vest, is generally recognized ratably over the requisite service period of the award on a straight-line basis. The Company recognizes forfeitures as they occur. The Company's estimates may be impacted by certain variables including, but not limited to, stock price volatility, employee retirement eligibility dates, the Company's performance and related tax impacts.

 Reclamation accretion Reclamation expense Remediation adjustments and other Remediation accretion Remediation expense Reclamation and remediation 
 In 2022, reclamation adjustments were primarily due to higher estimated closure costs resulting from cost inflation and increased water management costs at portions of the Yanacocha and Porcupine site operations that are no longer in production and with no expected substantive future economic value (i.e., non-operating) that resulted in increases of and , respectively. In 2021, reclamation adjustments were primarily comprised of related to non-operating portions of the Yanacocha site. In 2020, reclamation adjustments primarily related to increased lime consumption and water treatment costs at non-operating Yanacocha sites and an update to the project cost estimates at non-operating Porcupine sites that resulted in increases of and , respectively. 
 In 2022, remediation adjustments are primarily due to higher waste disposal costs and project execution delays at the Midnite mine and Dawn mill sites. In 2021, remediation adjustments are primarily due to revisions to estimated construction costs of the water treatment plant at the Midnite mine and higher estimated closure cost arising from recent tailings management review and monitoring requirements set forth by GISTM. In 2020, remediation adjustments primarily related to project execution delays due to COVID-19 and updated project cost estimates at the Midnite mine and Dawn mill sites of and other remediation project spend at other sites.

 (3) Primarily consists of impairment charges related to Goodwill at Cerro Negro for the year ended December 31, 2022. See below for further information. 
 The estimated cash flows utilized in both the long-lived asset and goodwill impairment evaluations are derived from the Company's current business plans. In the fourth quarter of 2022, the Company completed its annual business plan update which reflected certain adverse changes in market conditions, including inflationary pressures to costs and capital, strategic evaluation regarding the use of capital, and updates to asset retirement costs. 
 Impairment of long-lived and other assets 
 The Company reviews and evaluates its long-lived assets for impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the related carrying amounts may not be recoverable. During the fourth quarter of 2022, the Company determined that an impairment indicator existed at CC V, in the North America segment. This determination was based on the updated business plan, which reflected a deterioration in underlying cash flows from lower production, impacted by the decision to place the mill on long-term care and maintenance, higher costs due to inflationary pressures, as well as an increase to the asset retirement cost . As a result of the impairment indicator, a recoverability test was performed and the Company concluded the long-lived assets at CC V were impaired resulting in a non-cash impairment charge of and a remaining balance of within Property, plant and mine development, net at December 31, 2022. 
 The Company measured the impairment by comparing the total fair value of the existing operations to the carrying value of the corresponding assets. The estimated fair value was determined using the income approach and is considered a non-recurring level 3 fair value measurement. Significant inputs to the fair value measurement included (i) updated cash flow information from the Company's current business and closure plans, (ii) a short-term gold price of , (iii) a long-term gold price of , (iv) current estimates of reserves, resources, and exploration potential, and (v) a country specific pre-tax discount rate of . 
 Impairment of goodwill 
 The Company evaluates its goodwill for impairment annually at December 31 or when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying value. Each operating mine is considered a distinct reporting unit for purposes of goodwill impairment testing. At December 31, 2022, the Company performed a quantitative goodwill test for all the reporting units in the North America and South America segments. Based on these tests, the Company concluded that Goodwill was impaired at the Porcupine reporting unit, in the North America segment, and the Cerro Negro reporting unit, in the South America

 , which represented the full goodwill balance of the reporting unit prior to impairment. The Cerro Negro goodwill impairment was driven by a country specific discount rate that reflects current macroeconomic risk and uncertainty in Argentina, and resulted in a non-cash impairment charge of , which represented the full goodwill balance of the reporting unit prior to impairment. The long-lived assets of Porcupine and Cerro Negro were evaluated for impairment prior to the quantitative goodwill test and impairment was identified. 
 The Company measured the impairments by comparing the total fair value of the existing operations to the corresponding reporting unit carrying value. The estimated fair value was determined using the income approach and is considered a non-recurring level 3 fair value measurement.

 Factors that Significantly Impact Effective Tax Rate (Other than Factors Described Separately Below) 
 Percentage depletion allowances (tax deductions for depletion that may exceed the tax basis in the mineral reserves) are available to the Company under the income tax laws of the United States for operations conducted in the United States or through branches and partnerships owned by U.S. subsidiaries included in the consolidated United States income tax return. These deductions are highly sensitive to the price of gold and other metals produced by the Company. 
 The Company operates in various jurisdictions around the world that have statutory tax rates that are significantly different than those of the U.S. These differences combine to move the overall effective tax rate higher than the U.S. statutory rate. 
 Mining taxes in Nevada, Mexico, Canada, Peru and Australia represent state and provincial taxes levied on mining operations and are classified as income taxes as such taxes are based on a percentage of mining profits. 
 In the U.S., capital losses may be carried forward five years to offset capital gains. Capital loss carryforwards of , , and , expired in 2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively. The Company carries a full valuation allowance on U.S. capital losses.

 These amounts reflect the classification and presentation that is reported for each tax jurisdiction in which the Company operates. 
 Valuation of Deferred Tax Assets 
 The Company assesses the available positive and negative evidence to estimate if sufficient future taxable income will be generated to utilize the existing deferred tax assets. A significant piece of objective negative evidence evaluated was the recent pretax losses and/or expectations of future pretax losses. Such objective evidence limits the ability to consider other subjective evidence such as our projections for future growth. On the basis of this evaluation, a new valuation allowance has been recorded in Argentina. However, the amount of the deferred tax asset considered realizable could be adjusted if estimates of future taxable income during the carryforward period are increased, if objective negative evidence in the form of cumulative losses is no longer present or if additional weight were given to subjective evidence such as our projections for growth. 
 During 2022, the Company recorded an increase to the valuation allowance of to tax expense, primarily driven by an addition in the U.S. relating to capital loss utilization, an increase in the Yanacocha reclamation obligation in Peru, and a new valuation allowance established in Argentina. This was partially offset by a release for expiration of foreign tax credit carryforwards. There were additional valuation allowance decreases related to other components of the financial statements of . 
 Refer to Note 2 for additional risk factors that could impact the Company s ability to realize the deferred tax assets.

 At December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020, , and , respectively, represent the amount of unrecognized tax benefits, inclusive of interest and penalties that, if recognized, would impact the Company s effective income tax rate. 
 The Company operates in numerous countries around the world and is subject to, and pays annual income taxes under, the various income tax regimes in the countries in which it operates. Some of these tax regimes are defined by contractual agreements with the local government, and others are defined by the general corporate income tax laws of the country. The Company has historically filed, and continues to file, all required income tax returns and paid the taxes reasonably determined to be due. The tax rules and regulations in many countries are highly complex and subject to interpretation. From time to time, the Company is subject to a review of its historic income tax filings and in connection with such reviews, disputes can arise with the taxing authorities over the interpretation or application of certain rules to the Company s business conducted within the country involved. 
 The Australian Taxation Office ATO is conducting a limited review of the Company s prior year tax returns. The ATO is reviewing an internal reorganization executed in 2011 when Newmont completed a restructure of the shareholding in the Company s Australian subsidiaries. To date, the Company has responded to inquiries from the ATO and provided them with supporting documentation for the transaction and the Company s associated tax positions. One aspect of the ATO review relates to an Australian capital gains tax that applies to sales or transfers of stock in certain types of entities. In the fourth quarter of 2017, the ATO notified the Company that it believes the 2011 reorganization is subject to capital gains tax of approximately (including interest and penalties). The Company disputes this conclusion and intends to vigorously defend its position that the transaction is not subject to this tax. In the fourth quarter of 2017, the Company made a payment to the ATO and lodged an Appeal with the Australian Federal Court to preserve its right to contest the ATO conclusions on this matter. The Company and the ATO continue to provide support to the Court for their respective positions and during the fourth quarter of 2022 the Court agreed that the Company has until 30 June 2023 to submit its final evidence. A provisional Court date has been set for the third quarter of 2024. 
 In the third quarter of 2022, the Administraci n Federal de Ingresos P blicos ("AFIP") in Argentina notified the Company that it completed the 2016 transfer pricing review. The AFIP has questioned the Company s treatment of intercompany loans and believes they should be akin to capital contributions. These intercompany loans are still in place. The Company disputes this position and continues to believe that the financing meets the qualifications of bona fide debt and intends to vigorously defend this position. To date, no final audit report or assessment has been provided by the AFIP. The matter will be closely monitored and evaluated as more information becomes available. 
 The Company and/or subsidiaries file income tax returns in the U.S. federal jurisdiction, and various state and foreign jurisdictions. With few exceptions, the Company is no longer subject to U.S. Federal, state and local, and non-U.S. income tax examinations by tax authorities for years before 2016. As a result of (i) statute of limitations that will begin to expire within the next 12 months in various jurisdictions, and (ii) possible settlements of audit-related issues with taxing authorities in various jurisdictions, the Company believes that it is reasonably possible that the total amount of its unrecognized income tax liability will decrease between and in the next 12 months. 
 The Company s practice is to recognize interest and/or penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits as part of Income and mining tax benefit (expense) . At December 31, 2022 and 2021, the total amount of accrued income-tax-related interest and penalties included in the Consolidated Balance Sheets was and , respectively. During 2022, 2021, and 2020 the Company released , and of interest and penalties, respectively, through the Consolidated Statements of Operations.

Projected benefit obligation Fair value of plan assets ____________________________ 
 (1) Information for other benefit plans with an accumulated benefit obligations in excess of plan assets has not been included as all of the other benefit plans are unfunded. 
 The significant assumptions used in measuring the Company s benefit obligation were mortality assumptions and discount rate. 
 The mortality assumptions used to measure the pension and other post retirement obligation incorporate future mortality improvements from tables published by the Society of Actuaries ("SOA"). The Company utilized the Pri-2012 mortality tables and the MP-2021 generational projection scale to measure the pension and other post retirement obligations as of December 31, 2021. In 2022, the SOA announced they would not release a new generational projection scale and instead updated the Mortality Improvement Model ("MIM") tool with the ability to optionally input mortality loads to model differing viewpoints of the ongoing effect of COVID. The Company utilized the Pri-2012 mortality tables and the MP-2021 generational projection scales, with no adjustment for COVID due to the Company not experiencing material mortality gain due to COVID, to measure the pension and other post retirement obligations as of December 31, 2022. 
 Yield curves matching the Company s benefit obligations were derived using a model based on high quality corporate bond data from Bloomberg. The model develops a discount rate by selecting a portfolio of high quality corporate bonds whose projected cash flows match the projected benefit payments of the plan. The resulting curves were used to identify a weighted average discount rate for the Company of and at December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively, based on the timing of future benefit payments. 
 Actuarial gains of and were recognized in the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively, primarily due to an increase in discount rate from the prior year. 
 Settlement accounting is required when annual lump sum payments exceed the annual interest and service costs for a plan and results in a remeasurement of the related pension benefit obligation and plan assets and the recognition of settlement charges in Other income (loss), net due to the acceleration of a portion of unrecognized actuarial losses. Lump sum payments are primarily made from the plan assets. Settlement accounting was triggered for the periods ended December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020 resulting in pension settlement charges of , and , respectively. 
 For the period ended December 31, 2022, pension settlement charges primarily resulted from the Company executing an annuitization to transfer a portion of the pension plan obligations from the Company's U.S. qualified defined benefit pension plans to an insurance company using plan assets during the first quarter of 2022. As a result, of the previously recognized pension obligations were transferred and settlement accounting was triggered which resulted in the recognition of a non-cash settlement loss of in Other income (loss), net. In December 2022, the Company received the final true-up from the insurance company for the annuitization, which had an inconsequential impact on the settlement.

 (1) Total benefit cost (income) and other comprehensive income (loss) for the Company's U.S. qualified defined benefit pension plan was remeasured due to the settlement accounting required from the retiree annuity purchase on March 25, 2022. The discount rate used for determining the Total benefit cost (income) and other comprehensive income (loss) reflected from January 1, 2022 through March 25, 2022 and from March 26, 2022 through December 31, 2022. 
 The expected long-term return on plan assets used for each period in the three years ended December 31, 2022 was determined based on an analysis of the asset returns over multiple time horizons for the Company s actual plan and for other comparable U.S. corporations. At December 31, 2022, Newmont has estimated the expected long-term return on plan assets to be which will be used in determining future net periodic benefit cost. The Company determines the long-term return on plan assets by considering the most recent capital market forecasts, the plans current asset allocation and the actual return on plan assets in comparison to the expected return on assets. The average actual return on plan assets during the years ended December 31, 2022 approximated . 
 Newmont has pension calculations for salaried U.S. employees. The first is a Final Average Pay pension calculation which pays a monthly amount to employees in retirement based, in part, on their highest eligible earnings and years of credited service. The second is the Stable Value calculation which is defined as a lump sum payment to employees upon retirement. The amount of the lump sum is the total of annual accruals based on the employee s eligible earnings and years of service. The benefits accrued under the Final Average Pay formula were frozen on June 30, 2014 for those eligible employees. Beginning July 1, 2014, all future accruals are based on the terms and features of the Stable Value calculation. 
 The pension plans employ an independent investment firm which invests the assets of the plans in certain approved funds that correspond to specific asset classes with associated target allocations. The goal of the pension fund investment program is to achieve prudent actuarial funding ratios while maintaining acceptable risk levels. The investment performance of the plans and that of the individual investment firms is measured against recognized market indices. The performance of the pension funds are monitored by an investment committee comprised of members of the Company s management, which is advised by an independent investment consultant. With the exception of global capital market economic risks, the Company has identified no significant portfolio risks associated to asset classes.

 In early 2015 and again in June 2017, the Peruvian government agency responsible for certain environmental regulations, the Ministry of the Environment MINAM ), issued proposed modifications to water quality criteria for designated beneficial uses which apply to mining companies, including Yanacocha. These criteria modified the in-stream water quality criteria pursuant to which Yanacocha has been designing water treatment processes and infrastructure. In December 2015, MINAM issued the final regulation that modified the water quality standards. These Peruvian regulations allow time to formulate a compliance plan and make any necessary changes to achieve compliance. 
 In February 2017, Yanacocha submitted a modification to its previously approved compliance achievement plan to the MINEM. The Company did not receive a response or comments to this submission until April 2021. During this interim period, Yanacocha separately submitted an Environmental Impact Assessment ("EIA") modification considering the ongoing operations and the projects to be developed and obtained authorization from MINEM for such projects. This authorization included a deadline for compliance with the modified water quality criteria by January 2024. In May 2022, Yanacocha submitted a proposed modification to this plan requesting an extension of time for coming into full compliance with the new regulations in 2027. In the event that MINEM does not grant Yanacocha an extension of the previously authorized timeline for, and agree to, the updated compliance achievement plan, fines and penalties relating to noncompliance may result beyond January 2024. 
 The Company currently operates water treatment plants at Yanacocha that have been and currently meet all currently applicable water discharge requirements. The Company is conducting detailed studies to better estimate water management and other closure activities that will ensure water quality and quantity discharge requirements, including the modifications promulgated by MINAM, as referenced above, will be met. This also includes performing a comprehensive update to the Yanacocha reclamation plan to address changes in closure activities and estimated closure costs while preserving optionality for potential future projects at Yanacocha. The Company's asset retirement obligation at December 31, 2022, included updates primarily to the expected construction of water treatment plants, a related increase in the annual operating costs over the extended closure period, and initial consideration of known risks (including the associated risk that these water treatment estimates could change in the future as more work is completed). These ongoing studies, which will extend beyond the current year, were progressed in 2022 as the study team continued to evaluate and revise assumptions and estimated costs of changes to the reclamation plan. While certain estimated costs remain subject to revision, in conjunction with the Company's annual 2022 update process for all asset retirement obligations, the Company recorded an increase of to the Yanacocha reclamation liability based on progress of the closure studies with a corresponding non-cash charge of recorded to reclamation expense related to portions of the site operations no longer in production with no expected substantive future economic value and recorded as a decrease to the asset retirement cost for producing areas of the operation. The annual 2022 update related primarily to higher capital costs for construction of the water treatment plants due to updated design considerations and recent inflation and supply chain disruptions on the estimated construction costs, as well as post-closure management costs. The ultimate construction costs of the two water treatment plants remains highly uncertain as ongoing study work and assessment of opportunities that incorporates the latest design considerations remain in progress. These and other additional risks and contingencies that are the subject of ongoing studies, including, but not limited to, a comprehensive review of the Company's tailings storage facility management, review of Yanacocha s water balance and storm water management system, and review of post-closure management costs, could result in future material increases to the reclamation obligation at Yanacocha. 
 Yanacocha experienced heavy rainfall in early 2022, above average historical levels, which resulted in significant water balance stress and required active emergency management. Yanacocha has been in communication with Organismo Evaluaci n y Fiscalizaci n Ambiental OEFA ), under MINAM, and local government regarding the emergency measures undertaken and contingency planning. Yanacocha was able to prevent any offsite release of untreated water, but did need to accumulate untreated water in mine pits. If accumulation in pits or other emergency measures are deemed a violation of existing permits, it could result in fines and penalties for unauthorized discharge. Such fines and penalties, if ultimately assessed, are currently unknown and otherwise cannot be reasonably estimated at this time. Extended periods of rainfall, more extreme storm events or increased overall rainfall beyond historical or planned levels may also result in flooding or stress of mine pits and maintenance and storage facilities (e.g., tailings water), unpermitted off-site discharges, delays to planned study work, increased cost related to water infrastructure adjustments and potential negative impacts to permitting and operations.

 Dawn Mining Company LLC Dawn - Newmont Owned 
 Midnite mine site and Dawn mill site . Dawn previously leased an open pit uranium mine, currently inactive, on the Spokane Indian Reservation in the State of Washington. The mine site is subject to regulation by agencies of the U.S. Department of Interior (the Bureau of Indian Affairs and the Bureau of Land Management), as well as the EPA. 
 As per the Consent Decree approved by the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Washington on January 17, 2012, the following actions were required of Newmont, Dawn, the Department of the Interior and the EPA: (i) Newmont and Dawn would design, construct and implement the cleanup plan selected by the EPA in 2006 for the Midnite mine site; (ii) Newmont and Dawn would reimburse the EPA for its past costs associated with overseeing the work; (iii) the Department of the Interior would contribute a lump sum amount toward past EPA costs and future costs related to the cleanup of the Midnite mine site; (iv) Newmont and Dawn would be responsible for all future EPA oversight costs and Midnite mine site cleanup costs; and (v) Newmont would post a surety bond for work at the site. 
 During 2012, the Department of Interior contributed its share of past EPA costs and future costs related to the cleanup of the Midnite mine site. In 2016, Newmont completed the remedial design process, with the exception of the new WTP design which was awaiting the approval of the new NPDES permit. Subsequently, the new NPDES permit was received in 2017 and the WTP design commenced in 2018. The EPA completed their assessment and approval of the WTP design in 2021 and Newmont has selected contractors for the construction of the new water treatment plant and effluent pipeline. Construction of the effluent pipeline began in 2021, and construction of the new WTP began in 2022. 
 The Dawn mill site is regulated by the Washington Department of Health and is in the process of being closed in accordance with the federal Uranium Mill Tailings Radiation Control Act, and associated Washington state regulations. Remediation at the Dawn mill site began in 2013. The Tailing Disposal Area 1-4 reclamation earthworks component was completed during 2017 with the embankment erosion protection completed in the second quarter of 2018. The remaining closure activities will consist primarily of finalizing an Alternative Concentration Limit application (the "ACL application") submitted in 2020 to the Washington Department of Health to address groundwater issues, and also evaporating the remaining balance of process water at the site. In the fourth quarter of 2022, the Washington Department of Health provided comments on the ACL application, which Newmont is evaluating and to which it will provide a response. 
 The remediation liability for the Midnite mine site and Dawn mill site is approximately , assumed by Newmont, at December 31, 2022.

A subsidiary of the Company has a retained royalty obligation Holt royalty obligation to Royal Gold, Inc. Royal Gold for production on the Holt-McDermott property. In August 2020, the Company and Kirkland signed a Strategic Alliance Agreement (the Kirkland Agreement ). As part of the Kirkland Agreement, the Company purchased an option (the Holt option for from Kirkland for the mining and mineral rights subject to the Holt royalty obligation. The Company has the right to exercise the Holt option and acquire ownership to the mineral interests subject to the Holt royalty obligation in the event Kirkland intends to resume operations and process material subject to the obligation. Kirkland has the right to assume the Company s Holt royalty obligation at any time, in which case the Holt option would terminate. 
 On August 16, 2021, International Royalty Corporation IRC ), a wholly-owned subsidiary of Royal Gold, filed an action in the Supreme Court of Nova Scotia against Newmont Corporation, Newmont Canada Corporation, Newmont Canada FN Holdings ULC (collectively "Newmont"), and certain Kirkland defendants (collectively "Kirkland"). IRC alleges the Kirkland Agreement is oppressive to the interests of Royal Gold under the Nova Scotia Companies Act and the Canada Business Corporations Act, and that, by entering into the Kirkland Agreement, Newmont breached its contractual obligations to Royal Gold. IRC seeks declaratory relief, and in alleged royalty payments that it claims Newmont expected to pay under the Holt royalty obligation, but for the Kirkland Agreement. Kirkland filed a motion seeking dismissal of the case against it, which the court granted in October 2022. Newmont submitted a demand for particulars on February 6, 2023. Newmont intends to vigorously defend this matter, but cannot reasonably predict the outcome.

 of NewWest Gold and an individual named Jacob Safra owned or controlled of NWG. Prior to its acquisition of NewWest Gold, Fronteer entered into a June 2007 lock-up agreement with NWG providing that, among other things, NWG would support Fronteer s acquisition of NewWest Gold. At that time, Fronteer owned approximately of Aurora Energy Resources Inc. Aurora ), which, among other things, had a uranium exploration project in Labrador, Canada. 
 NWG contends that, during the negotiations leading up to the lock-up agreement, Fronteer represented to NWG, among other things, that Aurora would commence uranium mining in Labrador by 2013, that this was a firm date, that Aurora faced no current environmental issues in Labrador and that Aurora s competitors faced delays in commencing uranium mining. NWG further contends that it entered into the lock-up agreement and agreed to support Fronteer s acquisition of NewWest Gold in reliance upon these purported representations. On October 11, 2007, less than three weeks after the Fronteer-NewWest Gold transaction closed, a member of the Nunatsiavut Assembly introduced a motion calling for the adoption of a moratorium on uranium mining in Labrador. On April 8, 2008, the Nunatsiavut Assembly adopted a moratorium on uranium mining in Labrador. NWG contends that Fronteer was aware during the negotiations of the NWG/Fronteer lock-up agreement that the Nunatsiavut Assembly planned on adopting this moratorium and that its adoption would preclude Aurora from commencing uranium mining by 2013, but Fronteer nonetheless fraudulently induced NWG to enter into the lock-up agreement. 
 On September 24, 2012, NWG served a summons and complaint on the Company, and then amended the complaint to add Newmont Canada Holdings ULC as a defendant. The complaint also named Fronteer Gold Inc. and Mark O Dea as defendants. The complaint sought rescission of the merger between Fronteer and NewWest Gold and in damages. In August 2013 the Supreme Court of New York, New York County issued an order granting the defendants motion to dismiss on forum non conveniens. Subsequently, NWG filed a notice of appeal of the decision and then a notice of dismissal of the appeal on March 24, 2014. 
 On February 26, 2014, NWG filed a lawsuit in Ontario Superior Court of Justice against Fronteer Gold Inc., Newmont Mining Corporation, Newmont Canada Holdings ULC, Newmont FH B.V. and Mark O Dea. The Ontario complaint is based upon substantially the same allegations contained in the New York lawsuit with claims for fraudulent and negligent misrepresentation. NWG seeks disgorgement of profits since the close of the NWG deal on September 24, 2007 and damages in the amount of C . Newmont, along with other defendants, served the plaintiff with its statement of defense on October 17, 2014. Newmont, along with the other defendants, filed a motion to dismiss based on delay on November 29, 2022. Newmont intends to vigorously defend this matter, but cannot reasonably predict the outcome. 
 Newmont Ghana Gold Limited and Newmont Golden Ridge Limited - Newmont Owned 
 On December 24, 2018, individual plaintiffs, who are members of the Ghana Parliament Plaintiffs ), filed a writ to invoke the original jurisdiction of the Supreme Court of Ghana. On January 16, 2019, Plaintiffs filed the Statement of Plaintiff s Case outlining the details of the Plaintiff s case and subsequently served Newmont Ghana Gold Limited NGGL and Newmont Golden Ridge Limited NGRL along with the other named defendants, the Attorney General of Ghana, the Minerals Commission of Ghana and other mining companies with interests in Ghana. The Plaintiffs allege that under article 268 of the 1992 Constitution of Ghana, the mining company defendants are not entitled to carry out any exploitation of minerals or other natural resources in Ghana, unless their respective transactions, contracts or concessions are ratified or exempted from ratification by the Parliament of Ghana. Newmont s current mining leases are both ratified by Parliament; NGGL June 13, 2001 mining lease, ratified by Parliament on October 21, 2008, and NGRL January 19, 2010 mining lease; ratified by Parliament on December 3, 2015. The writ alleges that any mineral exploitation prior to Parliamentary ratification is unconstitutional. The Plaintiffs seek several remedies including: (i) a declaration as to the meaning of constitutional language at issue; (ii) an injunction precluding exploitation of minerals for any mining company without prior Parliamentary ratification; (iii) a declaration that all revenue as a result of violation of the Constitution shall be accounted for and recovered via cash equivalent; and (iv) an order that the Attorney General and Minerals Commission submit all un-ratified mining leases, undertakings or contracts to Parliament for ratification. Newmont intends to vigorously defend this matter, but cannot reasonably predict the outcome. 
 Other Commitments and Contingencies 
 As part of its ongoing business and operations, the Company and its affiliates are required to provide surety bonds, bank letters of credit and bank guarantees as financial support for various purposes, including environmental remediation, reclamation, exploration permitting, workers compensation programs and other general corporate purposes. At December 31, 2022 and 2021, there were and , respectively, of outstanding letters of credit, surety bonds and bank guarantees. The obligations associated with these instruments are generally related to performance requirements that the Company addresses through its ongoing operations. As the specific requirements are met, the beneficiary of the associated instrument cancels and/or returns the instrument to the issuing entity. Certain of these instruments are associated with operating sites with long-lived assets and will remain outstanding until closure. Generally, bonding requirements associated with environmental regulation are becoming more restrictive. However, the Company believes it is in compliance with all applicable bonding obligations and will be able to satisfy future bonding requirements through existing or alternative means, as they arise.

 Management s Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting 
 The management of the Company is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting. Internal control over financial reporting is a process designed by, or under the supervision of, the Company s principal executive and principal financial officers and effected by the Company s Board of Directors, management and other personnel, to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with GAAP. Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. 
 The Company s management assessed the effectiveness of the Company s internal control over financial reporting at December 31, 2022. In making this assessment, the Company s management used the criteria set forth by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO) in Internal Control-Integrated Framework 2013. Based upon its assessment, management concluded that, at December 31, 2022, the Company s internal control over financial reporting was effective. 
 As permitted by the SEC Staff interpretive guidance for proportionately consolidated entities, the Company s management excluded NGM from its assessment of internal control over financial reporting at December 31, 2022, as management does not have the ability to dictate, modify or assess the controls at NGM. The Company has implemented internal controls over financial reporting for recognizing its proportionate share of the assets, liabilities, and operations of NGM. Refer to Item 8 "Financial Statements and Supplementary Data" for NGM's "Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm" for Opinion on the Financial Statements and Internal Controls over Financial Reporting. 
 NGM represented 19 of the Company s consolidated Total assets at December 31, 2022, while its Sales comprised 18 of the Company s consolidated sales for the year ended December 31, 2022.

 REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM 
 To the Board of Directors and Stockholders of Newmont Corporation 
 Opinion on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting 
 We have audited Newmont Corporation s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2022, based on criteria established in Internal Control Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission 2013 framework (the COSO criteria). In our opinion, Newmont Corporation (the Company), based on our audit and the report of other auditors, maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2022, based on the COSO criteria. 
 We did not examine the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting of Nevada Gold Mines LLC, a 38.5 owned investment which is proportionately consolidated, whose financial statements reflect total assets and sales constituting 19 and 18 , respectively, of the related consolidated financial statement amounts as of and for the year ended December 31, 2022. The effectiveness of Nevada Gold Mines LLC s internal control over financial reporting was audited by other auditors whose report has been furnished to us, and our opinion, insofar as it relates to the effectiveness of Nevada Gold Mines LLC s internal control over financial reporting, is based solely on the report of the other auditors. 
 We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), the consolidated balance sheets of the Company as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, the related consolidated statements of operations, comprehensive income (loss), changes in equity and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2022, the related notes and financial statement schedule in Item 15(a)(2) and our report dated February 23, 2023 expressed an unqualified opinion thereon, based on our audit and the report of the other auditors. 
 Basis for Opinion 
 The Company s management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting included in the accompanying Management s Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company s internal control over financial reporting based on our audit and the report of the other auditors. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. 
 We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. 
 Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk, and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit and the report of other auditors provides a reasonable basis for our opinion. 
 Definition and Limitations of Internal Control Over Financial Reporting 
 A company s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements. 
 Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

The following is a summary of the material terms of our capital stock. For additional information regarding our capital stock, please refer to the applicable provisions of the DGCL, our Certificate of Incorporation and our By-Laws. 
 
 At December 31, 2022, we had 1,285,000,000 shares of authorized capital stock. Those shares consisted of

 Holders of our Common Stock may receive dividends when, as and if declared by our Board of Directors out of funds of Newmont legally available for the payment of dividends. Subject to the terms of any outstanding preferred stock, holders of our Common Stock may not receive dividends until we have satisfied our obligations to any holders of our preferred stock. 
 
 As a Delaware corporation, we may pay dividends out of our surplus capital or, if there is no surplus capital, out of our net profits for the fiscal year in which a dividend is declared and or the preceding fiscal year. Section 170 of the DGCL also provides that dividends may not be paid out of net profits if, after the payment of the dividend, capital is less than the capital represented by the outstanding stock of all classes having a preference upon the distribution of assets. 
 
 Currently, we pay dividends on our Common Stock each quarter. The declaration and payment of future dividends remains at the discretion of the Board of Directors and will depend on the Company's financial results, cash requirements, future prospects and other factors deemed relevant by the Board of Directors.

 Written notice of a meeting of our stockholders is given personally, by mail, or other means of electronic transmission not less than 10 days nor more than 60 days before the date on which the meeting is held, to each stockholder of record entitled to vote at the meeting. The notice must state the time, place and purposes of the meeting. In the event of a special meeting called upon the written request of our stockholders, the notice will describe any business set forth in the statement of purpose in the written stockholder request, as well as any additional business that our Board of Directors proposes to be conducted at the meeting. If mailed, the notice will be sent to our stockholders at their respective addresses appearing on our stock records or to such other addresses as they may designate in writing, and will be deemed given when mailed. A waiver of any notice, in writing by a stockholder or by electronic transmission given by the person or persons entitled to such notice before or after the time for the meeting, will be deemed equivalent to that stockholder having received the notice.

Our Board of Directors is not classified. Directors are to be elected by a majority of the votes cast by stockholders entitled to vote thereon at a duly held meeting of stockholders at which a quorum is present, and our stockholders do not have the right to cumulate their votes in the election of directors. 
 
 Liquidation

 Exhibit 95 

Mine Safety Disclosure 
 The following disclosures are provided pursuant to the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (the Act and Item 104 of Regulation S-K, which require certain disclosures by companies required to file periodic reports under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, that operate mines regulated under the Federal Mine Safety and Health Act of 1977 (the Mine Act ). The disclosures reflect our U.S. mining operations only as the requirements of the Act and Item 104 of Regulation S-K do not apply to our mines operated outside the United States. 
 Mine Safety Information. Whenever the Federal Mine Safety and Health Administration MSHA believes a violation of the Mine Act, any health or safety standard or any regulation has occurred, it may issue a citation which describes the alleged violation and fixes a time within which the U.S. mining operator (e.g. our subsidiary, Newmont USA Limited) must abate the alleged violation. In some situations, such as when MSHA believes that conditions pose a hazard to miners, MSHA may issue an order removing miners from the area of the mine affected by the condition until the alleged hazards are corrected. When MSHA issues a citation or order, it generally proposes a civil penalty, or fine, as a result of the alleged violation, that the operator is ordered to pay. Citations and orders can be contested and appealed, and as part of that process, are often reduced in severity and amount, and are sometimes dismissed. The number of citations, orders and proposed assessments vary depending on the size and type (underground or surface) of the mine as well as by the MSHA inspector(s) assigned. In addition to civil penalties, the Mine Act also provides for criminal penalties for an operator who willfully violates a health or safety standard or knowingly violates or fails or refuses to comply with an order issued under Section 107(a) or any final decision issued under the Act. 
 
 The below table reflects citations and orders issued to us by MSHA during the year ended December 31, 2022. The proposed assessments for the year ended December 31, 2022 were taken from the MSHA data retrieval system as of January 9, 2023. 
 Additional information about the Act and MSHA references used in the table follows. 
 Section 104(a) Significant and Substantial S Citations Citations received from MSHA under section 104(a) of the Mine Act for violations of mandatory health or safety standards that could significantly and substantially contribute to the cause and effect of a mine safety or health hazard. 
 Section 104(b) Orders Orders issued by MSHA under section 104(b) of the Mine Act, which represents a failure to abate a citation under section 104(a) within the period of time prescribed by MSHA. This results in an order of immediate withdrawal from the area of the mine affected by the condition until MSHA determines that the violation has been abated. 
 Section 104(d) S&S Citations and Orders Citations and orders issued by MSHA under section 104(d) of the Mine Act for unwarrantable failure to comply with mandatory, significant and substantial health or safety standards. 
 Section 110(b)(2) Violations Flagrant violations issued by MSHA under section 110(b)(2) of the Mine Act. 
 Section 107(a) Orders Orders issued by MSHA under section 107(a) of the Mine Act for situations in which MSHA determined an imminent danger (as defined by MSHA) existed. Mine (1)

MSHA assigns an identification number to each mine and may or may not assign separate identification numbers to related facilities such as preparation facilities. We are providing the information in the table by mine rather than MSHA identification number because that is how we manage and operate our mining business and we believe this presentation will be more useful to investors than providing information based on MSHA identification numbers.

Proposed assessments amounted to 6,822. 
 Pattern or Potential Pattern of Violations . During the year ended December 31, 2022, none of the mines operated by us received written notice from MSHA of (a) a pattern of violations of mandatory health or safety standards that are of such nature as could have significantly and substantially contributed to the cause and effect of mine health or safety hazards under section 104(e) of the Mine Act or (b) the potential to have such a pattern. 
 Pending Legal Actions . The following table reflects pending legal actions before the Federal Mine Safety and Health Review Commission (the Commission ), an independent adjudicative agency that provides administrative trial and appellate review of legal disputes arising under the Mine Act, as of December 31, 2022, together with the number of legal actions instituted and the number of legal actions resolved during the year ended December 31, 2022.

The number of legal actions noted above are reported on a per docket basis. 
 Legal actions pending before the Commission may involve, among other questions, challenges by operators to citations, orders and penalties they have received from MSHA or complaints of discrimination by miners under section 105 of the Mine Act. The following is a brief description of the types of legal actions that may be brought before the Commission. 
 Contests of Citations and Orders A contest proceeding may be filed with the Commission by operators, miners or miners representatives to challenge the issuance of a citation or order issued by MSHA. 
 Contests of Proposed Penalties (Petitions for Assessment of Penalties) A contest of a proposed penalty is an administrative proceeding before the Commission challenging a civil penalty that MSHA has proposed for the alleged violation contained in a citation or order. The validity of the citation may also be challenged in this proceeding as well. 
 Complaints for Compensation A complaint for compensation may be filed with the Commission by miners entitled to compensation when a mine is closed by certain withdrawal orders issued by MSHA. The purpose of the proceeding is to determine the amount of compensation, if any, due miners idled by the orders. 
 Complaints of Discharge, Discrimination or Interference A discrimination proceeding is a case that involves a miner s allegation that he or she has suffered a wrong by the operator because he or she engaged in some type of activity protected under the Mine Act, such as making a safety complaint. 
 Applications for Temporary Relief An application for temporary relief from any modification or termination of any order or from any order issued under section 104 of the Mine Act. 
 Appeals of Judges Decisions or Orders to the Commission A filing with the Commission of a petition for discretionary review of a Judge s decision or order by a person who has been adversely affected or aggrieved by such decision or order.

Pueblo Viejo Operations 
 Dominican Republic 
 Technical Report Summary 
 Report current as of 
 December 31, 2022 
 Qualified Person 
 Mr. Donald Doe, RM SME. 

Pueblo Viejo Operations 
 Dominican Republic 
 Technical Report Summary 

NOTE REGARDING FORWARD-LOOKING INFORMATION 
 This Technical Report Summary contains forward-looking statements within the meaning of the U.S. Securities Act of 1933 and the U.S. Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (and the equivalent under Canadian securities laws), that are intended to be covered by the safe harbor created by such sections. Such forward-looking statements include, without limitation, statements regarding Newmont s expectation for its mines and any related development or expansions, including estimated cashflows, production, revenue, EBITDA, costs, taxes, capital, rates of return, mine plans, material mined and processed, recoveries and grade, future mineralization, future adjustments and sensitivities and other statements that are not historical facts. 
 Forward-looking statements address activities, events, or developments that Newmont expects or anticipates will or may occur in the future and are based on current expectations and assumptions. Additionally, forward-looking statements regarding Pueblo Viejo are based largely upon information provided by the Operator, Barrick, to Newmont. Although Newmont s management believes that its expectations are based on reasonable assumptions, it can give no assurance that these expectations will prove correct. Such assumptions, include, but are not limited to (i) there being no significant change to current geotechnical, metallurgical, hydrological and other physical conditions (ii) permitting, development, operations and expansion of operations and projects being consistent with current expectations and mine plans, including, without limitation, receipt of export approvals (iii) political developments in any jurisdiction in which Newmont operates being consistent with its current expectations (iv) certain exchange rate assumptions being approximately consistent with current levels (v) certain price assumptions for gold, silver, and oil (vi) prices for key supplies being approximately consistent with current levels and (vii) other planning assumptions. 
 Important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those in the forward-looking statements include, among others, risks that estimates of mineral reserves and mineral resources are uncertain and the volume and grade of ore actually recovered may vary from our estimates, risks relating to fluctuations in metal prices risks due to the inherently hazardous nature of mining-related activities risks related to the jurisdictions in which we operate, uncertainties due to health and safety considerations, including COVID-19 and related variants, uncertainties related to environmental considerations, including, without limitation, climate change, uncertainties relating to obtaining approvals and permits, including renewals, from governmental regulatory authorities and uncertainties related to changes in law as well as those factors discussed in Newmont s filings with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), including Newmont s latest Annual Report on Form 10-K for the period ended December 31, 2022, to which this technical report summary is an exhibit. 
 Newmont does not undertake any obligation to release publicly revisions to any forward-looking statement, including, without limitation, outlook, to reflect events or circumstances after the date of this document, or to reflect the occurrence of unanticipated events, except as may be required under applicable securities laws. Investors should not assume that any lack of update to a previously issued forward-looking statement constitutes a reaffirmation of that statement. Continued reliance on forward-looking statements is at investors own risk.

Pueblo Viejo Operations 
 Dominican Republic 
 Technical Report Summary 

1.0 SUMMARY 
 
 1.1 Introduction 
 This technical report summary (the Report) was prepared for Newmont Corporation (Newmont) on the Pueblo Viejo Operations (Pueblo Viejo Operations or the Project) located in the province of Sanchez Ramirez in the Dominican Republic. 
 The operating entity is the joint venture (JV) company Pueblo Viejo Dominicana Jersey 2 Limited (PVDJ2 formerly Pueblo Viejo Dominicana Corporation), in which Barrick Gold Corporation (Barrick) holds a 60 interest and is Project operator, and Newmont holds a 40 interest. 
 The Pueblo Viejo Operations contain the Monte Negro, Moore, and Cumba zones within the Pueblo Viejo deposit. Open pit mining commenced in 2010, and commercial production was reached during 2013. The open pit operation feeds a conventional pressure oxidation (POX) circuit followed by a carbon-in-leach (CIL) process. 
 
 1.2 Terms of Reference 
 The Report was prepared to be attached as an exhibit to support mineral property disclosure, including mineral resource and mineral reserve estimates, for the Pueblo Viejo Operations in Newmont s Form 10-K for the year ending December 31, 2022. 
 Information in the Report, as provided to Newmont by Barrick and PVDJ2, is current as at December 31, 2022. 
 Mineral resources and mineral reserves are reported for the Monte Negro, Moore and Cumba zones. Mineral resources and mineral reserves are also estimated for material in stockpiles. 
 Mineral resources and mineral reserves are reported using the definitions in Regulation S K 1300 (SK1300), under Item 1300. 
 All measurement units used in this Report are metric unless otherwise noted, and currency is expressed in United States dollars (US as identified in the text. The currency of the Dominican Republic is the Dominican peso (D ). Unless otherwise indicated, all financial values are reported in US including all operating costs, capital costs, cash flows, taxes, revenues, expenses, and overhead distributions. 
 The Report uses US English. 
 
 1.3 Property Setting 
 The Pueblo Viejo Operations are situated 100 km northwest of the capital city of Santo Domingo, and 15 km west of Cotu , the provincial capital of Sanchez Ramirez. 
 Access from Santo Domingo is by a four lane, paved highway (Autopista Duarte, Highway #1) that is the main route between Santo Domingo and the second largest city, Santiago. This highway connects to a secondary highway, #17, at the town of Piedra Blanca, approximately 78 km from Santo Domingo. This secondary highway is a two-lane, paved highway that passes through the towns of Maimon, Palo de Cuaba, and La Cabirma on the way to Cotu . The

Pueblo Viejo Operations 
 Dominican Republic 
 Technical Report Summary 

gatehouse for the Pueblo Viejo Operations is approximately 22 km from Piedra Blanca and approximately 6.5 km from Palo de Cuaba. 
 The Dominican Republic has a tropical climate with little fluctuation in seasonal temperatures. Mining operations are conducted year-round. 
 The city of Santo Domingo is the principal source of supply for the operations. Workers typically live in the surrounding communities. 
 The Pueblo Viejo Operations are located in the eastern portion of the Cordillera Central where local topography ranges from 565 m at Loma Cuaba to approximately 65 m at the Hatillo Reservoir. Two watercourses run through the concession, the Rio Margajita and the Rio Maguaca. The Rio Margajita drains into the Rio Yuna upstream from the Hatillo Reservoir while the Rio Maguaca joins the Rio Yuna below the Hatillo Reservoir. The flows of both watercourses vary substantially during rainstorms. There is little primary vegetation within the general area of the Pueblo Viejo Operations, largely due to agricultural and mining activities. 
 Earthquakes are a risk as the island of Hispaniola is in a seismically-active zone. 
 
 1.4 Ownership 
 Newmont currently holds a 40 Project interest. The remaining 60 interest is held by Barrick, the Project operator. The in-country joint venture operating entity is Pueblo Viejo Dominicana Jersey 2 Limited. 
 
 1.5 Mineral Tenure, Surface Rights, Water Rights, Royalties and Agreements 
 Mineral tenure is leased from the Dominican government though the 7,995 ha Montenegro Fiscal Reserve. Fiscal reserves are mining areas of interest to the government that are established for exploitation by way of special contracts that may differ from the terms and conditions imposed on exploitation concessions. Mining rights in such reserves are won through a public bidding process. 
 Pueblo Viejo Dominicana Jersey 2 Limited can operate the Project by means of a Special Lease Agreement of Mining Rights, as amended, granted in 2002. The Special Lease Agreement governs the development and operation of the mine. It granted Pueblo Viejo Dominicana Jersey 2 Limited the right to operate for a 25-year period, which commenced on February 26, 2008, when Pueblo Viejo Dominicana Jersey 2 Limited provided the Dominican government with a Project Notice, and a completed feasibility study. 
 The lease on the Montenegro Fiscal Reserve can be renewed by Pueblo Viejo Dominicana Jersey 2 Limited for a further 25-year term, at its sole election. At the completion of the second term, the Special Lease Agreement provides for another 25-year extension however, this extension must be by mutual agreement between the government and Pueblo Viejo Dominicana Jersey 2 Limited. 
 Key items within the Special Lease Agreement include 
 Limestone deposits within the Montenegro Fiscal Reserve can be exploited with no additional charges

Pueblo Viejo Operations 
 Dominican Republic 
 Technical Report Summary 

The Dominican government will provide a permanent and reliable source of water to support operations 
 The Dominican government will lease to Pueblo Viejo Dominicana Jersey 2 Limited the lands and mineral rights needed to allow tailings and waste disposal 
 The Dominican government will remediate all historical disturbances other than those within areas designated for development by Pueblo Viejo Dominicana Jersey 2 Limited 
 A net smelter return (NSR) royalty of 3.2 of net receipts of sales is payable to the Dominican government 
 A net profits interest payment that is based on the gold price will be paid once Pueblo Viejo Dominicana Jersey 2 Limited has reached an initial rate of return of 10 . Once this rate has been reached, the net profits interest payable to the Dominican government will increase to 28.75 
 Income tax payments are subject to a stabilized tax regime, and an annual minimum tax rate. The annual minimum tax is only applicable when there is a positive difference between the product of the applicable annual minimum tax rate (which varies with the price of gold) multiplied by gross receipts and the sum of the net profits interest and income tax for a particular year. 
 The Pueblo Viejo joint venture is governed pursuant to a shareholder s agreement, effective as of August 23, 2012, and as amended as of January 23, 2020, between Barrick and the Newmont and their wholly-owned subsidiaries party thereto (JV Agreement). Under the terms of the JV Agreement, Newmont holds a 40 economic interest and Barrick holds a 60 economic interest. Barrick operates the joint venture with overall management responsibility and is subject to the supervision and direction of the joint venture s Board, which is comprised of five directors, three appointed by Barrick and two appointed by Newmont. Outside of certain prescribed matters, decisions of the Board are determined by a majority vote. Newmont also has representatives on the joint venture s advisory committees, including its advisory technical and finance committees. 
 The grant of the Special Lease Agreement provides the operations with surface rights for the current mining operations. The planned Naranjo tailings storage facility (TSF) required that PVDJ2 obtain surface rights in the planned facility location, and will require completion of a resettlement program. The Dominican government granted a decree to PVDJ2 to include the Naranjo TSF within the Montenegro Fiscal Reserve. The decree grants the mineral rights in the Naranjo TSF area to PVDJ2 however, surface rights for the Naranjo TSF remain to be secured. The Dominican government has granted surface rights for construction and operation of a water pipeline. 
 Under the water agreement with the National Water Resources Institute, PVDJ2 is responsible for construction and maintenance of water-related infrastructure such as pumps and pipelines. PVDJ2 also makes an annual payment of D 1.5 M (indexed to inflation) for water-related studies. 
 
 1.6 Geology and Mineralization 
 The Pueblo Viejo deposit area is considered to be an example of a high-sulfidation epithermal deposit. 
 Date February 2023 Page 1-3 

Pueblo Viejo Operations 
 Dominican Republic 
 Technical Report Summary 

The deposit is hosted in a portion of a Lower Cretaceous intra-oceanic island arc with bimodal volcanism that forms the base of the Greater Antilles Caribbean islands. In the Project area, the arc is primarily represented by the Los Ranchos Formation. The Hatillo Formation, consisting of limestones, is overthrust onto the Los Ranchos Formation to the southwest of the Pueblo Viejo deposit area. The Lagunas Formation, a fore-arc basin assemblage, overlies the Hatillo Formation, and crops out to the south of the Project area. The geology and tectonic evolution of the island of Hispaniola includes a thrust-bound fragment of the ocean floor comprising peridotite, which has been interpreted as a dismembered part of an ophiolite suite. An obduction process affecting the ocean floor was responsible for the metamorphism of rocks that belong to the Maimon Formation. 
 Mineralization is hosted in the Los Ranchos Formation, which in the Project area, is subdivided into three facies, consisting of a sedimentary facies (carbonaceous sediments), a quartz-bearing facies (epiclastic lithologies and volcanoclastic rocks), and an andesitic facies (extrusive intermediate composition volcanic rocks). 
 The major structural unit in the Pueblo Viejo deposit is the northeasterly-trending Monte Oculto fault that separates the Monte Negro and Moore pits, and has an approximate throw of about 100 m. 
 All lithologies display argillic alteration. Mineralization events are strongly related to the alteration sequence with disseminated pyrite occurring in an early event and sulfide veinlets occurring in a later event. Pyrite is the primary sulfide. Minor constituents can include sphalerite, local enargite and minor amounts of barite, rutile, telluride, and Pb-sulfides. Sphalerite and enargite (with antimony replacing arsenic) are present with pyrite, primarily as veins or filling fractures. 
 
 1.7 History 
 Exploration prior to the enactment of the joint venture was completed by Rosario Resources Corporation (Rosario Resources), Rosario Dominicana S.A. (Rosario Dominicana), Newmont, Genel JV, Mount Isa Mines and Placer Dome Inc. (Placer Dome) Placer Dome Dominicana Corporation. Work completed included geological and structural mapping, surface geochemical sampling, induced polarization ground geophysical surveys, core drilling, mining studies, metallurgical testwork, evaluation of refractory ore milling technologies, environmental studies, socio-economic evaluation, financial analysis, and mineral resource and mineral reserve estimation. Rosario Dominicana mined the deposit via open pit methods in 1975. Mining ceased with the depletion of oxide mineralization in 1991. 
 In March 2006, Barrick acquired Placer Dome and, in May 2006, amalgamated the companies. At the same time, Barrick sold a 40 stake in the then Pueblo Viejo project to Goldcorp Inc. Goldcorp was subsequently acquired by Newmont. The joint venture commenced mining operations in 2013. PVDJ2 has undertaken geological and structural mapping, surface geochemical sampling, core and reverse circulation (RC) drilling, mining studies, metallurgical testwork, and mineral resource and mineral reserve estimation. Studies are underway to support a Project expansion that was in progress at year-end 2022.

 Technical Report Summary 

1.8 Drilling and Sampling 
 
 1.8.1 Drilling 
 Drilling to December 31, 2022 totals 2,101 core (336,360 m), 343 percussion (8,706 m), 1,830 RC (290,098 m) and 2,130 rotary air blast (RAB) (85,979 m) drill holes. Grade control RC drilling totals 24,146 holes for 1,042,916 m. Drilling that supports mineral resource and mineral reserve estimation totals 1,311 core (279,602 m), and 1,009 RC (145,660 m) drill holes. Grade control RC drilling used in the estimate totals 22,801 holes for 980,581 m. Drill types other than RC and core are not used in estimation. Selected core and RC drill holes may be excluded for issues such as topographic, collar, downhole, and logging or analytical inconsistencies. In addition, drilling completed since May 17, 2022 was not used in mineral resource estimation. 
 Core recovery is typically good, averaging about 90 . Areas that can cause poor recoveries include weathering horizons. 
 The type of instrumentation used for surveying collar locations is not documented for the Rosario Dominicana or MIM campaigns. The Placer and Genel JV program drill collar locations were surveyed using global positioning system (GPS) instruments. There is no information as to any down hole surveys that may have been performed for the Rosario Dominicana and MIM campaigns. The Genel JV drill holes were surveyed, but there is no information as to the instrumentation used. The Placer Dome campaigns drill holes were down-hole surveyed at 60 75 m intervals using a Sperry Sun instrument, and azimuth readings were corrected to true north by subtracting 10 . All PVDJ2 drill hole collar locations are surveyed with high precision GPS instruments. Downhole surveys are taken using a Reflex Gyro instrument. 
 
 1.8.2 Hydrogeology 
 Surface and ground water monitoring are routinely conducted, with samples, depending on what is being monitored, that can be taken on daily, weekly, monthly, quarterly, or annual intervals. Samples are sent to ALS Dominicana S.A.S., located in Santo Domingo (ALS Dominicana) for analysis. Parameters tested include physical and chemical Organic, inorganic, dissolved metals, total metals, hydrocarbon. The laboratory holds ISO 17025 accreditations for selected analytical techniques. 
 Dewatering is undertaken to monitor pore pressure and phreatic water surfaces behind the pit slopes. Hydrogeological unit models were developed in 2021 in support of slope stability assessments, and were annually updated based on available vibrating wire piezometer data. Several studies between 2004 and 2018 by Piteau Associates and Schlumberger reviewed hydraulic parameters using pumping tests, packer tests, Lefranc tests, falling head tests, evaluation of historical response of vibrating wire piezometers and open piezometers during the day-to-day operation of dewatering wells, measurement of the flow from horizontal drains and reconciliation of the flow with the structural and lithological models. 
 In 2022, the first numerical groundwater model was developed by SRK Consulting considering all available data and was calibrated using over 10 years of mine development progression and monitoring data. It has validated the hydrogeological unit models, and will be updated further to provide guidance on optimal locations for pumping wells.

 Technical Report Summary 

1.8.3 Geotechnical 
 Geotechnical drilling was completed in support of infrastructure locations and in support of pit designs. The most recent geotechnical rock mass model was developed in 2021, and included a review of slope performance history and incorporation of learnings from instabilities on interim pit slopes. The majority of the sampling and the laboratory determinations were performed at the operations by PVDJ2 personnel. There is no system for accreditation of geotechnical laboratories. 
 The geological hard rock setting at the Pueblo Viejo Operations is well understood and displays reasonable consistency in the various open pits located on site. Additional testing continues to confirm the consistency of material strengths and parameters. 
 To the Report date, the geotechnical data collection programs have provided data suitable for use in the mining operations, and have supported the assumptions used in the active operations. 
 
 1.8.4 Sampling and Assay 
 Reverse circulation, core, and grade control drill holes were generally sampled on 2 m intervals. 
 Density (specific gravity) determinations were typically performed using water displacement methods. Density is considered under sampled. PVDJ2 advised Newmont that a program to increase density coverage is under way. 
 Placer Dome used ALS Chemex Laboratories Ltd., Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada (ALS Chemex) as the primary laboratory. ALS Chemex was ISO 9001 2008 and ISO 17025 2005 accredited for selected analytical techniques, and was independent of Placer Dome. PVDJ2 has used the non-independent Pueblo Viejo Assay Laboratory as the primary laboratory. This laboratory holds ISO 17025 2005 accreditations for selected analytical techniques. ACME (accreditations unknown) was used as an independent umpire laboratory by Placer Dome. 
 ALS Chemex crushed samples to 2 mm and pulverized to 200 mesh. Samples were assayed for gold and silver using a 30 g fire assay, with a gravimetric finish (methods Au-GRA21 and Ag-GRA21) copper, zinc and iron using an ore grade assay, aqua regia digestion, and an atomic absorption finish (method AA46) total carbon, LECO furnace (method C-IR07) total sulfur, LECO furnace (method C-IR07) multi-element analysis was performed on 80 samples from drill hole PD02-003 using a four acid digestion followed by ICP-MS (method ME-MS61). In 2004, every other sample from all drill holes was also analyzed using ME-MS41. 
 The Pueblo Viejo Assay Laboratory crushed to 2 mm (10 #), and pulverized to 85 passing 75 m (200 #). Samples were assayed for gold and silver using a fire assay, with a gravimetric finish, for copper and zinc using an ore grade assay, aqua regia digestion, and an atomic absorption finish, and total carbon and total sulfur using an ELTRA analyzer. 
 
 1.8.5 Quality Assurance and Quality Control 
 Insertion frequencies of QA QC materials has varied over the course of the exploration and resource drilling programs. Earlier programs included submission of two blank, two standard and two core duplicate samples into each 75-sample batch sent to ALS Chemex. This was later modified to two blanks, three standards (commercial and custom), two half-core duplicates, two

Pueblo Viejo Operations 
 Dominican Republic 
 Technical Report Summary 

coarse duplicates and seven cleaning blanks in each 76-sample batch sent to ACME. Currently, three standards, three field duplicates, and two coarse blanks are inserted into each batch of 60 samples. 
 Monitoring is completed on a batch-by-batch basis. For check samples that fell outside of the established control limits, the cause is reviewed, and, if found not to be result of a sample number switch, the relevant batch was re-assayed. Corrective actions taken are detailed through notes in the in-house resource database and supporting documentation. 
 
 1.9 Data Verification 
 The subset of the data that is used in mineral resource estimation is subject to a number of checks by PVDJ2 personnel using electronic data scripts and triggers. 
 Data verification was performed by external consultants in support of mine development and operations. No material issues were identified in the reviews. 
 Observations made during the QP s site visit, in conjunction with discussions with site-based technical staff also support the geological interpretations, and analytical and database quality. The QP s personal inspection supports the use of the data in mineral resource and mineral reserve estimation, and in mine planning. 
 
 1.10 Metallurgical Testwork 
 Metallurgical testwork in support of the original plant design was conducted by a number of independent laboratories or testwork facilities, including AMTEL, A.R. MacPherson Consultants Ltd., Outokumpu Technology Canada, Canadian Environmental & Metallurgical Inc., SGS Lakefield Research, CyPlus GmbH, the University of British Columbia, and SGS MinnovEX. The Barrick Technology Centre, formerly the Placer Dome Technology Centre, which is not independent, has also undertaken testwork. 
 Work completed in support of the process plant design included comminution, whole ore pressure oxidation, CIL, cyanide destruction, neutralization, iron removal, and pilot plant tests. Samples selected for metallurgical testing during feasibility and development studies were representative of the various types and styles of mineralization within the deposit. Samples were selected from a range of locations within the deposit zones. Sufficient samples were taken so that tests were performed on sufficient sample mass. 
 The process plant expansion project entails supplementary milling, a new flotation circuit, modifications to the existing autoclaves to cater for a greater sulfide feed plus additional oxygen generating capacity and finally several enhancements or additions to the downstream circuits to be able to cater for this increase in capacity. The process plant expansion project is currently in the commissioning phase. 
 Testwork in support of the proposed mine expansion was completed by the following independent laboratories McClelland Laboratories (bio-oxidation), Core Metallurgy Pty Ltd (Albion process optimization), Blue Coast Research Ltd (flotation variability and optimization), AuTec (mineralogy), ALS Metallurgy Kamloops (comminution), Bureau Veritas Metallurgy with Starkey and Associates (semi-autogenous grind (SAG) testing), SGS Lakefield (float, atmospheric pre-oxidation, POX, CIL variability), FLSmidth Minerals Testing and Research Center (POX and mineralogy variability), and University of Toronto, CERCL Ltd (microbial

characterization). Barrick s Las Lagunas site laboratory, which is not independent, generated the testwork samples. 
 The stockpile materials tested for the process plant expansion project were considered to represent the variation that was found in the stockpile in terms of gold, silver, copper and sulfide. 
 The recovery curves and formula have been updated since the initial feasibility study and indicate a reasonable correlation between prediction and actual results. 
 Forecast average life-of-mine recoveries for the expanded process plant are approximately 90 for gold and 65 for silver. 
 There are no deleterious elements from a processing perspective. Elements such as total carbon, organic carbon, total sulfur, and sulfide sulfur are managed using blending. 
 
 1.11 Mineral Resource Estimation 
 
 1.11.1 Estimation Methodology 
 Geological (lithology, structural and alteration) models were constructed using Leapfrog geological modeling software. Block models were built using Vulcan software with cell dimensions that were appropriate to the deposit style, orientation and dimensions of the mineralization. Selectivity during mining, mining method, equipment size and bench height were also taken into account when determining the parent cell size of 10 x 10 x 10 m. Two sub-blocks were used to better represent volumes of thin, high-grade mineralization, one at 5 x 5 x 5 m, the second at 2.5 x 2.5 x 2.5 m. The block model encompasses the Monte Negro, Moore, and Cumba zones. 
 Alteration was determined to be the main driver for the gold, silver, copper and total sulfur domains, with only minor influence from lithology. For total carbon, lithology was the primary influence. A 1 g t Au grade shell was constructed to constrain gold estimation in two domains where bimodal distributions as a result of overprinting acid alteration were identified. The grade profiles across domain boundaries were examined to assess the appropriate boundary type for estimation, using contact plots. In the cases where only limited samples were in contact, hard boundaries were applied. 
 Gold and silver grades were capped. No top cuts were applied to sulfur (total and sulfide sulfur) or carbon (total and organic carbon). PVDJ2 considered that non-capping generated an appropriately conservative estimate for these elements. 
 The raw assay data were composited to 2 m down-hole composites, independent of lithology and alteration. The composites were then flagged by the alteration and lithology wireframes and domains assigned based on the flagged values. 
 Three dimensional correlogram models were generated for both gold and silver using Sage2001 software. 
 Density was assigned to the blocks in the block model based on a linear relationship with sulfur. 
 Gold and silver grades were estimated to the block model using ordinary kriging (OK). The estimates were sub-divided into the footwall and hanging wall of the Monte Oculto Fault and internal and external to the 1.0 g t Au grade shell where appropriate. The silver estimate used the same parameters as the gold estimate, except for the high-yield limit values. 
 Date February 2023 Page 1-8 

Pueblo Viejo Operations 
 Dominican Republic 
 Technical Report Summary 

Second and third estimation passes, using expanded searches and reduced composite requirements were also run to fill blocks. Any estimated blocks remaining were manually set by script to 0.005 g t for both gold and silver. 
 Initially a total and sulfide sulfur OK estimate was performed using only paired data. A total sulfur estimate was also completed using all available total sulfur data. Carbon was estimated using OK. 
 Validation consisted of a combination of visual checks, swath plots, global statistical bias checks against input data, alternate estimation methods and reconciliation with historical mine plant performance. The validation procedures indicated that the geology and resource models used are acceptable to support the mineral resource estimation. 
 Mineralized material from mining has been stockpiled on-site and segregated for future processing. The stockpiles are modelled using a combination of surveys to create volumes, and ore-control grade and material types, which are tracked from the source polygon to the dumped location. This information is collated into a stockpile block-model for reporting and reclaim planning. 
 Mineral resource classification was undertaken based primarily on drill spacing and number of drill holes used in the estimate. Mineral resources were classified as measured, indicated, and inferred. Material in stockpiles was classified as indicated mineral resources, due to uncertainties relating to carbon estimates and sulfur degradation impacting process recoveries. 
 Mineral resources considered amenable to open pit mining methods are reported within a conceptual pit shell. 
 Commodity prices used in resource estimation are based on forecasts provided by Barrick management. The estimated timeframe used for the price forecasts is the 22-year life-of-mine (LOM) that supports the mineral reserve estimates. 
 The resources are reported using various cut-off values. The revenue for each block within the resource pit limit is compared to the cost of processing the specific block. Given the processing costs are dependent on the sulfur grade and recoveries vary with material type, the NSR cut-off grade for a block with an average sulfur grade of 8.2 is approximately US 45.23 t. 
 
 1.11.2 Mineral Resource Statement 
 Mineral resources are reported on a 100 basis using the mineral resource definitions set out in SK1300, and are reported in situ. Newmont currently holds a 40 Project interest. The remaining 60 interest is held by Barrick, the Project operator. 
 Mineral resources are reported exclusive of those mineral resources converted to mineral reserves. Mineral resources that are not mineral reserves do not have demonstrated economic viability. The measured and indicated mineral resource estimates for the Pueblo Viejo Operations are provided in Table 1-1. The inferred mineral resource estimates are included in Table 1-2.

1.12 Mineral Reserve Estimation 
 
 1.12.1 Estimation Methodology 
 Measured and indicated mineral resources were converted to mineral reserves. Mineral reserves include mineralization within the Monte Negro, Moore, and Cumba open pits, and stockpiled material. All inferred blocks are classified as waste in the cashflow analysis that supports mineral reserve estimation. 
 Economic pit shells were generated using the Lerchs Grossmann algorithm within Whittle software and then used in the open pit mine design process and mineral reserve estimation. Pit shell generation was constrained by infrastructure and permitting limits where applicable. Grades relevant to the economic value calculation for each block are gold, silver, sulfide and sulfur. 
 Various economic parameters were used to estimate the block value and resultant ore or waste categorization of the blocks within the ultimate pit shell. No additional mining recovery or dilution assumptions were applied for the optimization and block value calculations. 
 Pit designs are full crest and toe detailed designs with final ramps based on the selected optimum pit shells. Pit designs honor geotechnical guidelines. 
 Stockpile estimates were based on truck dispatch data. Material in stockpiles was classified as probable mineral reserves, due to uncertainties relating to carbon estimates and sulfur degradation impacting process recoveries. 
 
 1.12.2 Mineral Reserve Statement 
 Mineral reserves have been classified using the mineral reserve definitions set out in SK1300 on a 100 basis. Newmont currently holds a 40 Project interest. The remaining 60 interest is held by Barrick, the Project operator. The estimates are current as at December 31, 2022. The reference point for the mineral reserve estimate is the point of delivery to the process facilities. 
 Mineral reserves are reported in Table 1-3. 
 
 1.12.3 Factors That May Affect the Mineral Reserve Estimate 
 Areas of uncertainty that may materially impact the mineral reserve estimates include changes to long-term metal price and exchange rate assumptions changes to metallurgical recovery assumptions changes to the input assumptions used to derive the pit designs applicable to the open pit mining methods used to constrain the estimates changes to the forecast dilution and mining recovery assumptions changes to the cut-off values applied to the estimates variations in geotechnical (including seismicity), hydrogeological and mining method assumptions and changes to environmental, permitting and social license assumptions.

 Technical Report Summary 

1.13 Mining Methods 
 Open pit mining is conducted using conventional techniques and an Owner-operated conventional truck and shovel fleet. 
 There are three main geotechnical domains in the open pit. Slope designs assume the following parameters 
 Shallow slopes (IRA 16 for carbonaceous sediments susceptible to sliding along weak fabrics and governed by the need to achieve stable inter-ramp and overall slopes 
 Moderate slopes (IRA 26 38 in cover and clays of up to four benches and for carbonaceous sediments that are not susceptible to sliding along weak fabrics 
 Steep slopes (IRA 40 in volcanic rocks and limestones are governed by the need to manage short-term rock fall risks and maintain productivity. 
 Geotechnical berms associated with maximum inter-ramp slope heights (or stack heights) were introduced into the designs to improve overall mine design reliability by vertically separating slopes for planned geotechnical risk management and as a provision for mine dewatering infrastructure. 
 PVDJ2 considers that the slope design parameters and depressurization strategy adopted for the life-of-mine plan are appropriate for the Project. The current parameters are more conservative than previously proposed, and are designed to incorporate residual risks and uncertainty through the introduction of geotechnical berms (or slope decoupling berms). 
 Pumping rates for the Monte Negro and Moore pits range from 7 10 L s and 12 17 L s, respectively, depending on availability of storage and pump utilization. 
 The LOM plan is based on a detailed blend sequence that incorporates open pit mining, and stockpile reclaim phases and deposition schedules. 
 The LOM plan assumes a nominal rate of approximately 14 Mt a milling throughput until the end of 2037, with milling rates decreasing starting in 2038. The total tonnage moved is variable and is based on levelling haulage truck requirements. 
 The remaining mine life is projected to be 19 years, until 2041. Processing of low-grade stockpiles will continue to 2044 with limestone mining completing in 2043. 
 As part of the closure requirements pertinent to environmental permitting, all potentially acid generating (PAG) waste must be stored in anaerobic conditions to minimize the acid generating potential. Typically, PAG and tailings are sent to the TSFs, but disposal can also include back-filling the mined-out pits to an elevation below the natural water table level. 
 A combined total of 474 Mt of limestone will be mined from quarries over the LOM plan of this, 293 Mt is considered to be quality limestone for processing and other requirements such as TSF construction. Quarry designs and extents are designed using commercial mining software. The limestone quarry production schedule is based on process plant requirements and the material requirement for TSF construction activities. 
 The mine operations use conventional drilling, blasting, truck, and loader methods with various ancillary support equipment. The primary production fleet also supports the limestone quarries. Ancillary activities are performed by PVDJ2 or third-party contractors.

 Technical Report Summary 

1.14 Recovery Methods 
 The process plant design was based on a combination of metallurgical testwork, previous study designs and industry standard practices, together with debottlenecking and optimization activities once the mill was operational. The design is conventional to the gold industry and has no novel parameters. 
 The current process plant is designed to process approximately 24,000 t d of run-of-mine (ROM) refractory ore. The design basis for the oxygen plant is to provide the oxygen required to oxidize approximately 80 t h of sulfide sulfur. This is equivalent to 1,200 t h of feed containing 6.79 sulfide sulfur, assuming a design factor of 2.2 t O2 t sulfide sulfur. 
 The process plant currently consists of the following unit operations 
 Ore crushing circuit 
 SAG and ball mill with pebble crusher (SABC) grinding circuit 
 Pressure oxidation circuit 
 Oxygen plant 
 Hot cure circuit 
 Counter-current decantation (CCD) wash circuit 
 Ferric precipitation circuit (partial neutralization) 
 Neutralization and solution cooling circuit 
 Lime boil and slurry cooling circuit 
 CIL cyanidation circuit 
 Carbon acid washing, stripping and regeneration circuits 
 Refinery 
 Cyanide destruction circuit 
 Tailings effluent and acid rock drainage (ARD) water treatment plant circuit 
 Tailings disposal facility. 
 The process plant expansion project will expand processing operations from 8.6 Mt a to approximately 14 Mt a, thereby allowing treatment of lower-grade ores. The process plant expansion will also increase the TSF capacity to support a longer mine life. The intention is not to install an additional autoclave but rather to upgrade low-grade ore by installing a flotation circuit and to modify the existing four autoclaves by including a flash recycle thickening circuit, which will assist in increasing the capacity and the residence time in the autoclaves. 
 The expanded process plant will include the following

 The following areas will be expanded 
 Ferric precipitation 
 Solution cooling 
 Limestone and lime 
 Oxygen plant. 
 Power is supplied to the plant by a 230 kV incoming line to the substation intake transformers and reduced to 34,500 V AC for plant distribution. The forecast LOM power demand is approximately 210 MW, resulting in an average consumption of 1,700 GWh a. 
 The major consumables include flocculant lime, limestone and lime slaking and flotation reagents (copper sulfate, potassium amyl xanthate (PAX), methyl isobutyl carbinol (MIBC), and Guar gum). 
 Water is supplied to the process plant from two sources. The Hatillo Reservoir supplies fresh water requirements. Reclaim water from the TSF is a key secondary water supply for the plant. A collection pond captures the runoff before it is returned to the process plant to serve as make-up water. 
 
 1.15 Project Infrastructure 
 Key infrastructure associated with the Pueblo Viejo Operations LOM plan includes 
 Three open pits 
 Process plant 
 Stockpiles (28) 
 PAG storage facilities (three existing, one to be constructed) 
 PAG conveyor system (to be constructed) 
 NAG storage facilities (two) 
 Quarries (two limestone, one diorite)

 Effluent treatment plant 
 Power lines 
 Various support facilities including truck and vehicle shops, warehouse, administration, contractor and temporary offices, fuel storage, core processing facilities at the mine site, clinic and emergency response facilities, gatehouse, mess facilities, change rooms, personnel training facilities, information technology (IT) communications setups and towers, environmental monitoring facilities, sewage treatment plants, and reagents storage. 
 The current Llagal TSF was created by constructing an engineered embankment structure across the El Llagal valley, approximately 3.5 km south of the plant site, in a tributary of the Rio Maguaca. The Llagal TSF is expected to be filled to its design limit in 2027, after which tailings will be placed in a new proposed TSF, the Naranjo TSF. From 2025 until 2041, PAG waste rock from the mine is planned to be deposited into the Naranjo TSF. The Naranjo TSF will be located 5.5 km southeast of the process plant and 1 km east of the Llagal TSF, in the upper Rio Vuelta catchment, a tributary of the Rio Maguaca. The Naranjo TSF catchment will cover an area of about 14.3 km 2 and will have a combined tailings and PAG waste storage capacity of approximately 500 Mm 3 . The current design allows for expansion to a capacity of 645 Mm 3 if required in the future. 
 The process includes an effluent treatment plant to treat the combined flows of tailings effluent and the ARD generated in the Margarita drainage basin from previous mining activities. The chemically stable sludge produced in the plant is pumped to the TSFs for permanent storage. 
 Key water management structures include, or will include the following Hatillo reservoir Hondo reservoir Taino Dam fresh water storage pool emergency containment pools Monte Negro, Moore and Cumba Pits ARD storage dams effluent treatment plant Llagal TSF and Naranjo TSF. 
 On-site accommodation consists of an approximately 430-bed camp with full dining, laundry and recreational facilities. 
 The Pueblo Viejo Operations are supplied with electric power from two sources via two independent 230 kV transmission circuits. The operational power requirements are currently less than the capacity of the power sources. The mine peak load to date is 150 MW and the average load at full production is approximately 140 MW thus, the Quisqueya 1 power plant s capacity exceeds the mine load. Excess power from the Quisqueya 1 power plant is currently transmitted to Bonao III Substation and sold to the Dominican Republic s national power grid, referred to as the Systema Electrico Nacional Interconectado (SENI) at the grid marginal price. It is expected that the mine average load at full production, once the expansion project is completed, will exceed the Quisqueya Power production in about 2026. Additional power to support the LOM plan will be sourced either from the grid or from a solar plant that is currently in the planning stage. Emergency power is provided by 15 MW of diesel generation.

1.16 Environmental, Permitting and Social Considerations 
 
 1.16.1 Environmental Studies and Monitoring 
 Baseline and supporting environmental studies were completed to assess both pre-existing and ongoing site environmental conditions, as well as to support decision-making processes during operations start-up. Characterization studies were completed for climate, air quality, hydrology and surface water quality, hydrogeology, flora, fauna, soils, agriculture and land use, and the socioeconomic environment. 
 Plans were developed and implemented to address aspects of operations such as waste and fugitive dust management, spill prevention and contingency planning, water management, and noise levels. 
 An Environmental and Social Impact Assessment was completed to support the planned Naranjo TSF construction, and an environmental study was completed in support of the planned process expansion. It was submitted to the Ministry of Environment at the end of October 2022. 
 Environmental monitoring is ongoing at the Project and will continue over the life of the operations. Key monitoring areas include air, water, noise, wildlife, and waste management. 
 
 1.16.2 Closure and Reclamation Considerations 
 The Rosario Dominicana mine operated prior to June 1999. Previous development included the mining of two main open pits (Monte Negro and Moore) and several smaller open pits, construction of a plant site, and construction of two tailings impoundments (Las Lagunas and Mejita). Waste rock storage facility (WRSF) and low-grade stockpiles from these operations are located throughout the pit areas. When the Rosario Dominicana operations shut down, proper closure and reclamation was not undertaken. The result was a legacy of polluted soil and water and contaminated infrastructure. 
 The major legacy environmental issue is ARD. ARD develops from sulfide exposure to air, water, and bacteria in the existing pit walls, WRSFs, and stockpiles. Untreated and uncontrolled ARD contaminated local streams and rivers and led to the deterioration of water quality and aquatic resources within the operations area and offsite. 
 An updated Mine Closure Plan was prepared by third-party consultants Piteau Associates in September 2021, submitted to the government in December 2021, and is under review. The closure plan design includes several interrelated components such as legal and other obligations, closure objectives, environmental and social considerations, technical design criteria, closure assumptions, health and safety hazards, and relinquishment conditions. 
 Closure costs used for the economic analysis are estimated at US 342 M. 
 
 1.16.3 Permitting 
 Permits to support current operations are in place. 
 The last modification of the environmental license for the mine site was granted in August 2020 which authorized the modification of the existing process plant and other auxiliary areas needed to extend the LOM. 
 Date February 2023 Page 1-18 

Pueblo Viejo Operations 
 Dominican Republic 
 Technical Report Summary 

A modification request was submitted to the Ministry of Environment on 30 September, 2022 included information relating to additional proposed facilities. 
 The ESIA, submitted in October 2022, is expected to be approved by the Dominican government in about Q2, 2023 (i.e., nine months after submittal) the ESIA is currently undergoing Dominican government review. PVDJ2 expects to amend the ESIA submission to incorporate the latest engineering details supporting the Naranjo TSF designs during Q1, 2023. 
 The Naranjo TSF location was one of the preferred site options selected by the Ministry of Energy and Mines and the Ministry of Environment. PVDJ2 will need to complete a detailed engineering study for the planned facility, and submit the detailed engineering designs to the relevant Dominican governmental authorities for review and approval. 
 The main in-stream dam construction activities require a separate permit from the National Water Resources Institute, which is the hydraulic resources unit of the Ministry of Environment. An application is expected to be submitted to the National Water Resources Institute in Q3, 2023, following completion of applicable engineering studies. National Water Resources Institute approval is currently expected in about Q1, 2024. Approval will allow commencement of the main in-stream dam construction activities (requiring surface water diversion or storage). 
 All major permits and approvals are either in place or PVDJ2 expects to obtain them in the normal course of business. Where permits have specific terms, renewal applications are made of the relevant regulatory authority as required, prior to the end of the permit term. 
 
 1.16.4 Social Considerations, Plans, Negotiations and Agreements 
 A Social Management System is in place, which includes a number of Social Management Plans. 
 The objective of the Engagement and Disclosure Plan is to maintain effective communication between PVDJ2, local authorities and the community in general. 
 The expansion project requires the construction and operation of the Naranjo TSF, which includes the construction of a conveyor. Seven communities will require resettlement, two for the conveyor belt and five for the tailings dam. Land acquisition and involuntary resettlement, and livelihood restoration plans are in place and comply with national law and international standards. Preliminary studies for the Naranjo TSF identified that approximately 3,500 ha are required, in which 985 households are expected to be affected by the Project, through physical and or economic displacement. An area of about 1,056 ha, south of the proposed Naranjo TSF location, will be required for perimeter roads and as a buffer around the facility itself. PVDJ2 contracted the services of an expert consultant to prepare a Livelihood Restoration Plan for the communities to be resettled. This plan includes preparing family life plans aligning Livelihood Restoration Plan with national initiatives strengthening territorial management and leadership accompaniment in the identification, design and implementation of economic activities and design implementation of a monitoring, follow-up and evaluation system. 
 The Community Development Plan includes the participation of all stakeholders implementing initiatives, and aims to promote sustainable development of the communities near the Project, and support programs prioritized through a participatory process.

The Community Safety Plan is aimed at strengthening the capacity of communities and emergency response agencies to prevent health and safety risks during the construction of the expansion project and operations. 
 
 1.16.5 Qualified Person s Opinion on Adequacy of Current Plans to Address Issues 
 Based on the information provided to the QP by Barrick and PVDJ2 (see Chapter 25), issues that may arise include the following 
 Ongoing consultation and engagement with those households affected by the resettlement required to construct the Naranjo TSF 
 Should further analysis of the Naranjo TSF indicate a larger than planned area is required, then PVDJ2 will need to complete further resettlement analysis and engagement with those affected. 
 The Dominican government is actively reviewing the modified ESIA that was lodged in October, 2022. Government representatives requested a meeting with PVDJ2 in January 2023. This active review and approval process may generate additional information requests or compliance activities from PVDJ2. 
 PVDJ2 is currently not responsible for rehabilitation of any of the Rosario Dominicana environmental liabilities, but is administering the rehabilitation efforts on the Dominican government s behalf. 
 PVDJ2 has assumed for the purposes of the LOM plan and economic analysis in this Report that certain permits will be received by specific dates. If these are not approved or granted, there is a risk that some assumptions in the LOM plan and economic analysis may need to be modified to reflect the changed dates. 
 PVDJ2 was able to permit the existing operations, and currently has the social license to operate within the local communities. There is a reasonable expectation that issues arising in relation to the proposed expansion can be managed with appropriate dialogue, and if required, modifications to designs of major proposed infrastructure. PVDJ2 has some flexibility with the negotiation of any future compensation payments that may be provided to those affected by planned resettlement activities. 
 
 1.17 Markets and Contracts 
 
 1.17.1 Market Studies 
 Barrick has established contracts and buyers for the dor product from the Pueblo Viejo Operations, and has an internal marketing group that monitors markets for its key products. Together with public documents and analyst forecasts, these data support that there is a reasonable basis to assume that, for the LOM plan, the key products will be saleable at the assumed commodity pricing.

Barrick uses a combination of historical and current contract pricing, contract negotiations, knowledge of its key markets from a long operations production record, short-term versus long-term price forecasts prepared by the company s internal marketing group, public documents, and analyst forecasts when considering long-term commodity price forecasts. 
 Higher metal prices are used for the mineral resource estimates to ensure the mineral reserves are a sub-set of, and not constrained by, the mineral resources, in accordance with industry-accepted practice. 
 The long-term commodity price and exchange rate forecasts are 
 Mineral resources 
 Gold US 1,700 oz 
 Silver US 21 oz

 Mineral reserves 
 Gold US 1,300 oz 
 Silver US 18 oz 
 US Dominican peso 60. 
 
 1.17.3 Contracts 
 Bullion is sold on the spot market, by marketing experts retained in-house by Barrick. Barrick provides Newmont with the date and number of ounces that will be credited to Newmont s account, and invoices Newmont for how much Newmont is owed, such that Newmont receives credits for the ounces (based on the JV interest) and Newmont pays Barrick for the ounces. The terms contained within the sales contracts are typical and consistent with standard industry practice and are similar to contracts for the supply of bullion elsewhere in the world. 
 While Barrick has a gold and silver streaming agreement in place for its share of the bullion, Newmont has no similar agreement for its bullion share. 
 The largest in-place contracts other than for product sales cover items such as bulk commodities, operational and technical services, mining and process equipment, and administrative support services. Contracts are negotiated and renewed as needed. 
 
 1.18 Capital Cost Estimates 
 Capital cost estimates are at a minimum at a pre-feasibility level of confidence, having an accuracy level of 25 and a contingency range not exceeding 15 . 
 The overall capital cost estimate for the LOM is approximately US 3.3 B (Table 1-4). The capital costs are based on a conceptual level financial model provided by PVDJ2 that has been adjusted to align to generally-accepted accounting practices (GAAP).

 1.20 Economic Analysis 
 Please refer to the note regarding forward-looking information at the front of the Report. 
 
 1.20.1 Economic Analysis 
 The financial model that supports the mineral reserve declaration is a standalone model that calculates annual cash flows based on scheduled ore production, assumed processing recoveries, metal sale prices and Dominican peso US exchange rate, projected operating and capital costs and estimated taxes. 
 The financial analysis is based on an after-tax discount rate of 5 . All costs and prices are in unescalated real dollars. The currency used to document the cash flow is US . 
 All costs are based on the 2023 budget. Revenue is calculated from the recoverable metals and long-term metal price and exchange rate forecasts. 
 Taxation considerations include payment to the Dominican government of a net smelter return royalty of 3.2 based on gross revenues for gold and silver, a net profits interest of 28.75 based on an adjusted taxable cash flow, a corporate income tax of 25 based on adjusted net income, a withholding tax on interest paid on loans and on payments abroad, and other general tax obligations which include a graduated minimum tax. 
 The economic analysis is based on 100 equity financing and is reported on a 100 project ownership basis. The economic analysis assumes constant prices with no inflationary adjustments. 
 The NPV at a discount rate of 5 is 3.1 B. With a portion of the expansion capital already sunk, the payback and internal rate of return are not applicable. 
 A summary of the financial results is provided in Table 1-6. Total tonnage and metal may differ from declared values in the mineral reserve table due to the financial model being based on a projected end of year topography. The QP does not consider any differences to be material. 
 
 1.20.2 Sensitivity Analysis 
 The sensitivity of the Project to changes in grades, sustaining capital costs and operating cost assumptions was tested using a range of 25 above and below the base case values. The changes in metal prices are representative of changes in grade. The Project is most sensitive to changes in grade, as shown in Figure 1-1. The sensitivity to metal price mirrors the sensitivity to grade and is not shown in the graph.

 Density is currently under sampled. There is a risk of lower density than modelled which could impact estimated tonnages and contained metal. The risk is mitigated given the site s operating history 
 A portion of the mineral resource and mineral reserve estimates are in stockpiled material. This material is classified as indicated based on uncertainties relating to the carbon content, and sulfur degradation impacting process recoveries. If process recoveries are lower than assumed, this could affect the project economics for that portion of the mine plan that is based on expected revenue from stockpiled material 
 The process plant expansion project has not achieved commercial production and as with any construction project there is a risk of delays and lower than estimated plant throughput, recovery (or both) during the start-up period 
 The waste stacking system in the proposed Naranjo TSF may experience project delays, increased costs and or operational issues not envisaged during the study work. While truck haulage is always a feasible alternative, this would come at higher than planned costs 
 Relocation of communities may take longer than expected. Delays may impact the proposed construction schedule for the Naranjo TSF 
 The site has sufficient limestone available for the LOM requirements however, should unforeseen issues impact the availability of limestone, the use of external sources would be expected to increase costs. This scenario should be manageable within the current cost and revenue structure 
 The estimated closure cost in the economic analysis is US 342 M. The closure cost may require revision when the relevant regulatory authorities have examined the ESIA, modifications to the ESIA and related expansion scenario. There is a risk that the closure cost may be higher than that estimated in the economic analysis 
 Commodity price increases for key consumables such diesel, electricity, tires, and chemicals would negatively impact the stated mineral reserves and mineral resources

 Technical Report Summary 

Labor cost increases or productivity decreases could also impact the stated mineral reserves and mineral resources, or impact the economic analysis that supports the mineral reserves 
 Geotechnical and hydrological assumptions used in mine planning are based on historical performance, and to date historical performance has been a reasonable predictor of current conditions. Any changes to the geotechnical and hydrological assumptions could affect mine planning, affect capital cost estimates if any major rehabilitation is required due to a geotechnical or hydrological event, affect operating costs due to mitigation measures that may need to be imposed, and impact the economic analysis that supports the mineral reserve estimates 
 The mineral resource estimates are sensitive to metal prices. Lower metal prices will require revisions to the mineral resource estimates 
 Political risk from challenges to 
 Mining license renewals 
 Environmental permit grant or renewal 
 Changes to assumptions as to governmental tax or royalty rates, such as taxation rate increases or new taxation or royalty requirements. 
 
 1.21.2 Opportunities 
 Opportunities for the Pueblo Viejo Operations include moving the stated mineral resources into mineral reserves through additional drilling and study work. 
 Opportunities include 
 Conversion of some or all of the measured and indicated mineral resources currently reported exclusive of mineral reserves to mineral reserves, with appropriate supporting studies 
 Upgrade of some or all of the inferred mineral resources to higher-confidence categories, such that this material could be used in mineral reserve estimation 
 Higher metal prices than forecast could present upside sales opportunities and potentially an increase in predicted Project economics 
 Studies are underway to determine if a more economic source for TSF construction material is available. 
 
 1.22 Conclusions 
 Under the assumptions presented in this Report, the Pueblo Viejo Operations have a positive cash flow, and mineral reserve estimates can be supported. 
 
 1.23 Recommendations 
 As the Pueblo Viejo Operations consist of an operating mine, the QP has no material recommendations to make.

3.0 PROPERTY DESCRIPTION AND LOCATION 
 
 3.1 Introduction 
 The Pueblo Viejo Operations are situated 100 km northwest of the capital city of Santo Domingo, and 15 km west of Cotu , the provincial capital of Sanchez Ramirez. 
 Project centroid co-ordinates are approximately latitude 18 55'9.15 N, and longitude 70 10'20.35 W. 
 The Monte Negro pit is located at approximately latitude 18 56'59 N and longitude 70 11'00 W. The Moore pit is located at latitude 18 56'32 N and longitude 70 10'36 W. The Cumba pit is located at approximately latitude 18 57'22 N and longitude 70 10'20 W. 
 
 3.2 Property and Title in the Dominican Republic 
 
 3.2.1 Mineral Title 
 The Dominican government has ownership over all natural resources and may grant concessions to local or foreign private parties. 
 The key laws governing mineral title are 
 Law No. 146-71 and Resolution No. 207-98, which govern minerals 
 Law No. 64-00, which governs environmental aspects of mining. 
 Mining administration is typically under the purview of the Ministry of Industry and Commerce, through the General Mining Directorate. 
 A number of types of mining title can be granted, as summarized in Table 3-1. 
 
 3.2.2 Surface Rights 
 Surface rights are not granted with mining rights, and surface rights vary depending on the specific law applicable to a mining permit or concession. 
 A mining right allows the holder to access and use land sufficient for the activities to be undertaken, including accessing government-owned land. There is an expectation that the surface rights holder would be compensated for land use, and for any damage caused to the land surface by the mining rights holder such as construction and operation of infrastructure. 
 Expropriation of land is allowed for the plant site. A law is in place that addresses the expropriation procedures and the compensation that must be paid to the affected surface rights holder.

Table 3-1 Mining Titles 
 Title Name Duration Comments Reconnaissance permit Allows for preliminary prospecting Exploration concession License of Metallic Exploration Concession Three-year initial term. Two individual one year extensions are allowed. After five years, the concessions may be reapplied for, with an additional three to five year term possible. 
 An exploitation concession may be requested at any time during the exploration stage 
 Allows for exploration for mineralization. Requires twice-yearly payments of concession taxes, based on concession size, and requires twice-yearly reporting of exploration activities to the General Mining Directorate. Drilling requires an environmental permit. Exploitation concession License of Metallic Exploitation Concession Maximum 75-year term Allows for extraction of mineralization. Requires payment of concession taxes, based on concession size, payment of a 5 net smelter return (NSR) and requires reporting of activities to the General Mining Directorate. A 5 net profits interest is payable to the local municipality. NSR and nets profit interest payments required under the exploitation license can be negotiated for a fiscal reserve. 
 Also requires an approval authorization for a process plant. 
 Fiscal reserve reserve fiscal As negotiated Fiscal Reserve properties were held by the Dominican Republic government and were not available for acquisition until 2002. Fiscal reserves are mining areas of interest to the government that are established for exploitation by way of special contracts that may have different terms and conditions to those imposed on exploitation concessions. Mining rights in such reserves are won through a public bidding process. 
 The mining rights holder can directly negotiate with any surface rights holder to conclude leases or outright purchase of the surface rights. 
 Easements are typically granted for powerlines. The use of the national grid transmission lines is subject to the payment of special tolls and other similar fees. 
 
 3.2.3 Water Rights 
 Water is owned by the Dominican government, is considered a strategic national heritage, and human consumption has priority over any other use. 
 Law No. 5852 requires that any party wishing to use public waters must obtain a water title. If granted, the water rights are subject to certain fees based on invested capital in installed facilities and annual permitting fees. Other authorizations or permits may be required from the Natural Potable Water and Sewage Institute. Authorizations are required from the Ministry of Environment and Natural Resources for use of wells and groundwater. 
 Date February 2023 Page 3-2 

Pueblo Viejo Operations 
 Dominican Republic 
 Technical Report Summary 

Under Law 146, concession holders have a non-exclusive right to use surface waters needed for exploration or mining activities, can use water discovered during mining activities, and can use water draining from the mine. 
 Concessionaires are also entitled to use the water that freely flows through their concessions, provided that the water is restored to its natural source, such as a riverbed. The returned water must be adequately purified, and any hazardous substances removed. 
 If water is sourced from private third parties, this must be done under agreement, or through expropriation steps. 
 
 3.2.4 Environmental 
 The Ministry of Environment and Natural Resources is the government entity that administers environmental aspects of mining. Mining projects have to obtain an environmental permit or license, which is in part based on an environmental impact study (EIS) and at least one public hearing. A granted environmental license includes regular reporting and inspections amongst its compliance requirements. 
 
 3.3 Project Ownership 
 
 3.3.1 History 
 Initial mining operations were conducted by Rosario Dominicana S.A. (Rosario Dominicana). In 1979, the Dominican Central Bank purchased all foreign held shares in the mine. During 2000, the Dominican State invited international bids for the leasing and mineral exploitation of the Pueblo Viejo sulfide deposits. Placer Dome Dominicana Corporation, a subsidiary of Placer Dome Inc. (Placer Dome) won the bid. In February 2006, Barrick acquired control of Placer Dome and at the same time, sold a 40 stake in the Placer subsidiary that owned Placer Dome Dominicana Corporation to Goldcorp Inc. (Goldcorp). In December 2006, Placer Dome Dominicana Corporation was renamed Pueblo Viejo Dominicana Jersey 2 Limited and the change of name was officially registered with the Government of the Dominican Republic. Goldcorp was acquired by Newmont in 2019. 
 
 3.3.2 Current Ownership 
 Newmont currently holds a 40 Project interest. The remaining 60 interest is held by Barrick, the Project operator. The in-country joint venture operating entity is Pueblo Viejo Dominicana Jersey 2 Limited. 
 
 3.4 Mineral Tenure 
 
 3.4.1 Tenure History 
 The initial mineral concessions, the Pueblo Viejo and Pueblo Viejo II concessions, were granted to Rosario Dominicana. With Rosario Dominicana s consent, the Dominican government terminated both concessions on March 7, 2002. The government, under Presidential Decree No. 169-02, created the 3,200 ha Montenegro Fiscal Reserve, which covered the total area of 
 Date February 2023 Page 3-3 

Pueblo Viejo Operations 
 Dominican Republic 
 Technical Report Summary 

the former Pueblo Viejo and Pueblo Viejo II concessions. The area of the Montenegro Fiscal Reserve was leased to Pueblo Viejo Dominicana Jersey 2 Limited. 
 On August 3, 2004, the Montenegro Fiscal Reserve was modified to include the El Llagal area, planned to be used as the site of a TSF and the overall area of the reserve was increased in area to 4,880 ha. This was ratified under Presidential Decree No. 722-04. 
 An additional of modification ratified under Presidential Decree No. 270-22 added the El Naranjo areas to the Montenegro Fiscal Reserve, bringing the reserve area to approximately 7,995 ha. 
 
 3.4.2 Current Tenure 
 Mineral tenure is granted by the lease of the Montenegro Fiscal Reserve to Pueblo Viejo Dominicana Jersey 2 Limited. The reserve location was shown in Figure 2-2, and currently has a total area of 7,995 ha. 
 Pueblo Viejo Dominicana Jersey 2 Limited can operate the Project by means of a Special Lease Agreement of Mining Rights (the Special Lease Agreement), as amended, that was granted in 2002 (see Chapter 3.5). 
 
 3.5 Property Agreements 
 
 3.5.1 Special Lease Agreement 
 The Special Lease Agreement was ratified by the Dominican government as Resolution No. 125-02, dated August 26, 2002. The agreement was published in the Official Gazette of the Dominican Republic on May 21, 2003, and became effective on July 29, 2003. 
 The Special Lease Agreement gave Pueblo Viejo Dominicana Jersey 2 Limited the exclusive right to lease the Montenegro Fiscal Reserve (covering the Pueblo Viejo deposits and other related sites) free and clear of all defects, claims or encumbrances, for the term of the leases for exploitation of the minerals contained in the Montenegro Fiscal Reserve under the terms, conditions, stipulations and agreements set forth in the Special Lease Agreement. 
 The Special Lease Agreement governs the development and operation of the mining operations. It granted Pueblo Viejo Dominicana Jersey 2 Limited the right to operate for a 25-year period, which commenced on February 26, 2008, when Pueblo Viejo Dominicana Jersey 2 Limited provided the Dominican government with a Project Notice, and a completed feasibility study. 
 The lease on the Montenegro Fiscal Reserve can be renewed at the end of the initial 25-year period by Pueblo Viejo Dominicana Jersey 2 Limited for a further 25-year term, at its sole election. At the completion of the second term, the Special Lease Agreement provides for another 25-year extension however, this extension must be by mutual agreement between the government and Pueblo Viejo Dominicana Jersey 2 Limited. 
 Under the Special Lease Agreement, Pueblo Viejo Dominicana Jersey 2 Limited had to 
 Make certain fixed payments due upon achieving certain milestones 
 Pay a NSR royalty 
 Pay a net profits interest royalty

Pay income tax, and a withholding tax on interest paid on loans 
 Establish an Environmental Reserve Fund to be held in an offshore escrow account is to be funded during operations until the escrowed funds are adequate to discharge Pueblo Viejo Dominicana Jersey 2 Limited s closure reclamation obligations. 
 Prior to the lodgment of the Project Notice, the Dominican government was responsible for all historic environmental matters. Once the Project Notice was submitted, Pueblo Viejo Dominicana Jersey 2 Limited assumed these responsibilities for all historic environmental matters within the boundaries of the Development Areas as designated in the feasibility study. 
 In 2009, the Special Lease Agreement was modified to include revised fiscal terms and to clarify various administrative and operational matters. In 2013, a second modification occurred to address changes to the special tax regime previously agreed to, and to grant Pueblo Viejo Dominicana Jersey 2 Limited a power concession to generate electricity for consumption by the operations, and the right to sell excess power. 
 Current key terms of the Special Lease Agreement include 
 An initial 25-year term, a second 25-year term on Pueblo Viejo Dominicana Jersey 2 Limited s sole election, and a third 25-year term as agreed between the government and Pueblo Viejo Dominicana Jersey 2 Limited 
 Limestone deposits within the Montenegro Fiscal Reserve, including the Hatillo deposit, can be exploited with no additional charges 
 Permission to operate the Las Lagunas and Mejita TSFs (these are legacy TSFs from historical mining activity) 
 The Dominican government will provide a permanent and reliable source of water to support operations 
 The Dominican government will lease to Pueblo Viejo Dominicana Jersey 2 Limited the lands and mineral rights needed to allow tailings and waste disposal 
 The Dominican government will remediate all historical disturbances other than those within areas designated for development by Pueblo Viejo Dominicana Jersey 2 Limited 
 An NSR royalty of 3.2 of net receipts of sales is payable to the Dominican government 
 A net profits interest payment that is based on the gold price will be paid once Pueblo Viejo Dominicana Jersey 2 Limited has reached an initial rate of return of 10 . Once this rate has been reached, the net profits interest payable to the Dominican government will increase to 28.75 
 Income tax payments are subject to a stabilized tax regime, and an annual minimum tax rate of 25 . The annual minimum tax is only applicable when there is a positive difference between the product of the applicable annual minimum tax rate (which varies with the price of gold) multiplied by gross receipts and the sum of the net profits interest and income tax for a particular year. The 
 The graduated minimum tax is adjusted up or down every three years based on a financial model prepared by PVDJ2. PVDJ2 presented an updated financial model underpinning the graduated minimum tax rates for the period 2023 2025 to the Dominican government, which was approved on December 28, 2022.

 Technical Report Summary 

4.0 ACCESSIBILITY, CLIMATE, LOCAL RESOURCES, INFRASTRUCTURE, AND PHYSIOGRAPHY 
 
 4.1 Physiography 
 The central region of the Dominican Republic is dominated by the Cordillera Central mountain range, which runs from the Haitian border to the Caribbean Sea. The highest point in the Cordillera Central is Pico Duarte at 3,175 m. The Pueblo Viejo Operations are located in the eastern portion of the Cordillera Central where local topography ranges from 565 m at Loma Cuaba to approximately 65 m at the Hatillo Reservoir. 
 Two watercourses run through the concession, the Rio Margajita and the Rio Maguaca. The Rio Margajita drains into the Rio Yuna upstream from the Hatillo Reservoir while the Rio Maguaca joins the Rio Yuna below the Hatillo Reservoir. The flows of both watercourses vary substantially during rainstorms. 
 There is little primary vegetation within the general area of the Pueblo Viejo operations, largely due to agricultural and mining activities. Secondary regrowth can be abundant outside of the affected areas. Some reafforestation has occurred through tree planting for soil stabilization. 
 The primary economic activities other than mining are agriculture and cattle ranching. Crops include sugar cane, coffee, cocoa, tobacco, bananas, rice coconuts, yuca, tomatoes, pulses, dry beans, eggplants, and peanuts. 
 
 4.2 Accessibility 
 Access from Santo Domingo is by a four lane, paved highway (Autopista Duarte, Highway #1) that is the main route between Santo Domingo and the second largest city, Santiago. This highway connects to a secondary highway, #17, at the town of Piedra Blanca, approximately 78 km from Santo Domingo. This secondary highway is a two-lane, paved highway that passes through the towns of Maimon, Palo de Cuaba, and La Cabirma on the way to Cotu . The gatehouse for the Pueblo Viejo Operations is approximately 22 km from Piedra Blanca and approximately 6.5 km from Palo de Cuaba. 
 Gravel surfaced internal access roads provide access to the mine site facilities. 
 Gravel surfaced internal access roads provide access withing the mine to the mine site facilities. A network of haul roads is built to supplement existing roads so that mine trucks can haul ore, mine overburden, and limestone from the various quarries. 
 The main port facility in the Dominican Republic is Haina in Santo Domingo. Other port facilities are located at Puerto Plata, Boca Chica, and San Pedro de Macoris. 
 Commercial airlines service the cities of Santo Domingo, Santiago, Puerto Plata, and Punta Cana.

Pueblo Viejo Operations 
 Dominican Republic 
 Technical Report Summary 

4.3 Climate 
 The Dominican Republic has a tropical climate with little fluctuation in seasonal temperatures. August is generally the hottest month and January and February are the coolest. The average annual temperatures in the operations area are approximately 25 C. 
 Annual rainfall is about 1,800 mm, with May through October typically being the wettest months. The Dominican Republic is located in an area where hurricanes occur, with the hurricane season typically from August to November. 
 Mining operations are conducted year-round. 
 
 4.4 Infrastructure 
 The city of Santo Domingo is the principal source of supply for the operations. It is a port city with daily air service to the USA and other countries. Where possible, services are sourced from the adjacent townships with numerous programs initiated by PVDJ2 to assist in local business development. 
 PVDJ2 is a major employer within the Dominican Republic. Most non-technical staff positions and labor requirements are filled from local communities. Workers typically live in the surrounding communities. 
 The Pueblo Viejo Operations currently either have all infrastructure in place to support mining and processing activities (see also discussions in Chapter 13, Chapter 14, and Chapter 15 of this Report), or the requirements for LOM are well understood. These Report chapters also discuss water sources, electricity, personnel, and supplies. 
 
 4.5 Seismicity 
 Major earthquakes occur on average every 50 years in the Dominican Republic because the island of Hispaniola sits on top of small crustal blocks sandwiched between the North American and Caribbean tectonic plates.

 A summary of the exploration and development history of the Pueblo Viejo Operations is provided in Table 5-1. 
 Date February 2023 Page 5-1 

Pueblo Viejo Operations 
 Dominican Republic 
 Technical Report Summary 

Table 5-1 Exploration History 
 Year Company Note Circa 1505 1525 Spanish explorers Early workings. 1950s Dominican government Sponsored geological mapping in the region. Exploration at Pueblo Viejo focused on sulfide veins hosted in unoxidized sediments in stream bed outcrops. Small pilot plant constructed, but economic quantities of gold and silver could not be recovered. 1969 Rosario Resources Corporation of New York (Rosario Resources) Initial exploration focus on outcrops in stream valley however, these had limited thicknesses. Commenced step-out drilling on the valley sides, which identified thicker oxide mineralization. 1972 1999 Rosario Dominicana S.A. (Rosario Dominicana) Joint venture incorporated by Rosario Resources (40 ), Simplot Industries (40 ), and the Dominican Republic Central Bank (20 ). 
 Open pit mining of the oxide resource commenced on the Moore deposit in 1975. In 1979, the Dominican Central Bank purchased all foreign held shares in the mine. Management of the operation continued under contract to Rosario Resources until 1987. Rosario Resources was merged into AMAX Inc. (Amax) in 1980. 
 Monte Negro, Mejita, and Cumba deposits identified by soil sampling and drilling and put into production in the 1980s. Oxide mineralization was mined out in 1991. 
 Initiated studies on the underlying refractory sulfide resource to continue the operation. Feasibility-level studies were conducted by Fluor Engineers Inc. in 1986 and Stone & Webster Engineering American Mine Services in 1992. 
 The 1986 study concluded that developing a sulfide project would be feasible if based on roasting technology, with sulfuric acid as a by-product. Rosario Dominicana rejected this option due to environmental concerns related to acid production. 
 The 1992 study concluded that a roasting circuit was feasible, using limestone slurry for gas scrubbing and a new kiln to produce lime for gas cleaning and process neutralization. 
 A carbon-in-leach (CIL) plant circuit and new tailings facility at Las Lagunas were commissioned to process transitional sulfide ore at a throughput rate of 9,000 t d. Results were poor, with gold recoveries varying from 30 50 . 
 Selective mining continued in the 1990s on high-grade ore with higher estimated recoveries. Mining in the Moore deposit stopped early in the 1990s due to a to high copper content that resulted in high cyanide consumption, and increased ore hardness. Mining ceased in the Monte Negro deposit in 1998, and stockpile mining continued until July 1999, when the operation was shut down. 
 Two bidding processes to joint venture or dispose of the property were conducted, one in approximately 1992 and the other in 1996. In November 1996, Rosario selected Salomon Smith Barney to coordinate a process to find a strategic partner to rehabilitate the operation and to determine the best technology to economically exploit the sulfide resource (the privatization process). 
 Historical production from 1975 1999 of 5.5 Moz Au and 25.2 Moz Ag.

 Technical Report Summary 

6.0 GEOLOGICAL SETTING, MINERALIZATION, AND DEPOSIT 
 
 6.1 Deposit Type 
 The Pueblo Viejo deposit area is considered to be an example of a high-sulfidation epithermal deposit. 
 Most high-sulfidation deposits are generated in mildly extensional to neutral calc-alkaline andesitic dacitic arcs. The form of high-sulfidation deposits varies from replacement or dissemination to vein, stockwork and hydrothermal breccia. Irregular deposit shapes are frequently determined by host rock permeability and the geometry of ore-controlling structures. Multiple, crosscutting composite veins are common. 
 A typical sequence of mineral deposition is pyrite + and the dimorphic minerals enargite (Cu 3 AsS 4 luzonite (Cu 3 AsS 4 ), followed by chalcopyrite tennantite sphalerite galena + pyrite. Gold mineralization often post-dates the enargite assemblage, and typically consists of electrum and gold tellurides. 
 
 6.2 Regional Geology 
 The Pueblo Viejo deposit is located in the central part of Hispaniola Island. The deposit is hosted in a portion of a Lower Cretaceous intra-oceanic island arc with bimodal volcanism that forms the base of the Greater Antilles Caribbean islands, see Figure 6-1. In the Project area, the arc is primarily represented by the Los Ranchos Formation. 
 The Hatillo Formation, consisting of limestones, is overthrust onto the Los Ranchos Formation to the southwest of the Pueblo Viejo deposit area. The Lagunas Formation, a forearc basin assemblage, overlies the Hatillo Formation, and crops out to the south of the Project area. 
 Geology and tectonic evolution of Hispaniola includes a thrust-bound fragment of the ocean floor comprising peridotite, which has been interpreted as a dismembered part of an ophiolite suite. An obduction process affecting the ocean floor was responsible for the metamorphism of rocks that belong to the Maimon Formation. 
 
 6.3 Project Geology 
 
 6.3.1 Lithologies 
 A summary of the key lithologies within the Project area are provided in Table 6-1. Figure 6-2 is a schematic stratigraphic column for the Project area that shows more detail of the lithologies in the operations area. A Project geology plan is included as Figure 6-3.

 The sedimentary facies overlay both the quartz-bearing facies at the central part of the basin and the andesite facies at the border. There is a lower sedimentary horizon interpreted as remanent of a sub-basin that has a dominant calcareous composition and is interlayered with the andesite facies. 
 A narrow flat andesite layer at the Moore zone overlies the quartz-bearing facies. Intermediate dikes such as the Monte Negro dike represent a final volcanic episode that occurred near the end of the hydrothermal mineralization event. 
 
 6.3.2 Structure 
 The major structural unit in the Pueblo Viejo deposit is the northeasterly-trending Monte Oculto fault that separates the Monte Negro and Moore pits. It is a post deposition late-stage fault offsetting the lithologies and grades and cutting Quaternary alluvium. The fault has an approximate throw of 100 m. 
 For modelling purposes, a number of lineaments and faults were also evaluated, see Table 6-2. These structures are shown in Figure 6-6. 
 There is some evidence for post-mineralization deformation.

6.3.3 Alteration 
 All lithologies display argillic alteration. Common alteration minerals include quartz, and pyrophyllite. Figure 6-7 shows the major alteration types present in the Pueblo Viejo deposit as a paragenetic sequence from early to late alteration phases, and from high temperature to low temperature phases. 
 
 6.3.4 Mineralization 
 Mineralization events are strongly related to the alteration sequence with disseminated pyrite occurring in an early event and sulfide veinlets occurring in a later event. Mineralization is also interpreted to have occurred during or close to the end of basin sedimentation. The presence of mineralized veinlets cutting the bedding or hosted conformably in the deformed sediments are interpreted by PVDJ2 to be evidence of this. 
 Figure 6-7 showed the main stages of emplacement of gold mineralization in the Pueblo Viejo deposit. 
 Pyrite is the primary sulfide. Minor constituents can include sphalerite, local enargite and minor amounts of barite, rutile, telluride, and lead-sulfides. Sphalerite and enargite (with some antimony replacing arsenic) are present with pyrite, primarily as veins or filling fractures. 
 
 6.4 Deposit Descriptions 
 A surface map showing the overall deposit geology is provided in Figure 6-8. A map showing the location of the various mineralized zones that make up the Pueblo Viejo deposit is provided as Figure 6-9. The figure also shows the locations of the limestone quarries. 
 The primary mineralized areas are the Moore and Monte Negro zones, with a small satellite zone at Cumba. 
 
 6.4.1 Moore Zone 
 Moore forms the depocenter basement located at the southeast margin of the Pueblo Viejo deposit (refer to Figure 6-4). It includes a smaller mineralized area that was previously referred to as the Mejita zone in the southeastern extent of the Moore zone, and a second smaller zone, ARD1, in the southwestern extent of the zone. 
 
 6.4.1.1 Deposit Dimensions 
 The Moore zone extends 1,200 m north northwest, is 700 m wide, and can reach 400 m in thickness. The Mejita portion of the zone extends 550 m north northwest, is 250 m wide, and can reach 150 m in thickness.

 6.4.1.2 Lithologies 
 The carbonaceous sequence is well developed, with a thickness of more than 150 m. Thin-bedded carbonaceous siltstones and dacitic ash tuffs in the West Flank dip shallowly to the west. The dip increases towards the west where north-trending thrust faults displace the bedding. 
 Pyrite veins are steeply dipping with a trend typically to the north northwest. There is a secondary pyrite vein set that trends north south and north northeast. The orientation of pyrite veins and steep faults is similar.

 Technical Report Summary 

Gold-bearing quartz veins trend northwesterly, oblique to the pyrite veins, and have a similar strike to the interpreted contact with the overlying Hatillo Formation limestone. The quartz veins also occur as tension gash arrays in centimeter-scale dextral shear zones that trend north northwest. 
 A cross-section through the Moore zone is provided in Figure 6-10. 
 
 6.4.1.3 Structure 
 Faults create centimeter-scale displacement of bedding and pyrite-sphalerite veins occur along steep north-northeast trending faults. Two main north northeast-trending faults were mapped across the West Flank, sub-parallel to the Moore dacite pyroclastic contact. Displacement of veins preserves the evidence of lateral, sinistral movement.

 Four zones of alteration are mapped from core to outer 
 Advanced alunite 
 Advanced pyrophyllite 
 Propylitic 
 Intermediate argillic. 
 
 6.4.1.5 Mineralization 
 Mineralization is found along the contacts between carbonaceous sediments andesitic flows and pyroclastic dacitic andesitic flows, or is located along the bedding planes within the carbonaceous sediments andesitic flows. Mineralization at depth can be associated with cruciform-textured pyrite sphalerite quartz veins. 
 The mineralized veins are typically 4 cm wide. Sulfides include pyrite in disseminations and veins, and minor enargite and sphalerite veins. Gold mineralization is encapsulated in pyrite, and is refractory. 
 
 6.4.2 Monte Negro Zone 
 Monte Negro is located in the northwest portion of the Pueblo Viejo deposit. It is the distal area of the basin where the carbonaceous sequence is thinner and not as well developed as it is in Moore. 
 
 6.4.2.1 Deposit Dimensions 
 The Monte Negro zone extends 1,450 m north northwest, is 900 m wide, and can reach 360 m in thickness.

 Technical Report Summary 

6.4.2.2 Lithologies 
 In the Monte Negro central area, pyrite-rich veins with gold mineralization are sub-vertical and have different trends, creating conjugate sets. The average width is 2 cm. The north northwest trending set is sub-parallel to the strike of the bedding and fold axes, indicating a possible genetic relationship between folding and mineralization. 
 Enargite, sphalerite, and gold-bearing veins trend dominantly to the north-northeast and have an average width of 3 cm. 
 Mineralized veins to the south of Monte Negro are relatively pyrite-poor, sphalerite-rich, and are about 5 cm thick. The veins are sub-vertical and trend northwesterly. The episodic vein fill demonstrates a clear paragenesis of massive pyrite to enargite to sphalerite and finally to grey silica. 
 Shallow-dipping bedding and sub-vertical sphalerite silica veins on the southern margin of Monte Negro South are cut by a west-dipping thrust. The thrust has brought thinly-bedded pyritic sedimentary rocks into contact with andesitic volcanic and volcaniclastic rocks. 
 A cross-section through the Monte Negro zone is provided in Figure 6-11. 
 
 6.4.2.3 Structure 
 The fault pattern is dominated by steep north northwest-trending faults that are sub-parallel to the dominant pyrite vein set.

 The Cumba zone extends 70 m north northwest, is 170 m wide, and can reach 120 m in thickness. 
 
 6.4.3.2 Lithologies 
 Mineralization is hosted in a silicified andesitic rock. 
 A cross-section through the Cumba zone is provided in Figure 6-12. 
 
 6.4.3.3 Structure 
 The structural trend is northwest to east west and appears to control the mineralization. A major structure trending northeast is interpreted to cut off the mineralization to the south. 
 
 6.4.3.4 Alteration 
 Hydrothermal alteration is predominantly silica pyrophyllite, with traces of dickite in the core of the zone and illite chlorite toward the exterior of the zone. 
 
 6.4.3.5 Mineralization 
 Gold mineralization is associated with pyrite, enargite, tetrahedrite, and covellite with minor sphalerite. 
 
 6.5 QP Comments on Item 7 Geological Setting and Mineralization 
 The QP notes that the knowledge of the deposit setting, lithologies, mineralization style and setting, and structural and alteration controls on mineralization are sufficient to support mineral resource and mineral reserve estimation. 
 The Hatillo Formation hosts the limestone which has been historically mined out of the Quemados quarry, and currently from the active Lagunas and San Juan quarries. There is potential for other limestone quarries to be developed towards the west of the Montenegro Fiscal Reserve.

 Mapping completed prior to PVDJ2 s Project interest included 
 1973 district, property, and deposit scale geological mapping 
 1975 1990 bench scale mapping in the open pits 
 1999 district-scale geological mapping 
 2003 structural mapping in the open pits. 
 PVDJ2 has completed surface mapping at scales ranging from pit wall (1 1,200) to district (1 25,000) scales. Detailed mapping is used in daily pit activities. Regional-scale mapping is used to help vector into prospective areas for exploration focus. 
 
 7.1.3 Geochemistry 
 Prior to PVDJ2 s Project interest, geochemical samples were collected as part of early-stage reconnaissance activities, and included stream sediment, soil, and rock chip sampling. Sample locations, where known, are shown on Figure 7-1. 
 During 2019, PVDJ2 commenced a major program of data review, at both the local and district scale, to identify prospects that warranted additional exploration. This work identified two prospects where limited exploration had been completed 
 NW and South Arroyo Hondo 
 North of Cumba. 
 A west northwest-trending structural corridor to the southeast of the current open pits was also identified as prospective, particularly in an area where the Cumba Fault intersected east northeasterly oriented faulting. 
 An 832-sample soil program was completed (Figure 7-2) over four areas, Zambrana, Mejita Extension, Arroyo del Rey, and Arroyo Hondo. A total of 1,794 rock chip samples were collected as part of regional mapping activities (Figure 7-3).

7.1.4 Geophysics 
 The following geophysical surveys were conducted prior to PVDJ2 s Project interest 
 1976 district-scale ground magnetic geophysical survey 
 1997 project-scale induced polarization (IP) geophysical survey completed by MIM 
 2004 IP survey completed by Placer Dome. 
 The IP data showed that the Moore and Monte Negro zones lie near the center of a broad zone of demagnetization due to alteration that extends to a depth of 2 3 km (Figure 7-4). 
 The surveys were used for early-stage exploration vectoring. No information on the instrumentation or locations of survey lines is available to PVDJ2. 
 As part of exploration activities since 2019, PVDJ2 has completed a number of 2D and 3D IP surveys. Survey locations are shown on Figure 7-5. The survey results were used to plan drill programs to further investigate the Zambrana, Arroyo del Rey, Mejita and Main Gate prospects. 
 
 7.1.5 Petrology, Mineralogy, and Research Studies 
 Petrographic studies were commissioned by Rosario Dominicana and Placer Dome to provide information on the deposit lithologies, mineralization and alteration. PVDJ2 has commissioned a study, underway year-end 2022, to outline representative mineralization styles within the deposit. 
 Research studies include university research theses and numerous published papers in recognized professional journals. 
 
 7.1.6 Qualified Person s Interpretation of the Exploration Information 
 The exploration programs completed to date are appropriate to the style of the Pueblo Viejo deposit and prospects. Additional exploration has a likelihood of generating further exploration successes particularly as modern regional exploration has been limited to date. 
 
 7.1.7 Exploration Potential 
 In 2022, exploration efforts were focused on drilling near-mine prospects such as Main Gate, Arroyo del Rey, and Zambrana (refer to Figure 6-9 for locations), and drilling for quarry sources of limestone, diorite and tonalite for dam construction material. Definition drilling targeting high-grade mineralization was completed using a combination of core and reverse circulation (RC) drilling at the Moore and Monte Negro zones.

 Technical Report Summary 

7.2.1.3 Drilling Since Database Close-out Date 
 Drilling completed since May 17, 2022 is not used in mineral resource estimation. To December 31, 2022, and after the database closeout date, PVDJ2 completed 107 core holes (15,189 m), 30 RC holes (3,756 m) and 1,205 RC grade control holes (57,127 m). 
 No information was provided to the QP as to whether available results for this additional drilling had been compared to the block model and geological interpretation to confirm that there were no material changes likely to either when the data were incorporated into an updated mineral resource estimate. 
 
 7.2.2 Drill Methods 
 
 7.2.2.1 Historical Drilling 
 Rosario Dominica employed several drilling methods including core, RC, and RAB. 
 The Genel JV campaigns were completed using angled HQ (63.5 mm core diameter) holes. The MIM drilling used HQ, with occasional reductions to NQ (47.6 mm) as necessary to complete the drill holes. Drilling completed by Placer Dome used NQ. 
 
 7.2.2.2 PVDJ2 Drilling 
 Reverse circulation drilling is carried out using 5 inch (146 mm diameter) and 5 inch (143 mm diameter) bits. Core holes were HQ size. 
 
 7.2.3 Logging 
 
 7.2.3.1 Historical Drilling 
 The level of detail collected varied by drill program and operator, but generally each operator collected information on lithology, alteration, mineralization, structural features, oxidation description, and vein types. Placer Dome collected rock quality designation (RQD) measurements. 
 No photography was completed on drilling during the 1970s and 1980s. Core photography was completed during the Placer Dome campaigns. 
 
 7.2.3.2 PVDJ2 Drilling 
 Lithology, structures, mineralization, alteration and both recovery and RQD are logged by a geologist at the core shed. Logging data are captured and stored in an acQuire database. Core is photographed.

 Technical Report Summary 

7.2.4 Recovery 
 
 7.2.4.1 Historical Drilling 
 During the Rosario Dominicana campaigns, core recoveries were reported to be approximately 50 in areas of mineralization and within silicified material. Many of the holes were drilled in oxide areas now mined out. There is no information available to Newmont on core recoveries for the other historical drill programs. 
 
 7.2.4.2 PVDJ2 Drilling 
 Core recovery is typically good, averaging about 90 . Areas that can cause poor recoveries include weathering horizons. 
 
 7.2.5 Collar Surveys 
 
 7.2.5.1 Historical Drilling 
 The type of instrumentation used for surveying collar locations is not documented for the Rosario Dominicana or MIM campaigns. The Placer and Genel JV program drill collar locations were surveyed using global positioning system (GPS) instruments. 
 
 7.2.5.2 PVDJ2 Drilling 
 All drill hole collar locations are surveyed with high precision GPS instruments. 
 
 7.2.6 Downhole Surveys 
 
 7.2.6.1 Historical Drilling 
 There is no information as to any down hole surveys that may have been performed for the Rosario Dominicana and MIM campaigns. The Genel JV drill holes were surveyed, but there is no information as to the instrumentation used. The Placer Dome campaigns drill holes were down-hole surveyed at 60 75 m intervals using a Sperry Sun instrument, and azimuth readings were corrected to true north by subtracting 10 . 
 
 7.2.6.2 PVDJ2 Drilling 
 Downhole surveys are taken using a Reflex Gyro instrument. 
 
 7.2.7 Grade Control 
 In 2010, PVDJ2 started a close-spaced RC grade control program focused on the Moore and Monte Negro pit shells to better delineate the ore and improve grade prediction on a bench scale in the mining areas. 
 Date February 2023 Page 7-14 

Pueblo Viejo Operations 
 Dominican Republic 
 Technical Report Summary 

Grid spacing was northing 15 m by easting 10 m for ore and 30 m by 20 m spacing in waste areas. The program targeted multiple benches, and drill holes could range in length from 24 48 m. Holes were angled, and samples were taken at 2 m intervals. 
 This RC grade control program continues to be used as part of the production mining cycle. 
 
 7.2.8 Comment on Material Results and Interpretation 
 Example drill sections showing the relationship of the drilling to the mineralization were included as Figure 6-10 (Moore), Figure 6-11 (Monte Negro), and Figure 6-12 (Cumba). In general, the angled drilled widths are longer when compared to true widths. 
 Drilling and surveying were conducted in accordance with industry-standard practices at the time the drilling as performed and provide suitable coverage of the zones of gold silver mineralization. Collar and down hole survey methods used generally provide reliable sample locations. Drilling methods provide good core recovery. Logging procedures provide consistency in descriptions. These data are considered to be suitable for mineral resource and mineral reserve estimation. 
 There are no drilling or core recovery factors in the drilling that supports the estimates that are known to the QP that could materially impact the accuracy and reliability of the results. 
 
 7.3 Hydrogeology 
 Dewatering is undertaken to monitor pore pressure and phreatic water surfaces behind the pit slopes. 
 The current dewatering network comprises 13 active vertical dewatering wells currently pumping and an additional 14 vertical dewatering wells that are available but not actively pumping. Additional drilling and installations are ongoing each year to expand the capacity and replace ineffective or destroyed wells. 
 
 7.3.1 Sampling Methods and Laboratory Determinations 
 Surface and ground water monitoring are routinely conducted, with samples, depending on what is being monitored, that can be taken on daily, weekly, monthly, quarterly, or annual intervals. Samples are sent to ALS Dominicana S.A.S., located in Santo Domingo (ALS Dominicana) for analysis. Parameters tested include physical and chemical Organic, inorganic, dissolved metals, total metals, hydrocarbon. The laboratory holds ISO 17025 accreditations for selected analytical techniques. 
 Several studies between 2004 and 2018 by Piteau Associates and Schlumberger reviewed hydraulic parameters using pumping tests, packer tests, Lefranc tests, falling head tests, evaluation of historical response of vibrating wire piezometers and open piezometers during the day-to-day operation of dewatering wells, measurement of the flow from horizontal drains and reconciliation of the flow with the structural and lithological models. 
 Pore pressure hydrogeological unit models were developed in 2021 in support of slope stability assessments, and are updated annually based on available vibrating wire piezometer data. There are currently more than 100 vibrating wire piezometers in operation.

 Technical Report Summary 

Vertical pumping wells that are placed low in the pit permit proactive dewatering of the pit floor prior to deepening. These target permeable and interconnected major fracture systems for in-pit active dewatering wells. 
 Active horizontal depressurization of high walls is undertaken to lower the pore pressures in materials with low storativity and transmissivity such as the carbonaceous sediments and the interlayered clays and silts. Sub-horizontal drains are drilled into the slopes on benches at different levels targeting the most critical areas in terms of slope stability and incremental movements, based on hydraulic conductivity of each unit. 
 
 7.3.2 Groundwater Models 
 In 2022, the first numerical groundwater model was developed by SRK Consulting considering all available data and was calibrated using over 10 years of mine development progression and monitoring data. It has validated the hydrogeological unit models, and will be updated further to provide guidance on optimal locations for pumping wells. 
 
 7.3.3 Comment on Results 
 To the Report date, the hydrogeological data collection programs have provided data suitable for use in the mining operations, and have supported the assumptions used in the active pits. 
 
 7.4 Geotechnical 
 Geotechnical drilling was completed in support of infrastructure locations and in support of pit designs. 
 
 7.4.1 Sampling Methods and Laboratory Determinations 
 The most recent geotechnical rock mass model was developed in 2021 based on all available geotechnical drilling investigations between 2004 and 2021. The model includes information from previous studies completed by Piteau Associates and SRK Consulting in the period 2004 2018. 
 The majority of the sampling and the laboratory determinations were performed at the operations by PVDJ2 personnel. There is no system for accreditation of geotechnical laboratories.

 7.4.2 Models 
 A rock mass and minor structural model update was completed by Red Rock Geotechnical (Red Rock Geotechnical, 2021), which was based on all available data from 2004 to 2020, including a review of slope performance history and incorporation of learnings from instabilities on interim pit slopes. 
 Groundwater model updates are based on actual pore pressure monitoring data from pit slopes completed by PVDJ2 (2022b). 
 In 2022, a detailed numerical model was developed by SRK Consultants (SRK, 2022b) to replicate historic and predict future groundwater levels and pore pressures in the pit slopes. Red Rock Geotechnical (Red Rock Geotechnical, 2022) undertook three- and two-dimensional stability assessments for LOM open pit slopes to update slope design parameters. 
 
 7.4.3 Monitoring 
 Geotechnical monitoring equipment and procedures include 
 Five geotechnical slope monitoring radars 
 Bi-monthly InSAR satellite monitoring 
 Eight total station automated prism monitoring instruments 
 13 inclinometers around high-risk geologic structures 
 Canary remote monitoring and measurement of pumping wells and piezometers 
 24 7 slope radar monitoring by an external firm (Hexagon IDS) 
 24 7 monitoring by field monitoring geotechnic staff. 
 
 7.4.4 Comment on Results 
 The geological hard rock setting at the Pueblo Viejo Operations is well understood and displays reasonable consistency in the various open pits located on site. Additional testing continues to confirm the consistency of material strengths and parameters. 
 To the Report date, the geotechnical data collection programs have provided data suitable for use in the mining operations, and have supported the assumptions used in the active operations. 
 The geotechnical testwork and monitoring is used in the pit designs that are discussed in Chapter 13.

8.0 SAMPLE PREPARATION, ANALYSES, AND SECURITY 
 
 8.1 Sampling Methods 
 
 8.1.1 RC 
 
 8.1.1.1 Historical Drilling 
 Reverse circulation holes were generally sampled on 2 m intervals. 
 
 8.1.1.2 PVDJ2 Drilling 
 RC samples were on 2 m sample intervals, and were constant irrespective of changes seen in geological logging. If the drill hole had areas of poor recovery, no sample was taken. 
 
 8.1.2 Core 
 
 8.1.2.1 Historical Drilling 
 Core drilled by the Genel JV was split into thirds, with one third sampled, and the remaining retained as a reference. Where selected, one-third of the sample was used for metallurgical testwork purposes. 
 Core holes were sampled on approximately 2 m intervals. Samples could be adjusted to respect lithology or alteration contacts. 
 
 8.1.2.2 PVDJ2 Drilling 
 The sample intervals are generally 2 m long, with splits along major geological contacts resulting in some shorter sample intervals. The default sample interval is 1.5 m for ore intercepts and 2 m for non-ore intervals. In areas of low recovery, the sample interval is over drill run markers. One-half of the core is sampled, the other half is retained for reference. 
 Field duplicates are taken by splitting the sampled core by half, this process is done alongside with the main core sampling process. 
 
 8.1.3 Grade Control 
 Grade control samples are taken on 2 m intervals. The sampling systems currently in use are the Sandvik and Progradex both sampling units allow bulk dry samples without discarding fine particles from a multiple tray sorter. RC field duplicates are taken with the same unit by collecting chips from the opposite tray. 
 
 8.2 Sample Security Methods 
 Sample collection, preparation, and transportation were performed by PVDJ2 personnel using PVDJ2 vehicles, or by the relevant commercial laboratory vehicle. Chain-of-custody procedures

consist of sample submittal forms sent to the laboratory with sample shipments to make certain that all samples are received by the laboratory. 
 
 8.3 Density Determinations 
 The density database consists of 1,744 density measurements from 285 drill holes. Density is considered under sampled. PVDJ2 advised Newmont that a program to increase density coverage is under way. 
 A regression-based relationship between total sulfur and density to calculate block density values, based on the estimated sulfur grade has historically been used. This relationship was last updated in 2008, and was based on 854 samples. 
 In support of the resource estimate in Chapter 11, the currently-available density data were merged with lithology and alteration data for evaluation and then analyzed for outliers using a modified Z-Score methodology. This flagged 24 values 2.201 and 3.347 t m 3 as outliers, which were excluded from further analysis. 
 Lithology showed the largest variation in density however, there were a number of lithology groups that contained no or very limited density measurements 10), so lithology was considered unsuitable for density assignment. Instead, the historical regression formula was updated based on outlier trimmed data. The resulting calculated regression formula is 
 Density 2.714+0.017 S . 
 The measured density was compared against the 2008 and the updated regression (Figure 8-1 and Figure 8-2) by the sulfur bins used for ore routing. The updated formula shows better alignment with measured values, in particular for the very low and high bins.

 8.7 Quality Assurance and Quality Control 
 
 8.7.1 Historical 
 A summary of the pre- PVDJ2 quality assurance and quality control measures is provided in Table 8-4. 
 
 8.7.2 PVDJ2 
 Insertion frequencies of QA QC materials has varied over the course of the exploration and resource drilling programs. Earlier programs included submission of two blank, two standard and two core duplicate samples into each 75-sample batch sent to ALS Chemex. This was later modified to two blanks, three standards (commercial and custom), two half-core duplicates, two coarse duplicates and seven cleaning blanks in each 76-sample batch sent to ACME. Currently, 
 Date February 2023 Page 8-5 

Pueblo Viejo Operations 
 Dominican Republic 
 Technical Report Summary 

three standards, three field duplicates, and two coarse blanks are inserted into each batch of 60 samples. 
 Blank material is limestone, sourced from the active limestone quarries. Custom standards were prepared from mineralization at Pueblo Viejo. Pulp preparation, homogenization, and round robin analyses were overseen by Smee Consulting, a third party who certified all of the in-house standards. 
 Monitoring is completed on a batch-by-batch basis. For check samples that fell outside of the established control limits, the cause is reviewed, and, if found not to be result of a sample number switch, the relevant batch was re-assayed. Corrective actions taken are detailed through notes in the in-house resource database and supporting documentation. 
 
 8.8 Database 
 There are two main datasets one for exploration, the other for grade control. The Exploration database stores mine exploration, and reserve definition drilling data. The grade control database stores the production and infill data used for grade control, as well as condemnation drilling. Both datasets are built and managed using acQuire software for geoscientific data management. The, GIM Suite system is bundled with acQuire for data flow management and Arena software is used for reporting. 
 The acQuire GIM Suite is used for data checks, such as overlapping drill hole (x, y, z) coordinates in both planned and actual sets, sampling intervals, survey excessive deviations and assay QA QC reports.

 Operator QA QC Notes Rosario Dominicana No known QA QC data other than re-assay data at umpire laboratories Gold results generally corresponded well, but there were several outliers, possibly caused by sample swaps (AMEC, 2005) Genel JV Inserted blanks and duplicates Good precision for gold mineralization standard results were generally within acceptable limits. The standard dataset included many results that exceed the accepted limits, and it is not known if these samples were re-analyzed (AMEC, 2005) MIM No known QA QC data Placer Dome Varied by campaign. Standards always inserted later campaigns included blanks. Standard analyses indicated acceptable precision by ALS Chemex. Blanks showed some failures, attributed to inadvertent switches of blank and standard materials (AMEC, 2005). 
 Umpire assays completed at ACME. Results for gold, copper, and zinc indicated no significant biases between the two laboratories. The ALS Chemex silver assays, however, averaged approximately 12 lower than ACME (AMEC, 2005).

8.9 Qualified Person s Opinion on Sample Preparation, Security, and Analytical Procedures 
 The sample preparation, analysis, quality control, and security procedures used by PVDJ2 and predecessor companies have changed over time to meet evolving industry practices. Practices at the time the information was collected were in line with then-prevailing industry-standards. 
 The Qualified Person is of the opinion that the sample preparation, analysis, quality control, and security procedures used in mineral resource and mineral reserve estimation are sufficient to provide reliable data to support estimation of mineral resources and mineral reserves 
 Drill collar data are typically verified prior to data entry into the database, by checking the drilled collar position against the planned collar position 
 The sampling methods are acceptable, meet industry-standard practice, and are adequate for mineral resource and mineral reserves estimation and mine planning purposes 
 The quality of the analytical data is reliable, and that sample preparation, analysis, and security are generally performed in accordance with exploration best practices and industry standards 
 PVDJ2 has used a QA QC program comprising blank, standard and duplicate samples. PVDJ2 s QA QC submission rate meets industry-accepted standards of insertion rates 
 Verification is performed on all digitally-collected data on upload to the main database, and includes checks on surveys, collar co-ordinates, lithology, and assay data. The checks are appropriate, and consistent with industry standards. 
 Density is considered under sampled. PVDJ2 advised Newmont that a program to increase density coverage is under way. Use of the currently-available data is supported by PVDJ2 s operational history of the Project. 
 Sulfide sulfur (S 2 and organic carbon (C Org are under-sampled relative to total sulfur (S Tot and total carbon (C Tot ), with only around 28 of total sulfur and 23 of total carbon assays having corresponding sulfide sulfur and organic carbon values. Mineral resource estimation uses a paired estimation approach (see Chapter 11.9.2 and Chapter 11.9.3) to address this issue.

 The subset of the data that is used in Mineral Resource estimation is subject to a number of checks by PVDJ2 personnel, including 
 Collar location within reasonable limits 
 Missing collar coordinates 
 Azimuth or Inclination deviation of greater than 5o between adjacent measurements 
 Significant assay values repeated down-hole 
 Anomalous assay values 
 Missing down-hole survey information 
 Missing interval data

 Overlapping interval information 
 Assay values with no core logging information if the interval does not have both assay and logging information it is excluded 
 Decay and cyclicity analysis to look for downhole contamination in RC drilling 
 Paired data analysis to look at bias between RC and core drilling. 
 
 9.1.2 Mineral Resource and Mineral Reserve Estimates 
 Newmont established a system of layered responsibility for documenting the information supporting the mineral resource and mineral reserve estimates, describing the methods used, and ensuring the validity of the estimates. The concept of a system of layered responsibility is that individuals at each level within the organization assume responsibility, through a sign-off or certification process, for the work relating to preparation of mineral resource and mineral reserve estimates that they are most actively involved in. 
 In the case of the Pueblo Viejo joint venture, mineral reserve and mineral resource estimates are prepared by PVDJ2 personnel persons at the mine site level, and are subsequently reviewed by corporate qualified persons based in Newmont s Denver head office. 
 
 9.1.3 Reconciliation 
 PVDJ2 staff have performed a number of internal studies and reports in support of mineral resource and mineral reserve estimation. These include reconciliation studies, mineability and dilution evaluations, investigations of grade discrepancies between model assumptions and probe data, drill hole density evaluations, long-range plan reviews, and mining studies to meet internal financing criteria for project advancement.

10.0 MINERAL PROCESSING AND METALLURGICAL TESTING 
 
 10.1 Test Laboratories 
 There is no international standard of accreditation provided for metallurgical testing laboratories or metallurgical testing techniques. 
 
 10.1.1 Initial Plant Design 
 Metallurgical testwork in support of the original plant design was conducted by a number of independent laboratories or testwork facilities, including AMTEL, A.R. MacPherson Consultants Ltd., Outokumpu Technology Canada, Canadian Environmental & Metallurgical Inc., SGS Lakefield Research, CyPlus GmbH, the University of British Columbia, and SGS MinnovEX. 
 The Barrick Technology Centre, formerly the Placer Dome Technology Centre, which is not independent, has also undertaken testwork. 
 Work completed in support of the process plant design included comminution, whole ore pressure oxidation, carbon-in-leach (CIL), cyanide destruction, neutralization, iron removal, and pilot plant tests. 
 
 10.1.2 Plant Expansion 
 The process plant expansion project entails supplementary milling, a new flotation circuit, modifications to the existing autoclaves to cater for a greater sulfide feed plus additional oxygen generating capacity and finally several enhancements or additions to the downstream circuits to be able to cater for this increase in capacity. The expansion project is currently in the commissioning phase. 
 Testwork in support of the proposed process plant expansion was completed by the following independent laboratories McClelland Laboratories (bio-oxidation), Core Metallurgy Pty Ltd (Albion process optimization), Blue Coast Research Ltd (flotation variability and optimization), AuTec (mineralogy), ALS Metallurgy Kamloops (comminution), Bureau Veritas Metallurgy with Starkey and Associates (semi-autogenous grind (SAG) testing), SGS Lakefield (float, atmospheric pre-oxidation, pressure oxidation (POX), CIL variability), FLSmidth Minerals Testing and Research Center (POX and mineralogy variability), and University of Toronto, CERCL Ltd (microbial characterization). 
 Barrick s Las Lagunas site laboratory, which is not independent, generated the testwork samples. 
 
 10.2 Metallurgical Testwork 
 
 10.2.1 Initial Plant Design 
 Five geometallurgical ore types were defined, two at Moore and three at Monte Negro (Table 10-1). 
 Date February 2023 Page 10-1

 Technical Report Summary 

Bond ball mill work index (BBWi) measurements on the five main rock types undertaken in 2004 indicated that the BBWi of the ore varied from 12.8 kWh t to 16.1 kWh t (average 14.4 kWh t). The Bond rod mill Wi (RWi) varied from 14.9 kWh t to 18.6 kWh t. The BBWi used to size the grinding mills was the average for the hardest of the five ore types (MN-SP) and approximately the 80 th percentile BBWi of all ore types. 
 Laboratory tests on the various ore types showed that only 10 50 of the gold and silver in the ore are free and recoverable by the CIL process at cyanide additions of 2 5 kg t. The remainder of the gold and silver occurred as sub-microscopic particles encapsulated within pyrite mineralization and as solid solution chemically bonded into the pyrite matrix. In addition to the refractory nature of the ore, it also contained significant amounts of cyanide-consuming copper and zinc minerals, and preg-robbing carbonaceous materials in the black sedimentary ore types. The ore contained insignificant amounts of carbonate minerals. Mineralization was generally weakly acidic with a natural pH of approximately 4 to 5. The ore contained from 3 20 sulfur. 
 Placer Dome investigated bio-oxidation and flotation (after ultrafine grinding) as potential pre-treatment options however, whole ore pressure oxidation was selected as the most cost-effective process for mine design. Laboratory tests also showed that pressure oxidation of the whole ore followed by CIL cyanidation of the autoclave product would recover 88 95 (average 91.6 of the gold. 
 Approximately 99 sulfur oxidation was required to ensure a consistently high gold recovery. Reduction of organic carbon content by extending resident time, which corresponded with a higher sulfur oxidation, reduced the preg-robbing that occurred in the carbonaceous ores, also resulted in better gold recoveries. CIL recovery was impacted by the primary grind size. An 80 passing (P 80 of 80 m was selected as the optimum primary grind size. 
 Two additional stages were included in the process flowsheet 
 A hot cure stage, where slurry from pressure oxidation is held in tanks for extended periods of time (up to 12 hours) to dissolve and remove the basic ferric sulfate ahead of CIL cyanide leaching, thereby reducing lime consumption in CIL to 10 kg CaO t ore 
 A lime boil stage, which involves heating the hot cured and washed slurry followed by lime addition to break apart the jarosite and release silver for CIL recovery. 
 Test work and the INCO process was effective in reducing the residual weakly acid-dissociable cyanide to 1.0 mg L. 
 Significant amounts of sulfuric acid and soluble metal sulfate salts are produced during POX. The process plant confirmed the effectiveness of limestone neutralization.

Table 10-1 Geometallurgical Ore Types 
 Text Code Geometallurgical Ore Type Preg Rob Description MO-BSD Moore black sediments Moderate Fine interbeds of carbonaceous shale and siltstone. Bedding is sub-horizontal and is intersected by vertical sulfide veins. MO-VCL Moore volcaniclastics No A group of volcanic (andesitic) lithology units in the Moore pit. Units include massive and fragmental volcanic flows as well as sedimentary units composed primarily of volcanic material. These units typically have lower organic carbon content. MN-BSD Monte Negro black sediments Moderate Interbeds of carbonaceous shale, siltstone, and volcanic flows. Beds are up to three meters thick and have shallow dip to the south. The carbonaceous beds are similar to MO-BSD and comprise more than 50 of MN-BSD. MN-VCL Monte Negro volcaniclastics Weak Similar to MN-BSD except that the unit is less than 30 carbonaceous beds. MN-SP Monte Negro spilites No Volcanic spilite (andesite) flows are found at depth. 
 The plant prior to expansion was designed to process approximately 24,000 t d of run of mine (ROM) refractory ore. The main unit operations were crushing, grinding, high pressure oxidation, acid liquors neutralization and CIL. 
 The major plant bottleneck is the supply of oxygen. If the ROM feed has a low sulfide content, the plant can process over 30,000 t d. The design basis for the oxygen plant is to provide the oxygen required to oxidize approximately 80 t h of sulfide sulfur. This is equivalent to 1,200 t h of feed containing 6.79 sulfide sulfur, assuming a design factor of 2.2 t of O 2 t of sulfide sulfur. 
 
 10.2.2 Plant Expansion 
 The testwork supporting the expansion had three aims 
 Increase plant oxidation capacity 
 Maintain the current mass flows between the autoclave feed to the CIL tails discharge to limit additional capital equipment requirements in these areas 
 Define the geometallurgical precious metal recovery and hardness variability. 
 Testwork results are summarized in Table 10-2.

 Samples Results 2018 low grade stockpile bulk sample Bio-oxidation achieved 1.5 21.6 oxidation in 150 days for samples crushed to passing 50 or 19 mm. Grinding finer than 16 m yielded no benefit for oxidation. 40 of sulfide could be oxidized in 20 24 hours regardless of concentrate sulfide content. Gold and silver recoveries by CIL on the oxidized concentrate were 83 and 87 after 72 hours of oxidation. Depressant usage is essential to improve the concentrate quality but may not decrease mass pull. Recirculating loads yield marginal benefits. Optimum flotation generates concentrates with 90 of gold in 40 of the mass. Pyrite is contained as fine to very fine grains mostly liberated at P 80 75 m. Pre-float collects 20 m liberated pyrite and 10 m pyrite in pyrophyllite and quartz.

10.4.1.2 Plant Expansion 
 Samples supporting the planned expansion were sourced from 
 Two different bulk samples from trenches, representing low grade stockpiles. The medium-grade and high-grade stockpiles were not included in the sampling and drilling programs since these would be processed in the current plant before the expansion project studies were completed 
 The 2017 representative bulk sample was created by combining trench samples collected from 18 locations around the stockpiles 
 The 2018 representative bulk sample was created by combining trench samples collected from 27 locations around the stockpiles 
 Sonic drilling of stockpile material 
 Completion in 2018 of 80 drill holes targeting the low gold grade (L1 7.0 total sulfur, L2 between 7.0 to 8.5 total sulfur and L3 8.5 total sulfur) areas of the low-grade stockpile 
 Drill core 
 69 intervals, each 6 m in length, were selected from core drilling that was completed during the 2017 and 2018 drilling campaigns. 
 The materials tested were considered to represent the variation that was found in the stockpile in terms of gold, silver, copper and sulfide. 
 
 10.5 Deleterious Elements 
 There are no deleterious elements from a processing perspective. Elements such as total carbon, organic carbon, total sulfur, and sulfide sulfur are managed using blending. 
 
 10.6 Qualified Person s Opinion on Data Adequacy 
 The QP notes 
 Much of the gold and silver occurs as sub-microscopic particles encapsulated within the pyrite mineralization and as solid solution chemically bonded into the pyrite matrix. In addition to the refractory nature of the ore, it also contains significant amounts of cyanide-consuming copper and zinc minerals, and preg-robbing carbonaceous materials in the black sedimentary ore types 
 Metallurgical testwork completed on the Project is appropriate to establish optimal processing for the different mineralized zones and stockpiled materials that will be treated over the LOM 
 Testwork was completed on mineralization that is typical of the geometallurgical domains 
 The mill throughput and associated recovery factors are considered appropriate to support mineral resource and mineral reserve estimation, and mine planning

 Technical Report Summary 

Forecast average LOM recoveries for the expanded plant are approximately 90 for gold and 65 for silver. 
 Industry-standard studies were performed as part of process development and facility designs. 
 Testwork programs, both internal and external, continue to be performed to support current operations and the expansion project. From time to time, this may lead to requirements to adjust cut-off grades, modify the process flowsheet, or change reagent additions and process parameters to meet production and economic targets. 
 Based on these checks, the metallurgical testwork and reconciliation and production data support the estimation of mineral resources and mineral reserves, and the metallurgical inputs to the economic analysis.

11.0 MINERAL RESOURCE ESTIMATES 
 
 11.1 Introduction 
 The close-out date for the database used in mineral resource estimation is May 17, 2022. 
 Geological models were constructed using Leapfrog geological modeling software. Block models were built using Vulcan software with cell dimensions that were appropriate to the deposit style, orientation and dimensions of the mineralization. Selectivity during mining, mining method, equipment size and bench height were also taken into account when determining the parent cell size of 10 x 10 x 10 m. Two sub-block sizes were used to better represent volumes of thin, high-grade mineralization, one at 5 x 5 x 5 m, the second at 2.5 x 2.5 x 2.5 m. The block model encompasses the Monte Negro, Moore, and Cumba zones. 
 
 11.2 Geological Models 
 Lithology, structural and alteration models were constructed 
 Lithology semi-implicit model snapped to drill hole contacts. 42 logged lithologies in the data simplified to 17 lithology groups 
 Structure Monte Oculto fault surface as primary control, other structures as discussed in Chapter 6.3.2 
 Alteration five groups, based on grade and alteration assemblages. 
 All modelling was completed using a combination of grade control, exploration logging, bench face, structural, and pit mapping. 
 
 11.3 Exploratory Data Analysis 
 Alteration was determined to be the main driver for the gold, silver, copper and total sulfur domains, with only a minor influence from lithology. Lithology was the primary influence on total carbon. 
 A 1 g t Au grade shell was constructed to constrain gold estimation in two domains, Au3 and Au4, where bimodal distributions interpreted to have resulted from overprinting acid alteration were identified. 
 The grade profiles across domain boundaries were examined to assess the appropriate boundary type for estimation, using contact plots. A mix of boundary types were observed. In the cases where only limited samples were in contact, hard boundaries were applied. 
 
 11.4 Density Assignment 
 Density was assigned to the blocks in the block model based on a linear relationship with sulfur.

 Technical Report Summary 

11.5 Grade Capping Outlier Restrictions 
 Two capping methodologies, probability plots and decile analysis, were used to statistically assess the data. The top 5 of data by domain were statistically and spatially reviewed. 
 Gold was capped by domain, with caps ranging from 10 90 g t Au. Silver caps ranged from 72 600 g t Ag by domain. 
 Capping in the lower-grade domains removed a larger percentage of the gold metal (approximately 2.0 4.4 relative to higher-grade domains, but these high grades in the low-grade domains represent metal at risk. Caps for silver show similar reductions as for gold, with globally 0.03 of the data (199 data points) and 0.9 of the metal capped. 
 Overall, for silver, 41 of the metal and mean grade was from the top 5 of data, while for gold, 30 of the metal and 29 of the mean grade came from this portion of the data. The higher-grade domains had 23 28 of the metal and mean grade for this portion of the population for gold and 32 39 for silver. Statistically the lower-grade domains, for gold and silver, all showed 50 of the metal and 50 of the mean grade was from the top 5 of data in the domains. 
 No top cuts were applied to sulfur (total and sulfide sulfur) or carbon (total and organic carbon), as these elements are considered deleterious in ore processing and blending. PVDJ2 considered that non-capping generated an appropriately conservative estimate for these elements. 
 
 11.6 Composites 
 The raw assay data were composited to 2 m down-hole composites, independent of lithology and alteration. The composites were flagged by the alteration and lithology wireframes and domains were assigned based on the flagged values. 
 
 11.7 Variography 
 Three dimensional correlogram models were generated for both gold and silver using Sage2001 software. The nugget effect was based on the apparent nugget from the down-hole correlograms and used to fit the final model. The modelled nugget was between 0.15 0.3 for gold and 0.2 0.3 for silver, which is considered appropriate for this style of mineralization. The variogram ellipses were visualized to check that they were aligned with the interpreted structural and alteration controls on mineralization. 
 Experimental variograms were calculated and modelled for sulfur in Snowden Supervisor software. Nugget values were determined from downhole variograms, and spatial continuity directions and model were obtained from variogram maps. Directions of spatial continuity modelled were compared visually with the extension of high-grade zones from the composites and the distances observed from the correlation ranges from the variogram models. 
 Experimental variograms were calculated and modelled for carbon in Supervisor software. Nugget values were determined from the apparent nugget from the down-hole correlograms and used to fit the final model. Visual review of grades and lithology trends were used to maximize continuity.

11.8 Locally-Varying Anisotropy 
 A locally-varying anisotropic approach was used to define search orientations based on the structures discussed in Chapter 6.3.2. 
 
 11.9 Estimation Interpolation Methods 
 
 11.9.1 Gold and Silver 
 Gold and silver grades were estimated to the block model using ordinary kriging (OK). The estimates were sub-divided into the footwall and hanging wall of the Monte Oculto Fault and internal and external to the 1.0 g t grade shell where appropriate. The silver estimate used the same parameters as the gold estimate, except for the high-yield limit values. 
 Second and third estimation passes, using expanded searches and reduced composite requirements were also run to fill blocks. Any estimated blocks remaining were manually set by script to 0.005 g t for both gold and silver. The final estimation plan for each domain was derived by tuning the estimate to match the theoretical distribution derived from HERCO analysis. 
 
 11.9.2 Sulfur 
 Due to the low overall volume of sulfide sulfur assays, relative to total sulfur, estimates were completed in two phases. Initially a total and sulfide sulfur OK estimate was performed using only paired data. A total sulfur estimate was completed using all available total sulfur data. The linear relationship derived from the paired estimate was then used to calculate a sulfide sulfur value against this estimate. 
 
 11.9.3 Carbon 
 Carbon was estimated using OK. An additional carbon estimate was performed using only paired data where organic carbon was also present. Due to the very low volume of organic carbon assays (11 of the composites with total carbon also have organic carbon analyses) this estimate is considered significantly lower quality but retains the requirement that a fractional assay will always be lower than a total assay. The paired carbon organic carbon estimate was refined using grade tonnage curves and comparing against a nearest-neighbor (NN) paired analysis and the total carbon analyses. No global bias was seen in any domain. 
 A ratio was then calculated from the paired estimate and used to assign organic carbon values. Un-estimated blocks for carbon and assigned organic carbon were set to the lower detection limit of 0.01 C. 
 Validations of this approach using grade tonnage curves of estimated organic carbon, paired organic carbon, calculated organic carbon, and NN organic carbon showed very similar grades at a zero cut-off, implying no global bias. The estimate of organic carbon compared to the co-estimated organic carbon is very similar, with the only differences being due to the estimation method.

11.10 Block Model Validation 
 Model validation processes included 
 A NN estimate on capped 10 m composites to provide a declustered distribution for HERCO and swath plots 
 An inverse distance to the third power (ID3) estimate as an alternative estimation method 
 An uncapped estimate to quantify the amount of metal removed by capping 
 Visual checks of estimate in both plan and section against composite data and NN estimate 
 Checks for global bias, by comparison of mean grades at zero cut-off against the NN model 
 Checks for local bias, by swath plots in easting, northing, and elevation 
 Comparison of OK estimates to an alternative ID3 estimate 
 Comparison of the top 5 of blocks against high-grade composites 
 HERCO analysis to validate estimate smoothing against the selective mining unit. 
 The check showed that the models were acceptable for use in mineral resources and mineral reserve estimation. 
 
 11.11 Stockpiles 
 Mineralized material from mining has been stockpiled on-site and segregated for future processing. The stockpiles were modelled using a combination of surveys to create volumes, and ore-control grade and material types, which were tracked from the source polygon to the dumped location. A sonic drill program was used to provide additional data for stockpile modelling. 
 This information was collated into a stockpile block-model for reporting and reclaim planning. Stockpile locations are provided in Figure 11-1.

11.12 Classification of Mineral Resources 
 
 11.12.1 Mineral Resource Confidence Classification 
 Classification within the block model was assigned by setting up an estimate with an isotropic search and requiring a minimum and maximum of three drill holes to estimate a block (Table 11-1). The stored average distance was then used to classify the blocks. 
 This raw classification was smoothed to remove isolated blocks using the Vulcan Categorical Smoothing (BlockMaps) tool and a 3 x 3 x 3 moving window. 
 Material in stockpiles was classified as indicated mineral resources, due to uncertainties relating to carbon estimates and sulfur degradation impacting process recoveries. 
 A quantitative assessment of geological risk was undertaken. Primary risks to resource quality include quantity and spacings of drill data, geological knowledge, geological interpretation and grade estimates. All identified risks are within acceptable tolerances. 
 
 11.12.2 Uncertainties Considered During Confidence Classification 
 Following the analysis in Chapter 11.12.1 that classified the mineral resource estimates into the measured, indicated and inferred confidence categories, uncertainties regarding sampling and drilling methods, data processing and handling, geological modelling, and estimation were incorporated into the classifications assigned. The areas with the most uncertainty were assigned to the inferred category, and the areas with fewest uncertainties were classified as measured. 
 
 11.13 Reasonable Prospects of Eventual Economic Extraction 
 
 11.13.1 Input Assumptions 
 Mineral resources were constrained within a conceptual pit shell that used the parameter assumptions listed in Table 11-2. 
 
 11.13.2 Commodity Price 
 Commodity prices used in resource estimation are based on forecasts provided by Barrick management. An explanation of the derivation of the commodity prices is provided in Chapter 16.2. The estimated timeframe used for the price forecasts is the 22-year LOM that supports the mineral reserve estimates.

 Note G general and administrative. 
 
 11.13.3 Cut-off 
 The resources are reported at varying cut-off values, which are based primarily on the sulfur grade of the material type being mined. Given the processing costs are dependent on the sulfur grade and recoveries vary with material type, the NSR cut-off grade for a block with an average sulfur grade of 8.2 is approximately US 45.23 t. 
 PVDJ2 uses a cash-flow optimization methodology for cut-off determination. The revenue for each block within the mineral resource pit limit is compared to the cost of processing the specific block. Those blocks that produce a revenue greater than the processing costs are flagged as potential plant feed and tabulated as mineral resources. Blocks where the revenue does not exceed the processing cost are flagged as waste. 
 
 11.13.4 QP Statement 
 The QP is of the opinion that any issues that arise in relation to relevant technical and economic factors likely to influence the prospect of economic extraction can be resolved with further work. The mineral resource estimates are performed for deposits that are in a well-documented geological setting the district has seen nearly a decade of active open pit operations conducted by PVDJ2 PVDJ2 is familiar with the economic parameters required for successful operations in the Dominican Republic area and PVDJ2 has a history of being able to obtain and maintain permits, social license and meet environmental standards in the Dominican Republic. There is sufficient time in the 22-year timeframe considered for the commodity price forecast for PVDJ2 to address any issues that may arise, or perform appropriate additional drilling, testwork and engineering studies to mitigate identified issues with the estimates.

12.0 MINERAL RESERVE ESTIMATES 
 
 12.1 Introduction 
 Measured and indicated mineral resources were converted to mineral reserves. Mineral reserves include mineralization within the Monte Negro, Moore, and Cumba open pits, and stockpiled material. All inferred blocks are classified as waste in the cashflow analysis that supports mineral reserve estimation. 
 
 12.2 Pit Optimization 
 Economic pit shells were generated using the Lerchs Grossmann algorithm within Whittle software and then used in the open pit mine design process and mineral reserve estimation. 
 Pit shell generation was constrained by infrastructure and permitting limits where applicable. Pit shells were based on a combination of measured, indicated, and Inferred mineral resources. The inclusion of inferred is only for ultimate pit limit determination purposes, and no Inferred material is included in the mineral reserves or contributes to revenue in economic analysis supporting the mineral reserves. 
 Grades relevant to the economic value calculation for each block are gold, silver, sulfide and sulfur. Various economic parameters were used to estimate the block value and resultant ore or waste categorization of the blocks within the ultimate pit shell. 
 
 12.3 Optimization Inputs and Assumptions 
 The pit slope, metallurgical recovery, and commodity price optimization inputs are summarized in Table 12-1. 
 Mining considerations included 
 Operational considerations with respect to active mining area interaction and ramp usage from the exit from the pit bottom 
 Ramp connections, ramp placement, and ramp exits 
 Minimum mining width of 50 m 
 The existing topography and target final pit limits. 
 Pit designs are full crest and toe detailed designs with final ramps based on the selected optimum pit shells. Pit designs honor geotechnical guidelines. 
 Metallurgical recoveries will vary depending on the process stream to which the material is directed. Given the processing costs are dependent on the sulfur grade and recoveries vary with material type, the NSR cut-off grade for a block with an average sulfur grade of 8.2 is approximately US 45.23 t. The LOM plan average process recoveries for pit and stockpile feed are forecast at 90 for gold and 65 for silver.

 The mine plan is based on a mill throughput assumption of approximately 14 Mt a. 
 
 12.4 Ore Loss and Dilution 
 The block model used for mine planning has a regular block size of 10 x 10 x 10 m which represents a practical mining unit size, suitable for the equipment in use at the operation. Grades are smoothed over this block size, with the mining recovery and dilution being considered inherent with the resource model block. 
 No additional mining recovery or dilution assumptions were applied for the optimization and block value calculations. 
 
 12.5 Stockpiles 
 Stockpile estimates were based on truck dispatch data. 
 Stockpiles were typically established with similar material types, although given the large volumes and limited areas for storage, there are various ore types and grade categories interspersed throughout the stockpiles occasionally with low grade material stockpiles overlaying higher grade portions.

13.0 MINING METHODS 
 
 13.1 Introduction 
 Open pit mining is conducted using conventional techniques and an Owner-operated conventional drill, blast, truck and shovel fleet. 
 
 13.2 Geotechnical Considerations 
 The four main geotechnical domains in the open pit are summarized in Table 13-1, and domain locations are shown in Figure 13-1. Slope designs assume the following parameters 
 Shallow slopes (inter-ramp angle (IRA) 16 for carbonaceous sediments susceptible to sliding along weak fabrics and governed by the need to achieve stable inter-ramp and overall slopes 
 Moderate slopes (IRA 26 38 in cover and clays of up to four benches and for carbonaceous sediments that are not susceptible to sliding along weak fabrics 
 Steep slopes (IRA 40 in volcanic rocks and limestones are governed by the need to manage short-term rock fall risks and maintain productivity. 
 Geotechnical berms associated with maximum inter-ramp slope heights (or stack heights) were introduced into the designs to improve overall mine design reliability by vertically separating slopes for planned geotechnical risk management and as a provision for mine dewatering infrastructure. 
 Additional investigative drilling and ground characterization and the installation of pore pressure monitoring instrumentation were performed by PVDJ2 personnel and third-party consultants, SRK Consultants. Rock mass and minor structure model updates were performed by third-party consultants, Red Rock Geotechnical. 
 PVDJ2 considers that the slope design parameters and depressurization strategy adopted for the life-of-mine plan are appropriate for the Project. The current parameters are more conservative than previously proposed, and are designed to incorporate residual risks and uncertainty through the introduction of geotechnical berms (or slope decoupling berms). 
 
 13.3 Hydrogeological Considerations 
 Pumping rates for the Monte Negro and Moore pits range from 7 10 L s and 12 17 L s, respectively, depending on availability of storage and pump utilization.

Highly anisotropic, extremely weak and persistent fabric of bedding planes and sub-parallel faults and shears dipping to the southwest. Friction angles typically ranging from 17 19 . Carbonaceous sediments are low permeability and difficult to depressurize in a tropical setting with continuous groundwater recharge from precipitation. The north and east walls of the pit require active dewatering and horizontal drains to maintain reduced pore pressures. The majority of outcrops in the LOM plan occur on the north and east walls within the Moore and Monte Negro zones, where susceptibility to instability along the extremely weak fabric is most prominent. Instability has occurred several times in previous interim pit slopes. Volcanic rocks UCS is 30 MPa. GSI ranges from 50 65. Volcanic rocks are generally considered isotropic, with geological structures being less persistent and more variable in their orientation. Depressurizes relatively quickly with the existing pumping and horizontal drilling practices. Limestone Typical UCS of 70 MPa and GSI of 60. Mildly anisotropic. Bedding dips southwest.

 Technical Report Summary 

13.4 Operations 
 The remaining mine life is projected to be 19 years, until 2041. Processing of low-grade stockpiles will continue to 2044 with limestone mining completing in 2043. 
 A stockpiling strategy is practiced. The mine plan considers the value of the blocks mined on a continuous basis, together with an assessment of the expected dor quality. From time to time, material with a lower NSR value will be stockpiled to bring forward the processing of higher-value ore earlier in the LOM. 
 The LOM plan assumes a nominal rate of approximately 14 Mt a milling throughput until the end of 2037 with milling rates decreasing until 2044, the end of mine life. The total tonnage moved is variable and is based on levelling haulage truck requirements. 
 A final pit layout plan showing the pit phases is provided in Figure 13-2. 
 Operations use a standard drill-and-blast, truck-and-shovel configuration. The ramp design comprises two traffic lanes, safety berms and ditches. The final pit design is based on the following design parameters 
 Bench height is 10 m for pits, single and double-benching by sectors 
 Main haul roads are designed with 35 m width and maximum 10 gradient 
 Roads within the carbonaceous sediments geotechnical domain are designed to be 40 m for residual geotechnical risk 
 In-pit single-lane haul roads (typically to within 3 x 10 m benches of pit bottom) have a design width of 20 m and a maximum gradient of 12 
 The minimum mining width for phase design is in general targeted to be 60 m however, locally can reduce to 40 m. 
 
 13.5 Blasting and Explosives 
 Blasting patterns are designed to accommodate various drilling equipment with consideration to factors including geotechnics, material type and hardness, and ore location. Blast holes are drilled using a variety of drill hole diameters and hole depths based on the objective and expected results. 
 Explosives are supplied and loaded into blast holes by an explosive s contractor. Emulsion or ammonium nitrate fuel oil (ANFO) is used, depending on the blasting conditions, together with various packaged explosives and initiation systems as required. Appropriate powder factors are used to match ore, and waste types based on required fragmentation and other outcomes.

 13.6 Grade Control 
 Grade control is achieved through a close-spaced RC grade control program that uses a grid spacing of 15 m (northing) by 10 m (easting) for ore and a grid spacing of 30 m (northing) by 20 m (easting) in waste areas. Multiple benches are targeted using 24 48 m long angled holes. Samples are taken on a 2 m interval. 
 
 13.7 Stockpiles 
 Stockpiles are designed to be reclaimed in various phases throughout the LOM. A stockpile optimization was performed as guidance for stockpile phase sequencing. The typical stockpile design is based on a bench height of 10 m and a 7 m berm width. 
 The LOM plan requires stockpiling of approximately 185 Mt in stockpiles.

 Technical Report Summary 

13.8 Waste Rock Storage Facilities 
 As part of the closure requirements pertinent to environmental permitting, all potentially acid generating (PAG) waste must be stored in anaerobic conditions to minimize the acid generating potential. Typically, PAG waste and tailings are sent to the TSF facilities but disposal can also include back-filling the mined-out pits to an elevation below the natural water table level. 
 Due to sequencing of the completion of the Llagal TSF and the commissioning of the Naranjo TSF, PAG waste has had to be temporarily stored in above-ground facilities. The PAG waste will be ultimately rehandled into in-pit voids and the Naranjo TSF. The Hondo PAG facility can store about 150 Mt of PAG waste and low-grade ore. The key design considerations for this facility are acid rock drainage surface water runoff management and geotechnical constraints. 
 Pit backfilling is expected to start in 2030 and continue until the end of the LOM, with a planned capacity of 163 Mt of PAG waste. The Naranjo TSF is expected to be able to receive PAG waste in 2025, with tailings storage commencing in 2027. To minimize mining costs, a near-pit crusher with an overland conveyor system to a bulk material stacking system will be constructed. Construction is expected to start in 2025. 
 NAG waste material is currently placed mined-out areas of the open pits. After 2025, all NAG material resulting from the quarries and pits will be deposited in a NAG stockpile to be located to the northwest of the open pits, or placed within mined-out sections of the quarries, when available. 
 The waste rock storage facilities are based on typical design considerations of a 20 m bench height and a 14 m bench width. NAG facility designs include closure considerations such as final reclamation slopes and surface drainages for revegetation. 
 The LOM plan requires placement of about 517 Mt in waste rock storage facilities (WRSFs). 
 
 13.9 Limestone Quarries 
 Limestone is extracted from quarries to support the LOM process plan, and the proposed TSF expansion. The limestone is classified as either quality limestone or NAG waste. Waste rock from the quarries is generally classified as NAG, and taken to dedicated NAG storage facilities. 
 Quarry designs and extents are designed using commercial mining software. The limestone quarry production schedule is based on process plant requirements and the material requirement for TSF construction activities. 
 Blasthole sampling is used to determine the CaO SiO 2 . However, the clay content is visually logged. The estimated tonnages of available limestone are based on approximately 150 m spaced drilling. This spacing is sufficient to locate and model the limestone lithologies however, the logging does not allow for limestone quality to be assessed. The quality can only be assessed once clay logging data are available. Currently the limestone models use a call factor based on historical performance to derive quantities of different limestone quality for longer-term planning purposes. 
 A combined total of 474 Mt of material will be mined from the quarries over the LOM of this total, 293 Mt is considered to be quality limestone for processing and other requirements such as TSF construction.

Cyanide destruction circuit 
 Tailings effluent and acid rock drainage (ARD) water treatment plant circuit 
 Tailings disposal facility. 
 ROM ore is crushed to the optimum crushing size of P 80 130 mm in a primary gyratory crusher which is reclaimed from the crushing station dump pocket by an apron feeder and conveyed directly to the coarse ore stockpile. Ore is reclaimed from the coarse ore stockpile using apron feeders located in a tunnel under the stockpile. The apron feeders discharge onto a conveyor belt feeding the SAG mill. The ore is ground to a P 80 of 80 m in a SABC circuit. The SAG mill is in a closed circuit with a vibrating screen and a pebble crusher, while the ball mill is in a closed circuit with hydrocyclones. The cyclone overflow is thickened to approximately 50 solids and pumped to the autoclave feed storage tanks, which also serve to blend the ore to allow a more gradual and constant sulfur feed grade to the pressure oxidation circuit. 
 This ore slurry is pumped to the autoclaves where it is oxidized for 60 minutes at a temperature of 225 C and a pressure of 3,100 kPag. The oxidized slurry is flash discharged, and the steam produced is condensed in the quench tower and scrubber systems. 
 The oxidized slurry is sent to the hot cure tanks, where it is maintained at 90 C for 12 hours. In this process, the basic ferric sulfate is redissolved into the solution, which allows for a much lower neutralization cost using limestone. 
 The cured slurry is washed in a three-stage CCD circuit to remove the dissolved metal sulfates and sulfuric acid from the slurry. 
 The washed slurry is pumped to the lime boil preheat vessel, which is reheated to 95 C using steam from the autoclave flash discharge. The reheated slurry is treated with lime and maintained at more than 85 C to break down jarosite to liberate silver. 
 The lime boil slurry is then cooled to 50 C in a slurry cooling tower and pumped to the CIL cyanidation circuit, where gold and silver are extracted using cyanide and activated carbon. 
 The CCD wash thickener overflow, containing more than 99 of the dissolved metal sulfates and sulfuric acid, is used to condense the flash vapor in the autoclave quench systems and consequently contributes to reducing emissions to the atmosphere. The solution, at 95 100 C, is sent to the ferric iron precipitation tanks for partial neutralization using limestone. The resulting slurry is pumped to a high-density sludge neutralization circuit, where it is treated with limestone and lime to precipitate the remaining metal sulfates. The sludge is thickened and pumped to the TSF after blending with the CIL tailings. The high-density sludge thickener overflow is cooled in a series of solution cooling towers to less than 40 C and recycled back to the CCD wash circuit. 
 The lime and limestone required for the lime boil and neutralization process are produced on-site. Limestone quarries southwest of the open pits are developed to supply the required limestone for the process and the tailings dam construction. 
 The limestone and lime plant consist of the following

 Technical Report Summary 

Lime slaking ball mill circuit. 
 The limestone used for the process is first crushed in a gyratory crusher and then conveyed to a vibrating screen to separate the material between 50 100 mm, which will be suitable for the lime kilns. The finer and coarser materials are sent to the limestone grinding circuit, where it is ground in a SAG ball mill circuit to produce a fine limestone slurry with a P 80 of 60 m used in the neutralization and ARD treatment processes. 
 The midsized limestone is conveyed to three large lime vertical kilns, fired by heavy fuel oil to produce lime which is subsequently slaked to produce the milk of lime used in the grinding, lime boil, effluent treatment and final neutralization processes. 
 The loaded carbon from CIL is acid-washed and stripped using the Zadra elution process. Gold and silver in the pregnant eluate are recovered by electrowinning. The gold sludge is dried, retorted to remove the mercury, fluxed, and smelted to produce dor bullion bars. The stripped carbon is reactivated in horizontal carbon kilns and recycled back to the CIL cyanidation circuit. The carbon kilns are equipped with mercury absorbers to remove mercury from the off-gases. 
 The plant includes a cyanide destruction process, using the INCO process, for the CIL tails slurry. The INCO process includes the use of sulfur dioxide and air as the cyanide destruction reagents. Sulfur dioxide is supplied from a sulfur burner plant. A copper sulfate solution is added to provide the copper ions that act as a catalyst during the detoxification process. 
 
 14.4 Expansion Project 
 The expansion project will expand processing operations from 8.6 Mt a to approximately 14 Mt a, thereby allowing treatment of lower-grade ores. The expansion will also increase the TSF capacity to support a longer mine life. The intention is not to install an additional autoclave but rather to upgrade low-grade ore by installing a flotation circuit and to modify the existing four autoclaves by including a flash recycle thickening circuit, which will assist in increasing the capacity and the residence time in the autoclaves. 
 The expansion project is divided into the following phases 
 Phase 1 (Z1) optimize existing equipment 
 Phase 2 (Z2) installation of additional equipment to achieve the increased throughput 
 Phase 3 (Z3) increase in sulfur grade in 2032 from 6.4 to 7.4 no changes to plant design. 
 The expansion will include a new primary crusher and single-stage SAG milling circuit that is being added parallel to the existing grinding circuit. The existing SABC circuit will have the capability to feed the flotation plant as required. A dedicated crushed ore stockpile will feed the new single-stage SAG milling circuit. The overflow from the primary cyclones in the single-stage SAG milling circuit will be fed into two parallel flotation trains, each consisting of a surge tank, a conditioning tank and a rougher scavenger bank. Approximately a third of the total feed material will be able to bypass flotation and report directly to the POX feed thickener. The flotation tails will be thickened, and gold will be recovered in a float tails CIL circuit. The float tails CIL material will be sent for cyanide destruction before final disposal to the existing TSF. 
 The flotation concentrate will be thickened in the grinding thickener before being pumped to the existing autoclave feed tanks. The concentrate will then be pressure-oxidized in the autoclaves,

and discharged into a cooling tank that will feed to the hot cure circuit, which will dissolve any ferric sulfate that forms during pressure oxidation. 
 The hot-cured slurry will be gravity fed to a CCD washing circuit to remove sulfuric acid and dissolved metal sulfates. The underflow from the CCD will be pumped to a lime boil preheat vessel and then to lime boil tanks for the liberation of silver. The lime boil slurry will be cooled in slurry cooling towers and pumped to the existing CIL circuit. 
 The CCD thickener overflow will be used to quench the off-gas and steam from the autoclave circuit. The heated solution will be gravity fed to the ferric precipitation, where limestone and air will be used to precipitate iron from the solution. The iron sludge will be sent from the iron precipitation reactors to neutralization to treat the remaining acid and dissolved metals to form a high-density sludge. The resulting high-density sludge will be thickened and pumped to the TSF.

 Technical Report Summary 

15.4 Waste Rock Storage Facilities 
 The WRSFs are discussed in Chapter 13.8., and locations were shown on Figure 2-2. 
 
 15.5 Tailings Storage Facilities 
 The current Llagal TSF was created by constructing an engineered embankment structure across the El Llagal valley, approximately 3.5 km south of the plant site, in a tributary of the Rio Maguaca (see location in Figure 2-2). The Llagal TSF is expected to be filled to its design limit in 2027, after which tailings are proposed to be placed in a new TSF, the Naranjo TSF. From 2025 until 2041, PAG waste rock from the mine is also planned to be deposited into the Naranjo TSF. 
 The proposed Naranjo TSF will be located 5.5 km southeast of the process plant and 1 km east of the Llagal TSF (refer to Figure 2-2), in the upper Rio Vuelta catchment, a tributary of the Rio Maguaca. The Naranjo TSF catchment will cover an area of about 14.3 km 2 , will have a maximum height of 150 m, crest length of about 3,800 m, and a combined tailings and PAG waste storage capacity of approximately 500 Mm 3 . The current design allows for expansion to a capacity of about 645 Mm 3 if required in the future. 
 The Naranjo TSF embankment will be formed by the construction of an inclined core, zoned earth and rockfill zones adopting the downstream raise construction method. The TSF was designed with adequate flood storage capacity to minimize the risk of any discharge of contact water to the environment. An emergency spillway is included in the design. Over the LOM, the combined tailings stream will be delivered to the TSFs by pipelines, for sub-aerial deposition from the upstream crest of the TSF embankment into the impoundment. 
 The Naranjo TSF dam will be designed for an Extreme consequence classification, which is consistent with Barrick s Tailings Management Standard (March 7, 2022) and the Global Industry Standard on Tailings Management (GISTM, August 2020). The dam design meets or exceeds design criteria associated with the Extreme consequence classification and in accordance GISTM and Canadian Dam Association (CDA) dam safety guidelines and technical bulletins (CDA, 2007, 2013, and 2019). 
 The Naranjo TSF will have a net positive water balance and over time will accumulate water in the reclaim pond. Accumulated process water will be sent to the reclaim water tank at the process plant via a system of barge-mounted pumps and pipelines, for re-use in the process plant or treatment at the effluent treatment plant prior to discharge into the Rio Margajita or Rio Maguaca. Water discharged into rivers will meet Dominican government standards for discharge water quality. 
 Construction water management structures, including diversion dams and channels, are required upstream of the Naranjo TSF starter dam embankments to divert surface water flows around the work area during initial construction. The High consequence classification and associated design criteria are currently adopted for the construction water management diversion dam, in accordance with CDA dam safety guidelines and technical bulletins. 
 Seepage from the TSFs is, and will be, collected in seepage recovery dams, located a short distance downstream of the main TSF embankments. A pumping and piping system returns collected seepage back into the reclaim pond inside the TSF impoundment. A High

consequence classification and associated design criteria are currently adopted for the seepage recovery dams, in accordance with CDA dam safety guidelines and technical bulletins. 
 A groundwater impacts model was prepared for the Naranjo TSF, which concluded that impacts to groundwater (above Dominican government limits for groundwater quality) are limited to a short distance downstream of the Naranjo TSF. A significant portion of any seepage from under the Naranjo TSF embankment will either report directly to the embankment blanket drain or will surface in the Rio Vuelta a short distance downstream of the embankment, for collection and pump-back by the seepage recovery dam system. Modelling demonstrates that contaminant loading from seepage into the Rio Maguaca will be very low and the base flow water quality in the Rio Maguaca will remain within regulatory limits at the selected compliance point. 
 
 15.6 Effluent Treatment Plant 
 The process includes an effluent treatment plant to treat the combined flows of tailings effluent and the ARD generated in the Rio Margarita drainage basin from previous mining activities. The ARD collects in storage facilities located at Dam 1 and Dam 3 and is then pumped with barge pumps to the effluent treatment and process plants. 
 The effluent treatment plant comprises two stages of neutralization 
 Limestone is used in the first stage to raise the pH to approximately 6.2, and lime is used in the second stage to raise the pH to 8.5 
 The treated acidic liquor is then fed to a clarifier to remove the sludge in the underflow and produce a clear overflow for discharge to the environment. 
 The chemically stable sludge produced in the plant is pumped to the TSFs for permanent storage. 
 
 15.7 Water Management 
 The operations are in proximity to three watersheds 
 Rio Margajita 
 Rio Maguaca 
 Rio El Rey. 
 The main facilities involved in water management are summarized in Table 15-1 and a water flowsheet is included as Figure 15-1. 
 The process water supply is discussed in Chapter 14.6.3. 
 Reclaim water from the TSF is, and will be, pumped to the fresh water pond. Reclaim water is pumped directly to both the effluent treatment plant and the expansion process water tank.

The plant site is located on a ridge between two drainage catchments. Where possible, runoff from the process plant is directed to the Rio Margajita drainage area to separate it from the storm water runoff from historical mining facilities. Otherwise, a collection pond captures the runoff before it is returned to the process plant to serve as make-up water. 
 
 15.8 Camps and Accommodation 
 On-site accommodation consists of an approximately 430-bed camp with full dining, laundry and recreational facilities. 
 
 15.9 Power and Electrical 
 The Pueblo Viejo Operations are supplied with electric power from two sources via two independent 230 kV transmission circuits. The operational power requirements are currently less than the capacity of the power sources. 
 The primary source of electric power for the mine is the PVDJ2 owned and operated Quisqueya 1 power plant, which is located near the city of San Pedro de Macoris. A single 114 km long 230 kV circuit directly connects the 215 MW Quisqueya 1 power plant to the Pueblo Viejo Mine Substation. A second 138 km long 230 kV circuit connects the Quisqueya 1 power plant with Bonao III Substation, which is then connected to the Pueblo Viejo Mine Substation via another 27 km long 230 kV circuit. The Pueblo Viejo Mine Substation is connected to the mine. 
 The secondary source of electric power for the mine is the Dominican Republic s national power grid, referred to as the Systema Electrico Nacional Interconectado (SENI). The Pueblo Viejo Mine is interconnected to the SENI via the 250 and 350 MVA rated Piedra Blanca Substation step-up transformers. The SENI interconnection is capable of providing the full electric power requirements of the mine. 
 The mine peak load to date is 150 MW and the average load at full production is approximately 140 MW thus, the Quisqueya 1 power plant s capacity exceeds the mine load. Excess power from the Quisqueya 1 power plant is currently transmitted to Bonao III Substation and sold to various SENI customers at the grid marginal price. 
 It is expected that the mine average load at full production, once the expansion project is completed, will exceed the Quisqueya Power production in about 2026. Additional power to support the LOM plan will be sourced either from the grid or from a solar plant that is currently in the planning stage. 
 Power is distributed through the site from the mine main substation via a single 230 kV bus system. In addition, four main transformers provide power for all site loads, with two being dedicated to the oxygen plants. The operational steady-state energy demand (including expansion loads) was calculated as 493,973 kW, with the new SAG mill being the only load of critical relevance to the energy demand. The new SAG mill is a 23 MW gearless motor drive. 
 Power consumption in 2022 was 1,061 MW, and the 2023 forecast is approximately 1,352 MW. The assumed average consumption for the period 2024 to the end of mine life is about 1,340 MW.

16.0 MARKET STUDIES AND CONTRACTS 
 
 16.1 Market Studies 
 Barrick has established contracts and buyers for the dor product from the Pueblo Viejo Operations, and has an internal marketing group that monitors markets for its key products. Together with public documents and analyst forecasts, these data support that there is a reasonable basis to assume that, for the LOM plan, the key products will be saleable at the assumed commodity pricing. 
 There are no agency relationships relevant to the marketing strategies used. 
 Product valuation is included in the economic analysis in Chapter 22, and is based on a combination of the metallurgical recovery, commodity pricing, and consideration of processing charges. 
 
 16.2 Commodity Price Forecasts 
 Barrick, as operator, provides the commodity price guidance. Barrick uses a combination of historical and current contract pricing, contract negotiations, knowledge of its key markets from a long operations production record, short-term versus long-term price forecasts prepared by the company s internal marketing group, public documents, and analyst forecasts when considering long-term commodity price forecasts. 
 Higher metal prices are used for the mineral resource estimates to ensure the mineral reserves are a sub-set of, and not constrained by, the mineral resources, in accordance with industry-accepted practice. 
 The long-term commodity price and exchange rate forecasts are 
 Mineral resources 
 Gold US 1,700 oz

 16.3 Contracts 
 Bullion is sold on the spot market, by marketing experts retained in-house by Barrick. Barrick provides Newmont with the date and number of ounces that will be credited to Newmont s account, and invoices Newmont for how much Newmont is owed, such that Newmont receives credits for the ounces (based on the JV interest) and Newmont pays Barrick for the ounces. The

17.2.1 Water 
 The following guidelines are used to develop and implement the mine water management systems 
 Dominican Republic Water Quality Standards 
 International Finance Corporation Water Quality Guidelines 
 International Cyanide Management Code 
 Barrick Water Conservation Standard 
 Barrick Principles for Tailings Management. 
 Mine development is designed to treat most of the surface water that has been impacted by historical mining activity, control water quality during mine operations, and post closure so that the water released to the receiving environment will meet water quality standards established by the Dominican Republic government. The process treated water is discharged to the Rio Margajita. The point for water quality monitoring is the outfall of the effluent treatment plant. A secondary point located at the confluence of the Rio Margajita and the Hatillo Reservoir serves as a reference point for a better understanding of water quality interaction of discharged water and the reservoir. 
 Contact water from the mining areas is captured at ARD1, located in the headwaters of Rio Margajita. The water level within ARD1 is always maintained at the lowest possible level to provide sufficient storage. ARD1 is designed with a geomembrane liner to limit seepage. It is also constructed with spillways designed to pass the probable maximum flood resulting from the 24-hour probable maximum precipitation. 
 ARD3 was backfilled to assist with pit stability and the area is now used as a ROM pad. 
 Additionally, a new ARD dam (ARD4) to collect contact water is in the study and design engineering stage of development. 
 Limestone and lime requirements for the water treatment plant were estimated based on the results of pH at the high-density sludge plant. The pH discharge criterion used for the test was 8.5 to 9.0, which meets the Dominican Republic Standards for Mining Effluents and Receiving Water Quality applicable to mining effluents discharged to surface water (pH 6.0 to 9.0). 
 
 17.2.2 Cyanide Treatment 
 Cyanide in the tailings stream is routed to the cyanide-detoxification process to destroy most of the cyanide. The effluent from the process is blended with mill neutralization sludge prior to pumping to the TSF. A similar process will be followed when the Naranjo TSF is commissioned. Further degradation of cyanide in the tailings is expected to occur at a level that meets discharge criteria which are, based on the NA-CDAS-2012 Metallic Mining standard

 17.3 Closure and Reclamation Considerations 
 
 17.3.1 Closure Obligations Associated with Historical Mining Activities 
 The Rosario Dominicana mine operated prior to June 1999. Previous development included the mining of two main open pits (Monte Negro and Moore) and several smaller open pits, 
 Date February 2023 Page 17-3 

Pueblo Viejo Operations 
 Dominican Republic 
 Technical Report Summary 

construction of a plant site, and construction of two tailings impoundments (Las Lagunas and Mejita). WRSFs and low-grade stockpiles from these operations are located throughout the pit areas. When the Rosario Dominicana operations shut down, proper closure and reclamation was not undertaken. The result was a legacy of polluted soil and water and contaminated infrastructure. 
 The major legacy environmental issue is ARD. It developed from exposure to air, water, and bacteria of sulfides occurring in the existing pit walls, WRSFs, and stockpiles. Untreated and uncontrolled ARD contaminated local streams and rivers and led to the deterioration of water quality and aquatic resources within operations area and offsite. 
 An updated Mine Closure Plan was prepared by third-party consultants Piteau Associates in September 2021, submitted to the government in December 2021, and is under review. The closure plan design includes several interrelated components such as legal and other obligations, closure objectives, environmental and social considerations, technical design criteria, closure assumptions, health and safety hazards, and relinquishment conditions. 
 The overall, long term post-closure land use objective for the site is to return it to a self-sustaining condition suitable to support pre-mining land use activities such as small-scale agriculture, hunting, and artisanal forestry. 
 PVDJ2 plans to progressively reclaim the mine site as sections of the site become available. 
 
 17.3.2 Closure Costs 
 The Environmental License requires a compliance bond that corresponds to 10 of the amount of the updated Environmental Adjustment and Management Plan defined for the operational phase. At the end of the operational phase, PVDJ2 will provide the corresponding bond at 10 of the total amount of the Environmental Adjustment and Management Plan for the closure and post-closure phases. 
 To cover closing costs, PVDJ2 has allocated funds in an escrow account and an insurance bond for the remaining funds required. 
 Closure costs used for the economic analysis in Chapter 19 are estimated at US 342 M. 
 
 17.4 Permitting 
 Permits to support current operations are in place. 
 The last modification of the environmental license for the mine site was granted in August 2020, and authorized modifications to the process plant and other auxiliary areas to support plans to extend the LOM. 
 A modification request was submitted to the Ministry of Environment on September 30, 2022 included information relating to additional proposed facilities. 
 The ESIA, submitted in October 2022, is expected to be approved by Dominican government in about Q2, 2023 (i.e., nine months after submittal) the ESIA is currently undergoing Dominican government review. PVDJ2 expects to amend the ESIA submission to incorporate the latest engineering details supporting the Naranjo TSF designs during Q1, 2023. 
 Date February 2023 Page 17-4 

Pueblo Viejo Operations 
 Dominican Republic 
 Technical Report Summary 

The Naranjo TSF location was one of the preferred site options selected by the Ministry of Energy and Mines and the Ministry of Environment. PVDJ2 will need to complete a detailed engineering study for the planned facility, and submit the detailed engineering designs to the relevant Dominican governmental authorities for review and approval. 
 The main in-stream dam construction activities require a separate permit from the National Water Resources Institute, which is the hydraulic resources unit of the Ministry of Environment. An application will be submitted to the National Water Resources Institute in Q3, 2023, following completion of applicable engineering studies. National Water Resources Institute approval is currently expected in about Q1, 2024. Approval will allow commencement of the main in-stream dam construction activities (requiring surface water diversion or storage). 
 All major permits and approvals are either in place or PVDJ2 expects to obtain them in the normal course of business. Where permits have specific terms, renewal applications are made of the relevant regulatory authority as required, prior to the end of the permit term. 
 
 17.5 Social Considerations, Plans, Negotiations and Agreements 
 
 17.5.1 Local Context 
 There are from 31 communities in the direct area of influence of the mining operations, and 26 in the indirect area of influence. These communities belong to nine municipalities within the Monse or Nouel, S nchez Ram rez, Monte Plata and San Pedro de Macor s provinces. 
 
 17.5.2 Social Management System 
 A Social Management System is in place, which includes the following Social Management Plans 
 Engagement and Disclosure 
 Land Acquisition and Involuntary Resettlement 
 Community Development (emphasizing education, capacity building, production, income generation and diversification, microenterprises, community water and preventive health) Local Content (local employment and development of local suppliers) 
 Community Safety 
 Support for Environmental Management 
 Monitoring and Evaluation. 
 The objective of the Engagement and Disclosure Plan is to maintain effective communication between PVDJ2, local authorities and the broader community within a framework of trust, transparency and mutual respect. This plan, together with the creation of strategic alliances, the empowerment of communities, and gender equality, is the foundation for the other management plans. 
 Plan activities include formal and informal meetings with stakeholders frequent visits to communities community involvement in identifying emerging issues and potential risks visits to one of the three information offices (one is located outside the mine to allow free community access, the second is in Cotu , the head municipality of the S nchez Ram rez province, and the

 Technical Report Summary 

third is in the area where the Quisqueya I power plant is situated) participatory community mapping, as well as the design and implementation of a grievance mechanism. 
 The grievance mechanism process is known and accepted by stakeholders as the method by which stakeholders can lodge issues, and PVDJ2 can address concerns, complaints or grievances concerning PVDJ2 s social and environmental performance. The concepts of complaints and grievances are the same as those used by international organizations and were agreed upon with the communities during the disclosure processes. 
 
 17.5.3 Resettlement 
 The process plant expansion project requires the construction and operation of the Naranjo TSF, which includes the construction of a conveyor. Seven communities will require resettlement, two for the proposed conveyor belt route, and five for the Naranjo TSF. 
 National legislation, and international standards such as the International Finance Corporation s PS 5 and the World Banks Environmental and Social Framework, require companies to prepare and implement a Resettlement Action Plan should projects trigger involuntary resettlement of project affected people. 
 PVDJ2 has land acquisition and involuntary resettlement, and livelihood restoration plans in place that comply with national law and international standards. 
 The resettlement process will be designed and executed entirely under PVDJ2 s responsibility, unlike the resettlement program for the construction of the Llagal TSF, which was the responsibility of the Dominican government. 
 Preliminary studies for the Naranjo TSF identified that approximately 3,500 ha are required, in which 985 households are expected to be affected by the Project, through physical and or economic displacement. An area of about 1,056 ha, south of the proposed Naranjo TSF location, will be required for perimeter roads and to act as a buffer around the facility itself. 
 Implementing the Resettlement Action Plan is an important step towards correctly defining and documenting the impacts generated by the resettlement process. This is to ensure that management and compensation measures are widely disclosed to the individuals, family groups and communities that the Naranjo TSF project will impact. 
 PVDJ2 contracted the services of an expert consultant to prepare a Livelihood Restoration Plan for the communities to be resettled. This plan includes preparing family life plans aligning Livelihood Restoration Plan with national initiatives strengthening territorial management and leadership accompaniment in the identification, design and implementation of economic activities and design implementation of a monitoring, follow-up and evaluation system. 
 
 17.5.4 Community Development 
 The Community Development Plan includes the participation of all stakeholders implementing initiatives. The plan promotes the sustainable development of the communities near the Project, and supports investment programs that are prioritized through a participatory process. These areas of investment in development are aligned with Barrick s 2030 Sustainable Development Goals.

 Technical Report Summary 

One of the most important Community Development programs is the AgroEmprende project which will also support the Livelihood Restoration Program. It is a voluntary and discretionary program that offers tools to enhance the restoration of livelihoods of resettled households, as well as assistance to farmers in the project's area of influence. Local Content 
 The Local Content Plan (local employment and development of local suppliers) is intended to expand employment opportunities for local community through skilled, semi-skilled and unskilled roles. 
 PVDJ2 s Human Resources department, with the support of PVDJ2 s Community Engagement and Development team, implements specific learning programs to 
 Provide on-the-job training to local workers 
 Increase employment opportunities for the communities impacted by the operations 
 Guarantee good technical training in collaboration with technical-vocational education institutions and universities 
 Maximize the transfer of skills and technical knowledge of expatriate workers during the construction and operation phase to provide long-term benefits and employment opportunities to local communities 
 Maintain a dynamic succession planning system that identifies and develops high potentials. 
 PVDJ2 s Community Engagement and Development team, with the involvement of PVDJ2 s Supply Chain department, is responsible for a community business incubation and acceleration program to guarantee access to local businesses near the company, through 
 Initiatives to strengthen local suppliers and create new suppliers 
 The inclusion of local suppliers for goods and services 
 Compliance with clauses to contractors to ensure a percentage of goods and services are locally purchased. 
 
 17.5.5 Community Health and Safety 
 The Community Safety Plan is aimed at strengthening the capacity of communities and emergency response agencies to prevent health and safety risks during the construction of the expansion project and operations. 
 It is designed to reduce the potential impacts (security, health, access to basic services, among others) of a disorderly influx of new settlers in nearby communities or invasions of acquired land associated with the Naranjo TSF, and efficiently manage the settler influx with the support of local governments and residents of the communities near the new tailings facilities. 
 For these purposes, PVDJ2 s Community Engagement and Development, Safety and Security teams have prepared a Land Influx and Protection Management Plan to address operational safety and the safety of communities near the operations.

 Technical Report Summary 

17.5.6 Monitoring and Evaluation 
 PVDJ2 s Community Engagement and Development team has a social monitoring program in place, that is designed to manage data retention, information flow, follow-up activities, and compliance with aims set out in the Social Management Plans for reporting purposes and internal and external audits. 
 The team also evaluates sustainable program impacts. 
 
 17.6 Qualified Person s Opinion on Adequacy of Current Plans to Address Issues 
 Based on the information provided to the QP by Barrick and PVDJ2 (see Chapter 25), issues that may arise that will need careful management include the following 
 Ongoing consultation and engagement with those households affected by the resettlement required to construct the Naranjo TSF 
 Should further analysis of the Naranjo TSF indicate a larger than planned area is required, then PVDJ2 will need to complete further resettlement analysis and engagement with those affected. 
 The Dominican government is actively reviewing the modified ESIA that was lodged in October, 2022. Government representatives requested a meeting with PVDJ2 in January 2023. This active review and approval process may generate additional information requests or compliance activities from PVDJ2. 
 PVDJ2 is currently not responsible for rehabilitation of any of the Rosario Dominicana environmental liabilities, but has assumed the responsibility for administering the rehabilitation efforts on the Dominican government s behalf. 
 PVDJ2 has assumed for the purposes of the LOM plan and economic analysis in this Report that certain permits will be received by specific dates. If these are not approved or granted, there is a risk that some assumptions in the LOM plan and economic analysis may need to be modified to reflect the changed dates. 
 PVDJ2 was able to permit the existing operations, and currently has the social license to operate within the local communities. There is a reasonable expectation that issues arising in relation to the proposed expansion can be managed with appropriate dialogue, and if required, modifications to designs of major proposed infrastructure. PVDJ2 has some flexibility with the negotiation of any future compensation payments that may be provided to those affected by planned resettlement activities.

19.0 ECONOMIC ANALYSIS 
 Please refer to the note regarding forward-looking information at the front of the Report. 
 Table 19-1, Table 19-2, and Table 19-3 contain forward-looking statements within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, which are intended to be covered by the safe harbor created by such sections and other applicable laws. The cashflow is only intended to demonstrate the financial viability of the Project. Investors are cautioned that the above is based on a high-level mine plan and certain assumptions which may differ from Newmont s long-term outlook or actual financial results, including, but not limited to commodity prices, escalation assumptions and other technical inputs. For example, Table 19-1, Table 19-2, and Table 19-3 use the price assumptions stated in the tables, including a gold commodity price assumption of US 1,650 oz in 2023, followed by US 1,300 oz for the remaining years, which varies significantly from current gold prices and the assumptions that Newmont uses for its long-term guidance. Please be reminded that significant variation of metal prices, costs and other key assumptions may require modifications to mine plans, models, and prospects. 
 
 19.1 Methodology Used 
 The financial model that supports the mineral reserve declaration is a standalone model that calculates annual cash flows based on scheduled ore production, assumed processing recoveries, metal sale prices and Dominican peso US exchange rate, projected operating and capital costs and estimated taxes. 
 The financial analysis is based on an after-tax discount rate of 5 . All costs and prices are in unescalated real dollars. The currency used to document the cash flow is US . 
 All costs are based on the 2023 budget. Revenue is calculated from the recoverable metals and long-term metal price and exchange rate forecasts. 
 
 19.2 Financial Model Parameters 
 The economic analysis is based on the metallurgical recovery predictions in Chapter 10.4, the mineral reserve estimates in Chapter 12, the mine plan discussed in Chapter 13.10, the commodity price forecasts in Chapter 16, closure cost estimates in Chapter 17.3, and the capital and operating costs outlined in Chapter 18. Royalties were summarized in Chapter 3.2.5 and Chapter 3.8. 
 Taxation considerations include payment to the Dominican government of a net smelter return royalty of 3.2 based on gross revenues for gold and silver, a net profits interest of 28.75 based on an adjusted taxable cash flow, a corporate income tax of 25 based on adjusted net income, a withholding tax on interest paid on loans and on payments abroad, and other general tax obligations which include a graduated minimum tax. 
 The economic analysis is based on 100 equity financing and is reported on a 100 project ownership basis. The economic analysis assumes constant prices with no inflationary adjustments.

22.0 INTERPRETATION AND CONCLUSIONS 
 
 22.1 Introduction 
 The QP notes the following interpretations and conclusions, based on the review of data available for this Report. 
 
 22.2 Property Setting 
 The Pueblo Viejo Operations are located in an area that has more than nine years of mining activity by the joint venture with Barrick as operator. As a result, local and regional infrastructure and the supply of goods available to support mining operations is well-established. Personnel with experience in mining-related activities are available in the district. There are transportation routes that access the Project area. 
 There are no significant topographic or physiographic issues that would affect the Pueblo Viejo Operations. However, the Project is in a seismically-active region.

 22.5 Geology and Mineralization 
 The Pueblo Viejo deposit area is considered to be an example of a high-sulfidation epithermal deposit. 
 The geological understanding of the settings, lithologies, and structural and alteration controls on mineralization in the different zones is sufficient to support estimation of mineral resources and mineral reserves. The geological knowledge of the area is also considered sufficiently acceptable to reliably inform mine planning. 
 The mineralization style and setting are well understood and can support declaration of mineral resources and mineral reserves. 
 PVDJ2 continues to actively explore in the immediate and near-mine areas. 
 
 22.6 History 
 The Pueblo Viejo Operations have over nine years of currently active mining history, from 2013 onward. An initial mining phase ran from 1975 1991. 
 PVDJ2 and its predecessor company, Placer Dome, has had active exploration programs in the Project area since 2001. 
 
 22.7 Exploration, Drilling, and Sampling 
 The exploration programs completed to date are appropriate for the style of the mineralization within the Pueblo Viejo Operations area. 
 Date February 2023 Page 22-2 

Pueblo Viejo Operations 
 Dominican Republic 
 Technical Report Summary 

Sampling methods, sample preparation, analysis and security conducted prior to PVDJ2 s interest in the operations were in accordance with exploration practices and industry standards at the time the information was collected. Current sampling methods are acceptable for mineral resource and mineral reserve estimation. Sample preparation, analysis and security for the PVDJ2 programs are performed in accordance with current exploration practices and generally-accepted industry standards. 
 The quantity and quality of the lithological, geotechnical, collar and down-hole survey data collected during the exploration and delineation drilling programs and included in the database subset that supports estimation are sufficient to support mineral resource and mineral reserve estimation. The collected sample data adequately reflect deposit dimensions, true widths of mineralization, and the style of the deposits. Sampling is representative of the gold and silver grades in the deposit, reflecting areas of higher and lower grades. 
 The sample preparation, analysis, quality control, and security procedures used by the Pueblo Viejo Operations have changed over time to meet evolving industry practices. Practices at the time the information was collected were industry-standard. The sample preparation, analysis, quality control, and security procedures are sufficient to provide reliable data to support estimation of mineral resources and mineral reserves. 
 The QA QC programs adequately address issues of precision, accuracy and contamination. Modern drilling programs typically included blanks, duplicates and standard samples. QA QC submission rates meet industry-accepted standards. 
 Density measurements are considered to provide acceptable density values for use in mineral resource and mineral reserve estimation. However, density is considered under sampled. PVDJ2 advised Newmont that a program to increase density coverage is under way. 
 
 22.8 Data Verification 
 PVDJ2 had data collection procedures in place that included several verification steps designed to ensure database integrity. PVDJ2 staff also conducted regular logging, sampling, laboratory and database reviews. The process of active database quality control and internal and external audits generally resulted in quality data. 
 The data collected from the Pueblo Viejo Operations area adequately support the geological interpretations and constitute a database of sufficient quality to support the use of the data in mineral resource and mineral reserve estimation. 
 Data that were verified on upload to the database are acceptable for use in mineral resource and mineral reserve estimation. 
 The QP performed a site visit in November 2022. Observations made during the visit, in conjunction with discussions with site-based technical staff also support the geological interpretations, and analytical and database quality. The QP s personal inspection supports the use of the data in mineral resource and mineral reserve estimation, and in mine planning. 
 
 22.9 Metallurgical Testwork 
 Industry-standard studies were performed as part of process development and initial mill design. Subsequent production experience and focused investigations guided mill alterations and 
 Date February 2023 Page 22-3 

Pueblo Viejo Operations

 Technical Report Summary 

process changes. Testwork programs, both internal and external, continue to be performed to support current operations and potential improvements. From time to time, this may lead to requirements to adjust cut-off grades, modify the process flowsheet, or change reagent additions and plant parameters to meet quality, production, and economic targets. 
 Samples selected for testing were representative of the various types and styles of mineralization. Samples were selected from a range of depths within the deposit. Sufficient samples were taken so that tests were performed on sufficient sample mass. 
 Forecast average life-of-mine recoveries for the expanded plant are approximately 90 for gold and 65 for silver. 
 There are no deleterious elements from a processing perspective. Elements such as total carbon, organic carbon, total sulfur, and sulfide sulfur are managed using blending. 
 
 22.10 Mineral Resource Estimates 
 Estimation was performed by PVDJ2 personnel. Modelling was performed in Leapfrog and resource estimates were performed in Vulcan software. 
 Mineral resources are reported using the mineral resource definitions set out in SK1300, and are reported exclusive of those mineral resources converted to mineral reserves. The reference point for the estimate is in situ. Mineral resources are reported on a 100 basis. Newmont currently holds a 40 Project interest. The remaining 60 interest is held by Barrick, the Project operator. 
 Areas of uncertainty that may materially impact the mineral resource estimates include changes to long-term commodity price assumptions changes in local interpretations of mineralization geometry and continuity of mineralized zones changes to geological shape and continuity assumptions changes to metallurgical recovery assumptions changes to the operating cut-off assumptions for mill feed or stockpile feed changes to the input assumptions used to derive the conceptual open pit outlines used to constrain the estimate changes to drill hole spacing assumptions changes to the cut-off grades used to constrain the estimates variations in geotechnical, hydrogeological and mining assumptions changes to governmental regulations changes to environmental assessments and changes to environmental, permitting and social license assumptions. 
 Density is considered under sampled. PVDJ2 advised Newmont that a program to increase density coverage is under way. Use of the currently-available data is supported by PVDJ2 s operational history of the Project. 
 
 22.11 Mineral Reserve Estimates 
 Mineral reserves were converted from measured and indicated mineral resources. Inferred mineral resources were set to waste. Estimation was performed by PVDJ2 personnel. 
 All current mineral reserves will be exploited using open pit mining methods, or are in stockpiles. 
 Mineral reserves amenable to open pit mining methods were estimated assuming open pit methods with conventional methods for drilling, blasting, loading with hydraulic shovels and haulage by large trucks. 
 Date February 2023 Page 22-4 

Pueblo Viejo Operations 
 Dominican Republic 
 Technical Report Summary 

Mineral resources were converted to mineral reserves using a detailed mine plan, an engineering analysis, and consideration of appropriate modifying factors. Modifying factors include open pit mining methods, metallurgical recoveries, environmental, permitting and infrastructure requirements. 
 Mineral reserves are reported using the mineral resource definitions set out in SK1300. The reference point for the estimate is the point of delivery to the process facilities. Mineral reserves are reported on a 100 basis. Newmont currently holds a 40 Project interest. The remaining 60 interest is held by Barrick, the Project operator. 
 Areas of uncertainty that may materially impact the mineral reserve estimates include changes to long-term metal price and exchange rate assumptions changes to metallurgical recovery assumptions changes to the input assumptions used to derive the pit designs applicable to the open pit mining methods used to constrain the estimates changes to the forecast dilution and mining recovery assumptions changes to the cut-off values applied to the estimates variations in geotechnical (including seismicity), hydrogeological and mining method assumptions and changes to environmental, permitting and social license assumptions. 
 
 22.12 Mining Methods 
 Mining operations can be conducted year-round. 
 Open pit mining is conducted using conventional techniques and an Owner-operated conventional truck and shovel fleet. The open pit mine plans are appropriately developed to maximize mining efficiencies, based on the current knowledge of geotechnical, hydrological, mining and processing information on the Project. 
 The LOM plan assumes a nominal rate of approximately 14 Mt a milling throughput until the end of 2037, with milling rates decreasing starting in 2038. 
 The remaining mine life is projected to be 19 years, until 2041. Processing of low-grade stockpiles will continue to 2044 with limestone mining completing in 2043. 
 As part of day-to-day operations, PVDJ2 will continue to perform reviews of the mine plan and consider alternatives to, and variations within, the plan. Alternative scenarios and reviews may be based on ongoing or future mining considerations, evaluation of different potential input factors and assumptions, and corporate directives. 
 
 22.13 Recovery Methods 
 The process plant design was based on a combination of metallurgical testwork, previous study designs, previous operating experience. The design is conventional to the gold industry and has no novel parameters. 
 The processing plant is currently designed to process approximately 24,000 t d of ROM refractory ore. The oxygen supply is currently the key plant bottleneck. If the ROM feed has a low sulfide content, the plant can process over 30,000 t d. 
 The process plant expansion project will expand processing operations from 8.6 Mt a to approximately 14 Mt a. The intention is not to install an additional autoclave but rather to upgrade low-grade ore by installing a flotation circuit and to modify the existing four autoclaves by including a flash recycle thickening circuit, which will assist in increasing the capacity and the 
 Date February 2023 Page 22-5 

Pueblo Viejo Operations 
 Dominican Republic 
 Technical Report Summary 

residence time in the autoclaves. The flowsheet has been periodically subjected to professional review via independent consultants, resulting in several confirmatory reports. 
 The plant will produce variations in recovery due to the day-to-day changes in ore type or combinations of ore type being processed. These variations are expected to trend to the forecast recovery value for monthly or longer reporting periods. 
 
 22.14 Infrastructure 
 Infrastructure to support current mining operations is in place. Additional infrastructure is required to support the planned expansion. Key elements include an additional TSF and a PAG conveyor system. 
 A stockpiling strategy is practiced, deferring lower-grade ores to the end of mine life. 
 The Llagal TSF is expected to be filled to its design limit in 2027, after which tailings will be placed in a proposed new TSF, the Naranjo TSF. From 2025 until 2041, PAG waste rock from the mine is planned to be deposited into the Naranjo TSF. The facility will have a PAG waste storage capacity of approximately 500 Mm 3 . The current design allows for expansion to a capacity of 645 Mm 3 if required in the future. The Naranjo TSF dam will be designed for Extreme consequence classification. 
 The existing infrastructure, staff availability, existing power, water, and communications facilities, and the methods whereby goods are transported to the mine are all in place and well-established, and can support the estimation of mineral resources and mineral reserves. 
 The process includes an effluent treatment plant to treat the combined flows of tailings effluent and the ARD generated in the Margarita drainage basin from previous mining activities. 
 Key water management structures include, or will include the following Hatillo reservoir Hondo reservoir Taino Dam fresh water storage pool emergency containment pools Monte Negro, Moore and Cumba Pits ARD storage dams effluent treatment plant Llagal TSF and Naranjo TSF. 
 On-site accommodation consists of an approximately 430-bed camp with full dining, laundry and recreational facilities. 
 The Pueblo Viejo Operations are supplied with electric power from two sources via two independent 230 kV transmission circuits. It is expected that the mine average load at full production, once the expansion project is completed, will exceed the Quisqueya Power production in about 2026. Additional power to support the LOM plan will be sourced either from the grid or from a solar plant that is currently in the planning stage. 
 
 22.15 Market Studies 
 Barrick has established contracts and buyers for the dor product from the Pueblo Viejo Operations, and has an internal marketing group that monitors markets for its key products. Together with public documents and analyst forecasts, these data support that there is a reasonable basis to assume that, for the LOM plan, the key products will be saleable at the assumed commodity pricing. 
 Date February 2023 Page 22-6 

Pueblo Viejo Operations 
 Dominican Republic 
 Technical Report Summary 

Barrick, as operator of the Pueblo Viejo JV, provides the commodity price guidance. Higher metal prices are used for the mineral resource estimates to ensure the mineral reserves are a sub-set of, and not constrained by, the mineral resources, in accordance with industry-accepted practice. 
 Bullion is sold on the spot market, by marketing experts retained in-house by Barrick. Barrick provides Newmont with the date and number of ounces that will be credited to Newmont s account, and invoices Newmont for how much Newmont is owed, such that Newmont receives credits for the ounces (based on the JV interest) and Newmont pays Barrick for the ounces. The terms contained within the sales contracts are typical and consistent with standard industry practice and are similar to contracts for the supply of bullion elsewhere in the world. 
 The largest in-place contracts other than for product sales cover items such as bulk commodities, operational and technical services, mining and process equipment, and administrative support services. Contracts are negotiated and renewed as needed. 
 
 22.16 Environmental, Permitting and Social Considerations 
 Baseline and supporting environmental studies were completed to assess both pre-existing and ongoing site environmental conditions, as well as to support decision-making processes during operations start-up. Characterization studies were completed for climate, air quality, hydrology and surface water quality, hydrogeology, flora, fauna, soils, agriculture and land use, and the socioeconomic environment. 
 Plans were developed and implemented to address aspects of operations such as waste and fugitive dust management, spill prevention and contingency planning, water management, and noise levels. Environmental monitoring is ongoing at the Project and will continue over the life of the operations. Key monitoring areas include air, water, noise, wildlife, and waste management. 
 An Environmental and Social Impact Assessment was completed to support the planned Naranjo TSF construction, and an environmental study was completed in support of the planned process expansion. It was submitted to the Ministry of Environment at end of October 2022. 
 All major permits and approvals are either in place or PVDJ2 expects to obtain them in the normal course of business. Where permits have specific terms, renewal applications are made of the relevant regulatory authority as required, prior to the end of the permit term. 
 PVDJ2 understands and accepts the importance of proactive community relations as an overriding principle in its day-to-day operations as well as future development planning. The company therefore structures its community relations activities to consider the concerns of the local people and endeavors to communicate and demonstrate its commitment in terms that can be best appreciated and understood to maintain the social license to operate. 
 
 22.17 Capital Cost Estimates 
 Capital costs are based on a conceptual level financial model provided by PVDJ2 that has been adjusted to align to GAAP. 
 Date February 2023 Page 22-7 

Pueblo Viejo Operations 
 Dominican Republic 
 Technical Report Summary 

Capital costs were based on recent prices or operating data and are at a minimum at a pre-feasibility level of confidence, having an accuracy level of 25 and a contingency range not exceeding 15 . 
 The overall capital cost estimate for the LOM, including the expansion project, is approximately US 3.3 B. 
 
 22.18 Operating Cost Estimates 
 Operating costs are based on a conceptual level financial model provided by PVDJ2 that has been adjusted to align to GAAP. 
 Direct operating costs were based on actual costs seen during operations and are projected through the LOM plan, and are at a minimum at a pre-feasibility level of confidence, having an accuracy level of 25 and a contingency range not exceeding 15 . 
 Direct operating costs for the LOM are estimated at US 51.20 t processed. The estimated LOM open pit mining cost is 9.86 t mined, base processing costs are estimated at 37.18 t processed, and total G&A costs are estimated at 4.16 t processed. 
 
 22.19 Economic Analysis 
 The NPV at a discount rate of 5 is 3.1 B. With a portion of the expansion capital already sunk, the payback and internal rate of return are not applicable. 
 The Project is most sensitive to variations in grades. 
 
 22.20 Risks and Opportunities 
 
 22.20.1 Risks 
 The risks associated with the Pueblo Viejo Operations are generally those expected with open pit mining operations and include the accuracy of the resource model, unexpected geological features that cause geotechnical issues, and or operational impacts. 
 Uncertainties that may affect the mineral resource and mineral reserve estimates are discussed in Chapter 11.15 and Chapter 12.7 respectively. Uncertainties identified by the QP on the adequacy of current plans to address issues related to environmental, permitting, closure and social considerations are provided in Chapter 17.6. 
 Other risks noted include 
 Density is currently under sampled. There is a risk of lower density than modelled which could impact estimated tonnages and contained metal. The risk is mitigated given the site s operating history 
 A portion of the mineral resource and mineral reserve estimates are in stockpiled material. This material is classified as indicated based on uncertainties relating to the carbon content, and sulfur degradation impacting process recoveries. If process recoveries are lower than assumed, this could affect the project 
 Date February 2023 Page 22-8 

Pueblo Viejo Operations 
 Dominican Republic 
 Technical Report Summary 

economics for that portion of the mine plan that is based on expected revenue from stockpiled material 
 The process plant expansion project has not achieved commercial production and as with any construction project there is a risk of delays and lower than estimated plant throughput, recovery (or both) during the start-up period 
 The waste stacking system in the proposed Naranjo TSF may experience project delays, increased costs and or operational issues not envisaged during the study work. While truck haulage is always a feasible alternative, this would come at higher than planned costs 
 Relocation of communities may take longer than expected. Delays may impact the proposed construction schedule for the Naranjo TSF 
 The site has sufficient limestone available for the LOM requirements however, should unforeseen issues impact the availability of limestone, the use of external sources would be expected to increase costs. This scenario should be manageable within the current cost and revenue structure 
 The estimated closure cost in the economic analysis is US 342 M. The closure cost may require revision when the relevant regulatory authorities have examined the ESIA, modifications to the ESIA and related expansion scenario. There is a risk that the closure cost may be higher than that estimated in the economic analysis 
 Commodity price increases for key consumables such diesel, electricity, tires, and chemicals would negatively impact the stated mineral reserves and mineral resources 
 Labor cost increases or productivity decreases could also impact the stated mineral reserves and mineral resources, or impact the economic analysis that supports the mineral reserves 
 Geotechnical and hydrological assumptions used in mine planning are based on historical performance, and to date historical performance has been a reasonable predictor of current conditions. Any changes to the geotechnical and hydrological assumptions could affect mine planning, affect capital cost estimates if any major rehabilitation is required due to a geotechnical or hydrological event, affect operating costs due to mitigation measures that may need to be imposed, and impact the economic analysis that supports the mineral reserve estimates 
 The mineral resource estimates are sensitive to metal prices. Lower metal prices will require revisions to the mineral resource estimates 
 Political risk from challenges to 
 Mining license renewals 
 Environmental permit grant or renewal 
 Changes to assumptions as to governmental tax or royalty rates, such as taxation rate increases or new taxation or royalty requirements.

Pueblo Viejo Operations 
 Dominican Republic 
 Technical Report Summary 

22.20.2 Opportunities 
 Opportunities for the Pueblo Viejo Operations include moving the stated mineral resources into mineral reserves through additional drilling and study work. 
 Opportunities include 
 Conversion of some or all of the measured and indicated mineral resources currently reported exclusive of mineral reserves to mineral reserves, with appropriate supporting studies 
 Upgrade of some or all of the inferred mineral resources to higher-confidence categories, such that this material could be used in mineral reserve estimation 
 Higher metal prices than forecast could present upside sales opportunities and potentially an increase in predicted Project economics. 
 Studies are underway to determine if a more economic source for TSF construction material is available. 
 
 22.21 Conclusions 
 Under the assumptions presented in this Report, the Pueblo Viejo Operations have a positive cash flow, and mineral reserve estimates can be supported.

 Term Definition acid rock drainage acid mine drainage Characterized by low pH, high sulfate, and high iron and other metal species. ANFO A free-running explosive used in mine blasting made of 94 prilled aluminum nitrate and 6 No. 3 fuel oil. azimuth The direction of one object from another, usually expressed as an angle in degrees relative to true north. Azimuths are usually measured in the clockwise direction, thus an azimuth of 90 degrees indicates that the second object is due east of the first. ball mill A piece of milling equipment used to grind ore into small particles. It is a cylindrical shaped steel container filled with steel balls into which crushed ore is fed. The ball mill is rotated causing the balls themselves to cascade, which in turn grinds the ore. bullion Unrefined gold and or silver mixtures that have been melted and cast into a bar or ingot. carbonaceous Containing graphitic or hydrocarbon species, e.g., in an ore or concentrate such materials generally present some challenge in processing, e.g. preg-robbing characteristics. comminution crushing grinding Crushing and or grinding of ore by impact and abrasion. Usually, the word crushing is used for dry methods and grinding for wet methods. Also, crushing usually denotes reducing the size of coarse rock while grinding usually refers to the reduction of the fine sizes. concentrate The concentrate is the valuable product from mineral processing, as opposed to the tailing, which contains the waste minerals. The concentrate represents a smaller volume than the original ore counter-current decantation (CCD) A process where a slurry is thickened and washed in multiple stages, where clean water is added to the last thickener, and overflows from each thickener are progressively transferred to the previous thickener, countercurrent to the flow of thickened slurry. cut-off grade A grade level below which the material is not ore and considered to be uneconomical to mine and process. The minimum grade of ore used to establish reserves. data verification The process of confirming that data was generated with proper procedures, was accurately transcribed from the original source and is suitable to be used for mineral resource and mineral reserve estimation density The mass per unit volume of a substance, commonly expressed in grams cubic centimeter. dilution Waste of low-grade rock which is unavoidably removed along with the ore in the mining process. dor Unrefined gold and silver bullion bars consisting of approximately 90 precious metals that will be further refined to almost pure metal.

Term Definition easement 
 Areas of land owned by the property owner, but in which other parties, such as utility companies, may have limited rights granted for a specific purpose. encumbrance 
 An interest or partial right in real property which diminished the value of ownership, but does not prevent the transfer of ownership. Mortgages, taxes and judgements are encumbrances known as liens. Restrictions, easements, and reservations are also encumbrances, although not liens. feasibility study A feasibility study is a comprehensive technical and economic study of the selected development option for a mineral project, which includes detailed assessments of all applicable modifying factors, as defined by this section, together with any other relevant operational factors, and detailed financial analysis that are necessary to demonstrate, at the time of reporting, that extraction is economically viable. The results of the study may serve as the basis for a final decision by a proponent or financial institution to proceed with, or finance, the development of the project. 
 A feasibility study is more comprehensive, and with a higher degree of accuracy, than a pre-feasibility study. It must contain mining, infrastructure, and process designs completed with sufficient rigor to serve as the basis for an investment decision or to support project financing. 
 flotation Separation of minerals based on the interfacial chemistry of the mineral particles in solution. Reagents are added to the ore slurry to render the surface of selected minerals hydrophobic. Air bubbles are introduced to which the hydrophobic minerals attach. The selected minerals are levitated to the top of the flotation machine by their attachment to the bubbles and into a froth product, called the flotation concentrate. If this froth carries more than one mineral as a designated main constituent, it is called a bulk float . If it is selective to one constituent of the ore, where more than one will be floated, it is a differential float. flowsheet The sequence of operations, step by step, by which ore is treated in a milling, concentration, or smelting process. indicated mineral resource An indicated mineral resource is that part of a mineral resource for which quantity and grade or quality are estimated on the basis of adequate geological evidence and sampling. The term adequate geological evidence means evidence that is sufficient to establish geological and grade or quality continuity with reasonable certainty. The level of geological certainty associated with an indicated mineral resource is sufficient to allow a qualified person to apply modifying factors in sufficient detail to support mine planning and evaluation of the economic viability of the deposit. inferred mineral resource An inferred mineral resource is that part of a mineral resource for which quantity and grade or quality are estimated on the basis of limited geological evidence and sampling. The term limited geological evidence means evidence that is only sufficient to establish that geological and grade or quality continuity is more likely than not. The level of geological uncertainty associated with an inferred mineral resource is too high to apply relevant technical and economic factors likely to influence the prospects of economic extraction in a manner useful for evaluation of economic viability. 
 A qualified person must have a reasonable expectation that the majority of inferred mineral resources could be upgraded to indicated or measured mineral resources with continued exploration and should be able to defend the basis of this expectation before his or her peers.

Term Definition initial assessment An initial assessment is a preliminary technical and economic study of the economic potential of all or parts of mineralization to support the disclosure of mineral resources. The initial assessment must be prepared by a qualified person and must include appropriate assessments of reasonably assumed technical and economic factors, together with any other relevant operational factors, that are necessary to demonstrate at the time of reporting that there are reasonable prospects for economic extraction. An initial assessment is required for disclosure of mineral resources but cannot be used as the basis for disclosure of mineral reserves IP Geophysical method, induced polarization used to directly detect scattered primary sulfide mineralization. Most metal sulfides produce IP effects, e.g., chalcopyrite, bornite, chalcocite, pyrite, pyrrhotite life of mine (LOM) Number of years that the operation is planning to mine and treat ore, and is taken from the current mine plan based on the current evaluation of ore reserves. measured mineral resource A measured mineral resource is that part of a mineral resource for which quantity and grade or quality are estimated on the basis of conclusive geological evidence and sampling. The term conclusive geological evidence means evidence that is sufficient to test and confirm geological and grade or quality continuity. The level of geological certainty associated with a measured mineral resource is sufficient to allow a qualified person to apply modifying factors, as defined in this section, in sufficient detail to support detailed mine planning and final evaluation of the economic viability of the deposit. mill Includes any ore mill, sampling works, concentration, and any crushing, grinding, or screening plant used at, and in connection with, an excavation or mine. mineral reserve A mineral reserve is an estimate of tonnage and grade or quality of indicated and measured mineral resources that, in the opinion of the qualified person, can be the basis of an economically viable project. More specifically, it is the economically mineable part of a measured or indicated mineral resource, which includes diluting materials and allowances for losses that may occur when the material is mined or extracted. 
 The determination that part of a measured or indicated mineral resource is economically mineable must be based on a preliminary feasibility (pre-feasibility) or feasibility study, as defined by this section, conducted by a qualified person applying the modifying factors to indicated or measured mineral resources. Such study must demonstrate that, at the time of reporting, extraction of the mineral reserve is economically viable under reasonable investment and market assumptions. The study must establish a life of mine plan that is technically achievable and economically viable, which will be the basis of determining the mineral reserve. 
 The term economically viable means that the qualified person has determined, using a discounted cash flow analysis, or has otherwise analytically determined, that extraction of the mineral reserve is economically viable under reasonable investment and market assumptions. 
 The term investment and market assumptions includes all assumptions made about the prices, exchange rates, interest and discount rates, sales volumes, and costs that are necessary to determine the economic viability of the mineral reserves. The qualified person must use a price for each commodity that provides a reasonable basis for establishing that the project is economically viable.

Term Definition mineral resource A mineral resource is a concentration or occurrence of material of economic interest in or on the Earth s crust in such form, grade or quality, and quantity that there are reasonable prospects for economic extraction. 
 The term material of economic interest includes mineralization, including dumps and tailings, mineral brines, and other resources extracted on or within the earth s crust. It does not include oil and gas resources, gases (e.g., helium and carbon dioxide), geothermal fields, and water. 
 When determining the existence of a mineral resource, a qualified person, as defined by this section, must be able to estimate or interpret the location, quantity, grade or quality continuity, and other geological characteristics of the mineral resource from specific geological evidence and knowledge, including sampling and conclude that there are reasonable prospects for economic extraction of the mineral resource based on an initial assessment, as defined in this section, that he or she conducts by qualitatively applying relevant technical and economic factors likely to influence the prospect of economic extraction. 
 net present value (NPV) The present value of the difference between the future cash flows associated with a project and the investment required for acquiring the project. Aggregate of future net cash flows discounted back to a common base date, usually the present. NPV is an indicator of how much value an investment or project adds to a company. net smelter return (NSR) A defined percentage of the gross revenue from a resource extraction operation, less a proportionate share of transportation, insurance, and processing costs. open pit A mine that is entirely on the surface. Also referred to as open-cut or open-cast mine. ounce (oz) (troy) Used in imperial statistics. A kilogram is equal to 32.1507 ounces. A troy ounce is equal to 31.1035 grams. overburden Material of any nature, consolidated or unconsolidated, that overlies a deposit of ore that is to be mined. pebble crushing A crushing process on screened larger particles that exit through the grates of a SAG mill. Such particles (typically approx. 50 mm diameter) are not efficiently broken in the SAG mill and are therefore removed and broken, typically using a cone crusher. The crushed pebbles are then fed to a grinding mill for further breakage. plant A group of buildings, and especially to their contained equipment, in which a process or function is carried out on a mine it will include warehouses, hoisting equipment, compressors, repair shops, offices, mill or concentrator. preg-robbing A characteristic of certain ores, typically that contain carbonaceous species, where dissolved gold is readsorbed by these species, leading to an overall reduction in gold recovery. Such ores require more complex treatment circuits to maximize gold recovery.

Term Definition preliminary feasibility study, pre-feasibility study A preliminary feasibility study (prefeasibility study) is a comprehensive study of a range of options for the technical and economic viability of a mineral project that has advanced to a stage where a qualified person has determined (in the case of underground mining) a preferred mining method, or (in the case of surface mining) a pit configuration, and in all cases has determined an effective method of mineral processing and an effective plan to sell the product. 
 A pre-feasibility study includes a financial analysis based on reasonable assumptions, based on appropriate testing, about the modifying factors and the evaluation of any other relevant factors that are sufficient for a qualified person to determine if all or part of the indicated and measured mineral resources may be converted to mineral reserves at the time of reporting. The financial analysis must have the level of detail necessary to demonstrate, at the time of reporting, that extraction is economically viable 
 probable mineral reserve A probable mineral reserve is the economically mineable part of an indicated and, in some cases, a measured mineral resource. For a probable mineral reserve, the qualified person s confidence in the results obtained from the application of the modifying factors and in the estimates of tonnage and grade or quality is lower than what is sufficient for a classification as a proven mineral reserve, but is still sufficient to demonstrate that, at the time of reporting, extraction of the mineral reserve is economically viable under reasonable investment and market assumptions. The lower level of confidence is due to higher geologic uncertainty when the qualified person converts an indicated mineral resource to a probable reserve or higher risk in the results of the application of modifying factors at the time when the qualified person converts a measured mineral resource to a probable mineral reserve. A qualified person must classify a measured mineral resource as a probable mineral reserve when his or her confidence in the results obtained from the application of the modifying factors to the measured mineral resource is lower than what is sufficient for a proven mineral reserve. propylitic Characteristic greenish color. Minerals include chlorite, actinolite and epidote. Typically contains the assemblage quartz chlorite carbonate proven mineral reserve A proven mineral reserve is the economically mineable part of a measured mineral resource. For a proven mineral reserve, the qualified person has a high degree of confidence in the results obtained from the application of the modifying factors and in the estimates of tonnage and grade or quality. A proven mineral reserve can only result from conversion of a measured mineral resource.
