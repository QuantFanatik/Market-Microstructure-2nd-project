 our ability to generate and grow revenue through our relationships with broker dealers and digital financial service providers; 
 our ability to successfully manage liquidity risk;

 our ability to maintain our reputation; 
 increased competition in the financial services industry; 
 regulatory guidance on commercial lending concentrations; 
 the effectiveness of our risk management framework; 
 the commencement and outcome of litigation and other legal proceedings and regulatory actions against us or to which we may become subject; 
 the impact of recent and future legislative and regulatory changes and economic stimulus programs and other changes in banking, securities and tax laws and regulations, and their application by our regulators;

 material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting; and 
 our success at managing the risks involved in the foregoing items. 
 The foregoing factors should not be construed as exhaustive and should be read together with the other cautionary statements included in this Report on Form 10-K. If one or more events related to these or other risks or uncertainties materialize, or if our underlying assumptions prove to be incorrect, actual results may differ materially from what we anticipate. You are cautioned not to place undue reliance on forward-looking statements. Further, any forward-looking statement speaks only as of the date on which it is made and we undertake no obligation to update or revise any forward-looking statement to reflect events or circumstances after the date on which the statement is made or to reflect the occurrence of unanticipated events except as required by law.

 PART I 
 
 Item 1. Business 
 Our Company 
 Coastal Financial Corporation Company is a registered bank holding company, whose wholly owned subsidiaries are Coastal Community Bank Bank and Arlington Olympic LLC LLC ). The Company is a Washington state corporation that was organized in 2003. The Bank was incorporated and commenced operations in 1997 and is a Washington state-chartered commercial bank and Federal Reserve System Federal Reserve member bank. The LLC was formed in 2019 and owns the Company s Arlington branch, which the Bank leases from the LLC. Our executive offices are located at 5415 Evergreen Way, Everett, Washington 98203 and our telephone number is (425) 257-9000. Our website address is www.coastalbank.com. Information on our website should not be considered a part of this Report on Form 10-K. 
 We are headquartered in Everett, Washington, which by population is the largest city in, and the county seat of, Snohomish County. Our business is conducted through two reportable segments: The community bank and CCBX. The primary focus of the community bank is on providing a wide range of banking products and services to consumers and small to medium sized businesses in the broader Puget Sound region in the state of Washington and through the Internet and our mobile banking application. We currently operate 14 full-service banking locations, 12 of which are located in Snohomish County, where we are the largest community bank by deposit market share, and two of which are located in neighboring counties (one in King County and one in Island County). The CCBX segment provides banking as a service BaaS that allows our broker-dealer and digital financial service partners to offer their customers banking services. The CCBX segment has 19 active partners with six more currently in the testing of LOI stage as of December 31, 2022. The Bank s deposits are insured in whole or in part by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation FDIC ). The Bank is subject to regulation by the Federal Reserve and the Washington State Department of Financial Institutions Division of Banks. The Federal Reserve also has supervisory authority over the Company. 
 As of December 31, 2022, we had total assets of 3.14 billion, total loans receivable of 2.63 billion, total deposits of 2.82 billion and total shareholders equity of 243.5 million. 
 Throughout this Report on Form 10-K, references to we, us or our refer to the Company or the Bank, or both, as the context indicates. 
 Our Markets 
 We define our community bank market broadly as the Puget Sound region in the state of Washington, which encompasses King, Kitsap, Pierce, Snohomish, Skagit, Thurston and Island Counties. The Puget Sound region, which comprises over 62 of the population of the state of Washington, and approximately 63 of the number of businesses located therein has a population of approximately 4.9 million, over 164,000 businesses and 173.4 billion of deposits with us and other banking institutions located in the region. 
 We are the largest locally headquartered bank by deposit market share in Snohomish County, according to data from the FDIC as of June 30, 2022, at which date we had a 13.0 deposit market share in Snohomish County, which was up from 9.0 in 2021 and 7.6 in 2020. We aim to continuously enhance our customer base, increase loans and deposits and expand our overall market share in Snohomish County. In light of our market position and our business strategy, we do not regularly compete for commercial or retail deposits in the city of Seattle, and we believe this strategic decision has enabled us to generate low cost core deposits to fund our loan growth. 
 Our CCBX market extends throughout the United States through our broker dealers and digital financial services partners. Our CCBX partners make our banking products and services available to their consumers, partners and workforce through integration with our banking platform. In doing so, our addressable market expands to a broader spectrum of consumers as well as small businesses. Working with our CCBX partners allows us to provide a broader range of services for different demographics through their offerings. Developing the kind of unique offerings to specific under-served or under-banked populations would be difficult for a bank our size, but through our CCBX partnerships we are able to use our banking charter to support this effort in a much broader scope.

 Segment Reporting 
 The Company has two reportable segments: The community bank and CCBX. The primary focus of the community bank segment is on providing a wide range of banking products and services to consumers and small to medium sized businesses in the broader Puget Sound region in the state of Washington. We currently operate 14 full-service banking locations, 12 of which are located in Snohomish County, where we are the largest community bank by deposit market share, and two of which are located in neighboring counties (one in King County and one in Island County). The CCBX segment provides BaaS that allows our broker-dealer and digital financial service partners to offer their customers banking services. For more information about each of the Company s reportable segments, please refer to Note 21 Segment Reporting of the accompanying notes to the consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this report. 
 Our Banking Services 
 Lending Activities 
 We focus primarily on commercial lending, with an emphasis on commercial real estate in the community bank. We offer a variety of loans to business owners, including commercial and industrial loans and commercial real estate loans secured by owner-occupied commercial properties. We also offer non-owner occupied commercial real estate loans, multi-family loans, and construction and development loans to investors and developers. We also offer residential real estate loans and to a lesser extent, consumer loans in the community bank. We offer commercial and consumer loans through CCBX. 
 Commercial and Industrial Loans . As of December 31, 2022, we had 312.6 million of commercial and industrial loans, representing 11.8 of total loans. Included in the commercial and industrial loan balance is 151.7 million in community bank loans and 160.9 million in CCBX commercial loans. We make commercial and industrial loans, including term loans, Small Business Administration SBA loans, commercial lines of credit, capital call lines working capital loans, equipment financing, borrowing base loans, and other loan products, that are underwritten on the basis of the borrower s ability to service the debt from income. We take as collateral a lien on general business assets including, among other things, available real estate, accounts receivable, inventory and equipment and generally obtain a personal guaranty from the borrower or principal. Our commercial lines of credit typically have a term of one year and have variable interest rates that adjust monthly based on the prime rate. Other commercial and industrial loans generally have fixed interest rates and terms that typically range from one to five years depending on factors such as the type and size of the loan, the financial strength of the borrower/guarantor and the age, type and value of the collateral. Terms greater than five years may be appropriate in some circumstances, based upon the useful life of the underlying asset being financed or if some form of credit enhancement, such as an SBA guarantee, is obtained. 
 Commercial and industrial loans are often larger and involve greater risks than other types of lending. Because payments on commercial and industrial loans are often dependent on the operating cash flows of the borrower s business, repayment of these loans is often more sensitive to adverse conditions in the general economy, which in turn increases repayment risk. We also face the risk that losses incurred on a small number of commercial loans could have an adverse impact on our financial condition and results of operations due to (a) the larger average size of commercial loans as compared with other loans, such as residential loans, as well as (b) collateral that is generally less readily marketable than collateral for consumer loans, such as residential real estate and automobiles. 
 As of December 31, 2022, we held 146.0 million in capital call lines provided to venture capital firms through one of our CCBX partners. These loans are secured by the capital call rights and are individually underwritten to the Bank s credit standards and the underwriting is reviewed by the Bank on every loan/line. Capital call lines represent 46.7 of total commercial and industrial loans, and are included in CCBX commercial and industrial loans. 
 As of December 31, 2022, our total commercial SBA portfolio, excluding PPP loans, was 4.7 million, net of 5.2 million in loans sold, with 2.4 million guaranteed by the SBA. We participate in the SBA 7(a) program in order to meet the needs of our small business community. As an approved participant in the SBA Preferred Lender s Program, we enable our clients to obtain SBA loans without being subject to the potentially lengthy SBA approval process necessary for lenders that are not SBA Preferred Lenders. The SBA s 7(a) program provides up to a 75 guaranty for loans greater than 150,000. For loans 150,000 or less, the program provides up to an 85 guaranty. The maximum 7(a) loan amount is 5 million. The guaranty is conditional and covers a portion of the risk of payment default by the borrower, but not the risk of improper underwriting, closing and servicing by the lender. As such, prudent underwriting and closing processes are 
 4 

Table of Contents 

 essential to effective utilization of the 7(a) program. We typically sell in the secondary market the SBA-guaranteed portion (generally 75 of the principal balance) of the SBA loans we originate. 
 As of December 31, 2022, our commercial and industrial loans included 4.7 million in PPP loans. These are SBA loans that allowed small business owners to apply for financial assistance via the PPP as prescribed in the CARES Act. These loans have a contractual rate of 1.0 , with maturity terms of two to five years, are unsecured, 100 guaranteed and loan proceeds may be forgiven by the SBA if used for certain purposes. 
 As of December 31, 2022, we held a total of 521,000, and service 2.1 million on loans sold to others that are guaranteed by the United States Department of Agriculture USDA ), classified as commercial and industrial loans. We participate in the USDA Business and Industry and Community Facilities programs. Both loan programs provide up to a 90 guarantee. The guarantee is conditional and covers a portion of the risk of payment default by the borrower but not the risk of improper servicing by the lender. Unlike the SBA 7(a) program, the USDA guarantee is not issued until after the loan closes. USDA issues a conditional commitment prior to loan closing and prudent closing processes are essential to effective utilization of the USDA loan programs. The USDA guaranteed portion of the USDA loans are typically sold in the secondary market. 
 Commercial Real Estate . As of December 31, 2022, we had 1.05 billion of commercial real estate loans, representing 39.8 of total loans. We make commercial mortgage loans collateralized by owner- and non-owner-occupied real estate, as well as multi-family residential loans. Loans secured by owner-occupied real estate totaled 347.3 million and comprised 33.1 of our commercial real estate portfolio at December 31, 2022. The real estate securing our existing commercial real estate loans includes a wide variety of property types, such as manufacturing and processing facilities, business parks, warehouses, retail centers, convenience stores, hotels and motels, office buildings, mixed-use residential and commercial, and other properties. We originate both fixed- and adjustable-rate loans with terms up to 20 years. Fixed-rate loans typically amortize over a 10-to-25 year period with a final maturity and balloon payment at the end of five to ten years. Adjustable-rate loans are generally based on the prime rate and adjust with the prime rate or are based on term equivalent Federal Home Loan Bank rates. At December 31, 2022, approximately 30.5 of the commercial real estate loan portfolio consisted of fixed rate loans. Loan amounts generally do not exceed 75 of the lesser of the appraised value or the purchase price. 
 As of December 31, 2022, we had a total of 2.7 million, and service 6.2 million in loans sold to others that are guaranteed by the SBA, in commercial real estate SBA loans. Also included in commercial real estate loans was 68.4 million, or 2.6 of total loans, in loans under the SBA 504 program. Under the SBA 504 program we make loans to small businesses to provide funding for the purchase of real estate and we provide up to 90 financing of the total purchase cost, represented by two loans to the borrower. The first lien loan is generally a long-term, fully amortizing, fixed-rate loan made in the amount of 50 of the total purchase cost. The second lien loan is a short-term, interest only, adjustable rate loan made in the amount of 40 of the total purchase cost, which is generally paid off within three to six months after full receipt of loan proceeds from a certified development corporation that provides long-term financing directly to the borrower. 
 Our multi-family residential loan portfolio is comprised of loans secured by apartment buildings, residential mixed-use buildings and, to a lesser extent, senior living centers. As of December 31, 2022, we had 241.4 million on multi-family residential loans, representing 23.0 of our commercial real estate loans, and 9.2 of total loans. 
 Commercial real estate lending with respect to non-owner occupied properties typically involves higher loan principal amounts and the repayment is dependent, in large part, on sufficient income from the properties securing the loans to cover operating expenses and debt service. We require that our commercial real estate loans to investors be secured by well-managed properties with adequate margins and generally obtain a guaranty from responsible parties. As of December 31, 2022, we held 460.1 million in other non-owner occupied loans, excluding multifamily loans, representing 43.9 of our commercial real estate loans and 17.4 of total loans. 
 Construction, Land and Land Development Loans . As of December 31, 2022, we had 214.1 million in construction, land and land development loans, representing 8.1 of total loans. We make loans to established builders to construct residential properties, to developers of commercial real estate investment properties and residential developments and, to a lesser extent, loans to individual clients for construction of single family homes in our market areas. We also make loans for the acquisition of undeveloped land. Construction loans are typically disbursed as construction progresses and carry either fixed or variable interest rates. Our construction and development loans typically have terms that range from six months to two years depending on factors such as the type and size of the development and the financial strength 
 5 

Table of Contents 

 of the borrower/guarantor. Loans are typically structured with an interest only construction period and mature at the completion of construction. 
 Construction and land development loans typically involve more risk than other types of lending products because repayment of these loans is dependent, in part, on the sale or refinance of the ultimate project rather than the ability of the borrower or guarantor to repay principal and interest. Moreover, these loans are typically based on future estimates of value and economic circumstances, which may differ from actual results or be affected by unforeseen events. If the actual circumstances differ from the estimates made at the time of approval of these loans, we face the risk of having inadequate security for the repayment of the loan. Further, if we foreclose on the loan, we may be required to fund additional amounts to complete the project and may have to hold the property for an unspecified period of time until the foreclosed property is sold. 
 Residential Real Estate . As of December 31, 2022, we had 449.2 million in residential real estate loans, representing 17.1 of total loans. 
 We make one-to-four family loans to investors to finance their rental properties and to business owners to secure their business loans. As of December 31, 2022, residential real estate loans made to investors and business owners totaled 140.7 million, or 31.3 of our residential real estate loans. 
 CCBX loans totaled 244.6 million, or 54.5 of residential real estate loans, as of December 31, 2022. These loans are home equity line of credits that are accessed through the use of a consumer card. 
 We originate one-to-four adjustable-rate mortgage ARM ), loans for our portfolio and operate as a mortgage broker for mortgage lenders we have agreements with for customers who want a 15-year to 30-year, fixed-rate mortgage loan. As of December 31, 2022, the balance of ARM portfolio loans was 28.0 million, or 6.2 of residential real estate loans. Our ARM loans typically do not meet the guidelines for sale in the secondary market due to characteristics of the property, the loan terms or exceptions from agency underwriting guidelines, which enables us to earn a higher interest rate. We also originate home equity lines of credit and home equity term loans for our portfolio. Home equity lines of credit have variable interest rates, while home equity term loans are fixed for up to 5-1/2 years but can be amortized up to a maximum of 180 months with a balloon payment at maturity. 
 We also purchase residential mortgages originated through other financial institutions to hold for investment with the intent to diversify our residential mortgage loan portfolio, meet certain regulatory requirements and increase our interest income. As of December 31, 2022, we held 9.4 million, representing 2.1 of our residential real estate loans, in purchased residential real estate mortgage loans. Our last purchase of residential mortgages was in 2018. These purchased loans typically have a fixed rate with a term of 15 to 30 years and are collateralized by one-to-four family residential real estate. We have a defined set of credit guidelines that we use when evaluating these loans. Although purchased loans were originated and underwritten by another institution, our mortgage, credit, and compliance departments conduct an independent review of each underlying loan that includes re-underwriting each of these loans to our credit and compliance standards. 
 Like our commercial real estate loans, our residential real estate loans are secured by real estate, the value of which may fluctuate significantly over a short period of time as a result of market conditions in the area in which the real estate is located. Adverse developments affecting real estate values in our market areas could therefore increase the credit risk associated with these loans, impair the value of property pledged as collateral on loans, and affect our ability to sell the collateral upon foreclosure without a loss or additional losses. 
 Consumer and Other Loans . As of December 31, 2022, we had 608.8 million in total consumer loans, representing 23.2 of total loans. Consumer loans are primarily originated through our CCBX partners. Consumer loans typically have shorter terms, lower balances, higher yields and higher risks of default than residential real estate mortgage loans. Consumer loan collections are dependent on the borrower s continuing financial stability and are therefore more likely to be affected by adverse personal circumstances, such as a loss of employment, divorce, or unexpected medical costs. 
 The community bank segment has 1.7 million in consumer loans as of December 31, 2022. We make a variety of consumer loans to individuals, mainly business owners and family of business owners, for personal and household purposes, including automobile, boat and recreational vehicle loans and secured term loans. We also offer personal lines of credit including overdraft protection. Consumer loans are underwritten based on the individual borrower s income, current 
 6

 debt level, past credit history and the value of any available collateral. The terms of consumer loans vary considerably based upon the loan type, nature of collateral and size of the loan. 
 Through our CCBX segment we have 607.0 million in consumer and other loans as of December 31, 2022. This includes 327.4 million in other consumer loans, 145.7 million of which are purchased loans secured by consumer term loans, and 279.6 million in credit cards. Our CCBX segment includes cash secured and unsecured consumer loans, loan products designed to help consumers build credit, credit cards and overdrafts. Consumer loans are made through our CCBX partners to our underwriting standards. The terms of consumer loans vary considerably based upon the loan type, nature of collateral and size of the loan. As our relationships with CCBX partners continues to increase, we anticipate that our consumer loan portfolio will grow through these offerings. 
 Credit Administration and Loan Review 
 We control credit risk both through disciplined underwriting of each transaction, as well as active credit management processes and procedures to manage risk and minimize loss throughout the life of a loan for community bank and CCBX loans. We seek to maintain a broadly diversified loan portfolio in terms of type of customer, type of loan product, geographic area and industries in which our business customers are engaged. We have developed tailored underwriting criteria and credit management processes and procedures for each of the various loan product types we offer our customers. 
 Underwriting . In evaluating each potential loan relationship, we adhere to a disciplined underwriting evaluation process that includes the following: 
 understanding the customer s financial condition and ability to repay the loan; 
 verifying that the primary and secondary sources of repayment are adequate in relation to the amount and structure of the loan; 
 observing appropriate loan-to-value guidelines for collateral secured loans; 
 obtaining credit enhancements from CCBX partners to reduce the risk of loss 
 maintaining our targeted levels of diversification for the loan portfolio, both as to type of borrower and type of collateral; and 
 ensuring that each loan is properly documented with perfected liens on collateral. 
 Loan Approval Authority . Our lending activities follow written, non-discriminatory, underwriting standards and loan origination procedures established by our board of directors and management. We have established several levels of lending authority that have been delegated by the board of directors to our management credit committee, Chief Executive Officer, Chief Credit Officers (community bank and CCBX) and other personnel in accordance with our loan policy. Authority limits are based on the total exposure of the borrower and are conditioned on the loan conforming to the policies contained in the loan policy. Any loan policy exceptions are fully disclosed to the approving authority. 
 Ongoing Credit Risk Management. In addition to the tailored underwriting process described above, we perform ongoing risk monitoring and review processes for credit exposures. Although we grade and classify our loans internally, we engage an independent third-party professional firm to perform regular loan reviews and confirm loan classifications. We strive to identify potential problem loans early in an effort to actively seek resolution of these situations before they create a loss. We record any necessary charge-offs promptly and maintain adequate allowance levels for probable loan losses incurred in the loan portfolio. 
 In general, whenever a particular loan or overall borrower relationship is downgraded from a pass grade to a watch or substandard grade based on one or more standard loan grading factors, our relationship manager (who is typically the loan officer) and credit team members engage in active evaluation of the asset to determine the appropriate resolution strategy. Management regularly reviews the status of the watch list and classified assets portfolio as well as the larger credits in the portfolio.

 Concentrations of Credit Risk 
 Most of our community bank lending activity is conducted with businesses and individuals in our market area. As of December 31, 2022, approximately 86 of the real estate loans in our community bank loan portfolio (measured by dollar amount) were secured by real estate, or made to borrowers who live or conduct business, in the Puget Sound region. A substantial portion of our loan portfolio consists of commercial and industrial loans and real estate loans secured by commercial real estate properties located in the Puget Sound region, and is dependent upon the economic environment of the Puget Sound region. We have a limited number of loans secured by properties located outside of the Puget Sound region, most of which are made to borrowers who are well-known to us. 
 CCBX loans receivable total 1.01 billion, or 38.5 of total loans receivable, as of December 31, 2022. CCBX loans are originated through our partners and are consistent with our underwriting standards. Agreements with our CCBX partners provide for a credit enhancement which protects the Bank by absorbing incurred losses. In accordance with accounting guidance, we estimate and record a provision for probable losses for these CCBX loans. When the provision for loan losses and provision for unfunded commitments is recorded, a credit enhancement asset is also recorded on the balance sheet through noninterest income (BaaS fees -credit enhancement). Incurred losses are recorded in the allowance for loan losses, and as the credit enhancement recoveries are received from the CCBX partner, the credit enhancement asset is relieved. Agreements with our CCBX partners also provide protection to the Bank from fraud by absorbing incurred fraud losses. Fraud losses, which are substantially comprised of first payment defaults on partner loans, are recorded when incurred as losses in noninterest expense, and the recovery received from the CCBX partner is recorded in noninterest income, resulting in a net impact of zero to the income statement. Although many agreements with our CCBX partners provide for credit enhancements that provide protection to the Bank from credit and fraud losses by absorbing incurred credit and fraud losses and the possibility of writing off the credit enhancement on those loans, if our partner is unable to fulfill their contracted obligations then the Bank would be exposed to additional loan losses, as a result of this counterparty risk. 
 Our total non-owner-occupied commercial real estate loans, including loans secured by apartment buildings, investor commercial real estate, and construction and land loans totaled 1.26 billion and represented 269.2 of the Bank s total risk-based capital at December 31, 2022. Interagency guidance on commercial real estate concentrations describes sound risk management practices, which include board and management oversight, portfolio management, management information systems, market analysis, portfolio stress testing and sensitivity analysis, credit underwriting standards, and credit risk review functions. We believe that we have adequately implemented these practices in order to monitor concentrations in commercial real estate in our loan portfolio. 
 Lending Limits 
 Our lending activities are subject to a variety of lending limits imposed by state law. In general, the Bank is subject to a legal lending limit on loans to a single borrower based on the amount of the Bank s capital and surplus. The dollar amounts of the Bank s lending limit increases or decreases as the Bank s capital and surplus increases or decreases. The Bank is able to sell participations in its larger loans to other financial institutions, which allows the Bank to better manage the risk and exposure involved with larger loans and to meet the lending needs of its customers requiring extensions of credit in excess of Bank or regulatory limits. 
 The Bank s legal lending limit as of December 31, 2022 on loans to a single borrower was 68.3 million, or 20 of capital and surplus. 
 Our loan policies provide general guidelines for loan-to-value ratios that restrict the size of loans to a maximum percentage of the value of the collateral securing the loans, which percentage varies by the type of collateral. Our internal loan-to-value limitations also follow all limits established by applicable law. 
 Deposit Products 
 Our deposits serve as the primary funding source for lending, investing and other general banking purposes. We provide a full range of deposit products in the community bank and through our CCBX partners that have a wide range of interest rates and terms, including a variety of demand and savings accounts, time deposits, and money market accounts. We also provide a wide range of deposit services, including debit cards, remote deposit capture, online banking, mobile banking, and direct deposit services. We also offer business accounts and cash management services, including business checking and savings accounts, and treasury services. We also offer reciprocal deposits which enables us to extend FDIC 
 8 

Table of Contents 

 insurance to customers that have balances in excess of the FDIC insurance limit. This reciprocal deposit service trades our customer s funds in increments under the FDIC insured amount to other participating financial institutions and in exchange we receive customer deposits from participating financial institutions in a reciprocal agreement. 
 We solicit deposits through our relationship-driven team of dedicated and accessible bankers and through community-focused marketing. We currently operate 14 full-service banking locations, 12 of which are located in Snohomish County, where we are the largest community bank by deposit market share, and two of which are located in neighboring counties (one in King County and one in Island County). We emphasize obtaining deposit relationships at loan origination. Our focus on relationship banking combined with our robust business banking services has led to approximately 76.9 of our community bank loan customers having deposit relationships with us as of December 31, 2022. 
 Our CCBX partners originate deposits with many of the same characteristics as our community bank and these deposits are primarily interest bearing to us. The CCBX partner determines the rate paid to the end consumer and we determine the rates paid to the partner as indicated in the partner agreement. Additionally, as of December 31, 2022 we have access to 225.0 million in CCBX customer deposits that are currently being transferred off the Bank s balance sheet to other financial institutions on a daily basis. The Bank could retain these deposits for liquidity and funding purposes if needed. Depending on the circumstances of how the Bank retains these deposits and its relationship with the customer, these retained deposits could be classified as brokered deposits. 
 CCBX segment (BaaS) 
 Our CCBX segment provides BaaS enabling broker dealers and digital financial service providers to offer its clients banking services. The X is indicative of the technology services that our partners provide. Our partners make our banking products and services available to their consumers, partners and workforce through integration with our banking platform. In doing so, our addressable market expands to a broader spectrum of consumers as well as small businesses. We currently have a total of 27 relationships, which includes 19 active relationships, one in friends and family trials, zero in implementation and onboarding, five signed letters of intent, and two winding down to exit, and we continue to maintain a robust pipeline. CCBX is supported by staff that we began hiring in late 2019 and continued throughout 2022 to build the infrastructure, work with our CCBX partners and to execute new contracts. 
 Investments 
 As of December 31, 2022, the fair value of our investment portfolio, which represented 3.1 of assets, totaled 98.2 million and had an average effective yield of 2.16 and an estimated duration of approximately 1.2 years. The primary objectives of the investment portfolio are to provide a source of liquidity and provide collateral that can be readily sold or pledged for public deposits or other business purposes. At December 31, 2022, 98.7 of our investment portfolio consisted of U.S. Treasury securities. The remainder of our securities portfolio is invested in municipal bonds, U.S. Agency collateralized mortgage and U.S. Agency residential mortgage-backed securities obligations. We regularly evaluate the composition of our investment portfolio as the interest rate yield curve changes and may sell or pledge investment securities from time to time to adjust our exposure to interest rates or to provide liquidity to meet loan demand. Due to the low interest rate environment, we are primarily holding the majority of our on-balance sheet liquidity in interest bearing bank deposits to limit our exposure to interest rate and price risk and to provide readily available funds for loan growth. 
 As of December 31, 2022, we had 2.6 million in equity investments. The equity investments will be held at cost minus any impairment. This measurement should be applied until the investment has a determinable value or does not qualify for the measurement election (e.g., if the investment has a readily determinable fair value). We will reassess at each reporting period whether our equity investment without a readily determinable fair value qualifies to be measured at cost minus impairment. Our total equity investments as of December 31, 2022 included a 2.2 million equity interest in a specialized bank technology company and an equity interest of 350,000 in a separate bank technology company. Additionally, during the year ended December 31, 2022, we reassessed the value of an investment and recognized a 100,000 impairment. This investment has been written off and is no longer carried on the Company s books. 
 We have invested in funds that are accelerating technology for adoption by banks. These equity investments are held at fair value, as reported by the funds. During the year ended December 31, 2022, we contributed 349,000 with investment funds designed to help accelerate technology adoption at banks, and recognized net losses of 53,000, resulting in an equity interest of 456,000 at December 31, 2022. We have committed up to 988,000 in capital for these equity funds, however, we are not obligated to fund these commitments prior to a capital call.

 Competition 
 We operate in a highly competitive industry and in a highly competitive market. Our community bank commercial real estate lending in the Puget Sound region attracts keen competition from large banking institutions with national operations, as well as mid-sized regional banking institutions. We compete with other community banks, savings and loan associations, credit unions, mortgage companies, insurance companies, finance companies and other financial intermediaries. The primary factors driving competition for deposits are customer service, interest rates, fees charged, branch locations and hours, online and mobile banking functionality, and the range of products offered. The primary factors driving competition for our lending products are customer service, range of products offered, price, reputation, and quality of execution. Our CCBX segment competes against companies and financial institutions across the retail banking, financial services, transaction processing, consumer technology and financial technology services industries and may compete with others in the market who may in the future provide offerings similar to ours. Our CCBX segment competes primarily on the basis of quality of service, customer satisfaction, compliance and regulatory capabilities, brand recognition and reputation in the BaaS market space, speed and quality of innovation, reliability of system performance and security, scalability of services, and pricing. 
 We believe the Bank is a strong competitor in our markets, however other competitors have certain advantages over us. Among them, many larger institutions have the ability to finance extensive advertising campaigns, maintain extensive branch networks and make larger technology investments, and to offer services which we do not offer. The higher capitalization of the larger banking institutions permits them to have higher lending limits than those of the Bank. Some of our competitors have other advantages, such as tax exemption in the case of credit unions, and to some extent, lesser regulation in the case of mortgage companies and finance companies. 
 Information Technology Systems 
 We have made and continue to make significant investments in our information technology systems and staff for our banking and lending operations, treasury management activities, and CCBX. We believe this investment will support our continued growth and enable us to enhance our capabilities to offer new products and overall customer experience, and to provide scale for future growth and acquisitions. We utilize nationally recognized software vendors, and their support allows us to outsource our data processing. 
 The majority of our systems including our electronic funds transfer, transaction processing, and our online banking services are hosted by third-party service providers. The scalability of this infrastructure will support our growth strategy. In addition, the tested capability of these vendors to automatically switch over to standby systems should allow us to recover our systems and provide business continuity quickly in case of a disaster. 
 We continue to adopt scalable and secure cloud technologies in tandem with zero trust networking for applications, email, and data processing. These systems provide redundancy and disaster recovery capabilities. 
 Emerging Growth Company Status 
 We are an emerging growth company under the Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act of 2012, (the JOBS Act ). An emerging growth company may take advantage of reduced reporting requirements and is relieved of certain other significant requirements that are otherwise generally applicable to public companies. As an emerging growth company: 
 we may present as few as two years of audited financial statements and as few as two years of related management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations; 
 we are exempt from the requirement to obtain an attestation report from our auditors on management s assessment of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting under the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, or the Sarbanes-Oxley Act; 
 we are not required to comply with any requirements adopted by the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board requiring mandatory audit firm rotation or a supplement to the auditor s report providing additional information about the audit and our financial statements; 
 we are permitted to provide reduced disclosure regarding our executive compensation arrangements pursuant to the rules applicable to smaller reporting companies, which means we do not have to include a 
 10 

Table of Contents 

 compensation discussion and analysis and certain other disclosures regarding our executive compensation; and 
 we are not required to give our shareholders non-binding advisory votes on executive compensation or golden parachute arrangements. 
 We will cease to be an emerging growth company upon the earliest of: 
 the last day of the fiscal year in which we have total annual gross revenues of 1.235 billion or more; 
 the date on which we become a large accelerated filer (the fiscal year end on which the total market value of our common equity securities held by non-affiliates is 700 million or more as of June 30); 
 the date on which we have, during the previous three-year period, issued more than 1.0 billion in non-convertible debt; and 
 the last day of the fiscal year following the fifth anniversary of the completion of our initial public offering in 2018. 
 We have elected to adopt certain of the reduced disclosure requirements above with respect to the periodic reports we will file with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the SEC ), and proxy statements that we use to solicit proxies from our shareholders. 
 In addition, Section 107 of the JOBS Act permits us to take advantage of an extended transition period for complying with new or revised accounting standards affecting public companies. However, we have irrevocably opted out of the extended transition period and, as a result, we will adopt new or revised accounting standards on the relevant dates on which adoption of such standards is required for other public companies. 
 Diversity, Equity and Inclusion DEI 
 We believe that DEI needs to start at the top of an organization. As the Company enters and expands its presence in more complex arenas including BaaS, we seek out diverse and qualified director candidates who bring a background and expertise in the fintech and digital banking sectors regardless of their gender, race, or other personal characteristics. Additionally, those members of the Company s board of directors would need to be representative of the diversity found in the fintech s themselves. Since beginning this effort the board of directors has added three women and two directors from minority backgrounds. We strive to maintain a diverse and inclusive work culture in which individual differences and experiences are valued and all employees have the opportunity to contribute and thrive. We believe that leveraging our employees diverse perspectives and capabilities will enhance innovation, foster a collaborative work culture and enable us to better serve our customers and communities. 
 DEI is also achieved through our CCBX partners and the markets they serve. Our reach extends to a diverse and often underserved market through our BaaS relationships. These partners offer access to credit, promote financial well-being, provide financial education, and other services to a variety of markets. Some of the markets served through our BaaS partnerships are: women, people of color, young adults, immigrants, small businesses and other underserved populations. 
 DEI extends to our customers as well. We are focused on supporting small businesses throughout our communities. The COVID-19 pandemic exposed the challenges of small business. We are proud to have participated in the Paycheck Protection Program, originating over 5,800 loans totaling more than 763 million. During the COVID-19 pandemic, our company financially supported locally-owned restaurants by providing meals and gift cards for our employees.

 Environment and Sustainability 
 We are focused on the environment and committed to business practices and activities that encourage sustainability and minimize our environmental impact. 
 We demonstrate environmental responsibility in various ways, including: 
 replacing standard light bulbs with LED bulb that have a longer life and use less energy most notably many of our parking lot lights have been converted to LED; and 
 repurposing existing furniture whenever possible instead of buying new. 
 We are focused on sustainability throughout our everyday business practices by: 
 using technology that provides for a paperless environment and transactional efficiencies, 
 eCycling old technology equipment to avoid sending it to landfills, 
 installation of occupancy sensors that automatically shut off lights in densely populated buildings; and 
 exterior lights are on timers. 
 Services like mobile and online banking, remote deposit capture, electronic loan payments, eStatements and combined statements enable us to support all customers in their efforts to consume less fuel and paper. We continue to digitize loan origination and deposit account opening processes, reducing trips to the bank and paper documents for our customers. 
 Additionally, we work hard to ensure that our lending activities do not encourage business activities that could cause irreparable damage to our reputation or the environment. As a result, we try to conduct business responsibly, with awareness to environmental, social, and human rights issues while also monitoring credit risks. This process involves management and board of director oversight. In general, we evaluate each credit or transaction on its individual merits, with larger deals receiving more attention and deeper analysis. 
 Human Capital 
 As of December 31, 2022, we had 448 full-time equivalent employees, all were located in the United States, however technology has allowed us to expand our reach to include a larger demographic with more remote employees working outside of our physical locations and throughout the country. We seek to attract, retain and develop the most talented employees possible by promoting a strong, positive culture, maintaining a safe and healthy workplace, emphasizing open communication with management and investing in training and education. In 2022, our retention rate was 88 . We seek to help our employees grow and develop. In 2022, we had 106 internal promotions. None of our employees are parties to a collective bargaining agreement. We consider our relationship with our employees to be good and have not experienced interruptions of operations due to labor disagreements. 
 Our commitment to diversity starts with our board of directors, which oversees the culture and holds management accountable to build and maintain a diverse and inclusive environment. We believe a diverse workforce is critical to sustainable success. As of December 31, 2022, 64 of our employees were female, 24 were minorities (non-Caucasian) and 3 were disabled. We are proud of our workforce and the opportunity to further diversify our team going forward. 
 Culture 
 We have always led with people, building our Bank on the diverse perspectives, knowledge, and experiences of our employees. Our employees utilize their strengths to set the course and are empowered to do the right things for our clients. We strive to create an inclusive workplace so we can build and maintain a high-performing culture where engaged, satisfied employees embody our core values: stay flexible, take care of each other, embrace gray thinking, be relentless, be the best and be un-bankey. 
 12 

Table of Contents 

 We seek out talent that will be a cultural fit to our core values and have backgrounds that are as diverse as the clients we serve in each of our business units. 
 Pay Equity 
 We believe our staff should be paid for the roles they fulfill, their experience, and how they do their jobs, and our goal is to attract, retain and develop quality talent. To deliver on that commitment, we benchmark and set pay ranges based on banking market data and consider factors such as an employee s role and experience, the location of their job, and their performance. We also regularly review our compensation practices, both in terms of our overall workforce and individual employees, to ensure our pay is fair and equitable. 
 Health, Safety and Wellness 
 Since the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic, we have taken a people-first approach to help our employees manage their work and personal responsibilities, with a strong focus on employee well-being, health and safety. Our human resource team engages the staff in an evolving wellness program designed to enhance physical, financial, and mental well-being for all our employees. We encourage healthy lifestyle behaviors through regular communications, educational sessions, voluntary progress tracking of beneficial health changes, and wellness challenges. 
 We value the contributions of our employees, particularly in the face of the challenges posed by the COVID-19 pandemic. Where possible, many employees have been working from home to help maintain their health and safety as well as business continuity. The Bank has accommodated staff who are unable to work on site due to health or family issues, and our human resources department works one-on-one to find solutions that are workable for both staff and the Company. 
 Community Engagement 
 We are committed to supporting the communities we serve through donations, sponsorships and employee volunteerism. 
 We offer employees two options for employees donate to charitable organizations, the Employee Giving Fund and the Employee Workplace Giving Portal. The charities that provide critical services in our communities depend on support from donors. This is a testament to our commitment to helping and supporting our neighbors by encouraging employees to give to their charity of choice wherever they live and work through payroll deduction. 
 The Employee Giving Fund is supported entirely by donations contributed by employees, enabling staff to pool their donations for the greatest impact in the communities served by the community bank. Employees direct the grants from the fund by serving on Bank s grant advisory committee. Since its inception in 2001, the Employee Giving Fund has awarded 449 grants totaling more than 747,000 through the end of 2022. 
 The Employee Workplace Giving Portal, launched in the fourth quarter of 2022, allows employees to support their charity of choice. With staff in 34 states, it is important to encourage and enable employees to support their community, wherever they are located. The Employee Workplace Giving Portal allows employees to support their charity of choice through payroll deduction. The Company pays the administrative fees for the program so 100 of employee donations are directed to their charities of choice. 
 Volunteering and supporting our communities is an important part of community engagement. We provide 16 hours of paid volunteer hours (for full time staff) per year to encourage and enable employees to volunteer in their communities. In 2022, employees volunteered 5,545 hours supporting 187 organizations. In 2022, the Bank supported 152 organizations through donations and event sponsorships.

 Regulation and Supervision 
 General 
 Insured banks, their holding companies and their affiliates are extensively regulated under federal and state law. As a result, our growth and earnings performance may be affected not only by management decisions and general economic conditions, but also by the requirements of federal and state statutes and by the regulations and policies of various bank regulatory agencies, including the Washington Department of Financial Institutions Washington DFI ), the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve Federal Reserve ), the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation FDIC and the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau CFPB ). Furthermore, tax laws administered by the Internal Revenue Service IRS ), and state taxing authorities, accounting rules developed by the FASB, securities laws administered by the SEC and state securities authorities, anti-money laundering laws enforced by the U.S. Department of the Treasury Treasury Department and mortgage related rules, including with respect to loan securitization and servicing by the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development and entities such as Ginnie Mae and Freddie Mac, and SBA regulations with respect to small business loans, have an impact on our business. The effect of these statutes, regulations, regulatory policies and rules are significant to our operations and results, and the nature and extent of future legislative, regulatory or other changes affecting financial institutions are impossible to predict with any certainty. 
 Federal and state banking laws impose a comprehensive system of supervision, regulation and enforcement on the operations of insured banks, their holding companies and affiliates that is intended primarily for the protection of the FDIC-insured deposits and depositors of banks, rather than their shareholders. These federal and state laws, and the regulations of the bank regulatory agencies issued under them, affect, among other things, the scope of business, the kinds and amounts of investments banks may make, reserve requirements, capital levels relative to operations, the nature and amount of collateral for loans, the establishment of branches, the ability to merge, consolidate and acquire, dealings with insiders and affiliates and the payment of dividends. 
 This supervisory and regulatory framework subjects banks and bank holding companies to regular examination by their respective regulatory agencies, which results in examination reports and ratings that, while not publicly available, can impact the conduct and growth of their businesses. These examinations consider not only compliance with applicable laws and regulations, but also capital levels, asset quality and risk, management ability and performance, earnings, liquidity, sensitivity to market risk and various other factors. The regulatory agencies generally have broad discretion to impose restrictions and limitations on the operations of a regulated entity where the agencies determine, among other things, that such operations are unsafe or unsound, fail to comply with applicable law or are otherwise inconsistent with laws and regulations or with the supervisory policies of these agencies. 
 The following is a summary of the material elements of the supervisory and regulatory framework applicable to us and the Bank. It does not describe all of the statutes, regulations and regulatory policies that apply, nor does it restate all of the requirements of those that are described. The descriptions are qualified in their entirety by reference to the particular statutory and regulatory provision. 
 Bank Holding Company Regulation 
 Since we own all of the capital stock of the Bank, we are a bank holding company under the Bank Holding Company Act of 1956, as amended (the BHC Act ). As a result, we are primarily subject to the supervision, examination and reporting requirements of the BHC Act and the regulations of the Federal Reserve. 
 Acquisition of Banks 
 The BHC Act requires every bank holding company to obtain the Federal Reserve s prior approval before: 
 acquiring direct or indirect ownership or control of any voting shares of any bank if, after the acquisition, the bank holding company will, directly or indirectly, own or control more than 5 of the bank s voting shares; 
 acquiring all or substantially all of the assets of any bank; or 
 14 

Table of Contents 

 merging or consolidating with any other bank holding company. 
 Additionally, the BHC Act provides that the Federal Reserve may not approve any of the above transactions if such transaction would result in or tend to create a monopoly or substantially lessen competition or otherwise function as a restraint of trade, unless the anti-competitive effects of the proposed transaction are clearly outweighed by the public interest in meeting the convenience and needs of the community to be served. The Federal Reserve is also required to consider the financial and managerial resources and future prospects of the bank holding companies and banks concerned and the convenience and needs of the community to be served. The Federal Reserve s consideration of financial resources includes a focus on capital adequacy, which is discussed in the section entitled Bank Regulation and Supervision Capital Adequacy. The Federal Reserve also considers the effectiveness of the institutions in combating money laundering, including a review of the anti-money laundering programs and compliance records of the parties. Finally, the Federal Reserve takes into consideration the extent to which the proposed transaction would result in greater or more concentrated risks to the stability of the U.S. banking or financial system. 
 Under the BHC Act, if well-capitalized and well-managed, we or any other bank holding company located in Washington may purchase a bank located outside of Washington without regard to whether such transaction is prohibited under state law. Conversely, a well-capitalized and well-managed bank holding company located outside of Washington may purchase a bank located inside Washington without regard to whether such transaction is prohibited under state law. In each case, however, restrictions may be placed under state law on the acquisition of a bank that has only been in existence for a limited amount of time or will result in concentrations of deposits exceeding limits specified by statute. For example, Washington law currently prohibits a bank holding company from acquiring control of a Washington-based financial institution until the target financial institution has been in operation for at least five years. 
 Change in Bank Control 
 Subject to various exceptions, the BHC Act and the Change in Bank Control Act, together with related regulations, require Federal Reserve approval prior to any person or company acquiring control of a bank holding company. Under a rebuttable presumption established by the Federal Reserve pursuant to the Change in Bank Control Act, the acquisition of 10 or more of a class of voting stock of a bank holding company would constitute acquisition of control of the bank holding company if no other person will own, control, or hold the power to vote a greater percentage of that class of voting stock immediately after the transaction or the bank holding company has registered securities under the Exchange Act, as we have. In addition, any company, person or group of persons acting in concert must obtain the approval or non-objection of the Federal Reserve under the BHC Act or Change in Bank Control Act before acquiring 25 or more (more than 5 in the case of an acquirer that is already a bank holding company) of the outstanding voting stock of a bank holding company, the right to control in any manner the election of a majority of the company s directors, or otherwise obtaining control or a controlling influence over the bank holding company. Approval of the Washington DFI may also be required under state law before a person can acquire control over us. 
 Permitted Activities 
 Under the BHC Act, a bank holding company is generally permitted to engage in or acquire direct or indirect control of the voting shares of any company engaged in the following activities: 
 banking or managing or controlling banks; and 
 any activity that the Federal Reserve determines to be so closely related to banking as to be a proper incident to the business of banking. 
 Activities that the Federal Reserve has found to be so closely related to banking as to be a proper incident to the business of banking include: 
 factoring accounts receivable; 
 making, acquiring, brokering or servicing loans and usual related activities in connection with the foregoing; 
 leasing personal or real property under certain conditions;

 The Federal Reserve may order a bank holding company or its subsidiaries to terminate any of these activities or to terminate its ownership or control of any subsidiary when it has reasonable cause to believe that the bank holding company s continued ownership, activity or control constitutes a serious risk to the financial safety, soundness, or stability of it or any of its bank subsidiaries. In addition to the permissible bank holding company activities listed above, a bank holding company may qualify and elect to become a financial holding company, thereby permitting the bank holding company to engage in activities that are financial in nature or incidental or complementary to financial activity, which are broader activities than are otherwise permissible for bank holding companies. 
 For us to qualify to become a financial holding company, we must be well-capitalized and well-managed. In addition, the Bank and any other depository institution subsidiary we control must be well-capitalized and well-managed and must have a CRA rating of at least satisfactory. Additionally, we must file an election with the Federal Reserve to become a financial holding company and must provide the Federal Reserve with 30 days written notice prior to engaging in a permitted financial activity. We have not elected to become a financial holding company at this time. 
 Dividends 
 The Federal Reserve has issued a policy statement on the payment of cash dividends by bank holding companies, which expresses the Federal Reserve s view that a bank holding company should pay cash dividends only to the extent that the holding company s net income for the past year is sufficient to cover both the cash dividends and a rate of earning retention that is consistent with the holding company s capital needs, asset quality and overall financial condition. The Federal Reserve also has indicated that it would be inappropriate for a holding company experiencing serious financial problems to borrow funds to pay dividends. Furthermore, under the prompt corrective action regulations adopted by the Federal Reserve, the Federal Reserve may prohibit a bank holding company from paying any dividends if one or more of the holding company s bank subsidiaries is classified as undercapitalized. 
 Support of Subsidiary Institutions 
 The Federal Deposit Insurance Act FDIA and a Federal Reserve regulation require a bank holding company to serve as a source of financial and managerial strength to its bank subsidiaries. In addition, where a bank holding company has more than one FDIC-insured bank or thrift subsidiary, each of the bank holding company s subsidiary FDIC-insured depository institutions is responsible for any losses to the FDIC as a result of an affiliated depository institution s failure. As a result of a bank holding company s source of strength obligation, a bank holding company may be required to provide funds to a bank subsidiary in the form of subordinate capital or other instruments which qualify as capital under bank regulatory rules and at a time when the bank holding company would not otherwise be inclined to do so. 
 Repurchase or Redemption of Securities 
 A bank holding company that is not well capitalized or well managed, or that is subject to any unresolved supervisory issues, is required to give the Federal Reserve prior written notice of any purchase or redemption of its own 
 16 

Table of Contents 

 then-outstanding equity securities if the gross consideration for the purchase or redemption, when combined with the net consideration paid for all such purchases or redemptions during the preceding 12 months, is equal to 10 or more of the company s consolidated net worth. The Federal Reserve may disapprove such a purchase or redemption if it determines that the proposal would constitute an unsafe and unsound practice, or would violate any law, regulation, Federal Reserve order or directive, or any condition imposed by, or written agreement with, the Federal Reserve. Additionally, under Federal Reserve guidance, a bank holding company is generally expected to consult with Federal Reserve supervisory staff prior to repurchasing or redeeming stock in a number of circumstances, including when the company is considering expansion. 
 Bank Regulation and Supervision 
 The Bank is subject to extensive federal and state banking laws and regulations that impose restrictions on and provide for general regulatory oversight of the operations of the Bank. These laws and regulations are generally intended to protect the safety and soundness of the Bank and the Bank s depositors, rather than our shareholders. The following discussion describes the material elements of the regulatory framework that applies to the Bank. 
 Since the Bank is a commercial bank chartered under the laws of the state of Washington and is a member of the Federal Reserve System, it is primarily subject to the supervision, examination and reporting requirements of the Federal Reserve and the Washington DFI. The Federal Reserve and the Washington DFI regularly examine the Bank s operations and have the authority to approve or disapprove mergers, the establishment of branches and similar corporate actions. Both regulatory agencies have the power to take enforcement action to prevent the development or continuance of unsafe or unsound banking practices or other violations of law. The Bank s deposits are insured by the FDIC to the maximum extent provided by law. The Bank is also subject to numerous federal and state statutes and regulations that affect its business, activities and operations. 
 Branching 
 Under current Washington law, the Bank may open branch offices throughout Washington with the prior approval of the Washington DFI. In addition, with prior regulatory approval, the Bank may acquire branches of existing banks located in Washington. Under federal law, the Bank may establish branch offices with the prior approval of the Federal Reserve. Federal law allows a bank to branch into a new state by setting up a new branch if, under the laws of the state in which the branch is to be located, a state bank chartered by that state would be permitted to establish the branch, and if the bank meets certain supervisory and financial criteria. 
 FDIC Insurance and Other Assessments 
 The Bank s deposits are insured by the FDIC to the full extent provided in the FDIA (currently 250,000 per deposit account), and the Bank pays assessments to the FDIC for that coverage. Under the FDIC s risk-based deposit insurance assessment system, an insured institution s deposit insurance premium is computed by multiplying the institution s assessment base by the institution s assessment rate. An institution s assessment base equals the institution s average consolidated total assets during a particular assessment period, minus the institution s average tangible equity capital (that is, Tier 1 capital during such period. For institutions like the Bank with less than 10.0 billion in total consolidated assets, the assessment rate is calculated using a financial ratios method based on a statistical model estimating the institution s probability of failure over three years utilizing seven financial ratios (leverage ratio; net income before taxes/total assets; nonperforming loans and leases/gross assets; other real estate owned/gross assets; brokered deposit ratio; one year asset growth; and loan mix index) and a weighted average of supervisory ratings components. Since the outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic, the amount of total estimated insured deposits has grown rapidly while the funds in the DIF have grown at a normal rate, causing the DIF reserve ratio to fall below the statutory minimum of 1.35 . The FDIC adopted a restoration plan in September 2020, which it amended in June 2022, to restore the DIF reserve ratio to at least 1.35 by September 30, 2028. On October 18, 2022 the FDIC adopted a final rule to increase initial base deposit insurance assessment rates for insured depository institutions by 2 basis points, beginning with the first quarterly assessment period of 2023. The increased assessment rate schedules will remain in effect unless and until the reserve ratio of the DIF meets or exceeds 2 . As a result of the new rule, the FDIC insurance costs of insured depository institutions, including the Bank, will generally increase. The range of assessment rates effective January 1, 2023, and first applicable on invoices dated June 30, 2023, will fall between 2.5 basis points for an established small institution posing the least risk, to 32 basis points for an established small institution posing the most risk. The FDIC will lower the range of assessment rates if the reserve ratio of the Deposit Insurance Fund DIF increases to 2 or more. The FDIC may also impose special assessments from time to time. As of September 30, 2022, which is the most recent information available, the DIF was at 1.26 .

 Termination of Deposit Insurance 
 The FDIC may terminate its insurance of deposits of a bank if it finds that the bank has engaged in unsafe or unsound practices, is in an unsafe or unsound condition to continue operations, or has violated any applicable law, regulation, rule, order or condition imposed by the FDIC. 
 Community Reinvestment Act 
 The Community Reinvestment Act CRA requires that, in connection with examinations of insured depository institutions within their respective jurisdictions, the federal banking agencies will evaluate the record of each financial institution in meeting the credit needs of its local community, including low- and moderate-income neighborhoods. The Federal Reserve periodically evaluates the Bank s record of performance under the CRA, and these evaluations are publicly available. A bank s CRA performance is considered in evaluating applications seeking approval for mergers, acquisitions, and new offices or facilities. Failure to adequately meet these criteria could result in additional requirements and limitations being imposed on the bank. Certain regulatory advantages, such as expedited processing of applications, are available only to banks with CRA ratings of Satisfactory or Outstanding. Additionally, we must publicly disclose the terms of certain CRA-related agreements. The Bank received a Satisfactory rating at its most recent evaluation dated March 7, 2022. 
 On May 5, 2022 the federal banking agencies issued a proposed rule that would substantially revise how they evaluate an insured depository institution s record of satisfying the credit needs of its entire communities, including low- and moderate- income individuals and neighborhoods, under the CRA. If this rule is finalized as proposed, it may become more challenging and/or costly for insured depository institutions to achieve an Outstanding or Satisfactory CRA rating, which could negatively impact our ability to obtain regulatory approval for an acquisition. 
 Interest Rate Limitations 
 Interest and other charges collected or contracted for by the Bank are subject to applicable state usury laws and federal laws concerning interest rates. 
 Reserves 
 Pursuant to regulations of the Federal Reserve, an insured depository institution must maintain reserves against its transaction accounts. Because required reserves generally must be maintained in the form of vault cash, with a pass-through correspondent bank, or in the institution s account at a Federal Reserve Bank, the effect of the reserve requirement may be to reduce the amount of an institution s assets available for lending or investment. In March 2020, in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, the Federal Reserve reduced all reserve requirement ratios to zero. The Federal Reserve indicated that it may adjust reserve requirement ratios in the future if conditions warrant. 
 Federal Laws Applicable to Consumer Credit and Deposit Transactions 
 The Bank s loan and deposit operations are subject to a number of federal consumer protection laws, including: 
 the Federal Truth in Lending Act, governing disclosures of credit terms to consumer borrowers; 
 the Real Estate Settlement Procedures Act, imposing requirements on the settlement and servicing of residential mortgage loans; 
 the Home Mortgage Disclosure Act, requiring financial institutions to provide information to enable the public and public officials to determine whether a financial institution is fulfilling its obligation to help meet the housing needs of the communities it serves; 
 the Equal Credit Opportunity Act, prohibiting discrimination on the basis of race, color, religion, national origin, sex, marital status or certain other prohibited factors in all aspects of credit transactions; 
 the Fair Credit Reporting Act FCRA ), governing the use and provision of information to credit reporting agencies;

 the rules and regulations of the CFPB and various federal agencies charged with the responsibility of implementing these federal laws. 
 Capital Adequacy 
 The Federal Reserve has adopted risk-based and leverage capital adequacy requirements, pursuant to which they assess the adequacy of bank holding company and bank capital in examinations and in analyzing bank regulatory applications. Risk-based capital requirements determine the adequacy of capital based on credit and certain other risks inherent in various classes of assets and off-balance sheet items. The federal banking regulators have adopted regulations implementing the Basel Capital Adequacy Accord Basel III ), an international capital adequacy framework. The U.S. Basel III rule requires a minimum capital to risk-weighted assets requirements are a common equity Tier 1 capital ratio of 4.5 , a Tier 1 capital ratio of 6.0 , and a total capital ratio of 8.0 . The minimum leverage ratio (Tier 1 capital to total assets) is 4.0 . 
 In order to avoid limitations on capital distributions, including dividend payments and certain discretionary bonus payments to executive officers, a banking organization must maintain a capital conservation buffer composed of common equity Tier 1 capital above its minimum risk-based capital requirements. The buffer is measured relative to risk-weighted assets. A banking organization with a buffer greater than 2.5 is not subject to limits on capital distributions or discretionary bonus payments; however, a banking organization with a buffer of 2.5 or less would be subject to increasingly stringent limitations as the buffer approaches zero. A banking organization also would be prohibited from making distributions or discretionary bonus payments during any quarter if its eligible retained income is zero or negative in that quarter and its capital conservation buffer ratio was 2.5 or less at the beginning of the quarter. Effectively, the Basel III framework, including the capital conservation buffer, requires the Bank to meet minimum risk-based capital ratios of (i) 7 for common equity Tier 1 capital, (ii) 8.5 Tier 1 capital, and (iii) 10.5 total capital. The eligible retained income of a banking organization is defined as the greater of (1) its net income for the four calendar quarters preceding the current calendar quarter, based on the organization s quarterly regulatory reports, net of any distributions and associated tax effects not already reflected in net income, and (2) the average of its net income over the preceding four quarters. The minimum capital requirements plus the capital conservation buffer will exceed the prompt corrective action PCA ), well-capitalized thresholds for risk-based capital ratios, which are described below under Prompt Corrective Action. 
 The U.S. Basel III rule includes stringent criteria for capital instruments to qualify as Tier 1 or Tier 2 capital. For instance, the rule effectively disallows newly-issued trust preferred securities as a component of a holding company s Tier 1 capital. However, depository institution holding companies with less than 15 billion in total assets generally may include non-qualifying instruments that were issued and included in Tier 1 or Tier 2 capital prior to May 19, 2010 in Additional Tier 1 or Tier 2 capital until they redeem such instruments or until the instruments mature. At December 31,

 2022 the Company had 3.5 million of non-qualifying instruments includable in Tier 1 capital that were issued prior to May 19, 2010. 
 The Company and the Bank are required to meet the generally applicable regulatory capital requirements of the Federal Reserve and the FDIC. Historically, the Company had been operating under the Small Bank Holding Company Policy Statement, which exempts bank holding companies that have total consolidated assets of less than 3.0 billion and meet other criteria from the Federal Reserve s risk-based- and leverage capital rules. Because the Company s total consolidated assets exceeded 3.0 billion as of September 30, 2022, the Company is no longer subject to the Federal Reserve s Small Bank Holding Company Policy Statement and will be evaluated relative to the capital adequacy standards established by the Federal Reserve going forward. A bank holding company that crosses the 3.0 billion total consolidated assets threshold as of June 30 of a particular year is no longer permitted to file reports as a small holding company beginning the following March. The Company was not in excess of 3.0 billion as of June 30, 2022, and accordingly prepared and filed financial reports with the Federal Reserve as a small bank holding company. Currently, the Federal Reserve assesses the capital position of the Company based on these reports by reviewing its debt-to-equity ratio and its capacity to serve as a source of strength to the Bank. If the Company s total consolidated assets remain in excess of 3.0 billion as of June 30, 2023, starting in March 2024 the Company will cease filing financial reports with the Federal Reserve as though it were a small bank holding company. 
 The Economic Growth, Regulatory Relief and Consumer Protection Act (the EGRRCPA requires the federal banking agencies to develop a community bank leverage ratio (the CBLR (defined as the ratio of tangible equity capital to average total consolidated assets) for certain banks and holding companies with total consolidated assets of less than 10 billion. Qualifying banks that exceed the minimum CBLR are deemed to be in compliance with all other capital and leverage requirements. The CBLR is currently set at 9.0 . The Company and Bank have not adopted the CBLR. 
 Failure to meet statutorily mandated capital guidelines or more restrictive ratios separately established for a banking institution could subject the institution to a variety of enforcement remedies available to federal regulatory authorities, including issuance of a capital directive, the termination of deposit insurance by the FDIC, a prohibition on accepting or renewing brokered deposits, limitations on the rates of interest that the institution may pay on its deposits, and other restrictions on its business. 
 Prompt Corrective Action 
 The Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation Improvement Act of 1991 establishes a system of prompt corrective action to resolve the problems of undercapitalized insured depository institutions. Under this system, the federal banking regulators have established five capital categories (well-capitalized, adequately capitalized, undercapitalized, significantly undercapitalized and critically undercapitalized); all insured depository institutions fall into one of these categories. The federal banking agencies have specified by regulation the relevant capital thresholds and other qualitative requirements for each of the categories. For an insured depository institution to be well-capitalized under the PCA framework, it must have a common equity Tier 1 capital ratio of 6.50 , Tier 1 capital ratio of 8.00 , a total capital ratio of 10.00 , and a leverage ratio of 5.00 , and must not be subject to any written agreement, order or capital directive, or prompt corrective action directive issued by its primary federal regulator to meet and maintain a specific capital level for any capital measure. At December 31, 2022, the Bank qualified for the well-capitalized category. 
 Federal banking regulators are required to take various mandatory supervisory actions and are authorized to take other discretionary actions with respect to institutions in the three undercapitalized categories. An undercapitalized institution has a capital ratio below any one of four thresholds: a common equity Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio of 4.5 , a Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio of 6.0 , a total risk-based capital ratio of 8.0 , or a leverage ratio of 4.0 . The severity of the action depends upon the capital category in which the institution is placed. For example, institutions in all three undercapitalized categories are automatically restricted from paying distributions and management fees, whereas only an institution that is significantly undercapitalized or critically undercapitalized is restricted in its compensation paid to senior executive officers. Generally, subject to a narrow exception, the banking regulator must appoint a receiver or conservator for an institution that is critically undercapitalized. 
 An institution that is categorized as undercapitalized, significantly undercapitalized, or critically undercapitalized is required to submit an acceptable capital restoration plan to its appropriate federal banking agency. Such a plan must include a guarantee from the institution s bank holding company that the institution will comply with the plan until the institution has been adequately capitalized on average during each of the four consecutive calendar quarters. The holding company s obligation to fund a capital restoration plan is limited to the lesser of (i) 5 of an undercapitalized subsidiary 
 20 

Table of Contents 

 institution s assets at the time it became undercapitalized and (ii) the amount required to meet regulatory capital requirements. An undercapitalized institution is also generally prohibited from increasing its average total assets, making acquisitions, establishing any branches or engaging in any new line of business, except under an accepted capital restoration plan or with Federal Reserve approval. A critically undercapitalized bank, one with a ratio of tangible equity to total assets of 2 or less, is presumptively subject to a supervisory acquisition or the appointment of a conservator or receiver. 
 The regulations also establish procedures for downgrading an institution to a lower capital category based on supervisory factors other than capital. 
 Liquidity 
 Financial institutions are subject to significant regulatory scrutiny regarding their liquidity positions. Various bank regulatory publications, including Federal Reserve SR 10-6 (Funding and Liquidity Risk Management), address the identification, measurement, monitoring and control of funding and liquidity risk by financial institutions. 
 The U.S. federal banking regulators have two standardized metrics for large banking organizations. The first metric is the liquidity coverage ratio, and it aims to require a financial institution to maintain sufficient high-quality liquid resources to survive an acute stress scenario that lasts for one month. The second metric is the net stable funding ratio, and its objective is to require a financial institution to maintain a minimum amount of stable sources relative to the liquidity profiles of the institution s assets, as well as the potential for contingent liquidity needs arising from off-balance sheet commitments, over a one-year horizon. 
 While the liquidity coverage ratio and the net stable funding ratio only apply to the largest banking organizations in the country, certain elements may filter down and become applicable to or expected of all insured depository institutions including the Bank. 
 Payment of Dividends 
 We are a legal entity separate and distinct from the Bank. Our principal source of cash flow, including cash flow to pay dividends to our shareholders, is from capital raises and dividends the Bank pays to us as the Bank s sole shareholder. Statutory and regulatory limitations apply to the Bank s payment of dividends to us as well as to our payment of dividends to our shareholders. A corollary to the requirement that a bank holding company serve as a source of strength to its subsidiary banks is the Federal Reserve policy that a bank holding company should not maintain a level of cash dividends to its shareholders that places undue pressure on the capital of its bank subsidiaries or that can be funded only through additional borrowings or other arrangements that may undermine the bank holding company s ability to serve as such a source of strength. Our ability to pay dividends is also subject to the provisions of Washington corporate law that prevent distributions to shareholders if, after giving effect to the distribution, we would not be able to pay our liabilities as they become due in the usual course of business or our total assets would be less than the sum of our total liabilities plus the amount that would be needed, if we were to be dissolved at the time of the distribution, to satisfy the preferential rights upon dissolution of shareholders whose preferential rights are superior to those receiving the distribution. In addition, in deciding whether or not to declare a dividend of any particular size, our board of directors must consider our and the Bank s current and prospective capital, liquidity, and other needs. 
 The Washington DFI and the Federal Reserve also regulate the Bank s dividend payments. Under Washington law, a state-chartered bank may not pay a dividend in an amount greater than its retained earnings without approval of the Washington DFI. Under Federal Reserve regulations, the Bank may not declare or pay a dividend if the total of all dividends declared during the calendar year, including the proposed dividend, exceeds the sum of the Bank s net income during the current calendar year and the retained net income of the prior two calendar years, unless the dividend has been approved by the Federal Reserve. 
 The Bank s payment of dividends may also be affected or limited by other factors, such as the requirement to maintain adequate capital above regulatory guidelines. The federal banking agencies have indicated that paying dividends that deplete a depository institution s capital base to an inadequate level would be an unsafe and unsound banking practice. Under the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation Improvement Act of 1991, a depository institution may not pay any dividends if payment would cause it to become undercapitalized or if it already is undercapitalized. Moreover, the federal agencies have issued policy statements providing that bank holding companies and insured banks should generally only pay dividends out of current operating earnings.

 Restrictions on Transactions with Affiliates and Insiders 
 The Bank is subject to Section 23A of the Federal Reserve Act, which places limits on the amount of: 
 a bank s loans or extensions of credit to affiliates; 
 a bank s investment in securities issued by affiliates; 
 a bank s purchase of assets from affiliates; 
 loans or extensions of credit made by a bank to third parties collateralized by the securities or obligations of affiliates; 
 a bank s guarantee, acceptance or letter of credit issued on behalf of an affiliate; 
 a bank s transactions with an affiliate involving the borrowing or lending of securities to the extent they create credit exposure to the affiliate; and 
 a bank s derivative transactions with an affiliate to the extent they create credit exposure to the affiliate. 
 Subject to various exceptions, the total amount of the above transactions is limited in amount, as to any one affiliate, to 10 of a bank s capital and surplus and, as to all affiliates combined, to 20 of a bank s capital and surplus. In addition to the limitation on the amount of these transactions, the above transactions also must meet specified collateral requirements and safety and soundness requirements. Under no circumstances may a bank purchase a low-quality asset from an affiliate. 
 The Bank is also subject to Section 23B of the Federal Reserve Act, which, among other things, prohibits a bank from engaging in the above transactions with affiliates, as well as other types of transactions set forth in Section 23B, unless the transactions are on terms substantially the same, or at least as favorable to the bank, as those prevailing at the time for comparable transactions with nonaffiliated companies. 
 The Bank is also subject to restrictions on extensions of credit to its executive officers, directors, principal shareholders and their related interests. These extensions of credit (i) must be made on substantially the same terms, including interest rates and collateral, as those prevailing at the time for comparable transactions between the bank and third parties, and (ii) must not involve more than the normal risk of repayment or present other unfavorable features. There are also individual and aggregate limitations on loans to insiders and their related interests. The aggregate amount of insider loans generally cannot exceed the institution s total unimpaired capital and surplus. Insiders and banks are subject to enforcement actions for knowingly entering into insider loans in violation of applicable restrictions. 
 Brokered Deposits 
 The FDIA prohibits insured banks from accepting brokered deposits or offering interest rates on any deposits significantly higher than the prevailing rate in the bank s normal market area or nationally (depending upon where the deposits are solicited) unless it is well-capitalized, or it is adequately capitalized and receives a waiver from the FDIC. A bank that is adequately capitalized and that accepts brokered deposits under a waiver from the FDIC may not pay an interest rate on any deposit in excess of 75 basis points over certain prevailing market rates. There are no such restrictions under the FDIA on a bank that is well-capitalized. Further, undercapitalized institutions are subject to growth limitations. FDIC rules set forth standards for determining whether a person is a deposit broker and whether an insured depository institution must therefore treat deposits placed by that person as brokered deposits. Among other things, these rules provides that a person can generally only be a deposit broker if the person places deposits at more than one insured depository institution. 
 Single Borrower Credit Limits 
 Under Washington law, total loans and extensions of credit to a borrower may not exceed 20 of the Bank s capital and surplus.

 Commercial Real Estate Concentration Limits 
 In December 2006, the federal banking regulators issued guidance entitled Concentrations in Commercial Real Estate Lending, Sound Risk Management Practices to address increased concentrations in commercial real estate CRE ), loans. In addition, in December 2015, the federal bank agencies issued additional guidance entitled Statement on Prudent Risk Management for Commercial Real Estate Lending. Together, these guidelines describe the criteria the agencies will use as indicators to identify institutions potentially exposed to CRE concentration risk. An institution that has (i) experienced rapid growth in CRE lending, (ii) notable exposure to a specific type of CRE, (iii) total reported loans for construction, land development, and other land representing 100 or more of the institution s capital, or (iv) total CRE loans representing 300 or more of the institution s capital, and the outstanding balance of the institutions CRE portfolio has increased by 50 or more in the prior 36 months, may be identified for further supervisory analysis of the level and nature of its CRE concentration risk. The Bank s total non-owner-occupied commercial real estate loans, including loans secured by apartment buildings, investor commercial real estate, and construction and land loans, represented 269.2 and 305.1 of its capital, at December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. The outstanding balance of the Bank s CRE portfolio has increased by 30.9 and 7.8 , for the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. The level of CRE has exceeded regulatory guidelines in the previous 36 months but the growth rate is within regulatory guidelines, however, the Bank maintains enhanced underwriting and monitoring processes and procedures to manage its CRE portfolio. 
 Privacy 
 Financial institutions are required to disclose their policies for collecting and protecting nonpublic personal information of their clients. Clients generally may prevent financial institutions from sharing non-public personal information with nonaffiliated third parties except under certain circumstances, such as the processing of transactions requested by the consumer or when the financial institution is jointly offering a product or service with a nonaffiliated financial institution. Additionally, financial institutions generally are prohibited from disclosing consumer account numbers to any nonaffiliated third party for use in telemarketing, direct mail marketing or other marketing to consumers. 
 Cybersecurity 
 Federal banking agencies pay close attention to the cybersecurity practices of banks and their holding companies and affiliates. The interagency council of the agencies, the Federal Financial Institutions Examination Council FFIEC ), has issued several policy statements and other guidance for banks as new cybersecurity threats arise. FFIEC has recently focused on such matters as compromised customer credentials and business continuity planning. Examinations by the banking agencies now include review of an institution s information technology and its ability to thwart cyberattacks. 
 Federal banking agency rules require banking organizations to notify their primary federal regulator of significant security incidents within 36 hours of determining that such an incident has occurred as soon as possible and no later than within 36 hours of a significant cybersecurity incident. 
 Consumer Credit Reporting 
 The FCRA imposes, among other things: 
 requirements for financial institutions to develop policies and procedures to identify potential identity theft and, upon the request of a consumer, to place a fraud alert in the consumer s credit file stating that the consumer may be the victim of identity theft or other fraud; 
 requirements for entities that furnish information to consumer reporting agencies to implement procedures and policies regarding the accuracy and integrity of the furnished information and regarding the correction of previously furnished information that is later determined to be inaccurate; 
 requirements for mortgage lenders to disclose credit scores to consumers in certain circumstances; and 
 limitations on the ability of a business that receives consumer information from an affiliate to use that information for marketing purposes.

 Anti-Terrorism, Money Laundering Legislation and OFAC 
 The Bank is subject to the Bank Secrecy Act and the USA Patriot Act. These statutes and related rules and regulations impose requirements and limitations on specified financial transactions and accounts and other relationships intended to guard against money laundering and terrorism financing. The principal requirements for an insured depository institution include (i) establishment of an anti-money laundering program that includes training and audit components, (ii) establishment of a know your customer program involving due diligence to confirm the identities of persons seeking to open accounts and to deny accounts to those persons unable to demonstrate their identities, (iii) the filing of currency transaction reports for deposits and withdrawals of large amounts of cash, (iv) additional precautions for accounts sought and managed for non-U.S. persons and (v) verification and certification of money laundering risk with respect to private banking and foreign correspondent banking relationships. For many of these tasks a bank must keep records to be made available to its primary federal regulator. Anti-money laundering rules and policies are developed by the Treasury Department, including the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network, but compliance by individual institutions is overseen by its primary federal regulator. 
 The Bank has established appropriate anti-money laundering and customer identification programs. The Bank also maintains records of cash purchases of negotiable instruments, files reports of certain cash transactions exceeding 10,000 (daily aggregate amount), and reports suspicious activity that might signify money laundering, tax evasion, or other criminal activities pursuant to the Bank Secrecy Act. The Bank otherwise has implemented policies and procedures to comply with the foregoing requirements. 
 The Treasury Department s Office of Foreign Assets Control OFAC ), is responsible for helping to ensure that U.S. entities do not engage in transactions with certain prohibited parties, as defined by various Executive Orders and Acts of Congress. OFAC publishes lists of persons, organizations and countries suspected of aiding, harboring or engaging in terrorist acts, known as Specially Designated Nationals and Blocked Persons. If the Company or the Bank finds a name on any transaction, account or wire transfer that is on an OFAC list, the Company or the Bank must freeze or block such account or transaction, file a suspicious activity report, and notify the appropriate authorities. 
 Sarbanes-Oxley Act 
 The Sarbanes-Oxley Act represents a comprehensive revision of laws affecting corporate governance, accounting obligations and corporate reporting. The Sarbanes-Oxley Act is applicable to all companies with equity securities registered, or that file reports, under the Exchange Act. In particular, the act established (i) requirements for audit committees, including independence, expertise and responsibilities; (ii) responsibilities regarding financial statements for the chief executive officer and chief financial officer of the reporting company and new requirements for them to certify the accuracy of periodic reports; (iii) standards for auditors and regulation of audits; (iv) disclosure and reporting obligations for the reporting company and its directors and executive officers; and (v) civil and criminal penalties for violations of the federal securities laws. The legislation also established an accounting oversight board to enforce auditing standards and restrict the scope of services that accounting firms may provide to their publicly traded company audit clients. 
 Overdraft Fees 
 Federal Reserve Regulation E restricts banks abilities to charge overdraft fees. The rule prohibits financial institutions from charging fees for paying overdrafts on ATM and one-time debit card transactions, unless a consumer consents, or opts in, to the overdraft service for those types of transactions. 
 The Dodd-Frank Act and the EGRRCPA 
 The Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act Dodd-Frank Act significantly changed the bank regulatory framework and affected the lending, deposit, investment, trading and operating activities of banks and their holding companies, including in the following ways: 
 The Dodd-Frank Act imposed additional requirements regarding the origination and servicing of residential mortgage loans. The law created a variety of consumer protections, including limitations, subject to exceptions, on the manner by which loan originators may be compensated and an obligation on the part of lenders to verify a borrower s ability to repay a residential mortgage loan.

 The Dodd-Frank Act addresses many investor protection, corporate governance and executive compensation matters that affect most U.S. publicly traded companies. The Dodd-Frank Act (i) requires publicly traded companies to give shareholders a non-binding vote on executive compensation and golden parachute payments; (ii) enhances independence requirements for compensation committee members; (iii) requires national securities exchanges to require listed companies to adopt incentive-based compensation clawback policies for executive officers; (iv) authorizes the SEC to promulgate rules that would allow shareholders to nominate their own candidates using a company s proxy materials; and (v) directs the federal banking regulators to issue rules prohibiting incentive compensation that encourages inappropriate risks. 
 Other rules and regulations implementing the Dodd-Frank Act that may be relevant to us and the Bank are described or otherwise accounted for in various parts of this -Regulation and Supervision section. 
 The EGRRCPA made changes to a variety of rules and regulations, including revisions to the Dodd-Frank Act. For example, the EGRRCPA exempts certain lenders from the ability to repay requirements. Other EGRRCPA changes are described elsewhere in this section. 
 Current Expected Credit Losses Model 
 The FASB adopted a new accounting standard for GAAP that became effective for us on January 1, 2023. This standard, referred to as CECL, requires FDIC-insured institutions and their holding companies (banking organizations) to recognize credit losses expected over the life of certain financial assets. CECL covers a broader range of assets than the current method of recognizing credit losses and generally results in earlier recognition of credit losses. Upon adoption of CECL, a banking organization must record a one-time adjustment to its credit loss allowances as of the beginning of the fiscal year of adoption equal to the difference, if any, between the amount of credit loss allowances under the current methodology and the amount required under CECL. For a banking organization, implementation of CECL is generally likely to reduce retained earnings, and to affect other items, in a manner that reduces its regulatory capital. 
 Consumer Financial Protection Bureau 
 The Dodd-Frank Act created the CFPB, an independent federal bureau within the Federal Reserve System having broad rulemaking, supervisory and enforcement powers under various federal consumer financial protection laws, including the Equal Credit Opportunity Act, Truth in Lending Act, Real Estate Settlement Procedures Act, Fair Credit Reporting Act, Fair Debt Collection Practices Act, the consumer financial privacy provisions of the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act, Truth in Savings Act and certain other statutes. The CFPB has examination and primary enforcement authority with respect to depository institutions with more than 10.0 billion in assets. Smaller institutions, including the Bank, are subject to rules promulgated by the CFPB but continue to be examined and supervised by their primary federal banking agency for compliance with federal consumer protection laws and regulations. The CFPB also has authority to prevent unfair, deceptive or abusive acts or practices in connection with the offering of consumer financial products. The Dodd-Frank Act permits states to adopt consumer protection laws and standards that are more stringent than those adopted at the federal level and, in certain circumstances, permits state attorneys general to enforce compliance with both the state and federal laws and regulations. 
 The CFPB has proposed or issued a number of important rules affecting a wide range of consumer financial products. The changes resulting from the Dodd-Frank Act and CFPB rulemakings and enforcement policies may impact the profitability of our business activities, limit our ability to make, or the desirability of making, certain types of loans, require us to change our business practices, impose upon us more stringent capital, liquidity and leverage ratio requirements or otherwise adversely affect our business or profitability. The changes may also require us to dedicate significant management attention and resources to evaluate and make necessary changes to comply with the new statutory and regulatory requirements. 
 The CFPB has issued rules related to a borrower s ability to repay and qualified mortgage standards, mortgage servicing standards, loan originator compensation standards, requirements for high cost mortgages, appraisal and escrow standards and requirements for higher-priced mortgages. The CFPB has also issued rules establishing integrated disclosure requirements for lenders and settlement agents in connection with most closed end, real estate secured consumer loans; and rules which, among other things, expand the scope of information lenders must report in connection with mortgage and other housing-related loan applications under the Home Mortgage Disclosure Act.

 The CFPB s rulemaking and enforcement activities and strategic priorities have shifted as its leadership has changed, and in the future, the CFPB may take a different approach to its implementation of consumer financial protection laws than it has taken in the recent past. 
 The Volcker Rule 
 On December 10, 2013, five U.S. financial regulators, including the Federal Reserve, adopted a final rule implementing the Volcker Rule. The Volcker Rule was created by Section 619 of the Dodd-Frank Act and generally prohibits banking entities, including insured depository institutions and their affiliates, from engaging in proprietary trading and from sponsoring or investing in private equity or hedge funds, or extending credit to or engaging in other covered transactions with private equity or hedge funds that they sponsor or advise. The EGRRCPA amended Section 619 to exempt from the Volcker Rule any insured depository institution that has 10.0 billion or less in total consolidated assets and whose total trading assets and trading liabilities are 5 or less of total consolidated assets. We are among the exempt institutions. 
 Limitations on Incentive Compensation 
 In April 2016, the Federal Reserve and other federal financial agencies re-proposed restrictions on incentive-based compensation pursuant to Section 956 of the Dodd-Frank Act for financial institutions with 1 billion or more in total consolidated assets. For institutions with at least 1 billion but less than 50 billion in total consolidated assets, the proposal would impose principles-based restrictions that are broadly consistent with existing interagency guidance on incentive-based compensation. Such institutions would be prohibited from entering into incentive compensation arrangements that encourage inappropriate risks by the institution (1) by providing an executive officer, employee, director, or principal shareholder with excessive compensation, fees, or benefits, or (2) that could lead to material financial loss to the institution. The proposal would also impose certain governance and recordkeeping requirements on institutions covered by the rule. Whether or when the agencies will finalize the proposal is uncertain.

 Item 1A. Risk Factors 
 As a financial services organization, we are subject to a number of risks inherent in our transactions and present in the business decisions we make. Described below are the material risks and uncertainties that if realized could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations or cash flows, and our access to liquidity. Consideration should also be given to the other information in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, as well as in the documents incorporated by reference into this Form 10-K. However, other factors not discussed below or elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K could adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations or cash flows and our access to liquidity. Therefore, the risk factors below should not be considered a complete list of potential risks we may face. 
 Risk Factors Summary 
 Our business is subject to numerous material risks and uncertainties, including those described in Part I Item 1A. Risk Factors in this Report on Form 10-K. You should carefully consider these material risks and uncertainties when investing in our common stock. The principal risks and uncertainties affecting our business include the following: 
 Our business and operations are concentrated in the Puget Sound region and we are sensitive to adverse changes in the local economy. 
 If our allowance for loan losses is insufficient to absorb actual loan losses, our results of operations would be negatively affected. 
 We operate in a highly competitive market and face increasing competition from traditional and new financial services providers.

 We are subject to the various risks associated with our banking business and operations, including, among others, credit, market, liquidity, interest rate and compliance risks, which may have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations if we are unable to manage such risks. 
 We may be unable to effectively manage our growth, which could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. 
 The success of our relationship with broker dealers, digital financial service providers and other partners to provide BaaS is subject to risks associated with managing such relationships. 
 We operate in a highly regulated industry, and the current regulatory framework and any future legislative and regulatory changes, may have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. 
 We are subject to regulatory requirements, including stringent capital requirements, consumer protection laws, and anti-money laundering laws, and failure to comply with these requirements could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. 
 We are subject to laws regarding privacy, information security and protection of personal information and any violation of these laws or incidents involving personal, confidential or proprietary information of individuals, including, among others, system failures or cybersecurity breaches of our network security, could damage our reputation and otherwise adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operation. 
 Our charter documents contain certain provisions, including anti-takeover provision, that limit the ability of our shareholders to take certain actions and could delay or discourage takeover attempts that shareholders may consider favorable. 
 Risks Related to Credit Matters 
 We are subject to interest rate risk and fluctuations in interest rates may adversely affect our earnings. 
 The majority of our banking assets and liabilities are monetary in nature and subject to risk from changes in interest rates. Like most financial institutions, our earnings are significantly dependent on our net interest income, the principal component of our earnings, which is the difference between interest earned by us from our interest-earning assets, such as loans and investment securities, and interest paid by us on our interest-bearing liabilities, such as deposits and borrowings. We expect that we will periodically experience gaps in the interest rate sensitivities of our assets and liabilities, meaning that either our interest-bearing liabilities will be more sensitive to changes in market interest rates than our interest-earning assets, or vice versa. In either event, if market interest rates should move contrary to our position, this gap will negatively impact our earnings. The impact on earnings is more adverse when the slope of the yield curve flattens, that is, when short-term interest rates increase more than long-term interest rates or when long-term interest rates decrease more than short-term interest rates. Many factors impact interest rates, including governmental monetary policies, inflation, recession, changes in unemployment, the money supply and international economic weakness and disorder and instability in domestic and foreign financial markets. Our interest rate sensitivity profile was asset sensitive as of December 31, 2022, meaning that we estimate our net interest income would increase more from rising interest rates than from falling interest rates. 
 Interest rates have risen significantly following the historically low levels during the COVID-19 pandemic. Due to elevated levels of inflation and corresponding pressure to raise interest rates, the Federal Reserve announced in January of 2022 that it would be slowing the pace of its bond purchasing and increasing the target range for the federal funds rate over time. The FOMC since has increased the target range seven times throughout 2022. As of December 31, 2022, the target range for the federal funds rate had been increased to 4.25 to 4.50 and the FOMC signaled that future increases may be appropriate in order to attain a monetary policy sufficiently restrictive to return inflation to more normalized levels. 
 Interest rate increases often result in larger payment requirements for our borrowers, which increases the potential for default and could result in a decrease in the demand for loans. At the same time, the marketability of the property securing a loan may be adversely affected by any reduced demand resulting from higher interest rates. In a declining interest rate environment, there may be an increase in prepayments on loans as borrowers refinance their loans at lower 
 28 

Table of Contents 

 rates. In addition, in a low interest rate environment, loan customers often pursue long-term fixed rate credits, which could adversely affect our earnings and net interest margin if rates increase. Changes in interest rates also can affect the value of loans, securities and other assets. An increase in interest rates that adversely affects the ability of borrowers to pay the principal or interest on loans may lead to an increase in nonperforming assets and a reduction of income recognized, which could have an adverse effect on our results of operations and cash flows. Further, when we place a loan on nonaccrual status, we reverse any accrued but unpaid interest receivable, which decreases interest income. At the same time, we continue to have a cost to fund the loan, which is reflected as interest expense, without any interest income to offset the associated funding expense. Thus, an increase in the amount of nonperforming assets would have an adverse impact on net interest income. 
 Our commercial real estate lending activities expose us to increased lending risks and related loan losses. 
 At December 31, 2022, our commercial real estate loan portfolio totaled 1.05 billion, or 39.8 of our total loan portfolio. Our current business strategy is to continue our originations of commercial real estate loans. Commercial real estate loans generally expose a lender to greater risk of non-payment or late payment and loss than one-to-four family residential mortgage loans because repayment of the loans often depends on the successful operation of the properties and the income stream of the borrowers. These loans involve larger loan balances to single borrowers or groups of related borrowers compared to one-to-four family residential mortgage loans. To the extent that borrowers have more than one commercial real estate loan outstanding, an adverse development with respect to one loan or one credit relationship could expose us to a significantly greater risk of loss compared to an adverse development with respect to a one-to-four family residential real estate loan. Moreover, if loans that are collateralized by commercial real estate become troubled and the value of the real estate has been significantly impaired, then we may not be able to recover the full contractual amount of principal and interest that we anticipated at the time we originated the loan, which could cause us to increase our provision for loan losses and would adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. 
 We may be subject to environmental liabilities in connection with the real properties we own and the foreclosure on real estate assets securing our loan portfolio. 
 In the course of our business, we may purchase real estate in connection with our acquisition and expansion efforts, or we may foreclose on and take title to real estate or otherwise be deemed to be in control of property that serves as collateral on loans we make. As a result, we could be subject to environmental liabilities with respect to those properties. We may be held liable to a governmental entity or to third parties for property damage, personal injury, investigation and clean-up costs incurred by these parties in connection with environmental contamination, or we may be required to investigate or clean up hazardous or toxic substances or chemical releases at a property. The costs associated with investigation or remediation activities could be substantial. In addition, if we are the owner or former owner of a contaminated site, we may be subject to common law claims by third parties based on damages and costs resulting from environmental contamination emanating from the property. 
 The cost of removal or abatement may substantially exceed the value of the affected properties or the loans secured by those properties, we may not have adequate remedies against the prior owners or other responsible parties and we may not be able to resell the affected properties either before or after completion of any such removal or abatement procedures. If material environmental problems are discovered before foreclosure, we generally will not foreclose on the related collateral or will transfer ownership of the loan to a subsidiary. It should be noted, however, that the transfer of the property or loans to a subsidiary may not protect us from environmental liability. Furthermore, despite these actions on our part, the value of the property as collateral will generally be substantially reduced or we may elect not to foreclose on the property and, as a result, we may suffer a loss upon collection of the loan. Any significant environmental liabilities could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. 
 Our commercial business lending activities expose us to additional lending risks. 
 As of December 31, 2022, commercial and industrial loans totaled 312.6 million and represented 11.8 of total loans. Included in commercial and industrial loans are 4.7 million in PPP loans, which are 100 guaranteed by the by the U.S. Government. We make commercial business loans in our market area to a variety of professionals, sole proprietorships, partnerships and corporations. As compared to commercial real estate loans, which are secured by real property, the value of which tends to be more easily ascertainable, commercial business loans are of higher risk and typically are made on the basis of the borrower s ability to make repayment from the cash flow of the borrower s business. As a result, the availability of funds for the repayment of commercial business loans may depend substantially on the success of the business itself and the conditions in the general economy. Further, any losses incurred on a small number of 
 29 

Table of Contents 

 commercial loans could have an adverse impact on our financial condition and results of operations due to the larger average size of commercial loans as compared with other loans and the risk that collateral securing such loans may depreciate over time, may be difficult to appraise, may fluctuate in value and may depend on the borrower s ability to collect receivables. We have increased our focus on commercial business lending in recent years and intend to continue to focus on this type of lending in the future. 
 Our concentration of residential mortgage loans exposes us to increased lending risks . 
 At December 31, 2022, 449.2 million, or 17.1 , of our loan portfolio was secured by one-to-four family real estate. One-to-four family residential mortgage lending is generally sensitive to regional and local economic conditions that significantly impact the ability of borrowers to meet their loan payment obligations, making loss levels difficult to predict. Declines in real estate values could cause some of our residential mortgages to be inadequately collateralized, which would expose us to a greater risk of loss if we seek to recover on defaulted loans by selling the real estate collateral. 
 As of December 31, 2022, 204.6 million of our residential mortgage loans were made through the community bank, and 82.7 are secured by property in Washington State, and a significant majority of that is located in the Puget Sound region. A decline in residential real estate values as a result of a downturn in the Puget Sound housing market could reduce the value of the real estate collateral securing these types of loans. As of December 31, 2022, 140.7 million of our residential mortgage loans made through the community bank were made to investors. These loans may behave more like multi-family loans than individual 1-4 family loans that are occupied by their owners. 
 As of December 31, 2022, 244.6 million of our residential mortgage loans were made through CCBX partners and are located in different regions across the U.S. A decline in residential real estate values across the U.S. would reduce the value of this residential real estate collateral. These home equity lines of credit are secured by residential real estate and are accessed by using a credit card. 
 Our origination of construction loans exposes us to increased lending risks. 
 At December 31, 2022, 214.1 million, or 8.1 of our total loans was construction, land and land development loans. We originate commercial construction loans primarily to professional builders for the construction of one-to-four family residences, apartment buildings, and commercial real estate properties. To a lesser degree, we also originate land acquisition loans for the purpose of facilitating the ultimate construction of a home or commercial building. Our construction loans present a greater level of risk than loans secured by improved, occupied real estate due to: (1) the increased difficulty at the time the loan is made of estimating the building costs and the selling price of the property to be built; (2) the increased difficulty and costs of monitoring the loan; (3) the higher degree of sensitivity to increases in market rates of interest; and (4) the increased difficulty of working out loan problems. In addition, construction costs may exceed original estimates as a result of increased materials, labor or other costs. Construction loans also often involve the disbursement of funds with repayment dependent, in part, on the success of the project and the ability of the borrower to sell or lease the property or refinance the indebtedness. 
 Our focus on lending to the small to medium-sized businesses may adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. 
 We focus our business development and marketing strategy primarily on small to medium-sized businesses. Small to medium-sized businesses frequently have smaller market shares than larger firms, may be more vulnerable to economic downturns, often need substantial additional capital to expand or compete and may experience substantial volatility in operating results, any of which may impair a borrower s ability to repay a loan. In addition, the success of a small and medium-sized business often depends on the management skills, talents and efforts of a small group of people, and the death, disability or resignation of one or more of these people could have an adverse effect on the business and its ability to repay its loan. If our borrowers are unable to repay their loans, our business, financial condition and earnings could be adversely affected. 
 We may not be able to adequately measure and limit our credit risk, which could lead to unexpected losses. 
 The business of lending is inherently risky, including risks that the principal or interest on any loan will not be repaid timely or at all or that the value of any collateral supporting the loan will be insufficient to cover our outstanding exposure. These risks may be affected by the strength of the borrower s business sector and local, regional and national market and economic conditions. Many of our loans are made to small to medium-sized businesses that may be less able to 
 30 

Table of Contents 

 withstand competitive, economic and financial pressures than larger borrowers. Our risk management practices, such as monitoring the concentration of our loans within specific industries and our credit approval practices, may not adequately reduce credit risk, and our credit administration personnel, policies and procedures may not adequately adapt to changes in economic or any other conditions affecting customers and the quality of the loan portfolio. A failure to effectively measure and limit the credit risk associated with our loan portfolio could lead to unexpected losses and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. 
 We originate and purchase loans through our CCBX partners which exposes us to increased lending and compliance risks. 
 At December 31, 2022, 1.01 billion, or 38.5 of our total loans were originated or purchased through CCBX partners. Our partners underwrite these loans in compliance with our credit standards and policies. Our CCBX partners service 866.5 million of these loans. Our partners provide fraud and credit enhancements on many of our CCBX loans, but if they are unable to fulfill their contracted obligations then the Bank would be exposed to writing off all or a part of the credit enhancement asset and to additional loan losses as a result of this counterparty risk. We are subject to compliance and regulatory risk if partners do not follow our servicing policies, lending laws and regulations. 
 Our allowance for loan losses may prove to be insufficient to absorb losses in our loan portfolio. 
 Lending money is a substantial part of our business. Every loan carries a certain risk that it will not be repaid in accordance with its terms or that any underlying collateral will not be sufficient to assure repayment. This risk is affected by, among other things: 
 the cash flow of the borrower, guarantors and/or the project being financed; 
 the changes and uncertainties as to the future value of the collateral, in the case of a collateralized loan; 
 the character and creditworthiness of a particular borrower or guarantor; 
 changes in economic and industry conditions; and 
 the duration of the loan. 
 We maintain an allowance for loan losses, which is a reserve established through a provision for loan losses charged against earnings, which we believe is appropriate to absorb probable incurred losses in our loan portfolio. The amount of this allowance is determined by our management through a periodic comprehensive review and consideration of several factors, including, but not limited to: 
 our general reserve, based on our historical default and loss experience; 
 our specific reserve, based on our evaluation of impaired loans and their underlying collateral or discounted cash flows; and 
 current macroeconomic factors and regulatory requirements. 
 The determination of the appropriate level of the allowance for loan losses inherently involves a high degree of subjectivity and requires us to make significant estimates of current credit risks and future trends, all of which may undergo material changes. If our estimates are incorrect, the allowance for loan losses may not be sufficient to cover losses inherent in our loan portfolio, resulting in the need for increases in our allowance for loan losses through the provision for losses on loans which is charged against income. Management also recognizes that significant new growth in loan portfolios, through the community bank and/or CCBX, new loan products and the refinancing of existing loans can result in portfolios comprised of unseasoned loans that may not perform in a historical or projected manner and will increase the risk that our allowance may be insufficient to absorb losses without significant additional provisions. 
 Many of the agreements with our CCBX partners provide for a credit enhancement which helps protect the Bank by absorbing incurred losses. CCBX credit enhancements are free-standing and are accounted separately from the allowance for loan loss. In accordance with accounting guidance, we estimate and record a provision for probable losses for these CCBX loans, without regard to the credit enhancement. If a CCBX lending partner is unable to fulfill their 
 31 

Table of Contents 

 contractual obligations with the Bank, then the Bank would be exposed to additional loan losses as a result of this counterparty risk and would have to absorb any loan losses associated with the CCBX partner that cannot fulfill its contractual obligations. 
 Deterioration in economic conditions affecting borrowers, new information regarding existing loans, identification of additional problem loans and other factors, both within and outside of our control, may require an increase in the allowance for loan losses. If current conditions in the housing and real estate markets weaken, we expect we will experience increased delinquencies and credit losses. In addition, bank regulatory agencies periodically review our allowance for loan losses and may require an increase in the provision for loan losses or the recognition of further loan charge-offs, based on their judgments about information available to them at the time of their examination. In addition, if charge-offs in future periods exceed the allowance for loan losses, we will need additional provisions to increase the allowance for loan losses.While we believe that our allowance for loan losses was adequate at December 31, 2022, there is no assurance that it will be sufficient to cover future loan losses, especially if there is a significant deterioration in economic conditions. 
 The FASB adopted a new accounting standard referred to as CECL which requires financial institutions to determine periodic estimates of lifetime expected credit losses on loans and recognize the expected credit losses as allowances for credit losses. This will change the current method of providing allowances for credit losses that are probable, which may require us to increase our allowance for loan losses, and may greatly increase the types of data we would need to collect and review to determine the appropriate level of the allowance for credit losses. This accounting pronouncement was adopted by us effective for our fiscal year beginning January 1, 2023. The federal banking regulators, including the Federal Reserve and the FDIC, have adopted a rule that gives a banking organization the option to phase in over a three year period the day one adverse effects of CECL on its regulatory capital. Any increases in the allowance for loan losses due to the one-time cumulative-effect adjustment will result in a decrease in capital and may have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations. 
 The current economic condition in the market areas we serve may adversely impact our earnings and could increase the credit risk associated with our loan portfolio. 
 While there is not a single employer or industry in our market area on which a significant number of our customers are dependent, a substantial portion of our loan portfolio is comprised of loans secured by property located in the Puget Sound region and substantially all of our loan and deposit customers are businesses and individuals in greater Puget Sound region. A deterioration of the economy in the market areas we serve could result in the following consequences, any of which would have an adverse impact, which could be material, on our business, financial condition, and results of operations: 
 loan delinquencies may increase; 
 problem assets and foreclosures may increase; 
 collateral for loans made may decline in value, in turn reducing customers borrowing power, reducing the value of assets and collateral associated with existing loans; 
 certain securities within our investment portfolio could become other than temporarily impaired, requiring a write-down through earnings to fair value, thereby reducing equity; 
 CCBX partners may experience financial difficulties or fail, our BaaS revenue may decrease, and loan losses could increase if the partner cannot fulfill its credit enhancement obligations; 
 low cost or noninterest bearing deposits may decrease; and 
 demand for our loan and other products and services may decrease. 
 A decline in local economic conditions may have a greater effect on our earnings and capital than on the earnings and capital of larger financial institutions whose real estate loans are geographically diverse. Many of the loans in our portfolio are secured by real estate. Deterioration in the real estate markets where collateral for a mortgage loan is located could negatively affect the borrower s ability to repay the loan and the value of the collateral securing the loan. Real estate values are affected by various other factors, including changes in general or regional economic conditions, governmental rules or policies and natural disasters such as earthquakes and flooding. Further, deterioration in local economic conditions could drive the level of loan losses beyond the level we have provided for in our allowance for loan losses, which in turn could necessitate an increase in our provision for loan losses and a resulting reduction to our earnings and capital. 
 In addition, weakening in regional and general economic conditions such as inflation, recession, business closings, restrictions on business activity, unemployment, natural disasters, epidemic illness, or other factors beyond our control 
 32 

Table of Contents 

 could reduce our growth rate and negatively affect demand for loans, the ability of our borrowers to repay their loans and our financial condition and results of operations. 
 Our SBA lending program is dependent upon the U.S. federal government, and we face specific risks associated with originating SBA loans. 
 As of December 31, 2022, the balance of owned SBA loans and SBA loans net of the sold portion was 12.3 million, which includes 4.7 million in PPP loans that are 100 guaranteed, and an additional 3.1 million in non-PPP SBA loans which are also guaranteed. As of December 31, 2022, the balance of SBA loans sold and serviced was 14.3 million, resulting in 69,000 in servicing income for the year ended December 31, 2022. Our SBA lending program is dependent upon the U.S. federal government. As an approved participant in the SBA Preferred Lender s Program, referred to herein as an SBA Preferred Lender, we enable our clients to obtain SBA loans without being subject to the potentially lengthy SBA approval process necessary for lenders that are not SBA Preferred Lenders. The SBA periodically reviews the lending operations of participating lenders to assess, among other things, whether the lender exhibits prudent risk management. When weaknesses are identified, the SBA may request corrective actions or impose enforcement actions, including revocation of the lender s SBA Preferred Lender status. If we lose our status as an SBA Preferred Lender, we may lose some or all of our customers to lenders who are SBA Preferred Lenders, and as a result we could experience an adverse effect to our financial results. Any changes to the SBA program, including but not limited to changes to the level of guarantee provided by the federal government on SBA loans, changes to program specific rules impacting volume eligibility under the guaranty program, as well as changes to the program amounts authorized by Congress or exhaustion of the available funding for SBA programs may also have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operation. In addition, any default by the U.S. Government on its obligations or any prolonged government shutdown could, among other things, impede our ability to originate SBA loans or sell such loans in the secondary market, which could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. 
 Included in this category are PPP loans, which have a contractual rate of 1.0 , with maturity terms of two to five years, are unsecured, 100 guaranteed and the loan proceeds of which may be forgiven by the U.S. Government / SBA if used for certain purposes. 
 Outside of the PPP, the SBA s 7(a) Loan Program is the SBA s primary program for helping start-up and existing small businesses, with financing guaranteed for a variety of general business purposes. Generally, we sell the guaranteed portion of our non-PPP SBA 7(a) loans in the secondary market. These sales result in premium income for us at the time of sale and create a stream of future servicing income, as we retain the servicing rights to these loans. For the reasons described above, we may not be able to continue originating these loans or sell them in the secondary market. Furthermore, even if we are able to continue to originate and sell SBA 7(a) loans in the secondary market, we might not continue to realize premiums upon the sale of the guaranteed portion of these loans or the premiums may decline due to economic and competitive factors. When we originate SBA loans, we incur credit risk on the non-guaranteed portion of the loans, and if a customer defaults on a loan, we share any loss and recovery related to the loan pro-rata with the SBA. If the SBA establishes that a loss on an SBA guaranteed loan is attributable to significant technical deficiencies in the manner in which the loan was originated, funded or serviced by us, the SBA may seek recovery of the principal loss related to the deficiency from us. Generally, we do not maintain reserves or loss allowances for such potential claims and any such claims could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. 
 The laws, regulations and standard operating procedures that are applicable to SBA loan products may change in the future. We cannot predict the effects of these changes on our business, financial condition and results of operation. Because government regulation greatly affects the business and financial results of all commercial banks and bank holding companies and especially our organization, changes in the laws, regulations and procedures applicable to SBA loans could adversely affect our ability to operate profitably. 
 Economic conditions could increase our level of nonperforming loans and/or reduce demand for our products and services, which could have an adverse effect on our results of operations. 
 Prolonged deteriorating economic conditions could significantly affect the markets in which we do business, the value of our loans and investment securities, and our ongoing operations, costs and profitability. Further, declines in real estate values and sales volumes and elevated unemployment levels may result in higher loan delinquencies, increases in our nonperforming and classified assets and a decline in demand for our products and services. These events may cause us to incur losses and may adversely affect our financial condition and earnings. Reduction in problem assets can be slow, and the process can be exacerbated by the condition of the properties securing nonperforming loans and the lengthy foreclosure

 process in Washington. To the extent that we must work through the resolution of assets, economic problems may cause us to incur losses and adversely affect our capital, business, financial condition, results of operations or cash flows and our access to liquidity. 
 Nonperforming assets take significant time and resources to resolve and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. 
 Nonperforming assets adversely affect our net income in various ways. We generally do not record interest income on other real estate owned OREO ), or on nonperforming loans, thereby adversely affecting our income and increasing loan administration costs. When we take collateral in foreclosures and similar proceedings, we are required to mark the related asset to the then fair market value of the collateral, which may ultimately result in a loss. An increase in our level of nonperforming assets increases our risk profile and may impact the capital levels regulators believe are appropriate in light of the ensuing risk profile. While we seek to reduce problem assets through loan workouts, restructurings and otherwise, decreases in the value of the underlying collateral, or in these borrowers performance or financial condition, whether or not due to economic and market conditions beyond our control, could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. In addition, the resolution of nonperforming assets requires significant commitments of time from management, which may adversely impact their ability to perform their other responsibilities. We may not experience future increases in the value of nonperforming assets. 
 Risks Related to Compliance and Operational Matters 
 Imposition of limits by the bank regulators on commercial real estate lending activities could curtail our growth and adversely affect our earnings. 
 In 2006, the federal banking regulators issued joint guidance entitled Concentrations in Commercial Real Estate Lending, Sound Risk Management Practices CRE Guidance ). Although the CRE Guidance did not establish specific lending limits, it provides that a bank s commercial real estate lending exposure could receive increased supervisory scrutiny where total non-owner-occupied commercial real estate loans, including loans secured by apartment buildings, investor commercial real estate, and construction and land loans, represent 300 or more of an institution s total risk-based capital, and the outstanding balance of the commercial real estate loan portfolio has increased by 50 or more during the preceding 36 months. Our total non-owner-occupied commercial real estate loans, including loans secured by apartment buildings, investor commercial real estate, and construction and land loans, totaled 920.1 million and represented 269.2 and 305.1 of its capital, at December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. The outstanding balance of the Bank s regulatory CRE portfolio has increased by 30.9 and 7.8 , for the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. The level of CRE has exceeded regulatory guidelines in the previous 36 months but the growth rate is within regulatory guidelines. 
 In December 2015, the federal banking regulators released a new statement on prudent risk management for commercial real estate lending, referred to herein as the 2015 Statement. In the 2015 Statement, the federal banking regulators, among other things, indicate their intent to continue to pay special attention to commercial real estate lending activities and concentrations going forward. If the Federal Reserve, our primary federal regulator, were to impose restrictions on the amount of commercial real estate loans we can hold in our portfolio, for reasons noted above or otherwise, our earnings would be adversely affected. 
 Our business is subject to the risks of epidemic illnesses, earthquakes, tsunamis, floods, fires and other natural catastrophic events or effects of climate change. 
 A major catastrophe, such as an epidemic illness, earthquake, tsunami, flood, fire or other natural disaster or effects of climate change could result in a prolonged interruption of our business. For example, our headquarters are located in Everett, Washington and we serve the broader Puget Sound region, a geographical region that has been and may continue to be affected by earthquake, tsunami, wildfires and flooding activity. These activities may increase as the effects of climate change increase. Because we primarily serve individuals and businesses in the Northwest, a natural disaster, epidemic illness, significant effect of climate change or other major catastrophe in the Northwest likely would have a greater impact on our business, financial condition and results of operation than if our business were more geographically diverse. The occurrence of any of these natural disasters. epidemic illnesses, effects of climate change or other major catastrophes could negatively impact our performance by disrupting our operations or the operations of our customers, which could adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations.

 Appraisals and other valuation techniques we use in evaluating and monitoring loans secured by real property, OREO and repossessed personal property may not accurately reflect the net value of the asset. 
 In considering whether to make a loan secured by real property, we generally require an appraisal of the property. However, an appraisal is only an estimate of the value of the property at the time the appraisal is made, and, as real estate values may change significantly in relatively short periods of time (especially in periods of heightened economic uncertainty), this estimate may not accurately describe the net value of the real property collateral after the loan is made. As a result, we may not be able to realize the full amount of any remaining indebtedness when we foreclose on and sell the relevant property. In addition, we rely on appraisals and other valuation techniques to establish the value of our OREO, and personal property that we acquire through foreclosure proceedings and to determine certain loan impairments. If any of these valuations are inaccurate, our financial statements may not reflect the correct value of our OREO, and our allowance for loan losses may not reflect accurate loan impairments. This could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. As of December 31, 2022, we did not hold any OREO or repossessed property and equipment. 
 We derive a percentage of our deposits, total assets and income from deposit accounts generated through our BaaS relationships. 
 Deposit accounts acquired through these relationships totaled 1.28 billion, or 45.4 of total deposits at December 31, 2022. We provide oversight over these relationships, which must meet all internal and regulatory requirements. We may exit relationships where such requirements are not met or be required by our regulators to exit such relationships. Also, our CCBX partner(s) could terminate a relationship with us for many reasons, including being able to obtain better terms from another provider or dissatisfaction with the level or quality of our services. If a relationship were to be terminated, it could materially reduce our deposits, assets and income. We cannot assure you that we could replace such relationship. If we cannot replace such relationship, we may be required to seek higher rate funding sources as compared to the existing relationship and interest expense might increase. We may also be required to sell securities or other assets to meet funding needs which would reduce revenues or potentially generate losses. 
 Our strategy of partnering with broker dealers and digital financial service providers to offer BaaS has been adopted by other institutions with which we compete. 
 Several online banking operations as well as the online banking programs of conventional banks have instituted BaaS strategies similar to ours. As a consequence, we have encountered competition in this area and anticipate that we will continue to do so in the future. This competition may increase our costs, reduce our revenues or revenue growth or, because we are a relatively small banking operation without the name recognition of other, more established banking operations, make it difficult for us to compete effectively in obtaining these relationships. 
 Our agreements with BaaS partners may produce limited revenue and may expose us to liability for compliance violations by BaaS partners. 
 We have entered into agreements with BaaS partners, which includes broker dealers and digital financial service providers, pursuant to which we will provide certain banking services for the BaaS partner customers, including serving as the issuing bank for debit cards issued to their customers and establishing one or more settlement accounts for the purpose of settling customer transactions in the cash management account program. The agreements have varying terms and may be terminated by the parties under certain circumstances. If our BaaS partners are not successful in achieving customer acceptance of their programs or terminate the agreement before the end of its term, our revenue under the agreement may be limited or may cease altogether. In addition, because we will provide banking services with respect to the cash features of our BaaS partner account programs, our bank regulators may hold us responsible for their activities with respect to the marketing or administration of their programs, which may result in increased compliance costs for us or potentially compliance violations as a result of BaaS partner activities. 
 Uncertainty relating to the LIBOR calculation process and phasing out of LIBOR may adversely affect our results of operations. 
 On July 27, 2017, the Chief Executive of the United Kingdom Financial Conduct Authority, which regulates LIBOR, announced that it intends to stop persuading or compelling banks to submit rates for the calibration of LIBOR to the administrator of LIBOR after 2021. In November 2020, the ICE Benchmark Administration, which administers LIBOR, announced its intention to extend the publication of most tenors of LIBOR through June 30, 2023. The U.S. federal banking agencies encouraged banking organizations to cease entering into new contracts that use US Dollar LIBOR

 as a reference rate by no later than December 31, 2021, and to ensure existing contracts have robust fallback language that includes a clearly defined alternative reference rate. 
 Several domestic and international groups, including the Alternative Reference Rate Committee and the International Swaps and Derivatives Association, have developed LIBOR replacements, and a consensus appears to have emerged that the SOFR as observed by the Federal Reserve Bank of New York should be the successor rate. In March 2022, President Biden signed into law the Adjustable Interest Rate (LIBOR) Act (the LIBOR Act ). The LIBOR Act provides default rules for tough legacy contracts that do not have clearly defined and practicable fallback provisions for replacing LIBOR. The LIBOR Act also establishes a litigation safe harbor for lenders that select a LIBOR replacement under certain situations, including the use of a replacement rate selected by the Federal Reserve. On December 16, 2022, the Federal Reserve adopted a final rule that implements the LIBOR Act by identifying benchmark rates based on SOFR that will replace LIBOR in certain financial contracts after June 30, 2023. 
 Nevertheless, uncertainty surrounding the transition away from LIBOR may adversely affect LIBOR rates and the value of LIBOR-based loans, and debt instruments. If and when LIBOR rates are no longer available, and we are required to implement substitute indices for the calculation of interest rates under our loan agreements with our borrowers or our existing borrowings, we may incur additional expenses in effecting the transition, and may be subject to disputes or litigation with customers and creditors over the appropriateness or comparability to LIBOR of the substitute indices, which could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. As of December 31, 2022, we had 51 loans totaling 206.6 million that are tied to LIBOR. We have 3.6 million in floating rate junior subordinated debentures to Coastal (WA) Statutory Trust I, which was formed for the issuance of trust preferred securities. These debentures are also tied to LIBOR. The move to an alternate index may impact the rates we receive on loans and rates we pay on our junior subordinated debentures. We have identified the loans and debt instruments impacted, and we believe we will be able to use the benchmark replacements and transition protections provided by the LIBOR Act, Federal Reserve rule, and relevant FASB guidance to manage through the transition away from LIBOR. See Note 2 - Recent accounting standards in the Consolidated Financial Statements, for discussion on ASU 2020-04, Reference Rate Reform (Topic 848): Facilitation of the Effects of Reference Rate Reform on Financial Reporting . We no longer issue any loans or debt tied to LIBOR. 
 We may be adversely affected by changes in U.S. tax laws and regulations. 
 From time to time, the U.S. Government may introduce new tax laws and regulations, or interpretations of existing income tax laws could change, causing an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. For example, changes in tax laws contained in the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 (the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act ), which was enacted in December 2017, include a number of provisions that will have an impact on the banking industry, borrowers and the market for residential real estate. Included in this legislation was a reduction of the corporate income tax rate from 35 to 21 . In addition, other changes included: (i) a lower limit on the deductibility of mortgage interest on single-family residential mortgage loans, (ii) the elimination of interest deductions for home equity loans, (iii) a limitation on the deductibility of business interest expense and (iv) a limitation on the deductibility of property taxes and state and local income taxes. 
 We are subject to additional state and local taxes as a result of CCBX operations. 
 We are subject to additional state and local taxes and related reporting requirements related to our CCBX operations. The added recordkeeping burden as well as additional expense that could result from the expansion of CCBX into new regions may have an adverse impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations. 
 We expect that the implementation of a new accounting standard could require us to increase our allowance for loan losses and may have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. 
 The FASB, has adopted a new accounting standard, CECL, which requires financial institutions to determine periodic estimates of lifetime expected credit losses on loans, and provide for the expected credit losses as allowances for loan losses. We adopted CECL effective January 1, 2023. CECL will change the current method of providing allowances for loan losses that are probable, which we expect could require us to increase our allowance for loan losses, and will likely greatly increase the data we would need to collect and review to determine the appropriate level of the allowance for loan losses. Any increase in our allowance for loan losses, or expenses incurred to determine the appropriate level of the allowance for loan losses, may have an adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations. In addition, new accounting standards are issued or existing standards are revised periodically, changing the methods for preparing our

 financial statements. These changes are not within our control and may significantly impact our business, financial condition and results of operations. 
 Because the nature of the financial services business involves a high volume of transactions, we face significant operational risks, including, but not limited to, customer, employee or third-party fraud and data processing system failures and errors. 
 We rely on the ability of our employees and systems to process a high number of transactions. Operational risk is the risk of loss resulting from our operations, including but not limited to, the risk of fraud or other misconduct by employees or outside persons, the improper use of confidential information, the execution of unauthorized transactions by employees, errors relating to transaction processing and technology, breaches of our internal control system and compliance requirements, high volume of transactions processed for our strategic partners, and business continuation and disaster recovery. Insurance coverage may not be available for such losses, or where available, such losses may exceed insurance limits. This risk of loss also includes the potential legal actions, including claims for negligence, that could arise as a result of an operational deficiency or as a result of noncompliance with applicable regulations, adverse business decisions or their implementation, and customer attrition due to potential negative publicity. We maintain a system of internal controls to mitigate operational risks, including data processing system failures and errors and customer or employee fraud, as well as insurance coverage designed to protect us from material losses associated with these risks, including losses resulting from any associated business interruption. It is not always possible to prevent employee or third-party errors or misconduct. Although our control testing has not identified any significant deficiencies in our internal control system, a breakdown in our internal control system, improper operation of our systems or improper employee actions could result in material financial loss to us, the imposition of regulatory action, and damage to our reputation. 
 We are dependent on the use of data and modeling in our management s decision-making, and faulty data or modeling approaches could negatively impact our decision-making ability or possibly subject us to regulatory scrutiny in the future. 
 The use of statistical and quantitative models and other quantitative analyses is widespread in bank decision-making, and the employment of such analyses is becoming increasingly widespread in our operations. Liquidity stress testing, interest rate sensitivity analysis, and the identification of possible violations of anti-money laundering regulations are all examples of areas in which we are dependent on models and the data that underlies them. The use of statistical and quantitative models is also becoming more prevalent in regulatory compliance. While we are not subject to stress testing under the Dodd-Frank Act, we anticipate that model-derived testing may become more extensively implemented by regulators in the future. 
 We anticipate data-based modeling will penetrate further into bank decision-making, particularly risk management efforts, as the capacities developed to meet rigorous stress testing requirements are able to be employed more widely and in differing applications. While we believe these quantitative techniques and approaches improve our decision-making, they also create the possibility that faulty data or flawed quantitative approaches could negatively impact our decision-making ability or, if we become subject to regulatory stress testing in the future, adverse regulatory scrutiny. Further, because of the complexity inherent in these approaches, misunderstanding or misuse of their outputs could similarly result in suboptimal decision-making. 
 We depend on the accuracy and completeness of information provided to us by our borrowers and counterparties and any misrepresented information could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. 
 In deciding whether to approve loans or to enter into other transactions with borrowers and counterparties, we rely on information furnished to us by, or on behalf of, borrowers and counterparties, including financial statements, credit reports and other financial information. We also rely on representations of borrowers and counterparties as to the accuracy and completeness of that information and, with respect to financial statements, on reports of independent auditors. If any of this information is intentionally or negligently misrepresented and such misrepresentation is not detected prior to loan funding, the value of the loan may be significantly lower than expected and we may be subject to regulatory action. Whether a misrepresentation is made by the loan applicant, another third party, or one of our employees, we generally bear the risk of loss associated with the misrepresentation. Our controls and processes may not have detected, or may not detect all, misrepresented information in our loan originations or from our business clients. Any such misrepresented information could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.

 We could recognize losses on investment securities held in our securities portfolio, particularly if interest rates increase or economic and market conditions deteriorate . 
 While we attempt to invest a significant majority of our total assets in loans (our loan-to-asset ratio was 83.6 as of December 31, 2022), we invest a percentage of our total assets (3.2 as of December 31, 2022) in investment securities with the primary objectives of providing a source of liquidity and meeting pledging requirements. As of December 31, 2022, the fair value of our available for sale investment securities portfolio was 97.3 million, which included a net unrealized loss of 3.0 million, and the fair value of our held to maturity investment securities was 916,000, which included a net unrealized loss of 120,000. Factors beyond our control can significantly and adversely influence the fair value of securities in our portfolio. For example, fixed-rate securities are generally subject to decreases in market value when interest rates rise. Additional factors include, but are not limited to, rating agency downgrades of the securities, defaults by the issuer or individual borrowers with respect to the underlying securities, and instability in the credit markets. Any of the foregoing factors could cause other-than-temporary impairment in future periods and result in realized losses. The process for determining whether impairment is other-than-temporary usually requires difficult, subjective judgments about the future financial performance of the issuer and any collateral underlying the security in order to assess the probability of receiving all contractual principal and interest payments on the security. Although we have not recognized other-than-temporary impairment related to our investment portfolio as of December 31, 2022, changing economic and market conditions affecting interest rates, the financial condition of issuers of the securities and the performance of the underlying collateral, among other factors, may cause us to recognize losses in future periods, which could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. 
 The accuracy of our financial statements and related disclosures could be affected if the judgments, assumptions or estimates used in our critical accounting policies are inaccurate. 
 The preparation of financial statements and related disclosures in conformity with U.S. Generally Accepted Accounting Principles GAAP requires us to make judgments, assumptions and estimates that affect the amounts reported in our consolidated financial statements and related notes to those financial statements. Our critical accounting policies, which are included in the section entitled Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations in this Report on Form 10-K, describe those significant accounting policies and methods used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements that we consider critical because they require judgments, assumptions and estimates that materially affect our consolidated financial statements and related disclosures. As a result, if future events or regulatory views concerning such analysis differ significantly from the judgments, assumptions and estimates in our critical accounting policies, those events or assumptions could have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements and related disclosures, in each case resulting in our needing to revise or restate prior period financial statements, cause damage to our reputation and the price of our common stock, and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. 
 Dependency on external security systems expose us to greater operational risk. 
 External security systems with which we are connected, whether directly or indirectly, through the community bank or CCBX, can be sources of risk to us. We may be exposed not only to a systems failure with which we are directly connected, but also to a systems breakdown of a party to CCBX or other relationship to which we are connected. This is particularly the case where activities of customers or those parties are beyond our security and control systems, including through the use of the internet, cloud computing services and personal smart phones and other mobile devices or services. 
 If that party experiences a breach of its own systems or misappropriates that data, this could result in a variety of negative outcomes for us and our customers, including: 
 losses from fraudulent transactions, as well as potential liability for losses that exceed thresholds established in consumer protection laws and regulations, 
 increased operational costs to remediate the consequences of the external party s security breach, 
 negative impact on future revenues; and 
 harm to reputation arising from the perception that our systems may not be secure. 
 We are highly dependent on the accuracy and effectiveness of its operational processes and systems and the operational processes and systems of external parties related to the community bank and CCBX. 
 We rely comprehensively on financial, accounting, transaction execution, data processing and other operational systems to process, record, monitor and report a large number of transactions on a continuous basis, and to do so 
 38 

Table of Contents 

 accurately, quickly and securely. In addition to the proper design, installation, maintenance and training of our own operational systems, we rely on the effective functioning of operational systems of external parties related to the community bank and CCBX. Breakdowns in these operational systems could result in: 
 the inability to accurately and timely settle transactions, 
 the possibility that funds transfers or other transactions are executed erroneously, or with unintended consequences, 
 financial losses incurred, or possible restitution to customers, resulting from contractual agreements with external parties related to the community bank and CCBX, 
 regulatory issues, 
 higher operational costs, associated with replacing or recovering systems that are inoperable or unavailable, 
 loss of confidence in our ability to protect against and withstand operational disruptions, thus impacting our ability to market and establish new relationships in the CCBX segment, and 
 harm to our reputation. 
 As the speed, frequency, volume, interconnectivity and complexity of transactions within our CCBX segment continues to increase, it becomes more challenging to effectively maintain systems and mitigate risks such as: 
 errors made by us or external parties doing business with the community bank and CCBX, whether inadvertent or malicious; and 
 isolated or seemingly insignificant errors or losses, which migrate to other systems or grow in number, to become larger issues or losses. 
 We may be subject to potential business risk from actions by our regulators related to CCBX relationships. 
 Our regulators could impose restrictions on the businesses served in our CCBX segment or restrict the number of different relationships the Company can hold. Regulatory restrictions placed on the parties served in the Company s CCBX segment could result in reduced demand for services, reduced future revenue in the CCBX segment, or loss of current relationships. Regulatory restrictions that limit the number of relationships the Company can hold in its CCBX segment would result in reduced future revenue and limit the potential for growth in that segment. 
 Risks Related to Strategic and Reputational Matters 
 Our business strategy includes growth, and our business, financial condition and results of operations could be negatively affected if we fail to grow or fail to manage our growth effectively. Growing our operations could also cause our expenses to increase faster than our revenues. 
 Our business strategy includes growth in assets, deposits and the scale of our operations. Achieving such growth will require us to attract customers that currently bank at other financial institutions in our market area. Our ability to successfully grow will depend on a variety of factors, including our ability to attract and retain experienced bankers, the continued availability of desirable business opportunities, competition from other financial institutions in our market area and our ability to manage our growth. Growth opportunities may not be available or we may not be able to manage our growth successfully. If we do not manage our growth effectively, our financial condition and operating results could be negatively affected. Furthermore, there can be considerable costs involved in expanding deposit and lending capacity that generally require a period of time to generate the necessary revenues to offset these costs, especially in areas in which we do not have an established presence and that require alternative delivery methods. Accordingly, any such business expansion can be expected to negatively impact our earnings for some period of time until certain economies of scale are reached. Our expenses could be further increased if we encounter delays in modernizing existing facilities, opening new branches or deploying new services. 
 Our expansion strategy focuses on organic growth of our community bank and the expansion of our CCBX segment. We may not be able to execute on aspects of our expansion strategy, which may impair our ability to sustain our historical rate of growth or prevent us from growing at all. More specifically, we may not be able to generate sufficient new loans and deposits within acceptable risk and expense tolerances, obtain the personnel or funding necessary for additional growth or find suitable new strategic partners. The success of our strategy also depends on our ability to effectively manage growth, which is dependent upon a number of factors, including our ability to adapt our credit, operational, technology and governance infrastructure to accommodate expanded operations. If we fail to implement one or more aspects of our strategy, we may be unable to maintain our historical earnings trends, which could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.

 Strong competition within our market area could hurt our profits and slow growth. 
 Our profitability depends upon our continued ability to compete successfully in our market area. We face intense competition both in making loans and attracting deposits. Our competitors for commercial real estate loans include other community banks and commercial lenders, some of which are larger than us and have greater resources and lending limits than we have and offer services that we do not provide. We face stiff competition for one-to-four family residential loans from other financial service providers, including large national residential lenders and local community banks. Other competitors for one-to-four family residential loans include credit unions and mortgage brokers which keep overhead costs and mortgage rates down by selling loans and not holding or servicing them. Price competition for loans and deposits might result in us earning less on our loans and paying more on our deposits, which reduces net interest income. We expect competition to remain strong in the future. 
 The Washington DFI has entered into a multi-state agreement with six other states that is intended to streamline the licensing process for money service businesses, which include money transmitters and payment service providers. Increasing the relative ease of obtaining a license to operate a money service business within the state of Washington may encourage financial technology, or fintech, companies to offer services in the state, thereby increasing competition for such services. 
 We rely heavily on our executive management team and other key employees, and we could be adversely affected by the unexpected loss of their services. 
 Our success depends in large part on the performance of our executive management team and other key personnel, as well as on our ability to attract, motivate and retain highly qualified senior and middle management and other skilled employees. Competition for qualified employees is intense, and the process of locating key personnel with the combination of skills, attributes and business relationships required to execute our business plan may be lengthy. We may not be successful in retaining our key employees, and the unexpected loss of services of one or more of our key personnel could have an adverse effect on our business because of their skills, knowledge of and business relationships within our primary markets, years of industry experience and the difficulty of promptly finding qualified replacement personnel. If the services of any of our key personnel should become unavailable for any reason, we may not be able to identify and hire qualified persons on terms acceptable to us, or at all, which could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. 
 Anti-takeover provisions in our corporate organizational documents and provisions of federal and state law may make an attempted acquisition or replacement of our board of directors or management more difficult. 
 Our second amended and restated articles of incorporation and our amended and restated bylaws, bylaws ), may have an anti-takeover effect and may delay, discourage or prevent an attempted acquisition or change of control or a replacement of our incumbent board of directors or management. Our governing documents include provisions that: 
 empower our board of directors, without shareholder approval, to issue preferred stock, the terms of which, including voting power, are to be set by our board of directors; 
 establish a classified board of directors, with directors of each class serving a three-year term; 
 provide that directors may be removed from office without cause only by vote of 80 of the outstanding shares then entitled to vote; 
 eliminate cumulative voting in elections of directors; 
 permit our board of directors to alter, amend or repeal our bylaws or to adopt new bylaws; 
 require the request of holders of at least one-third of the outstanding shares of our capital stock entitled to vote at a meeting to call a special shareholders meeting; 
 require shareholders that wish to bring business before annual meetings of shareholders, or to nominate candidates for election as directors at our annual meeting of shareholders, to provide timely notice of their intent in writing; 
 40 

Table of Contents 

 require that certain business combination transactions with a significant shareholder be approved by holders of two-thirds of the shares held by persons other than the significant shareholder; and 
 enable our board of directors to increase, between annual meetings, the number of persons serving as directors and to fill the vacancies created as a result of the increase by a majority vote of the directors present at a meeting of directors. 
 In addition, certain provisions of Washington law, including a provision which restricts certain business combinations between a Washington corporation and certain affiliated shareholders, may delay, discourage or prevent an attempted acquisition or change in control. Furthermore, banking laws impose notice, approval, and ongoing regulatory requirements on any shareholder or other party that seeks to acquire direct or indirect control of an FDIC-insured depository institution or its holding company. These laws include the BHC Act, the Change in Bank Control Act, and comparable banking laws in the State of Washington. These laws could delay or prevent an acquisition. 
 We are subject to laws regarding the privacy, information security and protection of personal information and any violation of these laws or another incident involving personal, confidential or proprietary information of individuals could damage our reputation and otherwise adversely affect our business, financial condition and earnings. 
 Our business requires the collection and retention of large volumes of customer data, including personally identifiable information in various information systems that we maintain and in those maintained by third parties with whom we contract to provide data services. We also maintain important internal company data such as personally identifiable information about our employees and information relating to our operations. We are subject to complex and increasingly demanding laws and regulations governing the privacy and protection of personal information of individuals (including customers, employees, suppliers and other third parties). For example, our business is subject to the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act which, among other things: (i) imposes certain limitations on our ability to share nonpublic personal information about our customers with nonaffiliated third parties; (ii) requires that we provide certain disclosures to customers about our information collection, sharing and security practices and afford customers the right to opt out of any information sharing by us with nonaffiliated third parties (with certain exceptions); and (iii) requires that we develop, implement and maintain a written comprehensive information security program containing appropriate safeguards based on our size and complexity, the nature and scope of our activities, and the sensitivity of customer information we process, as well as plans for responding to data security breaches. Various state and federal laws and regulations impose data security breach notification requirements with varying levels of individual, consumer, regulatory or law enforcement notification in certain circumstances in the event of a security breach. Ensuring that our collection, use, transfer and storage of personal information complies with all applicable laws and regulations can increase our costs. 
 Furthermore, we may not be able to ensure that all of our clients, suppliers, counterparties, broker dealers and financial providers in CCBX, and other third parties have appropriate controls in place to protect the confidentiality of the information that they exchange with us, particularly where such information is transmitted by electronic means. If personal, confidential or proprietary information of customers or others were to be mishandled or misused (in situations where, for example, such information was erroneously provided to parties who are not permitted to have the information, or where such information was intercepted or otherwise compromised by third parties), we could be exposed to litigation or regulatory sanctions under personal information laws and regulations. Concerns regarding the effectiveness of our measures to safeguard personal information, or even the perception that such measures are inadequate, could cause us to lose customers or potential customers for our products and services and thereby reduce our revenues. Accordingly, any failure or perceived failure to comply with applicable privacy or data protection laws and regulations may subject us to inquiries, examinations and investigations that could result in requirements to modify or cease certain operations or practices or in significant liabilities, fines or penalties, and could damage our reputation and otherwise adversely affect our business, financial condition and earnings. 
 We are dependent on our information technology and telecommunications systems and third-party service providers; systems failures, interruptions, security breaches and cybersecurity threats could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. 
 Our business is dependent on the successful and uninterrupted functioning of our information technology and telecommunications systems and third-party service providers. The failure of these systems, or the termination of a third-party software license or service agreement on which any of these systems is based, could interrupt our operations. Because our information technology and telecommunications systems interface with and depend on third-party systems, we could experience service denials if demand for such services exceeds capacity or such third-party systems fail or experience

 interruptions. If significant, sustained or repeated, a system failure or service denial could compromise our ability to operate effectively, damage our reputation, result in a loss of customer business, and/or subject us to additional regulatory scrutiny and possible financial liability, any of which could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. 
 In the ordinary course of our business, we collect and store sensitive data, including our proprietary business information and that of our customers, suppliers and business partners, as well as personally identifiable information about our customers and employees. The processing that takes place with our strategic partners could potentially have an adverse impact on us in the event of a security breach of their systems. The secure processing, maintenance and transmission of this information is critical to our operations and business strategy. We, our customers, and other financial institutions with which we interact, are subject to increasingly frequent, continuous attempts, including ransomware and malware attacks, to penetrate key systems by individual hackers, organized criminals, and in some cases, state-sponsored organizations. Our systems and our third-party service providers systems have been, and will likely continue to be, subject to advanced computer viruses or other malicious codes, ransomware, unauthorized access attempts, denial of service attacks, phishing, social engineering, hacking and other cyber-attacks. 
 We have a cybersecurity program that includes internal/external penetration testing, regular vulnerability assessments, detailed vulnerability management, data loss prevention controls, file access and integrity monitoring and reporting and threat intelligence. While we have established policies and procedures to prevent or limit the impact of cyber-attacks, there can be no assurance that such events will not occur or will be adequately addressed if they do. In addition, we also outsource certain cybersecurity functions, such as penetration testing, to third-party service providers, and the failure of these service providers to adequately perform such functions could increase our exposure to security breaches and cybersecurity threats. Despite our security measures, our information technology and infrastructure may be vulnerable to attacks by hackers or breached due to employee error, malfeasance or other malicious code and cyber-attacks that could have an impact on information security. Any such breach or attacks could compromise our networks and the information stored there could be accessed, publicly disclosed, lost or stolen. Any such unauthorized access, disclosure or other loss of information could result in legal claims or proceedings, liability under laws that protect the privacy of personal information, and regulatory penalties; disrupt our operations and the services we provide to customers; damage our reputation; and cause a loss of confidence in our products and services, all of which could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. Further, to the extent that the activities of our third-party service providers or the activities of our customers involve the storage and transmission of confidential information, security breaches and viruses could expose us to claims, regulatory scrutiny, litigation costs and other possible liabilities. 
 Risks Related to Our Capital and Liquidity 
 Ineffective liquidity management could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. 
 Effective liquidity management is essential for the operation of our business. We require sufficient liquidity to meet customer loan requests, customer deposit maturities/withdrawals, payments on our debt obligations as they come due and other cash commitments under both normal operating conditions and other unpredictable circumstances causing industry or general financial market stress. Our access to funding sources in amounts adequate to finance our activities on terms that are acceptable to us could be impaired by factors that affect us specifically or the financial services industry or economy generally. Factors that could detrimentally impact our access to liquidity sources include a downturn in the geographic markets in which our loans and operations are concentrated or difficult credit markets. Our access to deposits may also be affected by the liquidity needs of our depositors. In particular, a majority of our liabilities are checking accounts and other liquid deposits, which are payable on demand or upon several days notice, while by comparison, a substantial majority of our assets are loans, which cannot be called or sold in the same time frame. Although we have historically been able to replace maturing deposits and advances as necessary, we might not be able to replace such funds in the future, especially if a large number of our depositors seek to withdraw their accounts, regardless of the reason. A failure to maintain adequate liquidity could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. 
 We may need to raise additional capital in the future, and such capital may not be available when needed or at all. 
 We may need to raise additional capital, in the form of additional debt or equity, in the future to have sufficient capital resources and liquidity to meet our commitments and fund our business needs and future growth, particularly if the quality of our assets or earnings were to deteriorate significantly. Our ability to raise additional capital, if needed, will depend on, among other things, conditions in the capital markets at that time, which are outside of our control, and our financial condition. Economic conditions and a loss of confidence in financial institutions may increase our cost of funding 
 42 

Table of Contents 

 and limit access to certain customary sources of capital or make such capital only available on unfavorable terms, including interbank borrowings, repurchase agreements and borrowings from the discount window of the Federal Reserve. We may not be able to obtain capital on acceptable terms or at all. Any occurrence that may limit our access to the capital markets, such as a decline in the confidence of debt purchasers, depositors of our bank or counterparties participating in the capital markets or other disruption in capital markets, may adversely affect our capital costs and our ability to raise capital and, in turn, our liquidity. Further, if we need to raise capital in the future, we may have to do so when many other financial institutions are also seeking to raise capital and would then have to compete with those institutions for investors. An inability to raise additional capital on acceptable terms when needed could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. 
 There may be future sales or other dilution of our equity, which may adversely affect the market price of our securities. 
 We may seek to raise additional capital in the future through equity offerings. The issuance of additional shares of common stock or the issuance of convertible securities would dilute the ownership interest of our existing common shareholders. The market price of our common stock could decline as a result of an equity offering, as well as other sales of a large block of shares of our common stock or similar securities in the market after an equity offering, or the perception that such sales could occur. Both we and our regulators perform a variety of analyses of our assets, including the preparation of stress case scenarios, and as a result of those assessments we could determine, or our regulators could require us, to raise additional capital. 
 Risks Related to Our Industry 
 Regulation of the financial services industry is intense, and we may be adversely affected by changes in laws and regulations. 
 We are subject to extensive government regulation, supervision and examination at both the federal and state level. The Bank s deposits are insured in whole or in part by the FDIC. The Bank is subject to regulation by the Federal Reserve and the Washington DFI. The Federal Reserve also has supervisory authority over the Company. Such regulation, supervision and examination govern the activities in which we may engage, and are intended primarily for the protection of the deposit insurance fund and the Bank s depositors, rather than for shareholders. 
 Compliance with applicable laws and regulations can be difficult and costly, and changes to laws and regulations can impose additional compliance costs. The Dodd-Frank Act, which imposed significant regulatory and compliance changes on financial institutions, is an example of this type of federal law. Any future legislative changes could have a material impact on our profitability, the value of assets held for investment or the value of collateral for loans. Future legislative changes could also require changes to business practices and potentially expose us to additional costs, liabilities, enforcement action and reputational risk. 
 Federal regulatory agencies have the ability to take strong supervisory actions against financial institutions that have experienced increased loan production and losses and other underwriting weaknesses or have compliance weaknesses. These actions include entering into formal or informal written agreements and cease and desist orders that place certain limitations on their operations. If we were to become subject to a regulatory action, such action could negatively impact our ability to execute our business plan, and result in operational restrictions, as well as our ability to grow, pay dividends, repurchase stock or engage in mergers and acquisitions. See Item 1. Business Regulation and Supervision Bank Regulation and Supervision Capital Adequacy for a discussion of regulatory capital requirements. 
 Additional increases in Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation insurance premiums could adversely affect our earnings and results of operations. 
 The deposits of the Bank are insured by the FDIC up to legal limits and, accordingly, subject it to the payment of FDIC deposit insurance assessments. The Bank's regular assessments are determined by the level of its assessment base and its risk classification, which is based on its regulatory capital levels and the level of supervisory concern that it poses, as well as by its usage of brokered deposits. Moreover, the FDIC has the unilateral power to change deposit insurance assessment rates and the manner in which deposit insurance is calculated and also to charge special assessments to FDIC-insured institutions. The FDIC utilized all of these powers during the financial crisis for the purpose of restoring the reserve ratios of the Deposit Insurance Fund, and more recently increased assessment rates to address extraordinary growth in the amount of insured deposits resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic. 
 43 

Table of Contents 

 Any future special assessments, increases in assessment rates or premiums, or required prepayments in FDIC insurance premiums could reduce our profitability or limit our ability to pursue certain business opportunities, which could adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations. 
 Federal banking agencies periodically conduct examinations of our business, including compliance with laws and regulations, and our failure to comply with any supervisory actions to which we are or become subject as a result of such examinations could adversely affect us. 
 As part of the bank regulatory process, the Federal Reserve and the Washington DFI periodically conduct comprehensive examinations of our business, including compliance with laws and regulations. If, as a result of an examination, either of these banking agencies were to determine that the financial condition, capital resources, asset quality, earnings prospects, management, liquidity, asset sensitivity, risk management or other aspects of any of our operations had become unsatisfactory, or that our Company, the Bank or their respective management were in violation of any law or regulation, it may take a number of different remedial actions as it deems appropriate. The Federal Reserve may enjoin unsafe or unsound practices or violations of law, require affirmative actions to correct any conditions resulting from any violation or practice, issue an administrative order that can be judicially enforced, direct an increase in our capital levels, restrict our growth, assess civil monetary penalties against us, the Bank or their respective officers or directors, and remove officers and directors. The FDIC also has authority to review our financial condition, and, if the FDIC were to conclude that the Bank or its directors were engaged in unsafe or unsound practices, that the Bank was in an unsafe or unsound condition to continue operations, or the Bank or the directors violated applicable law, the FDIC could move to terminate the Bank s deposit insurance. If we become subject to such regulatory actions, our business, financial condition, and results of operations as well as our reputation could be adversely affected. 
 Many of our new activities and expansion plans require regulatory approvals, and failure to obtain these approvals may restrict our growth. 
 We intend to complement and expand our business by growing our BaaS segment, expanding the Bank s banking location network, or de novo branching, and pursuing strategic acquisitions of financial institutions and other complementary businesses. Generally, we must receive federal and state regulatory approval before we can acquire a depository institution or related business insured by the FDIC or before we open a de novo branch. In determining whether to approve a proposed acquisition, federal banking regulators will consider, among other factors, the effect of the acquisition on competition, our financial condition, our future prospects, and the impact of the proposal on U.S. financial stability. The regulators also review current and projected capital ratios and levels, the competence, experience and integrity of management and its record of compliance with laws and regulations, the convenience and needs of the communities to be served (including the acquiring institution s record of compliance under the CRA) and the effectiveness of the acquiring institution in combating money laundering activities. Such regulatory approvals may not be granted on terms that are acceptable to us, or at all. 
 Federal bank regulators have increasingly focused on the risks related to bank and fintech company partnerships, raising concerns regarding risk management, oversight, internal controls, information security, change management, and information technology operational resilience. This focus is demonstrated by recent regulatory enforcement actions against other banks that have allegedly not adequately addressed these concerns while growing their BaaS offerings. We could be subject to additional regulatory scrutiny with respect to our CCBX business that could have a material adverse effect on the business, financial condition, results of operations and growth prospects of the Company. 
 Financial institutions, such as the Bank, face a risk of noncompliance with and enforcement action under the Bank Secrecy Act and other anti-money laundering statutes and regulations. 
 The Bank Secrecy Act, the Uniting and Strengthening America by Providing Appropriate Tools Required to Intercept and Obstruct Terrorism Act of 2001 USA PATRIOT Act ), and other laws and regulations require financial institutions, among other duties, to institute and maintain an effective anti-money laundering program and file suspicious activity and currency transaction reports as appropriate. The Financial Crimes Enforcement Network, established by the Treasury Department to administer the Bank Secrecy Act, has authority to impose significant civil money penalties for violations of these requirements and has recently engaged in coordinated enforcement efforts with the individual federal banking regulators, as well as the U.S. Department of Justice, Drug Enforcement Administration and the Internal Revenue Service. There is also increased scrutiny of compliance with the sanctions programs and rules administered and enforced by the Treasury Department s Office of Foreign Assets Control.

 In order to comply with regulations, guidelines and examination procedures in this area, we have dedicated significant resources to our anti-money laundering program. If our policies, procedures and systems are deemed deficient, we could be subject to liability, including fines and regulatory actions such as restrictions on our ability to pay dividends and the inability to obtain regulatory approvals to proceed with certain aspects of our business plans, including acquisitions and de novo branching. 
 We are subject to numerous laws designed to promote community reinvestment or protect consumers, including the CRA and fair lending laws, and failure to comply with these laws could lead to a wide variety of sanctions. 
 The CRA requires the Federal Reserve to assess the Bank s performance in meeting the credit needs of the communities it serves, including low- and moderate-income neighborhoods, and if the Bank performs unsatisfactorily, various adverse regulatory consequences may ensue, including an inability to secure regulatory approval of expansionary transactions or new branches. Additionally, in May 2022 the federal banking agencies issued a proposed rule that may make it more challenging and/or costly for insured depository institutions to achieve an Outstanding or Satisfactory CRA rating, which could negatively impact our ability to obtain regulatory approval for an acquisition. 
 In addition, the Equal Credit Opportunity Act, the Fair Housing Act and other fair lending laws and regulations impose nondiscriminatory lending requirements on financial institutions. The federal banking agencies, the CFPB, the U.S. Department of Justice and other federal agencies are responsible for enforcing these laws and regulations. The CFPB was created under the Dodd-Frank Act to centralize responsibility for consumer financial protection with broad rulemaking authority to administer and carry out the purposes and objectives of federal consumer financial laws with respect to all financial institutions that offer financial products and services to consumers. The CFPB is also authorized to prescribe rules applicable to any covered person or service provider, identifying and prohibiting acts or practices that are unfair, deceptive, or abusive in connection with any transaction with a consumer for a consumer financial product or service, or the offering of a consumer financial product or service. The broad rulemaking powers of the CFPB have potential to have a significant impact on the operations of financial institutions offering consumer financial products or services. 
 A successful regulatory challenge to an institution s performance under fair lending laws or regulations, or other consumer lending laws and regulations could result in a wide variety of sanctions, including damages and civil money penalties, injunctive relief, restrictions on mergers and acquisitions activity, restrictions on expansion, and restrictions on entering new business lines. Private parties may also have the ability to challenge an institution s performance under fair lending laws in private class action litigation. Such actions could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. 
 Federal, state and local consumer lending laws may restrict our ability to originate certain mortgage loans or increase our risk of liability with respect to such loans and could increase our cost of doing business. 
 Federal, state and local laws have been adopted that are intended to eliminate certain lending practices considered predatory. These laws prohibit practices such as steering borrowers away from more affordable products, selling unnecessary insurance to borrowers, repeatedly refinancing loans and making loans without a reasonable expectation that the borrowers will be able to repay the loans irrespective of the value of the underlying property. It is our policy not to make predatory loans, but these laws create the potential for liability with respect to our lending activities. They increase our cost of doing business and, ultimately, may prevent us from making certain loans and cause us to reduce the average percentage rate or the points and fees on loans that we do make. 
 The expanding body of federal, state and local regulations and/or the licensing of loan servicing, collections or other aspects of our business and our sales of loans to third parties may increase the cost of compliance and the risks of noncompliance and subject us to litigation. 
 We service most of our own community bank loans and CCBX partners service most loans originated through them. Loan servicing is subject to extensive regulation by federal, state and local governmental authorities, as well as various laws and judicial and administrative decisions imposing requirements and restrictions on those activities. The volume of new or modified laws and regulations has increased in recent years and, in addition, some individual municipalities have begun to enact laws that restrict loan servicing activities, including delaying or temporarily preventing foreclosures or forcing the modification of certain mortgages. If regulators impose new or more restrictive requirements, we may incur additional significant costs to comply with such requirements, which may further adversely affect us. In addition, were we to be subject to regulatory investigation or regulatory action regarding our loan modification and foreclosure practices, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected. 
 45

 Our failure to comply with applicable laws and regulations could possibly lead to: civil and criminal liability; loss of licensure; damage to our reputation in the industry; fines and penalties and litigation, including class action lawsuits; and administrative enforcement actions. Any of these outcomes could adversely affect us. 
 The Federal Reserve may require us to commit capital resources to support the Bank. 
 The Federal Reserve requires a bank holding company to act as a source of financial and managerial strength to its subsidiary banks and to commit resources to support its subsidiary banks. Under the source of strength doctrine that was codified by the Dodd-Frank Act, the Federal Reserve may require a bank holding company to make capital injections into a troubled subsidiary bank at times when the bank holding company may not otherwise be inclined to do so and may charge the bank holding company with engaging in unsafe and unsound practices for failure to commit resources to such a subsidiary bank. Under the prompt corrective action regime, if the Bank were to become undercapitalized, we would be required to guarantee the Bank s plan to restore its capital subject to certain limits. See Item 1. Business Regulation and Supervision Bank Regulation and Supervision Prompt Corrective Action. Accordingly, we could be required to provide financial assistance to the Bank if it experiences financial distress. 
 A capital injection may be required at a time when our resources are limited, and we may be required to borrow the funds or raise capital to make the required capital injection. Any loan by a bank holding company to its subsidiary bank is subordinate in right of payment to deposits and certain other indebtedness of such subsidiary bank. In the event of a bank holding company s bankruptcy, the bankruptcy trustee will assume any commitment by the holding company to a federal bank regulatory agency to maintain the capital of a subsidiary bank. Moreover, bankruptcy law provides that claims based on any such commitment will be entitled to a priority of payment over the claims of the holding company s general unsecured creditors, including the holders of any note obligations. Thus, any borrowing by a bank holding company for the purpose of making a capital injection to a subsidiary bank often becomes more difficult and expensive relative to other corporate borrowings. 
 We could be adversely affected by the soundness of other financial institutions. 
 Financial services institutions are interrelated as a result of trading, clearing, counterparty or other relationships. We have exposure to many different industries and counterparties, and routinely execute transactions with counterparties in the financial services industry, including commercial banks, brokers and dealers, investment banks and other institutional clients. Many of these transactions expose us to credit risk in the event of a default by a counterparty or client. In addition, our credit risk may be exacerbated when our collateral cannot be foreclosed upon or is liquidated at prices not sufficient to recover the full amount of the credit or derivative exposure due. Any such losses could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. 
 We could be adversely affected by the soundness of our CCBX partners. 
 A growing portion of our revenue, deposits and loans are derived from CCBX partner activities. If our partners are not operating soundly, we may be adversely impacted through decreased revenue, increased loan losses and reduced deposits. Our CCBX partners originate their loans in compliance with our credit standards and policies. Additionally, partners provide fraud and credit enhancements on many of our CCBX loans. If any CCBX partners encounter operating difficulties, we may experience reduced revenue, increased loan losses if credit and fraud enhancement obligations are not met, and reduced deposits, which may impact liquidity. Any such losses could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. 
 General Risk Factors 
 National and global economic and other conditions could adversely affect our future results of operations or market price of our stock. 
 Our business is directly impacted by factors such as economic, political and market conditions, broad trends in industry and finance, changes in government monetary and fiscal policies and inflation, foreign policy, and financial market volatility, all of which are beyond our control. Global economies continue to face significant challenges to achieving normalized economic growth rates and there are continuing concerns related to the level of U.S. government debt and fiscal actions that may be taken to address that debt. There can be no assurance that economic conditions will continue to improve, and these conditions could worsen. Any deterioration in the economies of the nation as a whole or in our markets would have an adverse effect, which could be material, on our business, financial condition, results of operations 
 46 

Table of Contents 

 and could also cause the market price of our stock to decline. While it is impossible to predict how long challenging economic conditions may exist, a slow or fragile recovery could continue to present risks into the future for the industry and our company. In addition, concerns about the performance of international economies, especially in Europe and emerging markets, economic conditions in Asia, particularly the economies of China, South Korea and Japan, and the Russian invasion of Ukraine and resulting economic impact, can impact the economy and financial markets here in the United States. If the national, regional and local economies experience worsening economic conditions, including high levels of unemployment, our growth and profitability could be constrained. Weak economic conditions are characterized by, among other indicators, deflation, elevated levels of unemployment, fluctuations in debt and equity capital markets, increased delinquencies on mortgage, commercial and consumer loans, residential and commercial real estate price declines, and lower home sales and commercial activity. Further, our business could be adversely affected by the effects of a widespread outbreak of epidemic illness in the human population. All of these factors are generally detrimental to our business. Our business is significantly affected by monetary and other regulatory policies of the U.S. federal government, its agencies and government-sponsored entities. Changes in any of these policies are influenced by macroeconomic conditions and other factors that are beyond our control, are difficult to predict and could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. 
 We are subject to certain risks in connection with growing through mergers and acquisitions. 
 It is possible that we could acquire other banking institutions, other financial services companies or branches of banks in the future. Acquisitions typically involve the payment of a premium over book and trading values and, therefore, may result in the dilution of our tangible book value per share and/or our earnings per share. Our ability to engage in future mergers and acquisitions depends on various factors, including: (1) our ability to identify suitable merger partners and acquisition opportunities; (2) our ability to finance and complete transactions on acceptable terms and at acceptable prices; and (3) our ability to receive the necessary regulatory and, when required, shareholder approvals. Our inability to engage in an acquisition or merger for any of these reasons could have an adverse impact on the implementation of our business strategies. Furthermore, mergers and acquisitions involve a number of risks and challenges, including our ability to achieve planned synergies and to integrate the branches and operations we acquire, and the internal controls and regulatory functions into our current operations, as well as the diversion of management s attention from existing operations, which may adversely affect our ability to successfully conduct our business and negatively impact our financial condition and results of operations. 
 We must keep pace with technological change to remain competitive. 
 Financial products and services have become increasingly technology-driven. Our ability to meet the needs of our customers competitively, and in a cost-efficient manner, is dependent on the ability to keep pace with technological advances and to invest in new technology as it becomes available, as well as related essential personnel. In addition, technology has lowered barriers to entry into the financial services market and made it possible for financial technology companies and other non-bank entities to offer financial products and services traditionally provided by banks. The ability to keep pace with technological change is important, and the failure to do so, due to cost, proficiency or otherwise, could have an adverse impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations. 
 Negative public opinion regarding our company or failure to maintain our reputation in the communities we serve could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations and prevent us from growing our business. 
 As a community bank, our reputation within the communities we serve, including the BaaS space, is critical to our success. We believe we have set ourselves apart from our competitors by building strong personal and professional relationships with our customers and being active members of the communities we serve. As such, we strive to enhance our reputation by recruiting, hiring and retaining employees who share our core values of being an integral part of the communities we serve and delivering superior service to our customers. If our reputation is negatively affected by the actions of our employees or otherwise, we may be less successful in attracting new talent and customers or may lose existing customers, and our business, financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected. Further, negative public opinion can expose us to litigation and regulatory action and delay and impede our efforts to implement our expansion strategy, which could further adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.

 Our corporate headquarters is located at 5415 Evergreen Way, Everett, WA 98203. In addition to our corporate headquarters, which includes our Evergreen branch, we operated 13 other branch offices as of December 31, 2022 for our community bank and CCBX segments. Twelve of our branches are located in Snohomish County and two of our branches are located in neighboring counties (one in King County and one in Island County). We own our corporate headquarters and four of our other branch offices and lease the remainder of our branch offices. The leases, excluding renewal periods, on our branch offices expire in 2023 through 2044. We believe that these facilities and additional or alternative space available to us are adequate to meet our needs for the foreseeable future. 
 
 Item 3. Legal Proceedings 
 From time to time we are a party to various litigation matters incidental to the conduct of our business. We do not believe that any currently pending legal proceedings will have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or operations. Item 103 of the SEC s Regulation S-K requires disclosure of certain environmental matters when a governmental authority is a party to the proceedings and the proceedings involve potential monetary sanctions unless we reasonably believe the monetary sanctions will not equal or exceed a threshold which we determine is reasonably designed to result in disclosure of any such proceeding that is material to our business or financial condition. We have determined such disclosure threshold to be 1,000,000.

 Market Information, Holders of Common Stock and Dividends 
 The Company s common stock, no par value per share, is traded on the Nasdaq Global Select Market under the symbol CCB. On March 7, 2023, there were 294 holders of record of the Company s common stock. 
 Holders of our common stock are only entitled to receive dividends when, as and if declared by our board of directors out of funds legally available for dividends. We have not historically declared or paid dividends on our common stock and we do not intend to declare or pay dividends on our common stock in the near-term. Instead, we anticipate that all of our future earnings will be retained to support our operations and to finance the growth and development of our business. Any future determination to pay dividends will be made by our board of directors and will depend on a number of factors, including: 
 our historic and projected financial condition, liquidity and results of operations; 
 our capital levels and needs; 
 tax considerations; 
 any acquisitions or potential acquisitions that we may pursue; 
 statutory and regulatory prohibitions and other limitations; 
 the terms of any credit agreements or other borrowing arrangements that restrict our ability to pay cash dividends; 
 general economic conditions; and 
 other factors that our board of directors may deem relevant. 
 We are not obligated to pay dividends on our common stock and are subject to certain restrictions on paying dividends on our common stock. 
 As a Washington corporation, we are subject to certain restrictions on distributions to shareholders under the Washington Business Corporation Act. Generally, a Washington corporation is prohibited from making a distribution to shareholders if, after giving effect to the distribution, the corporation would not be able to pay its liabilities as they become due in the usual course of business or the corporation s total assets would be less than the sum of its total liabilities plus, unless its articles of incorporation provide otherwise, the amount that would be needed, if the corporation were to be dissolved at the time of the distribution, to satisfy the preferential rights upon dissolution of shareholders whose preferential rights are superior to those receiving the distribution. In addition, if required payments on our outstanding junior subordinated debentures are not made or suspended, we may be prohibited from paying dividends on our common stock. We are also subject to certain restrictions on our right to pay dividends on our capital stock in the event we have failed to make any required payment of interest or principal under the terms of our subordinated note. 
 We are subject to certain restrictions on the payment of cash dividends as a result of banking laws, regulations and policies. Because we are a bank holding company and do not engage directly in business activities of a material nature, our ability to pay dividends on our common stock depends, in large part, upon our receipt of dividends from the Bank, which is also subject to numerous limitations on the payment of dividends under federal and state banking laws, regulations and policies. See Item 1. Business Regulation and Supervision Bank Holding Company Regulation Dividends. The present and future dividend policy of the Bank is subject to the discretion of its board of directors. The Bank is not obligated to pay us dividends.

 Overview 
 We are a bank holding company that operates through our wholly owned subsidiaries, Coastal Community Bank Bank and Arlington Olympic LLC . We are headquartered in Everett, Washington, which by population is the largest city in, and the county seat of, Snohomish County. Our business is conducted through two reportable segments: The community bank and CCBX. The primary focus of the community bank is on providing a wide range of banking products and services to consumers and small to medium sized businesses in the broader Puget Sound region in the state of Washington and through the Internet and our mobile banking application. We currently operate 14 full-service banking locations, 12 of which are located in Snohomish County, where we are the largest community bank by deposit market share, and two of which are located in neighboring counties (one in King County and one in Island County). The CCBX segment provides banking as a service BaaS that allows our broker-dealer and digital financial service partners to offer their customers banking services. The CCBX segment had 27 partners as of December 31, 2022. The Bank s deposits are insured in whole or in part by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation FDIC ). The Bank is subject to regulation by the Federal Reserve and the Washington State Department of Financial Institutions Division of Banks. The Federal Reserve also has supervisory authority over the Company. 
 As of December 31, 2022, we had total assets of 3.14 billion, total loans receivable of 2.63 billion, total deposits of 2.82 billion and total shareholders equity of 243.5 million. 
 The following discussion and analysis presents our financial condition and results of operations on a consolidated basis. However, because we conduct all of our material business operations through the Bank, the discussion and analysis relate to activities primarily conducted by the Bank. This discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with the audited consolidated financial statements and the accompanying notes presented elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. 
 We generate most of our community bank revenue from interest on loans and investments and CCBX revenue from BaaS fee income. Our primary source of funding for our loans is commercial and retail deposits from our customer relationships and from our partner deposit relationships. We place secondary reliance on any funding from our CCBX partner deposit relationships that are transferred off our balance sheet and wholesale funding, primarily borrowings from the Federal Home Loan Bank FHLB ). Less commonly used sources of funding include borrowings from the Federal Reserve System Federal Reserve discount window, draws on established federal funds lines from unaffiliated commercial banks, brokered funds, which allows us to obtain deposits from sources that do not have a relationship with the Bank and can be obtained through certificate of deposit listing services, via the internet or through other advertising methods, or a one-way buy through an insured cash sweep ICS account, which allows us to obtain funds from other institutions that have deposited funds through ICS. Our largest expenses are provision for loan losses, salaries and employee benefits, interest on deposits and borrowings, legal and professional expenses and data processing. Our principal lending products are commercial real estate loans, commercial and industrial loans, residential real estate loans, construction, land and land development loans, and consumer loans. 
 
 Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security CARES Act and PPP Overview 
 Our financial results for the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021 were impacted by the coronavirus, and variants thereof, including the Delta and Omicron variants COVID-19 pandemic. On March 27, 2020, the CARES Act was enacted, providing wide ranging economic relief for individuals and businesses impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic. Among other things, the statute created the Paycheck Protection Program PPP ), which was a stimulus response to the potential economic impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic. The purpose of the PPP was to provide forgivable loans to smaller businesses, sole proprietorships, independent contractors, and self-employed individuals that used the proceeds of the loans for payroll and certain other qualifying expenses.

 In total, we funded 763.9 million in PPP loans, since the first round of PPP loans opened in March 2020 through the close of round three. Total net deferred fees on these loans were 26.3 million. As of December 31, 2022, there were 4.7 million in PPP loans outstanding, compared to 111.8 million as of December 31, 2021. 
 
 London Interbank Offered Rate LIBOR Transition 
 On December 16, 2022, the Federal Reserve Board adopted a final rule that implements the LIBOR Act by identifying benchmark rates based on SOFR (Secured Overnight Financing Rate) that will replace LIBOR formerly known as the London Interbank Offered Rate, in certain financial contracts after June 30, 2023. Congress enacted the LIBOR Act, which was signed into law in March 2022, to provide a uniform, nationwide solution for so-called tough legacy contracts that do not have clear and practicable provisions for replacing LIBOR after June 30, 2023. The LIBOR Act also establishes a litigation safe harbor for lenders that select a LIBOR replacement under certain situations, including the use of a replacement rate selected by the Federal Reserve. As required by the law, the final rule identifies replacement benchmark rates based on SOFR to replace overnight, one-month, three-month, six-month, and 12-month LIBOR in contracts subject to the Act. These contracts include U.S. contracts that do not mature before LIBOR ends and that lack adequate "fallback" provisions that would replace LIBOR with a practicable replacement benchmark rate. 
 As of December 31, 2022, we had 51 loans totaling 206.6 million that are tied to LIBOR. We have 3.6 million in floating rate junior subordinated debentures to Coastal (WA) Statutory Trust I, which was formed for the issuance of trust preferred securities. These debentures are also tied to LIBOR. The move to an alternate index may impact the rates we receive on loans and rates we pay on our junior subordinated debentures. We have identified the loans and debt instruments impacted, and we believe we will be able to use other benchmark replacements and transition protections provided by the LIBOR Act, Federal Reserve rule and relevant accounting guidance to manage through the transition away from LIBOR. We no longer issue any loans or debt tied to LIBOR . 
 
 Key Factors Affecting our Business 
 Average Balances and Interest Rates 
 Our operating results depend primarily on our net interest income, which is the largest contributor to our net income and is the difference between the interest and fees earned on interest-earning assets (such as loans and securities) and the interest expense incurred in connection with interest-bearing liabilities (such as deposits and borrowings). Net interest income is primarily a function of the average balances of interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities and the yields and costs with respect to these assets and liabilities. Average balances are influenced by internal considerations such as the types of products we offer and the amount of risk that we are willing to assume as well as external influences such as economic conditions, competition for loans and deposits, and interest rates. The yields generated by our loans and securities are typically affected by short-term and long-term interest rates and, in the case of loans, competition for similar products in our market area. Interest rates are often impacted by the actions of the Federal Reserve. Since March 2022, in response to inflation, the FOMC of the Federal Reserve has increased the target range for the federal funds rate by 425 basis points, including 125 basis points during the fourth calendar quarter of 2022, to a range of 4.25 to 4.50 as of December 31, 2022. As it seeks to control inflation without creating a recession, the FOMC has indicated there may be further increases in the federal funds rate during calendar year 2023. The cost of our deposits and short-term borrowings is primarily based on short-term interest rates, which are largely driven by competition and by the actions of the Federal Reserve. The level of net interest income is influenced by movements in interest rates and the pace at which such movements occur, as well as the relationship between short- and long-term interest rates. 
 Credit Quality 
 We have well established loan policies and underwriting practices that have resulted in low levels of charge-offs and nonperforming assets for the community bank. Through our thorough underwriting process, we strive to originate quality loans that will maintain and enhance the overall credit quality of our loan portfolio, and through our careful monitoring of our loan portfolio and prompt attention to delinquencies, we seek to minimize the impact of problem loans. However, credit trends in the markets in which we operate are largely impacted by economic conditions beyond our control and can adversely impact our financial condition. We originate loans through our CCBX partners and while these loans will have higher levels of charge-offs and nonperforming assets, agreements with our CCBX partners provide for a credit enhancement which protects the Bank by absorbing incurred losses. If our partners are unable to fulfill their contracted obligations then the Bank would be exposed to additional loan losses as a result of this counterparty risk.

 Operating Efficiency 
 The largest component of noninterest expense is salaries and employee benefits. Other significant operating expenses include BaaS expense, occupancy expense, legal and professional expenses, data processing expense, director and staff expense and marketing expense. Our operating efficiency, as measured by our efficiency ratio, has gradually improved primarily because the growth of our deposits and loans has enabled our net interest income and noninterest income to outpace the growth of our expenses. When we make substantial investments in the infrastructure of new divisions, open new branches or make investments to increase our operating capacity, our operating efficiency decreases until we generate enough revenue growth to offset the increased costs however, prior to making such investments, we focus on how best and most expediently we can achieve the revenue growth necessary to offset the costs of these investments or new branches. Our efficiency ratio has been impacted by the increase in CCBX income and CCBX expense. Our efficiency ratio was 56.26 at December 31, 2022, compared to 58.82 at December 31, 2021. 
 Economic Conditions 
 Our business and financial performance are affected by economic conditions generally in the United States and more directly in the markets in the Puget Sound region where we operate. The significant economic factors that are most relevant to our business and our financial performance include, but are not limited to, real estate values, interest rates and unemployment rates. In recent years, the Puget Sound region has experienced significant population gain, fueled in large part by the region s technology industry, low unemployment and rising real estate values, all of which positively impacted our business. The economic environment is continuously changing, due to increased inflation, global unrest, the war in Ukraine, the political environment, and trade issues all contribute to economic uncertainty which has caused increased market volatility and may lead to an economic recession and/or a significant decrease in consumer confidence and business generally. 
 
 Critical Accounting Policies 
 Our accounting policies are integral to understanding our results of operations. Our accounting policies are described in greater detail in Note 1 to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Report on Form 10-K. Certain accounting policies involve significant judgments and assumptions by us that have a material impact on the carrying value of certain assets and liabilities. We consider these accounting policies, which are discussed below, to be critical accounting policies. These assumptions, estimates and judgments we use can be influenced by a number of factors, including the general economic environment. Actual results could differ from these judgments and estimates under different conditions, resulting in a change that could have a material impact on the carrying values of our assets and liabilities and our results of operations. We believe that of our accounting policies, the following accounting policies may involve a higher degree of judgment and complexity: 
 Securities 
 Securities are classified as available for sale when they might be sold before maturity. Securities available for sale are carried at fair value. Unrealized gains and losses are excluded from earnings and reported in other comprehensive income. Securities within the available for sale portfolio may be used as part of our asset/liability strategy and may be pledged or sold in response to changes in interest rate risk, prepayment risk or other similar economic factors. Securities held to maturity are carried at cost, adjusted for the amortization of premiums and the accretion of discounts and may be pledged. 
 Interest earned on these assets is included in interest income. Interest income includes amortization of any purchase premium or discount. Premiums and discounts on securities are amortized using the level-yield method, except for mortgage backed securities where prepayments are anticipated. Gains and losses on sales are recorded on the trade date and determined using the specific identification method. 
 Management evaluates debt securities for other-than-temporary impairment OTTI ), on at least a quarterly basis, and more frequently when economic or market conditions warrant such an evaluation. For securities in an unrealized loss position, management considers the extent and duration of the unrealized loss, and the financial condition and near-term prospects of the issuer. Management also assesses whether it intends to sell, or it is more likely than not that it will be required to sell, a security in an unrealized loss position before recovery of its amortized cost basis. If either of the criteria regarding intent or requirement to sell is met, the entire difference between amortized cost and fair value is recognized as impairment through earnings. For debt securities that do not meet the aforementioned criteria, the amount of impairment is 
 52 

Table of Contents 

 split into two components as follows: (1) OTTI related to credit loss, which must be recognized in the income statement, and (2) OTTI related to other factors, which is recognized in other comprehensive income, net of applicable taxes. The credit loss is defined as the difference between the present value of the cash flows expected to be collected and the amortized cost basis. The previous amortized cost basis less the OTTI recognized in earnings becomes the new amortized cost basis of the security. For more information and discussion related to securities, see Note 3 - Investment Securities in the Consolidated Financial Statements. 
 Loans Held for Investment 
 Loans held for investment are those that management has the intent and ability to hold for the foreseeable future or until maturity or payoff at the principal and interest balance outstanding, net of deferred loan fees and costs. Loans are typically secured by specific items of collateral including business assets, consumer assets, and commercial and residential real estate. Commercial loans are expected to be repaid from cash flow from operations of businesses. Interest income is accrued on the unpaid principal balance. Loan origination fees and certain direct origination costs are deferred and recognized as adjustments to interest income using a level yield methodology or a method approximating the level yield methodology. 
 As of December 31, 2022, loans receivable totaled 2.63 billion, an increase of 884.5 million, or 50.8 , compared to 1.74 billion as of December 31, 2021. Total loans receivable is net of 6.1 million in net deferred origination fees, 82,000 of which is attributed to PPP loans. The increase is largely attributed to growth in our CCBX segment as a result of adding new partners, combined with loan growth in the community bank segment, partially offset by forgiveness or principal paydowns on PPP loans. For more information and discussion related to the loans held for investment, see Note 4 - Loans and Allowance for Loan Losses in the Consolidated Financial Statements. 
 Loans Held for Sale 
 CCBX loans held for sale consist of the portion of CCBX originated loans that the Company intends to sell back to the originating CCBX partner or its affiliate generally at par. The Company sells loans to manage credit positions with partners and across loan categories. During the twelve months ended December 31, 2022, the Company transferred 152.5 million in CCBX loans receivable to loans held for sale and subsequently sold these loans. As of December 31, 2022 and 2021 there were no CCBX loans held for sale. 
 Community bank loans held-for-sale consist of the guaranteed portion of SBA loans and United States Department of Agriculture USDA loans the Company intends to sell after origination and are reflected at the lower of aggregate cost or fair value. Loans are generally sold with servicing of the sold portion retained by the Company when the sale of the loan occurs, the premium received is combined with the estimated present value of future cash flows on the related servicing asset and recorded as a gain on sale of loans in noninterest income. There were no community bank loans held for sale at December 31, 2022 and 2021. 
 Equity Investments 
 Equity investments include amounts invested in stock, venture capital funds, partnerships, and other business ventures. Some of these equity investments are in vendors/suppliers, private companies, government agencies, or government sponsored enterprises. The Company directly holds stock in organizations such as the Federal Reserve Bank, Federal Home Loan Bank of Des Moines, private companies, and venture capital funds. Equity investments are subject to the risk of loss if these organizations experience financial difficulties or fall on hard times. The Company carries these investments at market value or cost if market value is not readily determinable. During 2022, net contributions to private company equity investments totaled 699,000 and decreased in value by 153,000 in response to a decline in value in the stock based financial performance and growth rates. In 2021, net contributions to private company equity investments totaled 163,000 and increased in value by 1.5 million (unrealized gain) mostly in response to one company s issuance of common equity awards, identical to the Company s holdings, at a higher value. 
 The assumptions underlying these valuations represent management s best estimates, which involve inherent uncertainties and the application of management s judgment. While we believe the assumptions and estimates we have made are reasonable and appropriate, different assumptions or estimates could have resulted in materially different fair values for these equity investments. For more information and discussion related to securities, see Note 3 - Investment Securities in the Consolidated Financial Statements.

 Allowance for Loan Losses 
 The allowance for loan losses represents management s estimate of probable and reasonably estimable credit losses inherent in the loan portfolio. In determining the allowance, the Company estimates losses on individual impaired loans, or groups of loans which are not impaired, where the probable loss can be identified and reasonably estimated. On a quarterly basis, the Company assesses the risk inherent in the Company s loan portfolio based on qualitative and quantitative trends in the portfolio, including the internal risk classification of loans, historical loss rates, changes in the nature and volume of the loan portfolio, industry or borrower concentrations, delinquency trends, detailed reviews of significant loans with identified weaknesses and the impacts of local, regional and national economic factors on the quality of the loan portfolio. Community bank loans are assessed at the individual loan level and CCBX loans are pooled and evaluated at both the partner and product level. Based on this analysis, the Company records a provision for loan losses to maintain the allowance at appropriate levels. 
 Determining the amount of the allowance is considered a critical accounting estimate, as it requires significant judgment and the use of subjective measurements, including management s assessment of overall portfolio quality. The Company maintains the allowance at an amount the Company believes is sufficient to provide for estimated losses inherent in the Company s loan portfolio at each balance sheet date, and fluctuations in the provision for loan losses may result from management s assessment of the adequacy of the allowance. Changes in these estimates and assumptions are possible and may have a material impact on the Company s allowance, and therefore the Company s financial position, liquidity or results of operations. 
 The Company increased the allowance from 28.6 million at December 31, 2021 to 74.0 million at December 31, 2022. The allowance was significantly increased in response to growth in CCBX loans. The Company uses CCBX partner data, industry data and its own loan loss data to develop an appropriate allowance for the risk inherent in the CCBX new loan volume. The Company increased the allowance from 19.3 million to 28.6 million in 2021 largely due to an increase in CCBX consumer loans. For more information and discussion related to the allowance for loan losses, see Note 4 - Loans and Allowance for Loan Losses in the Consolidated Financial Statements. 
 Stock-based Compensation 
 We grant stock options and restricted stock to our employees and directors. We record the related compensation expense based on the grant date fair value calculated in accordance with the authoritative guidance issued by FASB. We recognize these compensation costs on a straight-line basis over the requisite service period of the award. We estimate the grant date fair value of stock options using the Black-Scholes valuation model. Stock-based compensation expense related to awards of restricted stock and restricted stock units is based on the fair value at the grant date. 
 The determination of fair value using the Black-Scholes model is affected by the price of our common stock, as well as the input of other subjective assumptions. These assumptions include, but are not limited to, the expected term of stock options and our stock price volatility. The factors considered by our board of directors included the prices of known transactions in our common stock, the book value per share of our common stock, and our board of directors understanding of pricing multiples for comparable financial institutions that were not publicly traded. 
 The assumptions underlying these valuations represented management s best estimate, which involved inherent uncertainties and the application of management s judgment. As a result, if we had used different assumptions or estimates, the fair value of our common stock and our stock-based compensation expense could have been materially different. For more information and discussion related to stock-based compensation, see Note 15 Stock-based Compensation in the Consolidated Financial Statements. 
 Revenue Recognition 
 We record revenue from contracts with customers in accordance with ASU 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers Topic 606 ). Under Topic 606, the Company must identify the contract with a customer, identify the performance obligations in the contract, determine the transaction price, allocate the transaction price to the performance obligations in the contract and recognize revenue when (or as) the Company satisfies a performance obligation. Significant revenue has not been recognized in the current reporting period that results from performance obligations satisfied in previous periods. A large portion of the Company s revenue are derived from interest and fees earned on loans, investment securities and other financial instruments that are not within the scope of Topic 606. The Company generally fully satisfies its performance obligations on its contracts with customers as services are rendered and the transaction prices are typically 
 54 

Table of Contents 

 fixed, charged either on a periodic basis or based on activity. Because performance obligations are satisfied as services are rendered and the transaction prices are fixed, there is little judgment involved in applying Topic 606 that significantly affects the determination of the amount and timing of revenue from contracts with customers. 
 The recording of BaaS income and expense is dependent upon the contractual agreement with each partner, however in accordance with accounting guidance the recording of certain components of BaaS income are as follows: Agreements with many of our CCBX partners provide for a credit enhancement which protects the Bank by absorbing incurred losses. In accordance with accounting guidance, we estimate and record a provision for probable losses for these CCBX loans. When the provision for loan losses and provision for unfunded commitments is recorded, a credit enhancement asset is also recorded on the balance sheet through noninterest income (BaaS fees -credit enhancement). Incurred losses are recorded in the allowance for loan losses, the credit enhancement asset is relieved when credit enhancement recoveries are received from the CCBX partner. Many agreements with our CCBX partners also provide protection to the Bank from fraud by absorbing incurred fraud losses. Fraud losses are recorded when incurred in noninterest expense, and the recovery received from the CCBX partner is recorded in noninterest income, resulting in a net impact of zero to the income statement. Enhancements that provide protection to the Bank from credit and fraud losses, are not within the scope of Topic 606. 
 For the year ended December 31, 2022, noninterest income subject to Topic 606 increased 4.3 million to 18.2 million, compared to 13.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2021. The increase was largely due to an increase in BaaS fee income resulting from growth with active CCBX partners. For more information and discussion related to revenue recognition, see Note 19 Revenue Recognition in the Consolidated Financial Statements. 
 Emerging Growth Company 
 The Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act of 2012, (the JOBS Act permits an emerging growth company to take advantage of an extended transition period to comply with new or revised accounting standards applicable to public companies. However, we have decided not to take advantage of this provision. As a result, we will comply with new or revised accounting standards to the same extent that compliance is required for non-emerging growth companies. Our decision to opt out of the extended transition period under the JOBS Act is irrevocable. 
 
 Recent Pronouncements 
 For a discussion of the expected impact of accounting pronouncements recently adopted and accounting pronouncements recently issued but not yet adopted by us as of December 31, 2022, see Note 2 Recent Accounting Standards in the accompanying notes to our audited consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Report on Form 10-K. 
 
 Results of Operations 
 Net Income 
 Year Ended December 31, 2022, Compared to Year Ended December 31, 2021 . Net income for the year ended December 31, 2022 was 40.6 million, or 3.01 per diluted share, compared to 27.0 million, or 2.16 per diluted share, for the year ended December 31, 2021. The increase in net income over the prior year was attributable to a 92.3 million increase in net interest income, 96.6 million increase in noninterest income partially offset by a 103.5 million increase in noninterest expense and a 69.1 million increase in the provision for loan losses. 
 Net Interest Income 
 Year Ended December 31, 2022, Compared to Year Ended December 31, 2021 . Net interest income for the year ended December 31, 2022, was 171.8 million, compared to 79.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2021, an increase of 92.3 million, or 116.2 . Yield on loans receivable was 8.12 for the year ended December 31, 2022, compared to 4.86 for the year ended December 31, 2021. The increase in net interest income compared to the year ended December 31, 2021 was largely related to increased yield on loans from growth in higher yielding CCBX and community bank loans and interest rate increases on variable rate and new loans. Average loans receivable for the year ended December 31, 2022 was 2.26 billion, compared to 1.69 billion for the year ended December 31, 2021.

 Interest and fees on loans totaled 183.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2022 compared to 82.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2021. The 101.2 million increase in interest and fees on loans for the year ended December 31, 2022, compared to the year ended December 31, 2021, was largely due to increased yield on loans from growth in higher yielding CCBX loans and an overall increase in interest rates. Loan growth of 884.5 million, or 50.8 , for the year ended December 31, 2022, compared to December 31, 2021, includes a decrease of 107.1 million in PPP loans that were forgiven or repaid. CCBX average loans receivable grew to 742.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2022, compared to 146.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2021, an increase of 596.1 million, or 407.4 . Average CCBX yield of 13.85 was earned on CCBX loans for the year ended December 31, 2022, compared to 4.46 for the year ended December 31, 2021. CCBX yield does not include the impact of BaaS loan expense. BaaS loan expense represents the amount paid or payable to partners for credit enhancements, fraud enhancements and servicing CCBX loans. The tables later in this section illustrate the impact of BaaS loan expense on CCBX loan yield. Also impacting the increase in loan interest is the increase in interest rates on variable rate loans resulting from the FOMC raising rates 4.25 during the year ended December 31, 2022. We continue to monitor the impact of these increases in interest rates. 
 Interest income from interest earning deposits with other banks was 6.7 million at December 31, 2022, an increase of 6.1 million due to an increase in balances and higher interest rates, compared to December 31, 2021. The average balance of interest earning deposits invested with other banks for the year ended December 31, 2022 was 516.0 million, compared to 402.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2021. Additionally, the yield on these interest earning deposits with other banks increased 1.15 , compared to the year ended December 31, 2021. Interest income on investment securities increased to 1.7 million at December 31, 2022, compared to 79,000 at December 31, 2021. Average investment securities increased 63.2 million from 30.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2022 to 93.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2022, and average yield increased to 1.87 for the year ended December 31, 2022, compared to 0.26 for the year ended December 31, 2021. 
 Interest expense was 20.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2022, a 16.7 million increase from the year ended December 31, 2021. Interest expense on deposits was 19.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2022, compared to 2.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2021. The 16.7 million increase in interest expense on deposits was primarily due to an increase in average interest bearing deposits of 813.9 million. Interest on borrowed funds was 1.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2022, compared to 1.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2021. The 72,000 increase in interest expense on borrowed funds from the year ended December 31, 2021 is the result of a decrease in average PPPLF and FHLB borrowings, which were paid off in full during the quarter ended June 30, 2021 and March 31, 2022, respectively, partially offset by a 12.2 million average balance increase in subordinated debt, which increased during the year ended December 31, 2022. Interest expense is expected to increase as a result of the FOMC increasing the Fed Funds rate 4.25 during the year ended December 31, 2022. In addition, as a result of the FOMC rate increase, CCBX deposits that were below their floor to earn interest due to the low interest rate environment and were not earning interest were reclassified to interest bearing deposits from noninterest bearing deposits during the first and second quarters of 2022. We anticipate additional rate increases in 2023, which we expect will result in higher interest expense on interest bearing deposits which will be offset by higher interest rates on CCBX loans and excess cash invested in the Federal Reserve Bank or other banks. 
 Net interest margin was 5.97 for the year ended December 31, 2022, compared to 3.73 for the year ended December 31, 2021. Interest rate spread was 5.52 , and 3.54 for the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. The increase in net interest margin and spread compared to the year ended December 31, 2021 was largely a result of an increase in higher rate loans. Average loans increased 568.9 million, compared to the year ended December 31, 2021; the increase includes an average decrease in PPP loans of 340.3 million. Also contributing to the increase in net interest margin and spread compared to the year ended December 31, 2021 was a 113.9 million increase in average interest earning deposits invested in other banks. These interest earning deposits earned an average rate of 130 basis points for the year ended December 31, 2022, compared to an average rate of 15 basis points for the year ended December 31, 2021. 
 Cost of funds was 0.75 for the year ended December 31, 2022, compared to 0.18 for the year ended December 31, 2021. Cost of deposits for the year ended December 31, 2022 was 0.71 , which was a 59 basis point increase, from 0.12 for the year ended December 31, 2021. These increases were largely due to an increase in interest bearing deposits from CCBX and an increase in interest rates. CCBX deposit growth and the aforementioned reclassification of CCBX noninterest bearing deposits to interest bearing deposits significantly contributed to the increase in interest expense.

 Total yield on loans receivable for the year ended December 31, 2022 was 8.12 , compared to 4.86 for the year ended December 31, 2021. This increase in yield on loans receivable is primarily attributed to an increase in higher rate CCBX loans. As of the year ended December 31, 2022, average CCBX loans increased 596.1 million, or 407.4 , with an average CCBX yield of 13.85 , compared to 4.46 at December 31, 2021. CCBX yield does not include the impact of BaaS loan expense. BaaS loan expense represents the amount paid or payable to partners for credit enhancements, fraud enhancements and servicing CCBX loans. The tables later in this section illustrate the impact of BaaS loan expense on CCBX loan yield. There was a decrease in average community bank loans of 27.2 million, or 1.8 , which is attributed to an average 340.3 million decrease in PPP loans as a result of loan forgiveness and repayments, compared to the year ended December 31, 2021. Average yield on community bank loans for the year ended December 31, 2022 was 5.32 . compared to 4.90 for the year ended December 31, 2021. 
 The following tables show the average yield on loans and cost of deposits by segment and also illustrates the impact of BaaS loan expense on CCBX yield on loans:

 (1) CCBX yield on loans does not include the impact of BaaS loan expense. BaaS loan expense represents the amount paid or payable to partners for credit enhancements, fraud enhancements and servicing CCBX loans. To determine net BaaS loan income earned from CCBX loan relationships, the Company takes BaaS loan interest income and deducts BaaS loan expense to arrive at net BaaS loan income which can be compared to interest income on the Company s community bank loans.

 Provision for Loan Losses 
 The provision for loan losses is an expense we incur to maintain an allowance for loan losses at a level that is deemed appropriate by management to absorb inherent losses on existing loans. For a description of the factors taken into account by our management in determining the allowance for loan losses see Item 7. Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Operations Financial Condition Allowance for Loan Losses. 
 The economic environment is continuously changing, due to increased inflation, higher interest rates, global unrest, the war in Ukraine, the political environment and trade issues that may impact the provision and therefore the allowance. Gross loans, excluding loans held for sale, totaled 2.63 billion at December 31, 2022 and included 4.7 million in PPP loans, which are 100 guaranteed, and are excluded from the provision for loan losses calculation. The allowance for loan losses as a percentage of loans was 2.82 at December 31, 2022, compared to 1.64 at December 31, 2021. 
 Agreements with our CCBX partners provide for an indemnification of loan losses, also known as a credit enhancement, which protects the Bank by absorbing incurred losses. In accordance with accounting guidance, we estimate and record a provision for probable losses for CCBX loans and deposit overdrafts. When the provision for loan losses and provision for unfunded commitments is recorded, a credit enhancement asset is also recorded in other assets on the balance sheet through noninterest income (BaaS credit enhancements) in recognition of the CCBX partner legal commitment to cover the Bank s loan losses related to loans they originate on behalf of the Bank. Incurred loan losses are recorded in the allowance for loan losses, and as the credit enhancement obligations are received from the CCBX partner, the credit enhancement asset is relieved. 
 The Company adopted the Current Expected Credit Loss CECL accounting standard effective January 1, 2023. The CECL allowance model which calculates reserves over the life of the loan and is largely driven by portfolio

 characteristics, economic outlook, and other key methodology assumptions versus the current accounting practice that utilizes the incurred loss model. The adoption of this ASU will result in a one-time cumulative-effect adjustment to the allowance for loan losses as of the day of adoption. The Company currently estimates a combined increase to our allowance for credit losses and reserve for unfunded loan commitments of 3 to 10 . This change will decrease the opening retained earnings balance as of January 1, 2023. The above range is disclosed due to the fact that the Company is still in the process of finalizing the CECL allowance model, including the review of assumptions related to qualitative adjustments and economic forecasts; finalizing the execution of internal controls; and evaluating the impact to our financial statement disclosures. 
 Year Ended December 31, 2022, Compared to Year Ended December 31, 2021 . The provision for loan losses for the year ended December 31, 2022, was 79.1 million compared to 9.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2021. The increase in the Company s provision for loan losses during the year ended December 31, 2022, is largely related to the provision for CCBX partner loans. During the year ended December 31, 2022, a 78.3 million provision for loan losses was recorded for loans originated through CCBX partners based on management s analysis. The factors used in management s analysis for community bank loan losses indicated that a provision for loan loss of 719,000 was needed for the year ended December 31, 2022. 
 The 78.3 million provision on CCBX loans includes 76.9 million for partner loans with credit enhancement on them and 1.4 million is attributed to loans originated through one CCBX partner for which the Company is responsible for credit losses. In accordance with the program agreement and for one CCBX partner only, the Company is responsible for credit losses on approximately 10 of a 114.5 million loan portfolio, or 11.5 million of that loan portfolio at December 31, 2022.

Net charge-offs were up significantly in 2022 compared to 2021 due to CCBX partner loans. In 2022, 382,000 in net charge-offs were for the community bank and 33.3 million were for CCBX. In 2021, 172,000 were for the community bank and 373,000 of the charge-offs were for the CCBX.

 Noninterest Income 
 Our primary sources of recurring noninterest income are BaaS indemnification income, Baas program income and deposit service charges and fees. Noninterest income does not include loan origination fees, which are generally recognized over the life of the related loan as an adjustment to yield using the interest or similar method.

 A description of our largest noninterest income categories are below: 
 BaaS Fees. Our CCBX segment provides BaaS offerings that enable our broker-dealer and digital financial service providers to offer their customers banking services. In exchange for providing these services, we earn fixed fees, volume-based fees and reimbursement of costs depending on the program agreement. In accordance with GAAP, we recognize the reimbursement of noncredit fraud losses on loans and deposits originated through partners and credit enhancements related to the allowance for loan losses and reserve for unfunded commitments provided by the partner as revenue in BaaS income. CCBX credit losses are recognized in the allowance for loan loss and noncredit fraud losses are expensed in noninterest expense under BaaS fraud expense. Also in accordance with GAAP, we establish a credit enhancement asset for expected future loan losses through the recognition of BaaS credit enhancement revenue at the same time we establish an allowance for those loans though a provision for loan losses. For more information on the accounting for BaaS allowance for loan losses, reserve for unfunded commitments, credit enhancements and fraud enhancements see the section titled CCBX BaaS Reporting Information. 
 For the year ended December 31, 2022, we earned 118.9 million in BaaS fees, which was an increase of 101.6 million, or 586.9 , over the year ended December 31, 2021, where we earned 17.3 million in BaaS fees. The increase over the year ended December 31, 2021 was primarily due to an increase of 6.2 million in total BaaS fee program income, which was the result of increased relationships with broker dealers and digital financial service providers, 67.3 million in BaaS fees credit enhancements related to the allowance for loan losses and reserve for unfunded commitments, 28.1 million in BaaS fees fraud recovery, and 1.7 million increase in reimbursement of expenses.

 Our CCBX segment continues to evolve, and now has 27 relationships, at varying stages, as of December 31, 2022. As of December 31, 2022, we had 19 active relationships. We continue to refine the criteria for CCBX partnerships and are exiting relationships where it makes sense for both parties and are focusing on selecting larger and more established partners, with experienced management teams. We are winding down two partner relationships; these programs are not material in terms of income, deposits or loans.

 Deposit Service Charges and Fees. Deposit service charges and fees include service charges on accounts, point-of-sale fees, merchant services fees and overdraft fees. Together they constitute the largest component of our noninterest income, outside of BaaS fee income. Deposit service charges and fees were 3.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2022, an increase of 106,000, or 2.9 , over the prior year primarily due to increases in point-of-sale fees of 96,000 and service charges on deposit accounts of 58,000, partially offset by decreases in merchant services revenue of 60,000, ATM fees of 9,000, and overdraft fees of 6,000. NSF and overdraft fees were 310,000 for the year ended December 31, 2022, compared to 316,000 for the year ended December 31, 2021. During 2022 consumer overdraft fees were eliminated. Consumer overdraft fees are not a significant source of income, and the elimination of these fees will not have a significant impact on income.

 Loan Referral Fees . We earn loan referral fees when we originate a variable rate loan and the borrower enters into an interest rate swap agreement with a third party to fix the interest rate for an extended period, usually 20 or 25 years. We recognize the loan referral fee for arranging the interest rate swap. By facilitating interest rate swaps to our clients, we are able to provide them with a long-term, fixed interest rate without assuming the interest rate risk. Interest rate volatility, swap rates, and the timing of loan closings all impact the demand for long-term fixed rate swaps. The recognition of loan referral fees fluctuates in response to these market conditions and as a result we may recognize more or less, or may not recognize any, loan referral fees in some periods. Current market conditions are making interest rate swap agreements less attractive in the higher rate environment. Loan referral fees were 810,000 for the year ended December 31, 2022, a decrease of 1.3 million, or 61.9 , over the year ended December 31, 2021. Interest rate volatility, swap rates, and the timing of loan closings all impact the demand for long-term fixed rate swaps. 
 Mortgage Broker Fees . We earn mortgage broker fees for residential mortgage loans that we broker through mortgage lenders. Mortgage broker fees decreased 663,000, or 72.1 , for the year ended December 31, 2022 compared to the year ended December 31, 2021. The mortgage market is slowing down as a result of higher interest rates on mortgages. 
 Gain on Sale of Branch, net. The sale of our Freeland branch closed on April 30, 2021. Noninterest income included 1.3 million gain from sale of the branch in 2021, there was no similar income in 2022. 
 Gain on Sale of Loans, net . Gain on sales of loans occurs when we sell in the secondary market the guaranteed portion (generally 75 of the principal balance) of the SBA and USDA loans that we originate. This activity fluctuates based on SBA and USDA loan activity. Gain on sale of loans decreased 396,000, or 100.0 , to zero for the year ended December 31, 2022 compared to the prior year, due to decreased activity. 
 Unrealized gain (loss) on equity securities, net. During the year ended December 31, 2022, we recognized an unrealized loss on equity securities of 153,000, compared to the year ended December 31, 2021, when we recognized a 1.5 million unrealized holding gain on an equity security as a result of an observable price change. 
 Other. This category includes a variety of other income-producing activities, annuity broker fees, and SBA and USDA servicing fees. Other noninterest income increased 148,000, or 15.8 , for the year ended December 31, 2022 compared to the year ended December 31, 2021. 
 Noninterest Expense 
 Generally, noninterest expense is composed of all employee expenses and costs associated with operating our facilities, obtaining and retaining customer relationships and providing bank services. The largest components of noninterest expense are BaaS loan and fraud expense and salaries and employee benefits. Noninterest expense also includes operational expenses, such as legal and professional expenses, data processing and software licenses, occupancy, FDIC assessment, points of sale expense, excise taxes, director and staff expenses, marketing and other expenses. 
 For the year ended December 31, 2022, noninterest expense totaled 166.8 million, an increase of 103.5 million, or 163.6 , compared to 63.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2021. Noninterest expense, excluding BaaS loan and BaaS fraud expense totaled 83.9 million and increased 25.1 million or 42.7 .

 Salaries and Employee Benefits. Salaries and employee benefits are the largest component of noninterest expense excluding BaaS loan expense and include payroll expense, incentive compensation costs, benefit plans, health insurance and payroll taxes. Salaries and employee benefits were 52.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2022, an increase of 15.1 million, or 40.8 , compared to 37.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2021. The increase was primarily due to hiring staff for our CCBX segment and additional staff for our ongoing community bank related growth initiatives. As our CCBX segment grows, we expect to continue to add employees to support this line of business. As of December 31, 2022, we had 448 full-time equivalent employees, compared to 377 at December 31, 2021. 
 Occupancy Expenses. Occupancy expenses were 4.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2022, compared to 4.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2021, an increase of 420,000, or 10.2 . This category includes building, leasehold, furniture, fixtures and equipment depreciation totaling 1.8 million and 1.6 million for years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. The increase of 420,000 in occupancy expenses for 2022 compared to 2021, was primarily the result of 222,000 increase in depreciation expense, resulting from increased costs associated with the increase in FTE and growth in CCBX and 138,000 increase in maintenance and repairs expense. Occupancy expenses rent, utilities, janitorial and other maintenance expenses, property insurances and taxes. Also included is depreciation on building, leasehold, furniture, fixtures and equipment. Although our hybrid and remote workforce has increased, which helps keep some occupancy expenses down, we do expect occupancy expenses to increase as we continue to grow. 
 Legal and Professional Expenses. Legal and professional expenses include legal, audit and accounting expenses, consulting fees, fees for recruiting and hiring employees, and IT related security expenses. These expenses fluctuate with the development of contracts for CCBX customers, audit and accounting needs, and are impacted by our reporting cycle and timing of legal and professional services. Legal and professional expenses were 6.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2022 compared to 3.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2021, an increase of 3.6 million, or 115.8 . The increase in legal and professional expenses were primarily focused on building infrastructure for future growth. 
 Data Processing and Software Licenses. Data processing and s oftware licenses includes expenses related to obtaining and maintaining software required for our various functions. Data processing costs include all of our customer transaction processing and data storage, computer processing, and network costs. Data processing costs grow as we grow and add new products, customers and branches. Additionally, CCBX data processing expenses and software that aids in the reporting of CCBX activities and monitoring of transactions that helps to automate and create other efficiencies in reporting have resulted in increased expenses in the category. These expenses are expected to increase as we invest more in

 automated processing and as we grow product lines and our CCBX segment. Data processing costs were 6.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2022, compared to 5.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2021, an increase of 1.5 million, or 31.0 . 
 FDIC Assessments. FDIC assessments are assessed to fund the Deposit Insurance Fund DIF to insure and protect the depositors of insured banks and to resolve failed banks. The assessment rate is based on a number of factors and recalculated each quarter. As deposits increase, the FDIC assessment expense will generally increase. FDIC assessments were 2.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2022, compared to 1.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2021, an increase of 1.2 million, or 75.2 . Deposit growth in the community bank and CCBX contributed to this increase. On October 18, 2022 the FDIC finalized an increase of 2 basis points in the initial base deposit insurance assessment rates schedules. The rise is intended to increase the reserve ratio of the Deposit Insurance Fund, which was at 1.26 as of September 30, 2022, to 1.35 , the statutory requirement. The increase in the base rates will remain in place until the reserve ratio reaches or exceeds 2.0 . The increase will take effect in the first quarterly assessment period of 2023 and will increase the FDIC assessment expense for the Bank. 
 Excise Taxes. Excise taxes are assessed on Washington state income and are based on gross income. Gross income is reduced by certain allowed deductions and income attributed to other states is also removed to arrive at the taxable base. Excise taxes were 2.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2022, compared to 1.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2021, an increase of 615,000, or 38.7 . Excise taxes increased as a result of increased income subject to excise taxes. Partially offsetting that increase is a credit we received in 2022 against excise taxes owed in the amount of 109,000 as a result of our participation in the Washington State Main Street Program, which reduced our calculated 2022 expense. Excise taxes are based on gross income of 316.9 million and 111.2 million for the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. Gross income is reduced by certain allowed deductions to arrive at the taxable base; however, as gross income increases, so does the excise tax expense. 
 Director and Staff Expenses. Director and staff expenses includes compensation for director service, continuing education for employees and other director and staff related expenses. Director and staff expenses were 1.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2022 compared to 1.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2021, an increase of 506,000, or 42.0 . In 2022 we saw an increase in employee travel and training return to a more typical level after a year of reduced activity in 2021 as a result of restrictions related to the COVID-19 pandemic. 
 Marketing and promotion. Marketing and promotion costs were 351,000 for the year ended December 31, 2022, compared to 451,000 for the year ended December 31, 2021, a decrease of 100,000, or 22.2 . Marketing and promotion costs decreased because we are using more cost-effective advertising options; however, we expect to see advertising expenses increase as we deploy more branding and targeted advertising for the community bank and CCBX. 
 Other. This category includes dues and memberships, office supplies, mail services, telephone, examination fees, internal loan expenses, services charges from banks, operational losses, directors and officer s insurance, donations, provision for unfunded commitments, and miscellaneous other expenses. The provision for unfunded commitments has increased with the addition of CCBX loan partners. Other noninterest expense increased to 4.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2022, compared to 3.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2021, an increase of 731,000, or 18.6 . The increase was largely due to a 551,000 increase in dues and memberships and 91,000 increase in business development and overall increases resulting from growth for the year ended December 31, 2022, as compared to the same period last year. 
 BaaS loan and fraud expense. Our CCBX segment provides BaaS offerings that enable our broker dealer and digital financial service providers to offer their customers banking services. Included in BaaS loan and fraud expense is partner loan expense including overdraft balances and partner fraud expense. Partner loan expense represents the amount paid or payable to partners for credit enhancements, fraud enhancements and servicing CCBX loans. Partner fraud expense represents noncredit fraud losses on loans and deposits originated through partners. Fraud losses are recorded when incurred as losses in noninterest expense, and the reimbursement from the CCBX partner is recorded in noninterest income, resulting in a net impact of zero to the income statement. For the year ended December 31, 2022, BaaS loan and fraud expense was 82.9 million, compared to 4.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2021 as a result of increased partner activity. For more information on the accounting for BaaS loan and fraud expenses see the section titled CCBX BaaS Reporting Information.

 Income Tax Expense 
 The amount of income tax expense we incur is impacted by the amounts of our pre-tax income, tax-exempt income and other nondeductible expenses. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are reflected at current income tax rates in effect for the period in which the deferred tax assets and liabilities are expected to be realized or settled. As changes in tax laws or rates are enacted, deferred tax assets and liabilities are adjusted through the provision for income taxes. Valuation allowances are established when necessary to reduce our deferred tax assets to the amount expected to be realized. The Company is subject to various state taxes that are assessed as CCBX activities and employees expand into other states, which has increased the overall tax rate used in calculating the provision for income taxes in the current and future periods. On August 16, 2022, President Biden signed into law the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022, which, among other things, implements a new 15 corporate alternative minimum tax for certain large corporations, a 1 excise tax on stock buybacks, and several tax incentives to promote clean energy and climate initiatives. These provisions are effective beginning January 1, 2023. Based on its current analysis of the provisions, we do not expect this legislation to have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements. 
 Year Ended December 31, 2022, Compared to Year Ended December 31, 2021. For the year ended December 31, 2022, income tax expense totaled 10.0 million, compared to 7.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2021. Our effective tax rates for the years ended December 31, 2022, and 2021, was 19.7 and 21.4 , respectively. The effective tax rate was lower for 2022 due to an update in the state apportionment of the revenues in the states in which we operate combined with tax benefits that resulted from stock based compensation activity. 
 
 Segment Information 
 For financial reporting purposes our Company has two reportable segments: The community bank and CCBX, which has been determined based upon the Company's relationship with the end customer. This determination also gave consideration to the structure and management of our various products. The community bank segment includes the operations of the Bank, and excludes the CCBX BaaS operations. The community bank segment derives its revenue primarily from interest on loans and investments as well as noninterest income typical for the banking industry. The CCBX segment includes BaaS operations. The CCBX segment derives its revenue from BaaS partnerships that allow our broker-dealer and digital financial partners to offer their customers banking services such as loans and deposits. 
 Reported segments and the financial information of the reported segments are not necessarily comparable with similar information reported by other financial institutions. Additionally, because of the interrelationships of the various segments, the information presented is not indicative of how the segments would perform if they operated as independent entities. Changes in management structure or allocation methodologies and procedures may result in future changes to previously reported segment financial data. The accounting policies of the segments are the same as those described in Note 1 Description of Business and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies in the accompanying notes to the consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this report. 
 Community bank total assets as of December 31, 2022 decreased 184.6 million, or 8.1 , to 2.10 billion, compared to 2.28 billion as of December 31, 2021. Total community bank loans receivable increased 218.7 million, or 15.7 , to 1.61 billion as of December 31, 2022, compared to 1.40 billion as of December 31, 2021. The increase in loans receivable is the result of strong loans growth net of 107.1 million in PPP loan forgiveness and paydowns during the year ended December 31, 2022. Non-PPP community bank loan growth was 325.8 million, or 25.4 , as a result of increased loan activity. Total community bank deposits decreased 109.3 million, or 6.6 , to 1.54 billion, as of December 31, 2022, compared to 1.65 billion as of December 31, 2021. The decrease in deposits is largely due our decision to let some deposits runoff instead of retaining them based on price. The overall increase in deposits was achieved

 despite a decrease of 25.6 million in total deposits due to the sale of our Freeland branch, which were included in the total deposits as of December 31, 2021. 
 Net interest income for the community bank was 85.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2022, an increase of 12.1 million, or 16.5 , compared to 73.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2021. The increase in net interest income is largely due to loan growth and increased interest rates on new and variable rate loans. Provision for loan losses was 719,000 for the year ended December 31, 2022, compared to 1.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2021. The provision for loan losses was increased in 2021 as a result of economic uncertainties of the COVID-19 pandemic and loan growth, however losses have not realized as anticipated. Noninterest income for the community bank was 5.7 million, for the year ended December 31, 2022, a decrease of 5.1 million, or 47.2 , compared to 10.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2021 In 2021, there was a 1.5 million unrealized holding gain on an equity investment and 1.3 million gain on sale of a branch, compared to 153,000 unrealized loss on equity securities, no gain on sale of branch and 1.3 million less in loan referral fees in 2022. Noninterest expenses for the community bank increased 12.6 million, or 24.4 , to 64.1 million as of December 31, 2022, compared to 51.5 million as of December 31, 2021. The increase in noninterest expense is largely due to increased salaries and employee benefits as a result of growth, higher software licenses maintenance and subscription costs related to new reporting software that helps to automate and create efficiencies in reporting, and other expense increases related to growth. 
 CCBX total assets as of December 31, 2022 increased 693.6 million, or 196.5 , to 1.05 billion, compared to 353.0 million as of December 31, 2021. Total CCBX loans receivable increased 665.8 million, or 192.1 , to 1.01 billion as of December 31, 2022, compared to 346.7 million as of December 31, 2021. The increase in loans receivable is the result of growth in CCBX relationships. CCBX allowance for loan losses increased to 53.4 million as of December 31, 2022, compared to 8.3 million as of December 31, 2021 as a result of loan growth and portfolio mix. Total CCBX deposits increased 563.0 million, or 78.6 , to 1.28 billion, compared to 716.3 million as of December 31, 2021 as a result of growth in CCBX. 
 Included in noninterest expense for the community bank is administrative overhead of 27.2 million and 19.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2022 and December 31, 2021, respectively. Both the community bank and the CCBX segment benefit from this administrative overhead and services, which includes shared operational activities such as data management, compliance monitoring and other administration functions. 
 Net interest income for CCBX was 86.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2022, an increase of 80.3 million, or 1,247.7 , compared to 6.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2021. The increase in net interest income is due to loan growth from CCBX relationships. Provision for loan losses was 78.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2022, compared to 8.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2021, as a result of loan growth from CCBX partners. Noninterest income for CCBX was 119.0 million, for the year ended December 31, 2022, an increase of 101.6 million, or 583.9 , compared to 17.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2021, due to an increase of 6.2 million in BaaS fee program income, which was the result of increased activity with broker dealers and digital financial service providers, 67.3 million in BaaS fees credit enhancements related to the allowance for loan losses and reserve for unfunded commitments, and 28.1 million in BaaS fees fraud enhancements. Noninterest expenses for CCBX increased 90.9 million, or 776.2 , to 102.7 million as of December 31, 2022, compared to 11.7 million as of December 31, 2021. The increase in noninterest expense is largely due to an increase in BaaS loan expense, BaaS fraud expense and increased salaries and benefits, for the year ended December 31, 2022, compared to the year ended December 31, 2021. For more information on the accounting for BaaS income and expenses see the section titled CCBX BaaS Reporting Information. .

 Financial Condition 
 Our total assets increased 509.0 million to 3.14 billion, or 19.3 at December 31, 2022, compared to 2.64 billion at December 31, 2021. This increase was largely the result of a 884.5 million increase in loans receivable, combined with a decrease of 489.2 million in interest earning deposits with other banks. 
 Loans Held For Sale 
 During the year ended December 31, 2022, 152.5 million in CCBX loans were transferred to loans held for sale, with 152.5 million in loans sold, at par, during the year ended December 31, 2022 and zero remaining in loans held for sale as of December 31, 2022. 
 Loan Portfolio 
 Our primary source of income is derived through interest earned on loans. A substantial portion of our loan portfolio consists of commercial real estate loans and commercial and industrial loans primarily in the Puget Sound region. Our consumer and other loans also represent a significant portion of our loan portfolio with the growth of our CCBX segment. Our loan portfolio represents the highest yielding component of our earning assets. 
 As of December 31, 2022, loans receivable totaled 2.63 billion, an increase of 884.5 million, or 50.8 , compared to December 31, 2021. Total loans receivable is net of 6.1 million in net deferred origination fees, 82,000 of which is attributed to PPP loans. The increase includes CCBX loan growth of 665.8 million, or 192.1 , and community bank loan growth of 215.9 million, or 15.4 , which includes a 107.1 million, or 95.8 , reduction in PPP loans due to forgiveness and principal paydowns. Additionally, unused loan commitments increased including unused commitments on capital call lines which increased 356.8 million to 772.7 million at December 31, 2022, compared to 416.0 million at December 31, 2021, which may translate into loan growth as the commitments are utilized. 
 Loans as a percentage of deposits were 93.2 as of December 31, 2022, compared to 73.7 as of December 31, 2021. We remain focused on serving our communities and markets by growing loans and funding those loans with customer deposits. The increase in the loan to deposit ratio was due to loan growth.

 (1) CCBX yield does not include the impact of BaaS loan expense. BaaS loan expense represents the amount paid or payable to partners for credit enhancements, fraud enhancements and servicing CCBX loans. To determine net BaaS loan income earned from CCBX loan relationships, the Company takes BaaS loan interest income and deducts BaaS loan expense to arrive at net BaaS loan income which can be compared to interest income on the Company s community bank loans. Net BaaS loan income is a non-GAAP measure. See the reconciliation of non-GAAP measures set forth in the section titled GAAP Reconciliation and Management Explanation of Non-GAAP Financial Measures for the impact of BaaS loan expense on CCBX yield. 
 Commercial and Industrial Loans . Commercial and industrial loans decreased 106.4 million, or 25.4 , to 312.6 million as of December 31, 2022, from 419.1 million as of December 31, 2021. The decrease in commercial and industrial loans receivable over December 31, 2021 was due to 107.1 million in forgiven and repaid PPP loans and a decrease of 56.9 million in capital call lines, partially offset by a 57.5 million increase in other commercial and industrial loans. Included in the commercial and industrial loan balance is 146.0 million and 202.9 million in capital call lines resulting from relationships with our CCBX partners as of December 31, 2022, and December 31, 2021, respectively. As of December 31, 2022, there were 14.9 million in CCBX other commercial loans, compared to zero at December 31, 2021. 
 Commercial and industrial loans are underwritten after evaluating and understanding the borrower s ability to operate profitably and effectively. These loans are primarily made based on the borrower s ability to service the debt from

 income. Most commercial and industrial loans are secured by the assets being financed or other business assets, such as accounts receivable, inventory or equipment, and we generally obtain personal guarantees on these loans. Commercial and industrial loans includes 45.1 million and 20.2 million in loans to financial institutions as of December 31, 2022, and December 31, 2021, respectively. 
 Also included in commercial and industrial loans is 4.7 million and 111.8 million in PPP loans as of December 31, 2022, and December 31, 2021, respectively. As of December 31, 2022, 4.7 million in PPP loans remained with 82,000 in net deferred fees, which will be recognized in interest income in future periods. The impact of PPP loans on the Company s financial statements has significantly decreased as nearly all of the PPP loans have been paid off and/or forgiven. 
 Construction, Land and Land Development Loans . Construction, land and land development loans increased 30.5 million, or 16.6 , to 214.1 million as of December 31, 2022, from 183.6 million as of December 31, 2021. The increase is attributed to growth in community bank primarily for commercial construction and some land and land development loans. 
 Unfunded loan commitments for construction, land and land development loans were 142.5 million at December 31, 2022, compared to 134.3 million at December 31, 2021. Although we have seen a strong commercial and residential real estate market in the Puget Sound region thus far in 2022, the economic environment is continuously changing and is impacted by increased inflation, higher interest rates, global unrest, the war in Ukraine, the political environment and trade issues that have resulted in some economic uncertainty and slowing in construction lending. 
 Construction, land and land development loans are comprised of loans to fund construction, land acquisition and land development construction. The properties securing these loans are primarily located in the Puget Sound region and are comprised of both residential and commercial properties, including owner occupied properties and investor properties. As of December 31, 2022, construction, land and land development loans included 100.7 million in commercial construction loans, 44.6 million in undeveloped land loans, 32.9 million in residential construction loans and 35.9 million in other construction, land and land development loans, compared to 82.8 million in commercial construction loans, 37.8 million in undeveloped land loans, 28.9 million in residential construction loans and 34.1 million in other construction, land and land development loans as of December 31, 2021. 
 Residential Real Estate Loans . Our one-to-four family residential real estate loans increased 244.8 million, or 119.8 , to 449.2 million as of December 31, 2022, from 204.4 million as of December 31, 2021 largely due to an increase of 207.7 million in CCBX loans. CCBX home equity lines of credit are secured by residential real estate and are accessed by using a credit card. 
 We originate one-to-four family residential real estate adjustable-rate mortgage ARM ), loans for our portfolio and operate as a mortgage broker for mortgage lenders we have agreements with for customers who want a 15-year to 30-year, fixed-rate mortgage loan. As of December 31, 2022, the balance of our ARM portfolio loans was 28.0 million, compared to 22.2 million at December 31, 2021. Our ARM loans typically do not meet the guidelines for sale in the secondary market due to characteristics of the property, the loan terms or exceptions from agency underwriting guidelines, which enables us to earn a higher interest rate. We also purchase residential mortgages originated through other financial institutions to hold for investment with the intent to diversify our residential mortgage loan portfolio, meet certain regulatory requirements and increase our interest income. We last purchased residential mortgage loans in 2018. As of December 31, 2022, we held 9.4 million in purchased residential real estate mortgage loans, compared to 11.9 million at December 31, 2021. These purchased loans typically are variable rate and are collateralized by one-to-four family residential real estate. We have a defined set of credit guidelines that we use when evaluating these loans. Although purchased loans were originated and underwritten by another institution, our mortgage, credit, and compliance departments conduct an independent review of each underlying loan that includes re-underwriting each of these loans to our credit and compliance standards. We also make one-to-four family loans to investors to finance their rental properties and to business owners to secure their business loans. As of December 31, 2022, residential real estate loans made to investors and business owners totaled 140.7 million. As of December 31, 2021, residential real estate loans made to investors and business owners totaled 114.0 million. 
 As of December 31, 2022, there were 244.6 million in CCBX home equity loans included in residential real estate, compared to 36.9 million at December 31, 2021, as a result of increased activity. These home equity lines of credit are secured by residential real estate and are accessed by using a credit card. 
 Like our commercial real estate loans, our residential real estate loans are secured by real estate, the value of which may fluctuate significantly over a short period of time as a result of market conditions in the area in which the real estate is

Adverse developments affecting real estate values in our market areas could therefore increase the credit risk associated with these loans, impair the value of property pledged as collateral on loans, and affect our ability to sell the collateral upon foreclosure without a loss or additional losses. 
 Commercial Real Estate Loans . Commercial real estate loans increased 213.2 million, or 25.5 , to 1.05 billion as of December 31, 2022, from 835.6 million as of December 31, 2021. 
 These increases, which occurred across the various segments of our portfolio, were due to our commitment to continue growing the portfolio in the Puget Sound region. We actively seek commercial real estate loans in our markets and our lenders are experienced in competing for these loans and managing these relationships. 
 We make commercial mortgage loans collateralized by owner-occupied and non-owner-occupied real estate, as well as multi-family residential loans. The real estate securing our existing commercial real estate loans includes a wide variety of property types, such as manufacturing and processing facilities, business parks, warehouses, retail centers, convenience stores, hotels and motels, office buildings, mixed-use residential and commercial, and other properties. We originate both fixed- and adjustable-rate loans with terms up to 20 years. Fixed-rate loans typically amortize over a 10 to 25 year period with balloon payments due at the end of five to ten years. Adjustable-rate loans are generally based on the prime rate and adjust with the prime rate or are based on term equivalent FHLB rates. At December 31, 2022, approximately 30.5 of the commercial real estate loan portfolio consisted of fixed rate loans. Commercial real estate loans represented 39.8 of our loan portfolio at December 31, 2022 and are historically our largest source of revenue. As of December 31, 2022, we held 42.4 million in purchased commercial real estate loans, compared to 35.9 million at December 31, 2021. Our credit administration team has substantial experience in underwriting, managing, monitoring and working out commercial real estate loans, and remains diligent in communicating and proactively working with borrowers to help mitigate potential credit deterioration. 
 Consumer and Other Loans . Consumer and other loans increased 499.9 million, or 459.2 , to 608.8 million, from 108.9 million as of December 31, 2021, as a result of growth in CCBX loans originated through our partners. 
 CCBX consumer loans totaled 607.0 million as of December 31, 2022, compared to 106.8 million at December 31, 2021. CCBX consumer loans include installment loans, credit cards, lines of credit and other loans. Our community bank consumer and other loans totaled 1.7 million as of December 31, 2022, compared to 2.0 million at December 31, 2021 and are comprised of personal lines of credit, automobile, boat, and recreational vehicle loans, and secured term loans.

 Nonperforming Assets 
 Loans are considered past due if the required principal and interest payments have not been received as of the date such payments were due. Loans are placed on nonaccrual status when, in management s opinion, the borrower may be unable to meet payment obligations as they become due, as well as when required by applicable regulations. Loans may be placed on nonaccrual status regardless of whether or not such loans are considered past due. In general, we place loans on nonaccrual status when they become 90 days past due. We also place loans on nonaccrual status if they are less than 90 days past due if the collection of principal or interest is in doubt. Installment (closed end) consumer loans and revolving (open-ended loans, such as credit cards) originated through CCBX partners continue to accrue interest until they are charged-off at 120 days past due for installment loans (primarily unsecured loans to consumers) and 180 days past due for revolving loans (primarily credit cards). These consumer loans are reported out as substandard loans, 90+ days past due and still accruing. As a result of the type of loans (primarily consumer loans) originated through our CCBX partners, we anticipate that balances 90 days past due or more and still accruing will increase as those loans grow. When loans are placed on nonaccrual status, all unpaid accrued interest is reversed from income and all interest accruals are stopped. Interest income is subsequently recognized only to the extent cash payments are received in excess of principal balance. Loans are returned to accrual status if we believe that all remaining principal and interest is fully collectible and there has been at least six months of sustained repayment performance since the loan was placed on nonaccrual status. We define nonperforming loans as loans on nonaccrual status and accruing loans 90 days or more past due. Nonperforming assets also include other real estate owned and repossessed assets. 
 We believe our lending practices and active approach to managing nonperforming assets has resulted in sound asset quality and timely resolution of problem assets. We have procedures in place to assist us in maintaining the overall credit quality of our loan portfolio. We have established underwriting guidelines, concentration limits and we also monitor our delinquency levels for any negative or adverse trends. We actively manage problem assets to reduce our risk for loss. 
 
 We had 33.2 million in nonperforming assets as of December 31, 2022, compared to 1.7 million as of December 31, 2021. This includes 26.1 million in CCBX loans more than 90 days past due and still accruing interest as of December 31, 2022, compared to 1.5 million at December 31, 2021. All of our nonperforming assets were nonperforming loans as of December 31, 2022 and December 31, 2021. Our nonperforming loans to loans receivable ratio was 1.26 at December 31, 2022, compared to 0.10 at December 31, 2021. The increase in nonperforming assets was due to a 24.6 million increase in CCBX partner loans that are 90 days or more past due and still accruing interest. Community bank nonaccrual loans increased 6.9 million during the year ended December 31, 2022 primarily due to the addition of one new nonaccrual loan partially offset by other nonaccrual principal reductions/charge-offs. The 6.9 million nonaccrual balance in commercial real estate loans shown below consists of one loan, is well secured with an original loan to value ratio of 62 , and an updated loan to value ratio of 75 as of January 2023. Management anticipates this loan being resolved in the first half of 2023. 
 Our community bank credit quality remains strong, as demonstrated by the low level of community bank charge-offs and nonperforming loan balance for the year ended December 31, 2022. CCBX loans have a higher level of expected losses than our community bank loans, which is reflected in the factors for the allowance for loan losses. Agreements with our CCBX partners provide for a credit enhancement which protects the Bank by absorbing incurred losses. Consumer loans originated through CCBX partners are charged-off at 120 days past due for installment loans (primarily unsecured loans to consumers) and 180 days past due for revolving loans (primarily credit cards).

 Potential Problem Loans 
 From a credit risk standpoint, we classify most categories of our loans in one of five categories: pass, other loans especially mentioned, substandard, doubtful or loss. Within the pass category, we classify loans into one of the following five subcategories based on perceived credit risk, including repayment capacity and collateral security: minimal risk, low risk, modest risk, average risk and acceptable risk. For consumer loans we follow the uniform retail credit classification approach, where we classify loans into three categories: pass, substandard (over 90 days and still accruing) and loss (installment/closed-end, and revolving/open-end consumer loans originated through CCBX lending partners more than 120 and 180 days past due, respectively). The classifications of loans reflect a judgment about the risks of default and loss given default. We review the risk ratings of our credits on an annual basis, or more frequently if circumstances warrant. Risk ratings are adjusted to reflect the degree of risk and loss that is believed to be inherent in each credit as of each monthly reporting period. Our methodology is structured so that specific reserve allocations are increased in accordance with deterioration in credit quality (and a corresponding increase in risk and loss) or decreased in accordance with improvement in credit quality (and a corresponding decrease in risk and loss). 
 Credits rated as other loans especially mentioned show clear signs of financial weaknesses or deterioration in creditworthiness; however, such concerns are not so pronounced that we generally expect to experience significant loss within the short-term. Such credits typically maintain the ability to perform within standard credit terms and credit exposure is not as prominent as credits with a lower rating. 
 Credits rated as substandard are those in which the normal repayment of principal and interest may be, or has been, jeopardized by reason of adverse trends or developments of a financial, managerial, economic or political nature, or important weaknesses in the collateral for the loan. A protracted workout on these credits is a distinct possibility. Prompt corrective action is therefore required to reduce exposure and to assure that adequate remedial measures are taken by the borrower. Credit exposure becomes more likely in such credits and a serious evaluation of the secondary support to the credit is performed. 
 Credits rated as doubtful have weaknesses of substandard assets that are sufficient to make collection or liquidation in full questionable and there is a high probability of loss based on currently existing facts, conditions and values. 
 Credits rated as loss are charged-off. We have no expectation of the recovery of any payments in respect of credits rated as loss. 
 CCBX credits are rated following the uniform retail credit classification approach, where we classify loans into three categories: pass, substandard (over 90 days and still accruing) and loss (installment/closed-end, and revolving/open-end consumer loans originated through CCBX lending partners more than 120 and 180 days past due, respectively). Installment/closed-end, and revolving/open-end consumer loans originated through CCBX lending partners will continue to accrue interest until 120 and 180 days past due, respectively and an

 allowance is recorded through provision expense for these probable incurred losses. For installment/closed-end and revolving/open-end consumer loans originated through CCBX lending partners with balances outstanding beyond 120 days and 180 days, respectively, principal and capitalized interest outstanding is charged off against the allowance and accrued interest outstanding is reversed against interest income.

 Allowance for Loan Losses 
 We maintain an allowance for loan losses that represents management s best estimate of the loan losses and risks inherent in our loan portfolio. The amount of the allowance for loan losses should not be interpreted as an indication that charge-offs in future periods will necessarily occur in those amounts. In determining the allowance for loan losses, we estimate losses on specific loans, or groups of loans, where the probable loss can be identified and reasonably determined. The balance of the allowance for loan losses is based on internally assigned risk classifications of loans, historical loan loss rates, changes in the nature of our loan portfolio, overall portfolio quality, industry concentrations, delinquency trends, and current economic factors. See Critical Accounting Policies Allowance for Loan Losses.

Table of Contents 

 In connection with our allowance for loan loss review, we consider risk elements applicable to particular loan types or categories in assessing the quality of individual loans. Some of the risk elements we consider include: 
 for commercial and industrial loans, the debt service coverage ratio (income from the business in excess of operating expenses compared to loan repayment requirements), the operating results of the commercial, professional or agricultural enterprise, the borrower s business, professional and financial ability and expertise, the specific risks and volatility of income and operating results typical for businesses in that category and the value, nature and marketability of collateral; 
 for commercial real estate loans, the debt service coverage ratio, operating results of the owner in the case of owner-occupied properties, the loan-to-value ratio, the age and condition of the collateral and the volatility of income, property value and future operating results typical of properties of that type; 
 for residential real estate loans, the borrower s ability to repay the loan, including a consideration of the debt-to-income ratio and employment and income stability, the loan-to-value ratio, and the age, condition and marketability of the collateral; and 
 for construction, land and land development loans, the perceived market feasibility of the project including the ability to sell developed lots or improvements constructed for resale or the ability to lease property constructed for lease, the quality and nature of contracts for presale or prelease, if any, experience and ability of the developer and loan-to-value ratio. 
 for consumer and other loans, the borrower s ability to repay the loan, including a consideration of delinquency status, consumer credit scores, debt-to-income ratio and employment and income stability, and loan-to-value ratios, as applicable. 
 As of December 31, 2022, the allowance for loan losses totaled 74.0 million, or 2.82 of total loans. As of December 31, 2021, the allowance for loan losses totaled 28.6 million, or 1.64 of total loans. The increase in the Company s allowance for loan losses for the year ended December 31, 2022 compared to December 31, 2021, is largely related to the provision for CCBX partner loans. During the year ended December 31, 2022, a 78.3 million provision for loan losses was recorded for CCBX partner loans based on management s analysis. The factors used in management s analysis for community bank loan losses indicated that a provision for loan losses of 719,000 was needed for the year ended December 31, 2022. The economic environment is continuously changing with increased inflation, higher interest rates, global unrest, the war in Ukraine, the political environment and trade issues that have resulted in some economic uncertainty. As described above, CCBX loans have a higher level of expected losses than our community bank loans, which is reflected in the factors for the allowance for loan losses. 
 Agreements with our CCBX partners provide for a credit enhancement provided by the partner which protects the Bank by absorbing incurred losses. In accordance with accounting guidance, we estimate and record a provision for probable losses for these CCBX loans and negative deposit accounts. When the provision for loan losses and provision for unfunded commitments is recorded, a credit enhancement asset is also recorded on the balance sheet through noninterest income (BaaS credit enhancements) in recognition of the CCBX partner's legal commitment to cover losses. The credit enhancement asset is relieved as credit enhancement recoveries are received from the CCBX partner. CCBX partners also pledge a cash reserve account at the Bank which the Bank can collect from when losses occur that is then replenished by the partner on a regular interval. Although agreements with our CCBX partners provide for credit enhancements that provide protection to the Bank from credit losses by absorbing incurred credit losses, if our partner is unable to fulfill its contracted obligations to replenish its cash reserve account then the Bank would be exposed to additional loan and deposit losses, as a result of this counterparty risk. If a CCBX partner does not replenish their cash reserve account then the Bank can declare the agreement in default, take over servicing and cease paying the partner for servicing the loan and providing credit enhancements. The Bank would write-off any remaining receivable from the CCBX partner but would retain the full yield on the loan going forward, and BaaS loan expense would decrease once default occurred and payments to the CCBX partner were stopped. The Company adopted the CECL accounting standard effective January 1, 2023 and accounted for the allowance for credit losses under the incurred loss model at December 31, 2022 and for prior periods.

 The allowance for loan losses to nonaccrual loans ratio decreased as of December 31, 2022, compared to December 31, 2021 as a result of an increase of 6.9 million in nonaccrual community bank loans, combined with an increase of 45.4 million in the allowance for loan losses. The decrease in the allowance to nonperforming loans ratio is due to an increase in CCBX loans 90+ days past due and accruing as a result of growth in the CCBX loan portfolio. The increase in the allowance for loan losses for the year ended December 31, 2022 compared to the year ended December 31, 2021, is largely related to the increase in the allowance for loans originated through our CCBX partners. CCBX partner agreements provide for, and the Company has collected in full, credit enhancements that cover the 33.3 million in net-charge-offs on CCBX loans for the year ended December 31, 2022. At December 31, 2022, the allowance for loan losses for CCBX partner loans totaled 53.4 million, compared to 8.3 million at December 31, 2021 .

 Year Ended December 31, 2022 December 31, 2021 (dollars in thousands; unaudited) Community Bank CCBX Total Community Bank CCBX Total Gross charge-offs 428 33,321 33,749 255 385 640 Gross recoveries (46) (36) (82) (83) (12) (95) Net charge-offs 382 33,285 33,667 172 373 545 Net charge-offs to average loans 0.03 4.48 1.49 0.01 0.25 0.03 
 Although we believe that we have established our allowance for loan losses in accordance with GAAP and that the allowance for loan losses was adequate to provide for known and inherent losses in the portfolio at all times shown above, future provisions for loan losses will be subject to ongoing evaluations of the risks in our loan portfolio. We have not seen an increase in community bank loan losses due to COVID-19 as originally anticipated, as evidenced by the low level of charge-offs and nonperforming loans, however, the economic environment is continuously changing with increased inflation, higher interest rates, global unrest, the war in Ukraine, the political environment and trade issues that have resulted in some economic uncertainty. If economic conditions worsen then the U.S., Washington state and Puget Sound region may experience a more severe economic downturn, and our asset quality could deteriorate, which may require material additional provisions for loan losses. 
 The following table shows the allocation of the allowance for loan losses among loan categories and certain other information as of the dates indicated. The allocation of the allowance for loan losses as shown in the table should neither be interpreted as an indication of future charge-offs, nor as an indication that charge-offs in future periods will necessarily occur in these amounts or in the indicated proportions. The total allowance is available to absorb losses from any loan category.

 Securities 
 We use our securities portfolio primarily as a source of liquidity and collateral that can be readily sold or pledged for public deposits or other business purposes. At December 31, 2022, 98.7 of our investment portfolio consisted primarily of U.S. Treasury securities. The remainder of our securities portfolio was invested in municipal bonds, U.S. Agency collateralized mortgage obligations and U.S. Agency residential mortgage-backed securities. Because we target a loan-to-deposit ratio in the range of 90 to 100 , we prioritize liquidity over the earnings of our securities portfolio. At December 31, 2022, our loan-to-deposit ratio was 93.2 due to our significant growth in both loans and deposits. Our securities portfolio represented less than 5 of assets. To the extent our securities represent more than 5 of assets, absent an immediate need for liquidity, we anticipate investing excess funds to provide a higher return.

 As of December 31, 2022, the amortized cost of our investment securities totaled 101.3 million, an increase of 64.7 million, or 176.7 , compared to 36.6 million as of December 31, 2021. The increase in the securities portfolio was due to the purchase of five Treasury securities for 135.0 million during the year ended December 31, 2022, to invest excess funds, replace maturing securities and pledge to secure public deposits and for other purposes as required or permitted by law, partially offset by 70.0 million in U.S. Treasury maturities and other principal paydowns. 
 Our investment portfolio consists of securities classified as available for sale and, to a lesser amount, held to maturity. The carrying values of our investment securities classified as available for sale are adjusted for unrealized gain or loss, and any gain or loss is reported on an after-tax basis as a component of other comprehensive income in shareholders equity. As of December 31, 2022, our available for sale portfolio has an unrealized loss of 3.0 million, compared to an unrealized loss of 38,000 as of December 31, 2021. 
 The following table summarizes the amortized cost and estimated fair value of certain of our investment securities as of the dates shown:

 All of our U.S. Agency residential mortgage-backed securities and U.S. Agency collateralized mortgage obligations are U.S. Government agency securities. As of December 31, 2022, we did not hold any Fannie Mae or Freddie Mac preferred stock, collateralized debt obligations, collateralized loan obligations, structured investment vehicles, private label collateralized mortgage obligations, subprime, or second lien elements in our investment portfolio. 
 Our management evaluates securities for other-than-temporary impairment on at least a quarterly basis, and more frequently when economic or market conditions warrant such an evaluation. 
 As of December 31, 2022 and 2021, we did not own securities of any one issuer, other than the U.S. Government and its agencies, for which aggregate adjusted cost exceeded 10.0 of consolidated shareholders equity. 
 Restricted equity securities totaled 7.5 million as of December 31, 2022 and 6.0 million as of December 31, 2021 The increase was attributable to net additions of Federal Reserve and FHLB stock. Federal Reserve and FHLB stock are carried at par and do not have a readily determinable fair value. Ownership of FHLB stock is restricted to the FHLB and member institutions, and can only be purchased and redeemed at par. 
 The Company has the following equity investments which do not have a readily determinable fair value and are held at cost minus impairment if any, plus or minus observable price changes in orderly transactions for an identical or similar investment of the same issuer. This method will be applied until the investments do not qualify for the measurement election (e.g., if the investment has a readily determinable fair value). The Company will reassess at each reporting period whether the equity investments without a readily determinable fair value qualifies to be measured at cost minus impairment. 
 As of December 31, 2022 and December 31, 2021 the Company held a 2.2 million equity interest in a specialized bank technology company which consists of 1.6 million shares of common stock and 873,853 preferred shares. During the year ended December 31, 2021, the Company reassessed the value and recognized a 1.5 million unrealized holding gain as a

 result of an observable price change. During the year ended 2022, the Company reviewed the carrying value of 2.2 million and determined it was still the appropriate carrying value. 
 During the year ended December 31, 2022, the Company re-evaluated the value on a 500,000 equity investment in a technology company and recorded an impairment of 100,000. This equity investment consists of 9,000 shares of stock and is carried at cost less impairment, which approximates its fair value. 
 Additionally, the Company contributed 350,000 in a technology company during the year ended December 31, 2022. There was no equity ownership in this company as of December 31, 2021. 
 The Company invests in investment funds that are designed to help accelerate technology adoption at banks and has invested in three separate funds. These funds are carried at fair value as reported by the funds During the year ended December 31, 2022, the Company contributed 349,000 with investment funds designed to help accelerate technology adoption at banks, and recognized losses of 53,000, resulting in an equity interest of 456,000 at December 31, 2022. The Company has committed up to 988,000 in capital for these investment funds, however, the Company is not obligated to fund these commitments prior to a capital call. 
 The following table sets forth the amortized cost of held to maturity securities and the fair value of available for sale securities, maturities and approximated weighted average yield based on estimated annual income divided by the average amortized cost of our securities portfolio as of the dates indicated. The contractual maturity of a mortgage-backed security is the date at which the last underlying mortgage matures.

 Deposits 
 We offer a variety of deposit products that have a wide range of interest rates and terms, including demand, money market, savings, and time accounts as well as reciprocal deposits. Reciprocal deposits enable us to provide an FDIC insured deposit option to customers that have balances in excess of the FDIC insurance limit. This service trades our customers funds as certificates of deposit or interest bearing demand deposits in increments under the FDIC insured amount to other participating financial institutions and in exchange we receive time deposit or interest bearing demand investments from participating financial institutions in a reciprocal agreement. We rely primarily on competitive pricing policies, convenient locations, electronic delivery channels (internet and mobile), and personalized service to attract new deposits and retain existing deposits. Additionally, we offer deposit products through our CCBX segment. CCBX deposits are generally classified as interest bearing negotiable order of withdrawal NOW and money market accounts, and a portion of such CCBX deposits may be classified as brokered deposits as a result of the relationship agreement. CCBX deposit products allow us to offer a broader range of partner specific products, which include products designed to reach specific under-served or under-banked populations served by our CCBX partners. 
 Total deposits as of December 31, 2022 were 2.82 billion, an increase of 453.7 million, or 19.2 , compared to 2.36 billion as of December 31, 2021. The increase in deposits was largely in core deposits, which increased 437.0 million to 2.69 billion from 2.25 billion at December 31, 2021. We define core deposits as all deposits except time deposits and brokered deposits. The 437.0 million increase in core deposits is also largely from growth in the CCBX segment, which accounted for 532.3 million of the increase, partially offset by a decrease of 95.3 million in community bank deposits. Additionally, as of December 31, 2022 we have access to 225.0 million in CCBX customer deposits that are currently being transferred from the Bank s balance sheet to other financial institutions on a daily basis. Depending on the circumstances of how the Bank would retain these deposits and its relationship with the customer, these retained deposits could be classified as brokered deposits. 
 Included in total deposits is 1.28 billion in CCBX deposits, an increase of 563.0 million, or 78.6 , compared to 716.3 million as of December 31, 2021. CCBX customer deposit relationships include deposits with CCBX end customers, operating and non-operating deposit accounts. The deposits from our CCBX segment are generally classified as interest bearing NOW and money market accounts, and a portion of such CCBX deposits may be classified as brokered deposits as a result of the relationship agreement. During the first and second quarter of 2022, the majority of CCBX deposits were reclassified from noninterest bearing to interest bearing. This is because the current rate exceeds the minimum interest rate set in their respective program agreements, as a result of the increases in interest rates by the FOMC. 
 Total noninterest bearing deposits as of December 31, 2022 were 775.0 million, a decrease of 580.9 million, or 42.8 , compared to 1.36 billion as of December 31, 2021. The 580.9 million decrease is primarily the result of reclassifying CCBX noninterest bearing deposits to interest bearing as a result of the increase in interest rates by the FOMC, partially offset by growth in CCBX noninterest deposits and growth in community bank noninterest deposits. Noninterest bearing deposits represent 27.5 and 57.4 of total deposits for December 31, 2022 and December 31, 2021, respectively. 
 Total interest bearing account balances, excluding time deposits, as of December 31, 2022 were 2.01 billion, an increase of 1.05 billion, or 108.7 , compared to 964.4 million as of December 31, 2021. The 1.05 billion increase is the result of reclassifying CCBX noninterest bearing deposits to interest bearing as a result of the increases in interest rates by the FOMC, combined with CCBX growth in interest bearing deposits partially offset by community bank decrease in interest bearing deposits of 70.2 million. Included in interest bearing account balances is 101.5 million in BaaS-brokered deposits, an increase of 30.8 million from December 31, 2021. Also included in interest bearing deposits is 12.5 million in reciprocal deposits. 
 Total time deposit balances as of December 31, 2022 were 29.4 million, a decrease of 14.0 million, or 32.2 , from 43.5 million as of December 31, 2021. The decrease is due to the strong increase in core deposits, and our focus on core deposits and letting higher rate deposits run off as they mature. We have seen competitors increase rates on time deposits, and we have not globally matched their rates in response as we focus on growing and retaining less costly core deposits.

 Average deposits for the year ended December 31, 2022, were 2.67 billion, an increase of 766.1 million, or 40.3 , compared 1.90 billion for the year ended December 31, 2021. The increase in average deposits was primarily due to an increase in core deposits, both in noninterest bearing deposits and in interest bearing deposits. Included in this increase is growth in CCBX deposits. We expect deposits to increase with continued growth in CCBX as well as in the community bank through our primary market areas, the increase in commercial lending relationships for which we also seek deposit balances and the results of business development efforts by branch managers, treasury service personnel and lenders. 
 The average rate paid on total interest-bearing deposits was 0.71 for the year ended December 31, 2022, compared to 0.12 for the year ended December 31, 2021. The average rate paid on total interest-bearing deposits was 1.10 for the year ended December 31, 2022, compared to 0.26 for the year ended December 31, 2021. The average rate paid on BaaS-brokered deposits increased 1.11 for the year ended December 31, 2022, compared to December 31, 2021, and NOW and money market accounts increased 0.93 , for the year ended December 31, 2022. The increase in average rate paid on deposit accounts for the year ended December 31, 2022, is the result of the increased Fed funds rates throughout 2022. Any further changes to the Fed funds rate and rate pressure from market competition is expected to continue to impact future cost of deposits and our pricing strategies.

 The ratio of average noninterest-bearing deposits to average total deposits for the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, was 35.3 and 52.1 , respectively. 
 Factors affecting the cost of funding interest-bearing assets include the volume of noninterest- and interest-bearing deposits, changes in market interest rates and economic conditions in the Puget Sound region and their impact on interest paid on deposits, competition from other financial institutions, as well as the ongoing execution of our growth strategies. Cost of total interest-bearing liabilities is calculated as total interest expense divided by average total interest-bearing deposits plus average total borrowings. Our cost of total interest-bearing liabilities was 1.16 and 0.36 for the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. The increase in our cost of deposits in 2022 was primarily due to rate increases from the Federal Reserve. We actively manage our interest rates on deposits, however, rate changes from the Federal Reserve and competition can and do impact our deposit costs.

 Uninsured Deposits 
 The FDIC insures our deposits up to 250,000 per depositor, per insured bank for each account ownership category. Deposits that exceed insurance limits are uninsured. At December 31, 2022, deposits totaled 2.82 billion, of which total estimated uninsured deposits were 835.8 million. At December 31, 2021, deposits totaled 2.36 billion, of which total estimated uninsured deposits were 823.5 million.

 Borrowings 
 We have the ability to utilize short-term to long-term borrowings to supplement deposits to fund our lending and investment activities, each of which is discussed below. 
 Federal Reserve Bank Line of Credit. The Federal Reserve allows us to borrow against our line of credit through a borrower in custody agreement utilizing the discount window, which is collateralized by certain loans. As of December 31, 2022, and December 31, 2021, total borrowing capacity of 26.7 million and 21.9 million, respectively, was available under this arrangement. As of December 31, 2022, and December 31, 2021, Federal Reserve borrowings against our line of credit totaled zero. We are able to pledge additional loans to increase out borrowing capacity, should we decide to do so. 
 Paycheck Protection Program Liquidity Facility. The borrowing was paid in full in June 2021 and as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, no PPPLF advances were outstanding. To bolster the effectiveness of the SBA s PPP loan program, the Federal Reserve supplied liquidity to participating financial institutions through term financing backed by PPP loans to small businesses. The PPP provided loans to small businesses so that they can keep their employees on the payroll and pay for other allowed expenses. If the borrowers meet certain criteria, the loan may be forgiven. The PPPLF extended credit to eligible financial institutions that originate PPP loans, taking the loans as collateral at face value. The interest rate was 0.35 and as PPP loans were paid down, the borrowing line also had to be paid down. PPPLF advances were a new borrowing arrangement beginning in 2020 that had favorable capital treatment and was specific to the PPP loan program. The last day to take new advances on the PPPLF was July 31, 2021. 
 The table below provides details on PPPLF advance borrowings for the periods indicated: 
 As of and For the Year Ended December 31, (dollars in thousands) 2021 Maximum amount outstanding at any month-end during period: 
 185,894 Average outstanding balance during period: 68,699 Weighted average interest rate during period: 0.35 Balance outstanding at end of period: Weighted average interest rate at end of period: 0.00 
 Federal Home Loan Bank Advances. The FHLB allows us to borrow against our line of credit, which is collateralized by certain loans. As of December 31, 2022 and December 31, 2021, we had borrowing capacity of 120.8 million and 120.4 million, respectively, with the FHLB. During the year ended December 31, 2022, we repaid a total of 25.0 million in FHLB term advances. This included a 10.0 million advance that would have matured in March of 2023 and 15.0 million advance that would have matured in March 2025. We have sufficient liquidity for our current loan demand, and

 with no prepayment penalty for early repayment, management opted to repay these term advances and save the unnecessary interest expense .

 Junior Subordinated Debentures. In 2004, we issued 3.6 million in junior subordinated debentures to Coastal (WA) Statutory Trust (the Trust ), of which we own all of the outstanding common securities. The Trust used the proceeds from the issuance of its underlying common securities and preferred securities to purchase the debentures issued by the Company. These debentures are the Trust s only assets and the interest payments from the debentures finance the distributions paid on the preferred securities. The debentures bear interest at a rate per annum equal to the 3-month LIBOR plus 2.10 . The effective rate as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, was 6.87 and 2.30 , respectively. We generally have the right to defer payment of interest on the debentures at any time or from time to time for a period not exceeding five years provided that no extension period may extend beyond the stated maturity of the debentures. During any such extension period, distributions on the Trust s preferred securities will also be deferred, and our ability to pay dividends on our common stock will be restricted. The Trust s preferred securities are mandatorily redeemable upon maturity of the debentures, or upon earlier redemption as provided in the indenture. If the debentures are redeemed prior to maturity, the redemption price will be the principal amount and any accrued but unpaid interest. We unconditionally guarantee payment of accrued and unpaid distributions required to be paid on the Trust Securities subject to certain exceptions, the redemption price with respect to any Trust securities called for redemption and amounts due if the Trust is liquidated or terminated. 
 Subordinated Debt. In August 2021, the Company issued a subordinated note in the amount of 25.0 million. The note matures on September 1, 2031, and bears interest at the rate of 3.375 per year for five years and, thereafter, reprices quarterly beginning September 1, 2026, at a rate equal to the three-month SOFR plus 2.76 . The five-year 3.375 interest period ends on September 1, 2026. We may redeem the subordinated note, in whole or in part, without premium or penalty, in principal redemption multiples of 1,000, after August 18, 2026, subject to any required regulatory approvals. Proceeds were used to repay 10.0 million in existing 5.65 interest subordinated debt on August 9, 2021 and 11.5 million was contributed to the Bank as capital. 
 In November 2022, the Company issued a subordinated note in the amount of 20.0 million.

 Liquidity and Capital Resources 
 Liquidity Management 
 Liquidity refers to our capacity to meet our cash obligations at a reasonable cost. Our cash obligations require us to have cash flow that is adequate to fund loan growth and maintain on-balance sheet liquidity while meeting present and future obligations of deposit withdrawals, borrowing maturities and other contractual cash obligations. In managing our cash flows, management regularly confronts situations that can give rise to increased liquidity risk. These include funding mismatches, market constraints in accessing sources of funds and the ability to convert assets into cash. Changes in economic conditions or exposure to credit, market, and operational, legal and reputational risks also could affect the Bank s liquidity risk profile and are considered in the assessment of liquidity management. The Company considers various deposit run-off scenarios in its liquidity management process including that all community bank uninsured deposits exit the Bank in an economic downturn. Deposits obtained through our CCBX segment are a significant source of liquidity for us. If a relationship with a large CCBX partner terminates, the exit of those deposits could have an adverse impact on liquidity. Partner program agreements govern the relationship and are valid for a given period of time. Prior to exiting, the partner would need to provide us adequate notice as stipulated in the agreement that they were not going to renew the program agreement and intend to move the deposits. The movement to an alternate BaaS provider is cumbersome and would be over a period of time, which would allow us the opportunity to put alternate liquidity in place; those options are more fully discussed below. As of December 31, 2022, we have 1 partner with deposits that are in excess of 10 of total deposits and represent 25 of total deposits. The Company also considers the immediate loss of a significant deposit partner as a liquidity scenario in its liquidity management process. 
 We continually monitor our liquidity position to ensure that our assets and liabilities are managed in a manner to meet all reasonably foreseeable short-term, long-term and strategic liquidity demands. Management has established a comprehensive process for identifying, measuring, monitoring and controlling liquidity risk. Because of its critical importance to the viability of the Bank, liquidity risk management is fully integrated into our risk management processes. Critical elements of our liquidity risk management include: effective corporate governance consisting of oversight by the board of directors and active involvement by management; appropriate strategies, policies, procedures, and limits used to manage and mitigate liquidity risk; comprehensive liquidity risk measurement and monitoring systems that are commensurate with the complexity of our business activities; active management of intraday liquidity and collateral; an appropriately diverse mix of existing and potential future funding sources; adequate levels of readily available cash, deposits and highly liquid marketable securities free of legal, regulatory, or operational impediments, that can be used to meet liquidity needs in stressful situations; contingency funding policies and plans that sufficiently address potential adverse liquidity events and emergency cash flow requirements; and internal controls and internal audit processes sufficient to determine the adequacy of the Bank s liquidity risk management process. Unlike many industrial companies, substantially all of our assets and liabilities are monetary in nature. As a result, interest rates have a more significant impact on our performance than the effects of general levels of inflation. Interest rates may not necessarily move in the same direction or in the same magnitude as the prices of goods and services. However, other operating expenses do reflect general levels of inflation. 
 Our liquidity position is supported by management of our liquid assets and liabilities and access to alternative sources of funds. Our liquidity requirements are met primarily through our deposits, FHLB advances and the principal and interest payments we receive on loans and investment securities. Cash on hand, cash at third-party banks, investments available-for-sale and maturing or prepaying balances in our investment and loan portfolios are our most liquid assets. Other sources of liquidity that are routinely available to us include funds from retail, commercial, and BaaS deposits, advances from the FHLB and proceeds from the sale of loans. Less commonly used sources of funding include borrowings from the Federal Reserve discount window, draws on established federal funds lines from unaffiliated commercial banks, funds from online rate services, brokered deposits, a one-way buy through an ICS account, and the issuance of debt or equity securities. Additionally, the Bank, as of December 31, 2022, has access to 225.0 million in CCBX customer deposits that are currently being transferred from the Bank s balance sheet to other financial institutions on a daily basis. The Bank could retain these deposits for liquidity and funding purposes if needed. We believe we have ample liquidity resources to fund future growth and meet other cash needs as necessary and are closely monitoring liquidity in this uncertain economic environment. 
 The Company is a corporation separate and apart from our Bank and, therefore, must provide for its own liquidity, including liquidity required to meet its debt service requirements on its subordinated notes and junior subordinated debentures. The Company s main source of cash flow has been through equity and debt offerings. The Company has consistently retained a portion of the funds from equity and debt offerings so that it has sufficient funds for its operating and debt costs. During the year ended December 31, 2022, the Company contributed 21.0 million in capital to the Bank. The Company currently holds 22.9 million in cash for debt servicing and operating purposes. In addition, the Bank can 
 91 

Table of Contents 

 declare and pay dividends to the Company if needed, to meet the Company s debt and operating expenses. There are statutory and regulatory limitations that affect the ability of the Bank to pay dividends to the Company. We believe that these limitations will not impact the ability of the Bank to pay dividends to the Company if needed, to meet ongoing operating needs. 
 For contingency purposes, the Company maintains a minimum level of cash to fund one year s projected operating cash flow needs and the Bank established a minimum liquidity ratio of 5 of assets, and usually maintains a liquidity ratio in excess of 10 . Both of these minimum liquidity levels are on-balance sheet sources. Per the Bank s policies and its liquidity contingency plan, in event of a liquidity emergency the Bank can utilize wholesale funds in an amount up to 30 of assets. Since the Bank uses only a small portion of its borrowing or wholesale funding capacity, the Bank has access to funds if needed in a liquidity emergency. 
 Capital Adequacy 
 Capital management consists of providing equity and other instruments that qualify as regulatory capital to support current and future operations. Banking regulators view capital levels as important indicators of an institution s financial soundness. As a general matter, FDIC-insured depository institutions and their holding companies are required to maintain minimum capital levels relative to the amount and types of assets they hold. We are required to meet the generally applicable regulatory capital requirements of the Federal Reserve and the FDIC at the company and bank level. Historically, the Company had been operating under the Small Bank Holding Company Policy Statement, which exempts bank holding companies that have total consolidated assets of less than 3.0 billion and meet other criteria from the Federal Reserve s risk-based- and leverage capital rules. 
 Because the Company s total consolidated assets exceeded 3.0 billion as of September 30, 2022, the Company is no longer subject to the Federal Reserve s Small Bank Holding Company Policy Statement and will be evaluated relative to the capital adequacy standards established by the Federal Reserve going forward. A bank holding company that crosses the 3.0 billion total consolidated assets threshold as of June 30 of a particular year is no longer permitted to file reports as a small holding company beginning the following March. The Company was not in excess of 3.0 billion as of June 30, 2022, and accordingly prepared and filed financial reports with the Federal Reserve as a small bank holding company. Currently, the Federal Reserve assesses the capital position of the Company based on these reports by reviewing its debt-to-equity ratio and its capacity to serve as a source of strength to the Bank. If the Company s total consolidated assets remain in excess of 3.0 billion as of June 30, 2023, starting in March 2024 the Company will cease filing financial reports with the Federal Reserve as though it were a small bank holding company. 
 As of December 31, 2022, the Company was in compliance with all applicable regulatory capital requirements. As of December 31, 2022, and December 31, 2021, the Bank was in compliance with all applicable regulatory capital requirements, and the Bank was classified as well capitalized for purposes of the Federal Reserve s prompt corrective action regulations. As we deploy our capital and continue to grow our operations, our regulatory capital levels may decrease depending on our level of earnings. However, we expect to monitor and control our growth in order to remain in compliance with all regulatory capital standards applicable to us. In addition, the Company maintains an effective registration statement on Form S-3 with the Securities and Exchange Commission that would allow the Company to raise additional capital in an amount up to 115.5 million. The Company raised 34.5 million in December 2021. The Company through a private placement raised 25.0 million in subordinated debt in 2021 and repaid 10.0 million of subordinated debt with the proceeds and used the remainder for general corporate purposes. On November 1, 2022 the Company, through a private placement, raised 20.0 million of subordinated debt with the proceeds to be used for general corporate purposes.

 Material Cash Requirements and Capital Resources 
 The following table provides the material cash requirements from known contractual and other obligations as of December 31, 2022:

 (1) Represents the undefined maturity of non-maturing deposits, including noninterest bearing demand deposits, interest bearing demand deposits, money market accounts, savings accounts and brokered deposits, which can generally be withdrawn on demand. 
 We maintain sufficient cash and cash equivalents and investment securities to meet short-term cash requirements and the levels of these assets are dependent on our operating, investing and financing activities during any given period. Cash on hand, cash at third-party banks, investments available-for-sale and maturing or prepaying balances in our investment and loan portfolios are our most liquid assets. Other sources of liquidity that are routinely available to us include funds from retail, commercial, and BaaS deposits, advances from the FHLB and proceeds from the sale of loans. Less commonly used sources of funding include borrowings from the Federal Reserve discount window, draws on established federal funds lines from unaffiliated commercial banks, funds from online rate services, brokered funds, a one-way buy through an ICS account, and the issuance of debt or equity securities. 
 In the normal course of business, we enter into various transactions, which, in accordance with GAAP, are not included in our consolidated balance sheets. We enter into these transactions to meet the financing needs of our customers. These transactions include commitments to extend credit and standby and commercial letters of credit, which involve, to varying degrees, elements of credit risk and interest rate risk in excess of the amounts recognized in our consolidated balance sheets. 
 Our commitments associated with outstanding commitments to extend credit and standby and commercial letters of credit are summarized below. Since commitments associated with commitments to extend credit and letters of credit may expire unused, the amounts shown do not necessarily reflect the actual future cash funding requirements. 
 As of December 31, 2022, we had 2.20 billion in commitments to extend credit, compared to 909.6 million as of December 31, 2021. The 1.29 billion increase is largely attributed to growth in our CCBX segment, due to the addition of new partners, resulting in an increase of 1.25 billion in commitments to extend credit on CCBX loans. The following

 table presents commitments associated with outstanding commitments to extend credit, standby and commercial letters of credit and equity investment commitments as of the periods indicated: 
 (dollars in thousands) As of December 31, 2022 As of December 31, 2021 Commitments to extend credit: Commercial and industrial loans 81,568 70,848 Commercial and industrial loans - capital call lines 772,732 415,956 Construction commercial real estate loans 109,715 90,946 Construction residential real estate loans 32,827 43,339 Residential real estate loans 374,735 101,715 Commercial real estate loans 35,024 23,248 Consumer and other loans 793,563 163,510 Total commitments to extend credit 2,200,164 909,562 Standby letters of credit 3,064 3,040 Equity investment commitment 988 1,090 
 Commitments to extend credit on CCBX loans are included in the table above and are summarized below: 
 (dollars in thousands) As of December 31, 2022 As of December 31, 2021 Commitments to extend credit: Commercial and industrial loans 773,684 415,956 Residential real estate loans 329,193 71,453 Consumer and other loans 792,447 162,266 Total commitments to extend credit 1,895,324 649,675 
 We have portfolio limits with our each of our partners to manage loan concentration risk, liquidity risk, and counter-party partner risk. For example, as of December 31, 2022, capital call lines outstanding balance totaled 146.0 million, and while commitments totaled 772.7 million the commitments are cancelable, and are also limited to a maximum of 350.0 million by agreement with the partner. 
 The following table shows the CCBX maximum portfolio sizes by loan category as of December 31, 2022. 
 (dollars in thousands; unaudited) Type of Lending Maximum Portfolio Size Commercial and industrial loans: Capital call lines Business - Venture Capital 350,000 All other commercial industrial loans 
 Business - Small Business 65,856 Real estate loans: Home equity lines of credit Home Equity - Secured Credit Cards 250,000 Consumer and other loans: Credit cards Credit Cards - Primarily Consumer 600,770 Installment loans Consumer 1,048,134 Other consumer and other loans Consumer - Secured Credit Builder Unsecured consumer 190,240 2,505,000 
 Commitments to extend credit are agreements to lend to a customer as long as there is no violation of any condition established in the contract. Commitments generally have fixed expiration dates or other termination clauses and may require payment of a fee. Since many of the commitments are expected to expire without being fully drawn upon, the 
 95 

Table of Contents 

 total commitment amounts disclosed above do not necessarily represent future cash requirements. We evaluate each customer s creditworthiness on a case-by-case basis. The amount of collateral obtained, if considered necessary by us, upon extension of credit, is based on management s credit evaluation of the customer. As of December 31, 2022, 1.57 billion in commitments to extend credit are unconditionally cancelable, compared to 162.3 million at December 31, 2021. The increase in unconditionally cancelable commitments is attributed to growth in CCBX loans. Commitments that are unconditionally cancelable allow us to better manage loan growth, credit concentrations and liquidity. We also limit CCBX partners to a maximum aggregate customer loan balance originated and held on our balance sheet, as shown in the table above. 
 Standby and commercial letters of credit are conditional commitments issued by us to guarantee the performance of a customer to a third party. In the event of nonperformance by the customer, we have rights to the underlying collateral, which can include commercial real estate, physical plant and property, inventory, receivables, cash and/or marketable securities. Our credit risk associated with issuing letters of credit is essentially the same as the risk involved in extending loan facilities to our customers. 
 We believe that we will be able to meet our long-term cash requirements as they come due. Adequate cash levels are generated through profitability, repayments from loans and securities, deposit gathering activity, access to borrowing sources and periodic loan sales. 
 
 CCBX BaaS Reporting Information 
 During the year ended December 31, 2022, 76.4 million was recognized in noninterest income BaaS credit enhancements related to the establishment of a credit enhancement asset for future loan losses indemnified by our strategic partners and reserve for unfunded commitments for CCBX partner loans and deposits. Agreements with our CCBX partners provide for a credit enhancement provided by the partner which protects the Bank by absorbing incurred losses on accounts originated through the partner. In accordance with accounting guidance, we estimate and record a provision for probable losses on these CCBX loans and deposit overdrafts. When the provision for loan losses and provision for unfunded commitments is recorded, a credit enhancement asset is also recorded on the balance sheet through the recognition of noninterest income (BaaS credit enhancements) in recognition of the CCBX partner s indemnification obligation and legal commitment to cover losses. Incurred credit losses are recorded in the allowance for loan losses, and as the credit enhancement payments are received from the CCBX partner, the credit enhancement asset is relieved. Agreements with our CCBX partners also provide protection to the Bank from fraud by absorbing incurred fraud losses. Fraud losses are recorded when incurred as losses in noninterest expense, and the recovery received from the CCBX partner is recorded in noninterest income, resulting in a net impact of zero to the income statement. CCBX partners also pledge cash reserves in a restricted deposit account at the Bank which the Bank can collect from when losses occur that is then replenished by the partner on a regular interval. Although agreements with our CCBX partners provide for enhancements that provide protection to the Bank from credit and fraud losses by absorbing incurred credit and fraud losses, if our partner is unable to fulfill its contracted obligations beyond its cash reserve account then the Bank would be exposed to additional loan and deposit losses, as a result of this counterparty risk. If a CCBX partner does not adequately replenish their cash reserve account then the Bank can declare the agreement in default, take over servicing and cease paying the partner for servicing the loan and providing credit enhancements. The Bank would write-off any remaining receivable from the CCBX partner but would retain the full yield on the loan going forward, and BaaS loan expense would decrease once default occurred and payments to the CCBX partner were stopped. 
 For CCBX partner loans the Bank records contractual interest earned from the borrower on loans in interest income, adjusted for origination costs which are paid or payable to the CCBX partner. BaaS loan expense represents the amount paid or payable to partners for credit enhancements, fraud enhancements and servicing CCBX loans. To determine net BaaS loan income earned from CCBX loan relationships, the Bank takes BaaS loan interest income and deducts BaaS loan expense to arrive at net BaaS loan income which can then be compared to interest income on the Company s community bank loans.

 GAAP Reconciliation and Management Explanation of Non-GAAP Financial Measures 
 The Company uses certain non-GAAP financial measures to provide meaningful supplemental information regarding the Company s operational performance and to enhance investors overall understanding of such financial performance. 
 However, these non-GAAP financial measures are supplemental and are not a substitute for an analysis based on GAAP measures. As other companies may use different calculations for these adjusted measures, this presentation may not be comparable to other similarly titled adjusted measures reported by other companies. 
 The following non-GAAP financial measures are presented to illustrate the impact of BaaS loan expense on net loan income, yield on CCBX loans and interest rate spread. 
 Net BaaS loan income divided by average CCBX loans is a non-GAAP measure that includes the impact BaaS loan expense on net BaaS loan income and the yield on CCBX loans. The most directly comparable GAAP measure is yield on CCBX loans. 
 Net BaaS loan interest income interest rate spread is a non-GAAP measure that includes the impact of BaaS loan expense on interest rate spread. The most directly comparable GAAP measure is interest rate spread . 
 Reconciliations of the GAAP and non-GAAP measures are presented in the following table.

 Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk 
 As a financial institution, our primary component of market risk is interest rate volatility. Our asset liability and funds management policy provides management with the guidelines for effective funds management, and we have established a measurement system for monitoring our net interest rate sensitivity position. We have historically managed our sensitivity position within our established guidelines. 
 Fluctuations in interest rates will ultimately impact both the level of income and expense recorded on most of our assets and liabilities, and the market value of all interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities, other than those 
 98 

Table of Contents 

 which have a short term to maturity. Interest rate risk is the potential for economic losses due to future interest rate changes. These economic losses can be reflected as a loss of future net interest income and/or a decrease in current fair market values. Our objective is to measure the effect on net interest income and to adjust the balance sheet to minimize the inherent risk while at the same time maximizing income. The Federal Open Market Committee raised interest rates 0.25 in mid-March 2022, 1.25 in the second quarter of 2022, 1.50 in the third quarter of 2022 and 1.50 in the fourth quarter of 2022 with additional increases expected in the future. The impact of this and any future increases will impact financial results. 
 We manage our exposure to interest rates by structuring our balance sheet in the ordinary course of business. We do not enter into instruments such as leveraged derivatives, financial options, financial future contracts or forward delivery contracts for the purpose of reducing interest rate risk. Based upon the nature of our operations, we are not subject to foreign exchange or commodity price risk. We do not own any trading assets. 
 Our exposure to interest rate risk is managed by the Asset Liability Committee ALCO ), of the Bank and reviewed by the Asset Liability and Investment Committee of our board of directors in accordance with policies approved by our board of directors. ALCO formulates strategies based on appropriate levels of interest rate risk. In determining the appropriate level of interest rate risk, ALCO considers the impact on earnings and capital on the current outlook on interest rates, potential changes in interest rates, regional economies, liquidity, business strategies and other factors. ALCO meets regularly to review, among other things, the sensitivity of assets and liabilities to interest rate changes, the book and market values of assets and liabilities, unrealized gains and losses, purchase and sale activities, commitments to originate loans and the maturities of investments and borrowings. Additionally, ALCO reviews liquidity, cash flows, maturities of deposits and consumer and commercial deposit activity. Management employs various methodologies to manage interest rate risk including an analysis of relationships between interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities and interest rate simulations using a model. The Asset Liability and Investment Committee of our board of directors meets regularly to review the Bank s interest rate risk profile, liquidity position, including contingent liquidity, and investment portfolio. 
 We use interest rate risk simulation models to test interest rate sensitivity of net interest income and fair value of equity, and the impact of changes in interest rates on other financial metrics. Contractual maturities and re-pricing opportunities of loans are incorporated in the model, as are prepayment assumptions, maturity data and call options within the investment portfolio. Average life of non-maturity deposit accounts are based on historical decay rates and assumptions and are incorporated into the model. The assumptions used are inherently uncertain and, as a result, the model cannot precisely measure future net interest income or precisely predict the impact of fluctuations in market interest rates on net interest income. Actual results will differ from the model s simulated results due to timing, magnitude and frequency of interest rate changes as well as changes in market conditions and the application and timing of various management strategies. To help ensure the accuracy of the model, we perform a quarterly back test against our actual results. 
 On a quarterly basis, we run multiple simulations under two different premises of which one is a static balance sheet and the other is a dynamic growth balance sheet. The static balance sheet approach produces results that show the interest risk currently inherent in our balance sheet at that point in time. The dynamic balance sheet includes our projected growth levels going forward and produces results that shows how net income, net interest income, and interest risk change based on our projected growth. These simulations test the impact on net interest income and fair value of equity from changes in market interest rates under various scenarios. Under the static and dynamic approaches, rates are shocked instantaneously and ramped over a 12-month horizon assuming parallel yield curve shifts. Parallel shock scenarios assume instantaneous parallel movements in the yield curve compared to a flat yield curve scenario. Non-parallel simulations are also conducted and involve analysis of interest income and expense under various changes in the shape of the yield curve including a forward curve, flat curve, steepening curve, and an inverted curve. Our internal policy regarding internal rate risk simulations currently specifies that for instantaneous parallel shifts of the yield curve, estimated net income at risk for the subsequent one- and two-year period should not decline by more than 10 for a 100 basis point shift, 15 for a 200 basis point shift, 20 for a 300 basis point shift, and 25 for a 400 basis point shift.

 (unaudited) Change in Market Interest Rates Twelve Month Projection As of December 31, 2022 Twelve Month Projection As of December 31, 2021 Static Balance Sheet and Rate Shifts +400 basis points 15.2 36.7 +300 basis points 11.4 27.2 +200 basis points 7.6 17.9 +100 basis points 3.8 8.5 -100 basis points (4.1) (9.7) -200 basis points (8.5) (15.4) -300 basis points (13.0) (19.9) Dynamic Balance Sheet and Rate Shifts +400 basis points 17.6 38.5 +300 basis points 13.2 28.7 +200 basis points 8.8 18.8 +100 basis points 4.4 9.1 -100 basis points (4.6) (11.8) -200 basis points (9.5) (19.4) -300 basis points (14.5) (23.0) 
 The results illustrate that the Company is asset sensitive and generally performs better in an increasing interest rate environment. As the Company s composition has shifted over time due to the growth of the CCBX segment to more variable/adjustable in nature, our interest rate risk profile has been mitigated, reducing variability in both rising and falling rate environments, as the community bank and CCBX segments work to offset one another. For the community bank, the drivers are primarily due to behavior of demand, money market and savings deposits during such rate fluctuations. We have found that, historically, offering rates on these community bank deposits change more slowly than changes in short-term market rates. For the CCBX segment, the offering rates on the loan portfolio are modeled using partner contractual net yields which adjust with market shifts. For this CCBX portfolio, the offering rates on both the loans and the deposits nearly fully reprice with changes in market rates. The assumptions incorporated into the simulation model are inherently uncertain and, as a result, the model cannot precisely measure future net interest income or precisely predict the impact that fluctuations in market interest rates have on net interest income. Actual results will differ from the model s simulated results due to timing, magnitude, and frequency of interest rate changes as well as changes in market conditions, the shape of the interest yield curve, and the application and timing of various assumptions and strategies. 

Impact of Inflation 
 Our consolidated financial statements and related notes to those financial statements included elsewhere in this Report on Form 10-K have been prepared in accordance with GAAP. GAAP requires the measurement of financial position and operating results in terms of historical dollars, without considering changes in the relative value of money over time due to inflation or recession. 
 Unlike many industrial companies, substantially all of our assets and liabilities are monetary in nature. As a result, interest rates have a more significant impact on our performance than the effects of general levels of inflation. Interest rates may not necessarily move in the same direction or in the same magnitude as the prices of goods and services. However, other operating expenses do reflect general levels of inflation.

 REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM 
 To the Shareholders and the Board of Directors of 
 Coastal Financial Corporation 
 Opinion on the Financial Statements 
 We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Coastal Financial Corporation and Subsidiary (the Company as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, the related consolidated statements of income, comprehensive income, changes in shareholders equity, and cash flows for the years then ended, and the related notes (collectively referred to as the consolidated financial statements ). In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the consolidated financial position of the Company as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, and the consolidated results of its operations and its cash flows for the years then ended, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. 
 Basis for Opinion 
 These consolidated financial statements are the responsibility of the Company s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company s consolidated financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. 
 We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. The Company is not required to have, nor were we engaged to perform, an audit of its internal control over financial reporting in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. As part of our audits we are required to obtain an understanding of internal control over financial reporting but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Company s internal control over financial reporting in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Accordingly, we express no such opinion. 
 Our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures to respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the consolidated financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the consolidated financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.

 The allowance for loan losses is comprised of amounts charged against income in the form of the provision for loan losses, less charged-off loans, net of recoveries. When available information confirms that specific loans or portions thereof are uncollectible, identified amounts are charged against the allowance for loan losses. The existence of some or all of the following criteria will generally confirm that a loss has been incurred: (1) the loan is significantly delinquent and the borrower has not demonstrated the ability or intent to bring the loan current; (2) the Company has no recourse to the borrower or if it does, the borrower has insufficient assets to pay the debt; (3) the estimated fair value of the loan collateral

 to . This change will decrease the opening retained earnings balance as of January 1, 2023. The above range is disclosed due to the fact that the Company is still in the process of finalizing the CECL allowance model, including the review of assumptions related to qualitative adjustments and economic forecasts; finalizing the execution of internal controls; and evaluating the impact to our financial statement disclosures. 
 The Company does not expect a material allowance for credit losses to be recorded on its available-for-sale debt securities for losses expected over the life of the security under the newly codified available-for-sale debt security impairment model, as the majority of these securities are government agency-backed securities for which the risk of credit loss is minimal. 
 In March 2020, the FASB issued ASU 2020-04, Reference Rate Reform (Topic 848): Facilitation of the Effects of Reference Rate Reform on Financial Reporting , to provide temporary optional expedients and exceptions to the U.S. GAAP guidance on contract modifications and hedge accounting to ease the financial reporting burdens of the expected market transition from LIBOR and other interbank offered rates to alternative reference rates, such as Secured Overnight Financing Rate. Entities can elect not to apply certain modification accounting requirements to contracts affected by what the guidance calls reference rate reform, if certain criteria are met. An entity that makes this election would not have to remeasure the contracts at the modification date or reassess a previous accounting determination. Also, entities can elect various optional expedients that would allow them to continue applying hedge accounting for hedging relationships affected by reference rate reform, if certain criteria are met, and can make a one-time election to sell and/or reclassify held-to-maturity debt securities that reference an interest rate affected by reference rate reform. The amendments in this ASU are effective for all entities upon issuance through December 31, 2022. The Company expects to be able to use other expedients in this guidance to manage through the transition away from LIBOR, specifically as they relate to loans and borrowing relationships. The adoption of this accounting guidance is not expected to have a material impact on the Company s consolidated financial statements. 
 In March 2022, the FASB issued ASU 2022-02, Financial Instruments - Credit Losses (Topic 326): Troubled Debt Restructurings and Vintage Disclosures. The ASU eliminates the accounting guidance for TDR loans by creditors while enhancing disclosure requirements for certain loan refinancings and restructurings by creditors when a borrower is experiencing financial difficulty. Additionally, the ASU requires public business entities to disclose current-period gross write-offs by year of origination for financing receivables and net investments in leases. This ASU is effective upon adoption of ASU 2016-13. The Company is in the process of implementing this ASU and evaluating the impact adoption will have on the Company s consolidated financial statement disclosures.

 million in unsecured loans originated through CCBX partners as of December 31, 2022, compared to as of December 31, 2021. Loan types include PPP loans, revolving lines of credit, term loans, and loans secured by liquid collateral such as cash deposits or marketable securities. Also included in commercial and industrial loans are loans to other financial institutions. Additionally, the Company issues letters of credit on behalf of its customers. Risk arises primarily due to the difference between expected and actual cash flows of the borrowers. In addition, the recoverability of the Company s investment in these loans is also dependent on other factors primarily dictated by the type of collateral securing these loans. The fair value of the collateral securing these loans may fluctuate as market conditions change. In the case of loans secured by accounts receivable, the recovery of the Company s investment is dependent upon the borrower s ability to collect amounts due from its customers. 
 For the year ended December 31, 2022, million in CCBX capital call lines are included in commercial and industrial loans compared to million at December 31, 2021. Capital call lines are provided to venture capital firms. These loans are secured by the capital call rights and are individually underwritten to the Bank s credit standards and the underwriting is reviewed by the Bank on every line/loan. 
 Construction, land and land development loans The Company originates loans for the construction of 1-4 family, multifamily, and CRE properties in the Company s market area. Construction loans are considered to have higher risks due to construction completion and timing risk, the ultimate repayment being sensitive to interest rate changes, government regulation of real property and the availability of long-term financing. Additionally, economic conditions may impact the Company s ability to recover its investment in construction loans, as adverse economic conditions may negatively impact the real estate market, which could affect the borrower s ability to complete and sell the project. Additionally, the fair value of the underlying collateral may fluctuate as market conditions change. The Company occasionally originates land loans for the purpose of facilitating the ultimate construction of a home or commercial building. The primary risks include the borrower s ability to pay and the inability of the Company to recover its investment due to a material decline in the fair value of the underlying collateral. 
 Residential real estate - Residential real estate includes various types of loans for which the Company holds real property as collateral. Included in this segment are multi-family loans, first lien single family loans, which the Company occasionally purchases to diversify its loan portfolio, home equity lines of credit and rental portfolios secured by one-to-four family homes. The primary risks of residential real estate loans include the borrower s inability to pay, material decreases in the value of the collateral, and significant increases in interest rates which may make the loan unprofitable. 
 As of December 31, 2022, million in loans originated through CCBX partners are included in residential real estate loans, compared to million at December 31, 2021. These home equity lines of credit are secured by residential real estate and are accessed by using a credit card. Home equity lines of credit are classified as residential real estate per regulatory guidelines. 
 Commercial real estate (includes owner occupied and nonowner occupied) - Commercial real estate loans include various types of loans for which the Company holds real property as collateral. We make commercial mortgage loans collateralized by owner-occupied and non-owner-occupied real estate, as well as multi-family residential loans. The primary risks of commercial real estate loans include the borrower s inability to pay, material decreases in the value of the collateralized real estate and significant increases in interest rates, which may make the real estate loan unprofitable. Commercial real estate loans may be more adversely affected by conditions in the real estate markets or in the general economy. 
 Consumer and other loans The community bank originates a limited number of consumer loans, generally for banking customers only, which consist primarily of lines of credit, saving account secured loans, and auto loans. CCBX originates consumer loans including credit cards, consumer term loans and secured and unsecured lines of credit. This loan category also includes overdrafts. Repayment of these loans is dependent on the borrower s ability to pay and the fair value of the underlying collateral. 
 As of December 31, 2022 million in CCBX loans are included in consumer and other loans, compared to million at December 31, 2021.

 In some circumstances, the Company grants restructurings in response to borrower financial difficulty, and generally provides for a temporary modification of loan repayment terms. The restructured loans on accrual status represent the only impaired loans accruing interest. In order for a restructured loan to be considered for accrual status, the loan s collateral coverage generally will be greater than or equal to of the loan balance, the loan is current on payments, and the borrower must either prefund an interest reserve or demonstrate the ability to make payments from a verified source of cash flow for an extended period of time, usually at least in duration. 
 loans were restructured in the year ended December 31, 2022 and December 31, 2021 that qualified as troubled debt restructurings. The Company has commitments to loan additional funds to borrowers whose loans were classified as troubled debt restructurings at December 31, 2022, as there were outstanding troubled debt restructurings at December 31, 2022 and December 31, 2021.

Installment/closed-end, and revolving/open-end consumer loans originated through CCBX lending partners will continue to accrue interest until and days past due, respectively and an allowance is recorded through provision expense for these probable incurred losses. For installment/closed-end and revolving/open-end consumer loans originated through CCBX lending partners with balances outstanding beyond days and days past due, respectively, principal and capitalized interest outstanding is charged off against the allowance and accrued interest outstanding is reversed against interest income. These consumer loans are reported as substandard, days or more days past due and still accruing. 
 When loans are placed on nonaccrual status, all accrued interest is reversed from current period earnings. Payments received on nonaccrual loans are generally applied as a reduction to the loan principal balance. If the likelihood of further loss is removed, the Company will recognize interest on a cash basis only. Loans may be returned to accruing status if the Company believes that all remaining principal and interest is fully collectible and there has been at least of sustained repayment performance since the loan was placed on nonaccrual.

 Credit Quality and Credit Risk 
 Federal regulations require that the Company periodically evaluate the risks inherent in its loan portfolio. In addition, the Company s regulatory agencies have authority to identify problem loans and, if appropriate, require them to be reclassified. The Company classifies some loans as Watch or Other Loans Especially Mentioned OLEM ). Loans classified as Watch are performing assets but have elements of risk that require more monitoring than other performing loans and are reported in the OLEM column in the following table. Loans classified as OLEM are assets that continue to perform but have shown deterioration in credit quality and require close monitoring. There are three classifications for problem loans: Substandard, Doubtful, and Loss. Substandard loans have one or more defined weaknesses and are characterized by the distinct possibility that the Company will sustain some loss if the deficiencies are not corrected. Revolving (open-ended loans, such as credit cards) and installment (closed end) consumer loans originated through CCBX partners continue to accrue interest until they are charged-off at days past due for installment loans (primarily unsecured loans to consumers) and days past due for revolving loans (primarily credit cards) and are classified as substandard. Doubtful loans have the weaknesses of loans classified as Substandard, with additional characteristics that suggest the weaknesses make collection or recovery in full after liquidation of collateral questionable on the basis of currently existing facts, conditions, and values. There is a high possibility of loss in loans classified as Doubtful. A loan classified as Loss is considered uncollectible and of such little value that continued classification of the credit as a loan is not warranted. If a loan or a portion thereof is classified as Loss, it must be charged-off, meaning the amount of the loss is charged against the allowance for loan losses, thereby reducing that reserve.

 Allowance for Loan Losses 
 The Company s ALLL covers estimated credit losses on individually evaluated loans that are determined to be impaired as well as estimated probable losses inherent in the remainder of the loan portfolio. The ALLL for the community bank is prepared using the information provided by the Company s credit review process and our historical loss data, together with data from peer institutions and economic information gathered from published sources. 
 The loan portfolio is segmented into groups of loans with similar risk profiles. Each segment possesses varying degrees of risk based on the type of loan, the type of collateral, and the sensitivity of the borrower or industry to changes in external factors such as economic conditions. An estimated loss rate calculated from the community bank s actual historical loss rates adjusted for current portfolio trends, economic conditions, and other relevant internal and external factors, is applied to each group s aggregate loan balances.

 CCBX deposits are originated through CCBX partners for true depositor and FDIC insurance purposes. CCBX deposits were primarily noninterest bearing prior to the rate increases in 2022 by the Federal Open Market Committee FOMC ). As a result of the interest rate increases, a significant portion of CCBX deposits that were not earning interest were reclassified to interest bearing deposits from noninterest bearing deposits during the first and second quarters of 2022. These CCBX deposits were reclassified because the current interest rate exceeded the minimum interest rate set in their respective program agreements, as a result of the first and second quarter 2022 interest rate increases by the FOMC, we needed to pay interest to the CCBX partners for these deposits. We do not expect additional CCBX deposits will be reclassified as a result of future rate increases.

 The determination of the amount of deferred income tax assets which are more likely than not to be realized is primarily dependent on projections of future earnings, which are subject to uncertainty and estimates that may change given economic conditions and other factors. The realization of deferred income tax assets is regularly assessed and a valuation allowance is recorded if it is more likely than not that all or a portion of the deferred tax asset will not be realized. More likely than not is defined as greater than a 50 chance. All available evidence, both positive and negative is considered to determine whether, based on the weight of that evidence, a valuation allowance is needed. Based upon its analysis of available evidence, including recent profitability, management has determined that it is more likely than not that the Company s deferred income tax assets as of December 31, 2022 will be fully realized and therefore valuation allowance was recorded. 
 At December 31, 2022, the Company had federal net operating loss carryforwards or tax credit carryforwards. The Company files federal and various state income tax returns.

 The Company measures and discloses certain assets and liabilities at fair value. Fair value is defined as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date (that is, not a forced liquidation or distressed sale). GAAP establishes a consistent framework for measuring fair value and disclosure requirements about fair value measurements. Among other things, the accounting standard requires the reporting entity to maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs when measuring fair value. Observable inputs reflect market data obtained from independent sources, while

 The following methods were used to estimate the fair value of the class of financial instruments above:

 Impaired loans - A loan is considered impaired when it is probable that payment of interest and principal will not be made in accordance with the contractual terms of the loan agreement. Impairment is measured based on the fair value of the underlying collateral or the discounted cash expected future cash flows. Subsequent changes in the value of impaired loans are included within the provision for loan losses in the same manner in which impairment initially was recognized or as a reduction in the provision that would otherwise be reported. Impaired loans are evaluated quarterly to determine if valuation adjustments should be recorded. The need for valuation adjustments arises when observable market prices or current appraised values of collateral indicate a shortfall in collateral value compared to current carrying values of the related loan. If the Company determines that the value of the impaired loan is less than the carrying value of the loan, the Company either establishes an impairment reserve as a specific component of the allowance for loan losses or charges off the impairment amount. These valuation adjustments are considered nonrecurring fair value adjustments. 
 Equity securities The Company measures equity securities without readily determinable fair values at cost less impairment (if any), plus or minus observable price changes from an identical or similar investment of the same issuer, with price changes recognized in earnings.

Revenue is recognized at the date the mortgage company funds the mortgage loan. The contract arrangement includes a fee reimbursement requirement for funded mortgage loans that pay off within three months of origination. 
 BaaS Fees: The Company earns fees and is reimbursed for certain expenses, as specified in the program agreement, for providing banking services to broker-dealers and digital financial service providers.

 Item 9A. Controls and Procedures 
 Conclusion Regarding the Effectiveness of Disclosure Controls and Procedures 
 An evaluation was performed under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including the Chief Executive Officer and the Chief Financial Officer, of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) promulgated under the Exchange Act) as of December 31, 2022. In designing and evaluating our disclosure controls and procedures, we and our management recognize that any controls and procedures, no matter how well-designed and operated, can provide only a reasonable assurance of achieving the desired control objectives, and management necessarily was required to apply its judgment in evaluating and implementing possible controls and procedures. Based on that evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures are effective to ensure that information required to be disclosed by us in the reports it files or submits under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported as of the end of the period covered by this annual report. 
 Management s Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting 
 Our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rule 13a-15(f) and 15d- 15(f) of the Exchange Act). Our internal control system is designed to provide reasonable assurance to our management and board of directors regarding the preparation and fair presentation of published financial statements in accordance with GAAP. Internal control over financial reporting includes self-monitoring mechanisms, and actions are taken to correct deficiencies as they are identified. 
 148 

Table of Contents 

 There are inherent limitations in any internal control over financial reporting, no matter how well designed, misstatements due to error or fraud may occur and not be detected, including the possibility of circumvention or overriding of controls. Accordingly, even an effective internal control system can provide only reasonable assurance with respect to financial statement preparation. Further, because of changes in conditions, the effectiveness of an internal control system may vary over time. 
 Our management assessed its internal control structure over financial reporting as of December 31, 2022 using the criteria set forth in Internal Control Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. Based on this assessment, our management concluded that we maintained effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2022.

 F. ADDITIONAL RENT 
 (a) Beginning April 15, 2023 and continuing throughout the term of this lease, the Lessee shall pay to the Lessor, as additional rent, Lessee s Share of Operating Expenses of the land and building of which the premises are a part. Within 60 days following the end of each calendar year, or as soon after such 60-day period as practicable, Lessor shall notify the Lessee of the amount of such additional rent by notice in writing addressed to Lessee at the premises and Lessor shall provide Lessee with a statement of the actual Operating Expenses for the prior year. Lessee shall then pay any shortfall or receive a credit for any surplus attributable to the prior year. 
 
 Lessee shall have the right to audit Lessor s files no more than once per calendar year at Lessee s sole cost and expense. In the event Lessee notifies Lessor that Lessee intends to audit Lessor s files, Lessor shall make readily available to Lessee all of Lessor s files related to this Lease, the Property, and the Operating Expenses. Lessee s auditor will not be paid based on the audit s outcome. 
 
 In the event that the estimated amount of Lessee s Share of Operating Expenses has not yet been determined for any calendar year, Lessee shall pay the monthly installment in the estimated amount determined for the preceding calendar year until the estimate for the current calendar year has been provided to Lessee. At such time as the estimate for the 
 FOURTH AMENDMENT OF LEASE - 2 

EXHIBIT 10.12 

 current calendar year is received, Lessee shall then pay any shortfall or receive a credit for any surplus for the preceding months of the current calendar year and shall, thereafter, make the monthly additional rent payment in accordance with the current estimate. 
 
 Commencing on March 1 of the year following the end of each calendar year in which Operating Expenses are calculated, and on the first (1st) day of each of the twelve months thereafter, Lessee shall pay to the Lessor an amount equal to one-twelfth of Lessee s Share of the Operating Expenses. If, for any reason other than default of Lessee, this Lease shall terminate during any such 12-month period commencing March 1, Lessee s Share of Operating Expenses shall be proportioned on the basis of which the number of days of this lease during such 12- month period bears to 365. 
 
 For purposes of this Paragraph 5(a) 
 
 (i) Lessee s Share of the Operating Expenses is thirty-three percent (33 of Operating Expenses for the Property. Lessee s Share is conditioned on the basement and the fourth floor of the Building being used solely as storage by the Lessor or other lessees of the Building or vacant. In the event the Lessor or other lessee s use of the basement or fourth floor is for any use besides vacant space or storage, then the parties shall reduce Lessee s Share of the variable Operating Expenses in a proportionate manner. The denominator for calculating Lessee s share shall be 28,755 square feet (9,489 sq ft divided by 0.33) until such time that Lessor or other Lessee s use of the basement and or 4th floor is used for anything other than vacant space or storage. At such time, the square footage of the basement and or 4th floor used as non-storage space shall be added to the denominator and Lessee s share of Operating expenses will be reduced accordingly. 
 (ii) Operating Expenses are all of Lessor s direct and indirect costs of managing, operating, maintaining and repairing the Premises, the Building, and the Property including, without limitation, wages, salaries and payroll burden of employees janitorial, cleaning, maintenance, guard, elevator and other services electrical energy, water, waste disposal and other utilities heating, ventilation and air conditioning materials and supplies painting, repairs and other maintenance capital improvements insurance and real property taxes and assessments which may be levied or assessed against the land and building of which the premises are a part.

If the capital improvements exceed that ten percent (10 threshold, Lessor can include in the recoverable expenses either reserves (in advance of such expenditures) or amortizing reimbursements for replacement of existing capital improvements in the Property spread over their useful life, which Lessee hereby authorizes Lessor to impose as Lessor deems necessary. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Lessee s Share shall not include roof replacement (as opposed to maintenance repairs), structural maintenance repairs, 5 of the Building s gas consumption and janitorial service to the 2 nd and 3 rd floors. Lessee, at Lessee s expense, is responsible for all maintenance repairs to the interior of the Premises including, but not limited to janitorial service, lighting, paint, floor, window coverings, and exterior window glass, doors and door glass. 
 (iii) If the occupancy of the property is less than 95 during any portion of an expense year, Lessor may make an appropriate gross-up adjustment of the variable components of the Operating Expenses for that expense year, as reasonably determined by Lessor using sound accounting and management principles, to determine the amount of Operating Expenses that would have been incurred had the Project been 100 occupied. This amount shall be 
 FOURTH AMENDMENT OF LEASE - 3 

EXHIBIT 10.12 

 considered to have been the amount of operating expenses for that expense year. For purposes of this section, variable components include only those component expenses that are affected by variations in occupancy levels, such as utility usage and janitorial services. 
 (iv) The parties further acknowledge that the Lease requires Lessee to pay property taxes directly to Snohomish County. As of the Effective Date, Lessor shall pay all property taxes subject to reimbursement as described herein. For property taxes attributable to the first half of 2023, Lessee shall pay to Lessor, on or before April 30, 2023, an amount equal to 100 of the property taxes accruing from January 1, 2023 to April 14, 2023 plus thirty-three percent (33 of the property taxes accruing from April 14, 2023 to June 30, 2023. Thereafter, Lessee shall pay its proportionate share of the property taxes directly to Lessor as Operating Expenses. 
 
 (b) Notwithstanding anything contained in this Paragraph F, the rent payable by Lessee shall in no event be less than the minimum monthly rent specified in Paragraph 6 plus the additional rent established in Paragraph F(a) above. 
 
 (c) The failure of Lessor during the term of this lease to prepare and submit to Lessee notices advising Lessee of the rent adjustments made in accordance with Paragraphs F(a) and F(b) of this lease shall not in any way cause Lessor to waive, surrender or forfeit any additional rent which may become due during the term of this lease. 
 
 (d) Notwithstanding any dispute which may arise between Lessor and Lessee regarding rent adjustments under this Paragraph F, Lessee shall continue to pay all minimum monthly rent as provided in Paragraph 6 above plus the additional monthly rent established in Paragraph F(a) above, and the full amount of any rent adjustments as determined by Lessor under this Paragraph F, such payments being subject to adjustment, if necessary, upon final resolution of the dispute. 
 
 8. Parking . As of 4 15 2023, any right of Lessee to park on the Property shall be limited to the drive-through area only. 
 
 9. Signage . Lessee shall retain its existing signage on the Building and agrees to keep it in good working condition. 
 
 10. Remaining Provisions . All of the terms and conditions of the Lease, as amended, are hereby reaffirmed and remain in full force and effect. If there is a conflict between the terms and conditions of this Fourth Amendment and the terms and conditions of the Lease, as previously amended, then the terms and conditions of this Fourth Amendment shall control. 
 
 11. Modification . In accordance with the terms of the Lease, as extended and amended, this Fourth Amendment cannot be altered or modified hereafter except in a writing signed and acknowledged by the parties. 
 
 12. Counterparts . This Fourth Amendment may be executed in two or more counterparts, each of which when executed and delivered to the other parties (or to the other parties' legal counsel) will be deemed to be an original and all of which, taken together, will be deemed to be one and the same instrument. 
 
 13. Equal Participation in Drafting and Independent Legal Counsel . The parties have each participated and had an equal opportunity to participate in the drafting of this Fourth Amendment. No ambiguity shall be construed against any party based upon a claim that such party drafted the ambiguous language. The parties expressly 
 FOURTH AMENDMENT OF LEASE - 4 

EXHIBIT 10.12 

 acknowledge that the parties have had adequate time and opportunity to seek and consult with independent legal counsel to advise them of their rights and liabilities with regard to this Fourth Amendment and the corresponding documents. 
 
 14. Authority . The undersigned parties executing this Amendment on behalf of Lessor hereby represent and warrant that such parties comprise all of the title owners of the Property and are authorized to enter into this Amendment on behalf of Lessor and to bind Lessor thereto.

The market rental value that the appraiser selects or determines shall be the market rental value binding on the parties. Absent clear error, the appraiser s decision shall be final, conclusive, and binding on the parties.
