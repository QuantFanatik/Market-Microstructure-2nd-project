 ITEM 1. BUSINESS 
 Company Overview 
 We are a diversified real estate development and agribusiness company committed to responsibly using our land and resources to meet the housing, employment, and lifestyle needs of Californians and create value for our shareholders. Current operations consist of land planning and entitlement, land development, commercial land sales and leasing, leasing of land for mineral royalties, water asset management and sales, grazing leases, farming, and ranch operations. 
 These activities are performed through our five reporting segments: 
 
 Our prime asset is approximately 270,000 acres of contiguous, largely undeveloped land that, at its most southerly border, is 60 miles north of downtown Los Angeles and, at its most northerly border, is 15 miles east of Bakersfield. We create value by securing entitlements for our land, facilitating infrastructure development, strategic land planning, monetization of land through development and/or sales, and conservation in order to maximize the highest and best use for our land. We are involved in eight joint ventures that either own, develop, and/or operate real estate properties. We enter into joint ventures as a means to facilitate the development of portions of our land. 
 3 

Business Objectives and Strategies 
 Our primary business objective is to maximize long-term shareholder value through the monetization of our land-based assets. A key element of our strategy is to entitle and then develop large-scale mixed-use master planned residential and commercial/industrial real estate projects to serve the growing populations of Southern and Central California. Our mixed-use master planned residential developments have been approved to collectively include up to 35,278 housing units, and more than 35 million square feet of commercial space. We have obtained entitlements on Mountain Village at Tejon Ranch, or MV, and the first approved final map for the project consisting of 401 residential lots and parcels for hospitality, amenities, and public uses. In 2019, the Kern County Board of Supervisors unanimously reapproved the Grapevine at Tejon Ranch project, or Grapevine. Centennial at Tejon Ranch, or Centennial, had entitlements approved in 2018, and received legislative approvals in 2019 from the Los Angeles County Board of Supervisors. The approvals were litigated in May 2019 and the Company has since worked on addressing the ongoing litigation. 
 
 We are currently executing on value creation as we are engaged in construction, commercial sales, and leasing at our commercial/industrial center Tejon Ranch Commerce Center, or TRCC. The Kern County Board of Supervisors approved a Conditional Use Permit, authorizing development of multi-family apartment uses within the Tejon Ranch Commerce Center, on a 27-acre site located immediately north of the Outlets at Tejon. This authorization allows the Company to develop up to a maximum of 495 multi-family residences, in thirteen apartment buildings, as well as approximately 6,500 square feet of community amenity space and up to 8,000 square feet of community serving retail. All of these efforts are supported by diverse revenue streams generated from other operations including: farming, mineral resources, ranch operations, and our various joint ventures.

Real Estate Development Overview 
 Our real estate operations consist of the following activities: real estate development, commercial land sales and leasing, land planning and entitlement, and conservation. 
 Interstate 5, one of the nation s most heavily traveled freeways, brings in excess of 80,000 vehicles per day through our land, which includes 16 miles of Interstate 5 frontage on each side of the freeway and the commercial land surrounding three interchanges. The strategic plan for real estate focuses on development opportunities along the Interstate 5 and Highway 138 corridors, which includes TRCC in Kern County, Centennial, a mixed-use master planned community on our land in Los Angeles County, MV, a resort and residential community in Kern County, and Grapevine, a mixed-use master planned community on our land in Kern County. TRCC includes developments east and west of Interstate 5 at TRCC-East and TRCC-West, respectively. 
 The chart below is a continuum of the real estate development process highlighting each project's current status and key milestones to be met in moving through the real estate development process in California. During this process, we may experience delays arising from factors beyond our control. Such factors include litigation and a changing regulatory environment.

Operating Segments 
 Real Estate - Commercial/Industrial 
 
 A primary focus of the Company is our real estate commercial/industrial segment that includes: planning, and permitting of land held for development; construction of infrastructure; the construction of pre-leased buildings; the construction of buildings to be leased or sold; and the sale of land to third parties for their own development. The commercial/industrial segment also includes activities related to communications leases, a power plant lease, and landscape maintenance fees. 
 At the heart of our real estate commercial/industrial segment is TRCC, a 20 million square foot commercial/industrial development on Interstate 5 just north of the Los Angeles basin. The Los Angeles industrial market is the largest in the country by most measures, sitting at the center of a 2 billion square-foot Southern California industrial market. It has been characterized by some of the highest asking rents and lowest vacancy rates of any market in the nation. The Ports of Los Angeles and Long Beach are the primary industrial drivers and are responsible for over 40 of all inbound containers into the U.S. 
 As of December 31, 2022, our industrial portfolio, through our joint venture partnerships, consisted of 2.3 million square feet of gross leasable area, or GLA, and our TRCC commercial portfolio consisted of 620,907 square feet of GLA. As of December 31, 2022, our industrial portfolio was 100 leased and our commercial portfolio was 89 leased. Substantially all of our tenants are subject to net lease agreements. A net lease typically requires the tenant to be responsible for minimum monthly rent and property expenses including property taxes, insurance, and maintenance. 
 Over eight million square feet of industrial, commercial, and retail space has been developed at TRCC, including distribution centers for IKEA, Caterpillar, Famous Footwear, L'Oreal, Camping World, Sunrise Brands, and Dollar General. TRCC sits on both sides of Interstate 5, giving distributors immediate access to the west coast s principal north-south goods movement corridor. 
 
 10 

TRCC has a Foreign Trade Zone, or FTZ, designation, of approximately 1,094 acres, which allows a user within the FTZ to secure the many benefits and cost reductions associated with streamlined movement of goods in and out of a trade zone. TRCC's attractiveness as a commercial/industrial location is further enhanced by the Economic Development Incentive Policy, or EDIP, adopted by the Kern County Board of Supervisors. The EDIP is aimed to expand and enhance the County's competitiveness by taking affirmative steps to attract new businesses and to encourage the growth and resilience of existing businesses. The EDIP provides incentives such as assistance in obtaining state tax incentives, building supporting infrastructure, and workforce development. 
 Recent Developments 
 For a discussion of business developments that occurred in 2022, see Item 7 Management s Discussion and Analysis of 
 Financial Condition and Results of Operations later in this report. Certain summarized highlights are contained below. 
 Construction 
 On March 29, 2022, we formed TRC-MRC 5 LLC, a joint venture with Majestic Realty Co., or Majestic, a Los Angeles-based commercial industrial developer, to pursue the development, construction, lease-up, and management of an approximately 446,400 square foot industrial building located within TRCC-East. Construction began in 2023 with completion expected later this year. A lease has been secured, in advance of construction, for the entirety of this space by Sunrise Brands, a leading designer, producer, distributor, and retailer of both branded and private-label apparel. 
 Construction on the 629,274 square foot industrial building owned by TRC-MRC 4 LLC was completed in the fourth quarter of 2022, and the Company has leased 100 of the rentable space. 
 Land Sales 
 During 2022, the Company sold three land parcels, comprised of 98.2 acres, for 29,796,000 comprising of the following: 
 A 27.88 acre land parcel contributed with a fair value of 8,501,000 to TRC-MRC 5, LLC. The Company recognized revenues of 5,489,000 and deferred profit of 3,012,000 after applying the five-step revenue recognition model in accordance with ASC Topic 606 Revenue From Contracts With Customers and ASC Topic 323, Investments Equity Method and Joint Ventures. 
 58.0 acres of industrial land located at TRCC East to a major multinational corporation for 22,000,000. The Company recognized land sales revenue of 19,627,000 and deferred revenues of 2,373,000 attributable to a performance obligation within the contract after applying the five-step revenue recognition model in accordance with ASC Topic 606 - Revenue From Contracts With Customers. 
 12.3 acres of industrial land located at TRCC West to a third party for 4,680,000. 
 Investments 
 Leasing 
 Within our commercial/industrial segment, we lease land to various types of tenants. We currently lease land to two auto service stations with convenience stores, 13 fast-food operations, a motel, an antique shop, and a post office. 
 In addition, the Company leases several microwave repeater locations, radio and cellular transmitter sites, fiber optic cable routes, and 32 acres of land to Pastoria Energy Facility, L.L.C., or PEF, for an electric power plant.

The following table summarizes information with respect to lease expirations for our consolidated entities as of December 31, 2022.

 2 - This lease pertains to a communication lease that does not have defined rentable square feet. 
 3 - This amount includes 32 acres of the PEF ground lease. 
 
 For the year ended December 31, 2022, we had six lease renewals. 
 Joint Ventures 
 We use joint ventures to advance our development projects at TRCC. This allows us to combine our resources with other real estate companies and gain greater access to capital, share in the risks of real estate developments and share in the operating expenses. More importantly, it allows us to better manage the deployment of our capital and increase our leasing portfolio. 
 Our joint venture with TA/Petro owns and operates two travel and truck stop facilities, restaurants, and five separate gas stations with convenience stores within TRCC-West and TRCC-East. 
 We are involved in five joint ventures with Majestic to develop, lease, manage, and/or acquire industrial buildings within TRCC. These joint ventures currently operate four fully leased industrial buildings occupying over 2.3 million rentable square feet, and have a 446,400 square foot industrial building under construction. 
 We are involved in one joint venture with Rockefeller Development Group, or RDG, as of December 31, 2022. The TRCC/Rock Outlet Center LLC operates the Outlets at Tejon. Our previous joint venture with RDG, the 18-19 joint venture, sold its land to a third-party during the fourth quarter of 2021 for 15.2 million, and was dissolved in 2022. 
 12 

TRCC Residential 
 In 2021, the Kern County Board of Supervisors approved a Conditional Use Permit (CUP) which authorizes the development of a multi-family apartment complex within the TRCC. The approved CUP authorize the Company to develop up to a maximum of 495 multi-family residences, in thirteen apartment buildings, as well as approximately 6,500 square feet of community amenity space and 8,000 square feet of community serving retail, collectively known as TRCC Residential. TRCC Residential will be located on a 27-acre site located immediately north of the Outlets at Tejon. TRCC Residential will be the first residential community at TRCC and for the Company, providing an ideal housing option for the thousands of employees currently working at the various distribution centers, retailers and fast-food restaurants at TRCC. 
 On February 16, 2022, we formed TRC-MRC Multi I, LLC with Majestic for the development, leasing and management of this multi-family residential community. As of December 31, 2022, the Company controlled the joint venture and has consolidated its assets within the Consolidated Balance Sheet. On January 26, 2023, the Company and Majestic entered into a Membership Interest Purchase Agreement, formalizing the purchase of Majestic's interest in this joint venture for 175,000. The project is currently in its final planning and design phases. 
 TRCC Entitlements 
 The following is a summary of the Company's commercial, retail and industrial real estate developments as of December 31, 2022: 
 in thousands) Project Cost to Date Estimated Cost to Complete Total Estimated Cost at Completion Estimated Completion Date Tejon Ranch Commerce Center 97,734 100,589 198,323 TBD Less: Reimbursements from TRPFFA 1 
 82,976 48,846 131,822 TBD TRCC Development Costs, net 14,758 51,743 66,501 1 The Tejon Ranch Public Facilities Financing Authority, or TRPFFA, is a joint powers authority formed by Kern County and Tejon-Castac Water District, or TCWD, to finance public infrastructure within the Company s Kern County developments. TRPFFA, through bond sales, will reimburse the Company for qualifying infrastructure costs at TRCC. 
 
 The above costs have increased as a result of inflationary factors on things such as labor, fuel, and material costs. 
 The following table summarizes total entitlements for TRCC as of December 31, 2022: 
 (in square feet) Industrial Commercial Retail Total entitlements received 19,300,941 956,309 Total entitlements used 8,201,864 674,246 Entitlements available 11,099,077 282,063 
 
 We believe we are well positioned for long-term value creation as we continue with our current development plans at TRCC. This is evident in the 151 increase in land prices over the last five years, which reached 8.77 per square foot in 2022 compared with 3.50 per square foot in 2017. Industrial rents have increased 188 over the last five years, with rents at 0.72 per square foot in 2022 compared to 0.25 per square foot in 2017. Current entitlements available at TRCC can facilitate alternative uses and further increase the per acre value.

Commercial/industrial Real Estate Development Market Overview 
 The logistics operators currently located within TRCC have demonstrated success in serving all of California and the western region of the United States, and we are building on their success in our marketing efforts. We will continue to focus our marketing strategy for TRCC on the significant labor and logistical benefits of our site, the pro-business approach of Kern County, and the success of the current tenants and owners within our development. Our strategy fits within the logistics model that many companies are using, which favors large, centralized distribution facilities which have been strategically located to maximize the balance of inbound and outbound efficiencies, rather than several decentralized smaller distribution centers. Operators located within TRCC have demonstrated success through utilization of this model. With access to markets of over 40 million people for next-day delivery service, they are also demonstrating success with e-commerce fulfillment. 
 We believe that our ability to provide fully-entitled, shovel-ready land parcels to support buildings of any size, provides us with a marketing advantage. Our marketing efforts target industrial users in the Santa Clarita Valley of northern Los Angeles County, and the northern part of the San Fernando Valley for whom we may be an attractive location due to the limited availability of new product and high real estate costs in these locations. Tenants in these geographic areas are typically users of smaller facilities, but often are looking to expand operations and cannot find larger size buildings in these markets. We are also targeting larger users in the Inland Empire that are looking to relocate to lower their operating costs. 
 
 We continue to closely monitor new construction, specifically speculative construction in comparison to pre-lease and build to suit. Limited supply and an increase in demand has made the industrial property sector advantageous, positioning it for success 
 going into the next year. 
 The commercial/industrial real estate sales market is highly competitive, with competition throughout California. The principal factors of competition in this industry are price, availability of labor, proximity to the port complexes of Los Angeles and Long Beach and customer base. A potential disadvantage to our development strategy is our distance from the ports of Los Angeles and Long Beach in comparison to the warehouses and distribution centers located in the West Inland Empire. 
 Our most direct regional competitors are in the Inland Empire, a large industrial area located 60 miles east of Los Angeles, which continues its expansion eastward beyond Riverside and San Bernardino into the Perris, Moreno Valley, and Beaumont regions of Southern California. We also face competition within Northern Los Angeles, which is comprised of the San Fernando Valley and Santa Clarita Valley along with areas north of us in the San Joaquin Valley of California. Strong demand for large distribution facilities is driving development farther east in search for large, entitled parcels. As development in the Inland Empire continues to move east and farther away from the ports, our distance from the ports is becoming less of a disadvantage. 
 During the quarter ended December 31, 2022, vacancy rates in the Inland Empire ticked up to 0.9 and net absorption failed to surpass new supply. However, average asking rents posted a new record-high rate of 1.61 per square foot, a 50 jump from, 12 months ago. As lease rates increase in the Inland Empire, we may experience greater pricing advantages due to our lower land basis. Vacancy rates in the northern Los Angeles industrial market, which includes the San Fernando Valley and Santa Clarita Valley, increased 10 basis points to 0.7 . Average asking price continued to climb, posting another high-water mark at 1.64 per square foot in the San Fernando Valley and 1.46 per square foot in Santa Clarita. 
 Industrial vacancy rates are expected to remain low, and industrial users seeking larger spaces are going further north into neighboring Kern County, and particularly, TRCC, which has attracted increased attention as market conditions continue to tighten. Additionally, TRCC is in a position to capture tenant awareness due to our ability to provide a competitive alternative for users in the Inland Empire and the Santa Clarita Valley.

Real Estate - Resort/Residential 
 Our resort/residential segment activities include land entitlement, land planning and pre-construction engineering, and land stewardship and conservation activities. We have three major resort/residential communities within this segment: 
 Mountain Village at Tejon Ranch 
 Centennial at Tejon Ranch 
 Grapevine at Tejon Ranch 
 The entitlement process precedes the regulatory approvals necessary for land development and routinely takes several years to complete. The Conservation Agreement we entered into with five major environmental organizations in 2008 is designed to minimize opposition from environmental groups to these projects and eliminate or reduce the time spent in litigation once governmental approvals are received. Litigation by environmental and other special interest groups have been a primary cause of delays and increased costs for our real estate development projects as well as other projects in California. For discussion on legal matters pertaining to our developments, see Note 14 (Commitments and Contingencies) of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. 
 As we embark on our mixed-use master planned communities, we understand that it can take up to 25 years, or longer, to complete from commencement of construction. The entitlement process for development of property in California is complex, lengthy (spanning multiple years) and costly, involving numerous federal, state, and county regulatory approvals. We are unable to determine anticipated completion dates for our real estate development projects with certainty because the time for completion is heavily dependent on the regulatory approvals necessary for land development. Also, as a real estate developer, we are cognizant of the micro- and macro-economic factors that have a significant influence on the real estate sector. As a developer, one would be at an economic disadvantage to bring product to market with no willing or able buyers. This ebb and flow of the economy also plays into the timing of our completion date. Costs will also fluctuate over the life of these projects because of the cost of labor and raw materials and the timing of approvals and other activity. The uncertainty of estimated costs to completion is compounded by the potential impact of inflation, which will fluctuate with the equally uncertain completion dates for our projects.

Mountain Village at Tejon Ranch 

MV is planned to be an exclusive, low-density, resort-based community that will provide its owners and guests with a wide variety of recreational opportunities, lodging and spa facilities, putting greens, a range of housing options, and other exclusive services and amenities that are designed to distinguish MV as the resort community of choice for the Southern California market. MV encompasses 26,417 acres, including 5,082 acres for a mixed-use master planned community to include housing, lodging, retail, and commercial components. MV is entitled for 3,450 homes, 160,000 square feet of commercial development, 750 hotel keys, and 21,335 acres of open space. The first tentative tract map for the project, which includes 752 residential lots, was approved by Kern County in 2017. The first final map for the project consisting of 401 residential lots and parcels for hospitality, amenities, and public uses was approved by Kern County in December 2021. 
 The commercial component of the project is the 160,000 square foot commercial center that we call Farm Village (shown above). Farm Village will serve as the commercial center and community gathering place for MV residents and visitors, as well as the gateway to MV. Farm Village will include fresh culinary offerings, artisan markets, boutique lodging, and an array of trails, gardens, and agriculture that will be intertwined to create the most unique, relaxing and edutaining experience while fulfilling the needs of residents and visitors of MV. In 2018, we obtained commercial site plan approval from Kern County for the first phase of the Farm Village consisting of 53,180 square feet. 
 Timing of MV development in the coming years will be dependent on the strength of both the economy and the residential real estate market. We are currently exploring capital financing opportunities for the development of MV. Such financing opportunities could come from a variety of sources, such as joint ventures with financial partners, debt financing, or the Company s issuance of common stock. 
 18 

Centennial at Tejon Ranch 

The Centennial development is a mixed-use master planned community development encompassing 12,323 acres of our land within Los Angeles County. Centennial is entitled for 19,333 housing units, including nearly 3,500 affordable units, and 10.1 million square feet of commercial development. Centennial will incorporate business districts, schools, retail and entertainment centers, medical facilities and other commercial office and light industrial businesses that, when complete, will create a substantial number of jobs. The project is being developed by Centennial Founders, LLC, a consolidated joint venture in which we have a 93.27 ownership interest as of December 31, 2022. Centennial is envisioned to be an ecologically friendly community that will achieve a jobs-housing balance. 
 In 2018, the Los Angeles County Board of Supervisors took action to approve the Specific Plan and 30-Year Development Agreement for Centennial by a vote of 4-1. In 2019, the Los Angeles County Board of Supervisors' affirmed their final approval of Centennial project, and Climate Resolve and CBD/California Native Plant Society, or CNPS, separately filed actions in Los Angeles Superior Court objecting to the Centennial project. In 2021, the court issued its decision denying the petition for writ of mandate by CBD/CNPS and granting the petition for writ of mandate filed by Climate Resolve. On November 30, 2021, the Company and Centennial entered into a Settlement Agreement with Climate Resolve. The Company is now awaiting the Court s decision regarding the outcome of outstanding claims. See Note 14 (Commitments and Contingencies) of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statement for further discussion. 
 19 

Grapevine at Tejon Ranch 
 
 Grapevine is a mixed-use master planned community encompassing 8,010 acres of our lands within Kern County located on the San Joaquin Valley floor, adjacent to TRCC. Grapevine is entitled for 12,000 homes, 5.1 million square feet for commercial development, and more than 3,367 acres of open space and parks. The 4,643 acres designated for mixed-use development will include housing, retail, commercial, and industrial components. See Note 14 (Commitments and Contingencies) of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statement for further discussion. 
 Immediately northeast of Grapevine is Grapevine North, a 7,655-acre development area, that is currently used for agricultural purposes. Identified as a development area in the Tejon Ranch Conservation and Land Use Agreement, Grapevine North presents a significant opportunity for future development. Grapevine North may feature mixed use community development similar to Grapevine at Tejon Ranch, or other development uses as appropriate based upon market conditions at the time. 
 The greatest competition for the Centennial and Grapevine communities will come from developments in the Santa Clarita Valley, Lancaster, Palmdale, and Bakersfield. The developments in these areas will be providing similar housing product as our developments. The principal factors of competition in this industry are product segmentation, pricing of product, amenities offered, and location. We will attempt to differentiate our developments through our unique setting, land planning and different product offerings. MV will compete generally for discretionary dollars that consumers will allocate to recreational and residential homes.

 (3) Total estimated project costs are difficult to accurately forecast with any certainty at this time due to finalization of entitlement and mapping processes, as well as final engineering for the developments, and capital funding structure selected. Dollars presented in thousands. 
 Mineral Resources 
 Our mineral resources segment consists of oil and gas royalties, rock and aggregate royalties, royalties from a cement operation leased to National Cement Company of California, Inc., or National, and the management of water assets and water infrastructure. We continue to look for opportunities to grow our mineral resource revenues through expansion of leasing and encouraging new exploration. The management of our water assets consists of the evaluation of near-term highest and best uses, which can include the sale of water on a temporary basis, the use of water for internal purposes, and the storage of water for future use in our development projects. At the same time we are also evaluating opportunities as they arise for the purchase of additional water assets as we have done in the past. 
 Royalty rates are contractually defined and based on a percentage of production and are received in cash. Our royalty revenues fluctuate based on changes in the market prices for oil, natural gas, and rock and aggregate product, the inevitable decline in production of existing wells and quarries, and other factors affecting the third-party oil and natural gas exploration and production companies that operate on our lands including the cost of development and production. 
 Estimates of oil and gas reserves on our properties are unknown to us. We do not make such estimates, and our lessees do not make information concerning reserves available to us. 
 We lease certain portions of our land to oil companies for the exploration and production of oil and gas. We do not engage in any oil exploration or extraction activities. As of December 31, 2022, 10,332 acres were committed to producing oil and gas leases from which the operators produced and sold approximately 92,788 barrels of oil and 57,000 MCF (each MCF being 1,000 cubic feet) of dry gas during 2022. Our share of production, based upon average royalty rates during the last three years, has been 36, 29, and 37 barrels of oil per day for 2022, 2021, and 2020, respectively. There are 306 active oil wells located on the leased land as of December 31, 2022. Royalty rates on our leases averaged approximately 14 of oil production in 2022. 
 The price per barrel of oil increased in the first-half of 2022 and declined in the second-half of 2022. Prices for oil, natural gas fluctuate in response to relatively minor changes in supply and demand, market uncertainty and a variety of additional factors that are beyond our control, such as: changes in domestic and global supply and demand, domestic and global inventory levels, and political and economic conditions, including international disputes such as current conflicts in Eastern Europe. 
 We have approximately 2,000 acres under lease to National, for the purpose of manufacturing Portland cement from limestone deposits found on the leased acreage. National owns and operates a cement manufacturing plant on our property with a production capacity in excess of 1,000,000 tons of cement per year. The amount of payment that we receive under the lease is based upon shipments from the cement plant. In 2022, payments increased due to an increase in production stemming from an increase in regional construction as well as price increases driven by inflationary pressures. The term of this lease expires in 2026, however National has options to extend the lease until 2095. 
 We also lease 521 acres to Granite Construction and Griffith Construction for the mining of rock and aggregate product that is used in construction of roads and bridges. The royalty revenues we receive under this arrangement are based upon the amount of product produced at these sites. The Granite site has reached its economic life and will undergo restoration activities during 2023. We also have a royalty arrangement with Granite Construction tied to land previously owned by the Company that began operations in 2021 and is now paying royalty payments which will more than offset the payments received from the old Granite site. 
 21 

Water sales opportunities each year are impacted by rain and snowfall volume along with California State Water Project, or SWP, allocations. The current SWP allocation is at 35 of contract amounts with an expectation that the allocation will increase. At higher SWP allocations we anticipate a reduced amount of water will be sold in 2023. 
 In 2015, we entered into a water sale agreement with PEF, our current lessee under a power plant lease. PEF may purchase from us up to 3,500 acre feet of water per year through July 2030, with an option to extend the term. PEF is under no obligation to purchase water from us in any given year, but is required to pay us an annual option payment equal to 30 of the maximum annual payment. The price of the water under the agreement is subject to 3 annual increases for the duration of the lease agreement. The Company's commitments to sell this water can be met through current water sources. 
 Farming Operations 
 In the San Joaquin Valley, we farm permanent crops including the following acreage: wine grapes 1,036 (849 in production and 187 under development); almonds 2,235 (1,487 in production and 748 under development); and pistachios 932 (all in production). We manage the farming of alfalfa and forage mix on 626 acres in the Antelope Valley, and we periodically lease 530 acres of land that is used for the growing of vegetables which can also be used for the development of permanent crops such as almonds. 
 Pricing for nut and grape crops are particularly sensitive to the size of each year s world crop and demand for those crops. The U.S. almond industry projects 2022 yields to be about 2.6 billion pounds compared to 2.9 billion pounds during the previous year. High production levels combined with higher-than-normal inventory levels from the 2021 crop year as a result of supply chain issues have pushed prices to lower levels. We expect prices to remain low until industry inventory levels are reduced, which may not happen until after 2023. We have begun to see some improvement as January 2023 almond shipments increased to pre-Covid levels. Pistachios for the 2022 crop year are expected to be approximately 1.0 billion pounds compared to 1.2 billion pounds during the previous year. Yields for the Company's 2022 almond and wine grape crops have been comparable with prior year's thus far, while pistachio yields have seen a decrease. Tariffs from China and India, which are major customers of almonds and pistachios, can make American products less competitive and push customers to switch to another producing country. 
 The Company, and the industry as a whole, continues to experience challenges with attracting and retaining farm workers. The Company is unable to determine the expected duration of these labor shortages. 
 Labor costs both internal and through labor contractors continue to increase and the Company expects this trend to continue over the foreseeable future. The Company utilizes external labor contractors as necessary for large projects such as pruning and harvesting as a way to manage our labor needs. From a broader inflationary standpoint, the Company is seeing and will continue to see an increase in production costs, most notably chemicals such as herbicides and pesticides, and fuel costs. 
 Sales of our grape crop typically occur in the third and fourth quarters of the calendar year. Sales of our pistachio and almond crops also typically occur in the third and fourth quarters of the calendar year, but can occur up to a year or more after each crop is harvested. In 2022, we sold 40 of our grape crop to one winery, 38 to a second winery and the remainder to two other customers. These sales are under contracts ranging from one to eight years. In 2022, our almonds were sold to various commercial buyers, with the largest buyer accounting for 34 of our crop. We do not believe that we would be adversely affected by the loss of any or all of these buyers because of the markets for these commodities, the large number of buyers that would be available to us, and the fact that the prices for these commodities do not vary based on the identity of the buyer or the size of the contract. 
 Weather conditions could impact the number of tree and vine dormant hours, which are integral to tree and vine growth. We will not know the impact of current weather conditions on 2023 production until the early summer of 2023. 
 At this time the State Department of Water Resources has announced that the estimated water supply for 2023 will be at 35 of full entitlement. This allocation may change based upon precipitation and snowpack runoff in Northern California from additional potential winter storms. The current 35 allocation of SWP water is enough for us to farm our crops. We have additional water resources, such as groundwater and surface sources, and those of the water districts we are in, that allow us to have sufficient water for our farming needs. It is too early in the year to determine the impact of 2023 water supplies on 2023 California crop production for almonds, pistachios, and wine grapes. See discussion of water contract entitlement and long-term outlook for water supply under Item 2, Properties. Also see Note 6. (Long-Term Water Assets) of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding our water assets.

Ranch Operations 
 Our ranch operations segment consists of game management revenues and ancillary land uses such as grazing leases and filming. Within game management, we operate our High Desert Hunt Club, a premier upland bird hunting club. The High Desert Hunt Club offers over 6,400 acres and 35 hunting fields, each field providing different terrain and challenges. The hunting season runs from mid-October through March. We also sell individual hunting packages as well as seasonal hunting memberships. 
 Approximately 256,000 acres are used for two grazing leases, which account for 29 of total revenues from ranch operations at December 31, 2022. 
 Game management offers a wide variety of guided big game hunts, including trophy Rocky Mountain elk, deer, turkey and wild pig. We offer guided hunts and memberships for both the Spring and Fall hunting seasons. At December 31, 2022, game management accounts for 42 of the total revenue from ranch operations. 
 In addition, the Ranch Operations segment manages, and includes the expenses for the upkeep, maintenance, and security of all 270,000 acres of land. 
 General Environmental Regulation 
 Our operations are subject to federal, state, and local environmental laws and regulations including laws relating to water, air, solid waste, and hazardous substances. Although we believe that we are in material compliance with these requirements, there can be no assurance that we will not incur costs, penalties, and liabilities, including those relating to claims for damages to property or natural resources, resulting from our operations. Environmental liabilities may also arise from claims asserted by adjacent landowners or other third parties. We also expect continued legislation and regulatory development in the area of climate change and greenhouse gases. It is unclear as of this date how any such developments will affect our business. Enactment of new environmental laws or regulations, or changes in existing laws or regulations or the interpretation of these laws or regulations, might require expenditures in the future. We historically have not had material environmental liabilities. 
 Environmental Sustainability 
 Environmental stewardship, or sustainability, is one of Tejon Ranch Co. s core values, along with quality and visionary innovation and development. This commitment to sustainability manifests itself in many ways throughout the Company and its operations. 
 Climate Change 
 The Company maintains policies intended to both reduce its carbon footprint and proactively sequester, or capture and store, carbon. 
 Since 2008, the Company has voluntarily conserved 240,000 acres of its land covered by trees and other vegetation. A recent analysis conducted for the Company by Dudek Environmental Service's determined that this acreage effectively sequesters 3.3 million tons of carbon. That equals the volume of carbon produced in a single year by 2.5 million passenger vehicles, approximately 5 of California s 2022 passenger vehicle fleet. 
 Solar power is used significantly within TRCC. For example, the Company installed a solar covered parking structure at the Outlets at Tejon. The structure covers 1.85 acres and is projected to offset 83 of the center s electricity needs for shared spaces and produce 1,076,000 kWh of clean energy every year. In addition, the IKEA distribution center at TRCC features a 1.8 MW photovoltaic solar array covering 370,000 square feet of the warehouse s rooftop. The system handles the power needs of IKEA s distribution center and provides power into the electric grid as well. 
 The Company is working with Calpine Energy, a power generating company, to complete the development of a 600-acre industrial-sized solar field. Located immediately adjacent to Calpine s PEF, a natural gas and steam powered generating plant in the San Joaquin Valley portion of Tejon Ranch, the solar array is expected to produce approximately 100 MW of power once fully operational. 
 The Company s master planned mixed-use residential communities are designed with a jobs housing balance that will locate housing near employment centers, reducing commuting miles and emissions. Centennial is designed to be a net zero carbon community, completely mitigating projected carbon emissions through a combination of on-site and on-ranch carbon reduction measures, and off-ranch credited carbon reductions. These measures include encouraging and facilitating the use of emission-free electric vehicles through vehicle purchase incentives and the installation of 30,000 EV chargers located within both residential and commercial sections of the community, at TRCC, and within disadvantaged communities in Southern California. At Centennial, at least 50 of the energy supply is intended to be 
 23 

produced by on-site renewable sources, and natural gas use in the community will be limited to essential commercial uses only, significantly reducing emissions from residential and commercial natural gas. 
 At Grapevine, like Centennial, 50 or more of its energy supply is intended to be produced on site by renewable sources, and natural gas will not be installed in homes to further reduce carbon emissions. 
 All homes in Mountain Village will feature roof-top photovoltaic solar arrays and battery energy storage systems where required by code. 
 
 Air Quality 
 The Company has contracted with the San Joaquin Valley Unified Air Pollution Control District, or SJVUAPCD, to pre-mitigate air emissions related to the Company s current development at TRCC-East and future development at Mountain Village and Grapevine. As of 2022, the SJVUAPCD had fully offset current air emissions at TRCC-East, as well as future emissions projected to occur through full build-out of the project. For Mountain Village, the Company has funded the replacement of outdated agricultural engines to provide emissions mitigation for the initial phase of development. 
 Nearly two decades ago, the Company helped establish and has continuously supported Valley Clean Air Now, or VCAN, a non-profit, 501(c)(3) public charity that advances quantifiable and voluntary solutions addressing air pollution in California s San Joaquin Valley, a region with some of the worst air quality and highest poverty levels in the United States. The Company continues to support VCAN in its mission to improve public health and quality of life in disadvantaged communities located in the region. 
 VCAN s programs deliver 850 smog repair vouchers and 9,500 in down payment incentives to low-income residents in the region so they can replace high-polluting vehicles with used plug-in or hybrid cars. 
 In the past five years, VCAN has helped more than 35,000 households improve their vehicle emissions by completing over 20,000 smog repairs and providing more than 26,000 smog repair vouchers. Additionally, VCAN s vehicle replacement program has delivered more than 2,000 plug-in electric vehicles. Based on pre- and post-repair emission capture readings, VCAN s vehicle repair and replacement work has reduced oxides of nitrogen (also known as NOx by 692 tons, carbon monoxide by 71 tons, and hydro-carbon emissions by 90 tons. 
 
 Water Conservation 
 At TRCC-East, all water used for irrigation purposes is reclaimed water from the water treatment plant. Landscaping at the Outlets at Tejon consists of drought-tolerant, native planting material. 
 Each of the Company s master planned mixed-use residential communities will feature state-of-the-art water conservation measures, reclaimed water for irrigation, stormwater capture, and drought-tolerant landscaping. 
 The Company s agricultural operations use highly efficient drip irrigation to water its orchards and vineyards. 
 We are involved in water storage and water recharge programs in the water basins in which we have operations. 
 Customers 
 Our PEF power plant lease accounted for 6 of total revenues in 2022, 8 in 2021 and 12 in 2020. No other recurring customer represents 5 or more of our revenues in 2022, 2021 and 2020. 
 Organization 
 Tejon Ranch Co. is a Delaware corporation incorporated in 1987 to succeed the business operated as a California corporation since 1936. 
 24 

Human Capital 
 At December 31, 2022, we had 78 full-time employees. We believe our employees are among our most important resources and are critical to our continued success. We focus significant attention on attracting and retaining talented and experienced individuals to manage and support our operations. To attract and retain top talent, we have designed our compensation and benefits programs to provide a balanced and effective reward structure. Our short and long-term incentive programs are aligned with key business objectives and are intended to motivate strong performance. Our employees are eligible for medical, dental and vision insurance, a 401(k) savings/retirement plan, employer-provided life and disability insurance and an array of voluntary benefits designed to meet individual needs. We have adopted a Compliance with State and Federal Statutes, Rules and Regulations Reporting Policy that applies to all of our employees. Its receipt and review by each employee is documented and verified quarterly. None of our employees are covered by a collective bargaining agreement. 
 Diversity, Equity and Inclusion 
 Our policies are designed to promote fairness, equal opportunities, and diversity within the Company. When attracting, developing and retaining talent, we seek individuals who hold varied experiences and viewpoints and embody our core values to create an inclusive and diverse culture and workplace that allows each employee to do their best work and drive our collective success. We believe that a diverse workforce possesses a broader array of perspectives that businesses need to remain competitive in today s economy. We maintain employment policies that comply with federal, state and local labor laws and promote a culture of fairness and respect. These policies set forth our goal to provide equal employment opportunity without discrimination or harassment on the basis of age, gender (including identity or expression), marital status, civil partnership status, sexual orientation, disability, color, nationality, race or ethnic origin, or religion or belief. All of our employees must adhere to a Code of Business Conduct and Ethics that sets standards for appropriate behavior, and all employees must also complete required internal training on respect in the workplace and diversity to further enhance our cultural behaviors. 
 Reports 
 We make available free of charge through our Internet website, www.tejonranch.com, our annual report on Form 10-K, quarterly reports on Form 10-Q, current reports on Form 8-K and amendments to these reports filed or to be furnished pursuant to Section 13(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, as soon as reasonably practicable after we electronically file such material with or furnish it to the SEC.

 ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS 
 The risks and uncertainties described below are not the only ones facing the Company. If any of the following risks occur, our business, financial condition, results of operations or future prospects could be materially adversely affected. Our strategy, focused on more aggressive development of our land, involves significant risk and could result in operating losses. The risks that we describe in our public filings are not the only risks that we face. Additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us, or that we currently consider immaterial, also may materially adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations. 
 STRATEGIC RISKS 
 
 Strategic risk relates to the Company's future business plans and strategies, including the risks associated with the macro- and micro- environment in which we operate, including the demand for our products and services, the success of investments in our real estate development, technology and public policy. 
 Adverse changes in economic conditions in markets where we conduct our operations and where prospective purchasers of our future homes and commercial products live could reduce the demand for our products and, as a result, could adversely affect our business, results of operations, and financial condition. Adverse changes in economic conditions in markets where we conduct our operations and where prospective purchasers of our real estate products live have had and may in the future have a negative impact on our business. Adverse changes in employment levels, job growth, consumer confidence, interest rates, and population growth, or an oversupply of product for sale or lease may reduce demand and depress prices and cause buyers to cancel their purchase agreements. This, in turn, could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition. 
 Higher interest rates and lack of available financing can have significant impacts on the real estate industry . Higher interest rates generally impact the real estate industry by making it harder for buyers to qualify for financing, which can lead to a decrease in the demand for residential, commercial or industrial sites. Higher interest rates can also lead to tighter construction lending markets impacting the development of industrial buildings within our projects. Any decrease in demand 
 26 

will negatively impact our proposed developments. Lack of available credit to finance real estate purchases can also negatively impact demand. Any downturn in the economy or consumer confidence can also be expected to result in reduced housing demand and slower industrial development, which would negatively impact the demand for land we are developing. 
 We are subject to various land use regulations and require governmental approvals and permits for our developments that could be denied . In planning and developing our land, we are subject to various local, state, and federal statutes, ordinances, rules and regulations concerning zoning, infrastructure design, subdivision of land, and construction. All of our new developments require amending existing general plan and zoning designations, so it is possible that our entitlement applications could be denied. In addition, the zoning that ultimately is approved could include density provisions that would limit the number of homes and other structures that could be built within the boundaries of a particular area, which could adversely impact the financial returns from a given project. Many states, cities and counties (including neighboring Ventura County) have in the past approved various slow growth or urban limit line measures. If that were to occur in the jurisdictions governing the Company s land use, our future real estate development activities could be significantly adversely affected. 
 Third-party litigation could increase the time and cost of our development efforts . The land use approval processes we must follow to ultimately develop our projects have become increasingly complex. Moreover, the statutes, regulations and ordinances governing the approval processes provide third parties the opportunity to challenge the proposed plans and approvals. As a result, the prospect of third-party challenges to planned real estate developments provides additional uncertainties in real estate development planning and entitlements. Third-party challenges in the form of litigation could result in denial of the right to develop, or would, by their nature, adversely affect the length of time and the cost required to obtain the necessary approvals. In addition, adverse decisions arising from any litigation would increase the costs and length of time to obtain ultimate approval of a project and could adversely affect the design, scope, plans and profitability of a project. 
 We are subject to environmental regulations and opposition from environmental groups that could cause delays and increase the costs of our development efforts or preclude such development entirely . Environmental laws that apply to a given site can vary greatly according to the site s location and condition, present and former uses of the site, and the presence or absence of sensitive elements like wetlands and endangered species. Federal and state environmental laws also govern the construction and operation of our projects and require compliance with various environmental regulations, including analysis of the environmental impact of our projects and evaluation of our reduction in the projects carbon footprint and greenhouse gas emissions. Environmental laws and conditions may result in delays, cause us to incur additional costs for compliance, mitigation and processing land use applications, or preclude development in specific areas. In addition, in California, third parties have the ability to file litigation challenging the approval of a project which they usually do by alleging inadequate disclosure and mitigation of the environmental impacts of the project. Certain groups opposed to development have made clear they intend to oppose our projects vigorously, so litigation challenging their approval is expected. Currently, the Centennial entitlement approval has been opposed through litigation against the Company and Los Angeles County. At Grapevine, the issues most commonly cited in opponents public comments include the poor air quality of the San Joaquin Valley air basin, potential impacts of projects on the California condor and other species of concern, the potential for our lands to function as wildlife movement corridors, potential impacts of our projects on traffic and air quality in Los Angeles County, emissions of greenhouse gases, water availability and criticism of proposed development in rural areas as being sprawl. In addition, California has a specific statutory and regulatory scheme intended to reduce greenhouse gas emissions in the state and efforts to enact federal legislation to address climate change concerns could require further reductions in our projects carbon footprint in the future. 
 Until final permits are received, litigation is complete, and final maps are received, we will have a limited inventory of real estate . Each of our four current and planned real estate projects, TRCC, Centennial, MV, and Grapevine involve obtaining various governmental agency permits, overcoming litigation, and receiving final maps from local jurisdictions. A delay in achieving these items could lead to additional costs related to these developments and potentially lost opportunities for the sale of lots to developers and land users. 
 We are in competition with several other developments for customers and residents . Within our real estate activities, we are in direct competition for customers with other industrial sites in Northern, Central, and Southern California. We are also in competition with other highway interchange locations using Interstate 5 and State Route 99 for commercial leasing opportunities. Once they receive all necessary permits and approvals, Centennial and Grapevine will ultimately compete with other residential housing options in the region, such as developments in the Santa Clarita Valley, Lancaster, Palmdale, and Bakersfield. MV will compete generally for discretionary dollars that consumers will allocate to recreation and second homes, so its competition will include a greater area and range of projects. Intense competition may decrease our sales and harm our results of operations. 
 27 

Increases in taxes or government fees could increase our cost, and adverse changes in tax laws could reduce demand for homes in our future residential communities. Increases in real estate taxes and other local government fees, such as fees imposed on developers to fund schools, open space, and road improvements, could increase our costs and have an adverse effect on our operations. In addition, any changes to income tax laws that would reduce or eliminate tax deductions or incentives to homeowners, such as a change limiting the deductibility of real estate taxes or interest on home mortgages, could make housing less affordable or otherwise reduce the demand for housing, which in turn could reduce future sales. 
 Our developable land is concentrated entirely in California . All of our developable land is in California and our business is especially sensitive to the economic conditions within California. Any adverse change in the economic climate of California, or our regions of that state, and any adverse change in the political or regulatory climate of California, or the counties where our land is located could adversely affect our real estate development activities. Ultimately, our ability to sell or lease lots may decline as a result of weak economic conditions or restrictive regulations. 
 We have in the past and may in the future encounter other risks that could impact our ability to develop our land . We have in the past and may in the future encounter other difficulties in developing our land, including: 
 Difficulty in securing adequate water resources for future developments; 
 Natural risks, such as geological and soil problems, earthquakes, fire, heavy rains and flooding, and heavy winds; 
 Shortages of qualified trades people; 
 Reliance on local contractors, who may be inadequately capitalized; 
 Shortages of materials; and 
 Increases in the cost of materials. 
 A prolonged downturn in the real estate market or instability in the mortgage and commercial real estate financing industry, could have an adverse effect on our real estate business. Our residential housing projects, Centennial, MV, and Grapevine, are currently in the litigation phase, permitting phase, or are fully entitled and waiting for development to begin. If a downturn in the real estate market or an instability in the mortgage and commercial real estate financing industry exists at the time these projects move into their development and marketing phases, our resort/residential business could be adversely affected. An excess supply of homes available due to foreclosures or the expectation of deflation in housing prices could also have a negative impact on our ability to sell our inventory when it becomes available. The inability of potential commercial/industrial clients to get adequate financing for the expansion of their businesses could lead to reduced lease revenues and sales of land within our industrial development. 
 OPERATIONAL RISKS 
 Operational risk relates to risks arising from external market factors that affect the operation of our businesses. It includes weather and other natural conditions; regulatory requirements; information management and data protection and security, including cybersecurity; supply chain and business disruption; and other risks, including human resources and reputation. 
 We are involved in a cyclical industry and are affected by changes in general and local economic conditions . The real estate development industry is cyclical and is significantly affected by changes in general and local economic conditions, including: 
 Employment levels 
 Availability of financing 
 Interest rates 
 Consumer confidence 
 Demand for the developed product, whether residential or industrial 
 Supply of similar product, whether residential or industrial 
 The process of a project's development begins, and financial and other resources are committed long before a real estate project comes to market, which could occur at a time when the real estate market is depressed. It is also possible in a rural area like ours that no market for the project will develop as projected. 
 28 

The inability of a client tenant to pay us rent adversely affects our business. Our commercial revenues are derived primarily from rental payments and reimbursement of operating expenses under our leases. If our client tenants fail to make rental payments under their leases, our financial condition and cash flows could be adversely affected. 
 Our inability to renew leases or re-lease space on favorable terms as leases expire may significantly affect our business. Some of our revenues are derived from rental payments and reimbursement of operating expenses under our leases. If a client tenant experiences a downturn in its business or other types of financial distress, it may be unable to make timely payments under its lease. Also, if our client tenants terminate early or decide not to renew their leases, we may not be able to re-lease the space. Even if client tenants decide to renew or lease space, the terms of renewals or new leases, including the cost of any tenant improvements, concessions, and lease commissions, may be less favorable to us than current lease terms. Consequently, we could generate less cash flow from the affected properties than expected, which could negatively impact our business. We may have to divert cash flow generated by other properties to meet our debt service payments, if any, or to pay other expenses related to owning the affected properties. 
 We may experience increased operating costs, which may reduce profitability to the extent that we are unable to pass those costs on to client tenants. Our properties are subject to increases in operating expenses including insurance, property taxes, utilities, administrative costs, and other costs associated with security, landscaping, and repairs and maintenance of our properties. We cannot be certain that our client tenants will be able to bear the full burden of costs such as real estate taxes, insurance, utilities, common area and other expenses that we pass along through our leases, or that such increased costs will not lead them, or other prospective client tenants, to seek space elsewhere. If operating expenses increase, the availability of other comparable space in the markets we operate in may hinder or limit our ability to increase our rents, if operating expenses increase without a corresponding increase in revenues, our profitability could diminish. 
 From time to time we experience shortages or increased costs of labor and supplies or other circumstances beyond our control that cause delays or increased costs within our industrial development, which can adversely affect our operating results. Our ability to develop our current industrial development has in the past and may in the future be adversely affected by circumstances beyond our control including: work stoppages, labor disputes and shortages of qualified trades people; changes in laws relating to union organizing activity; and shortages, delays in availability, or fluctuations in prices of building materials (including as a result of inflation). Any of these circumstances could give rise to delays in the start or completion of, or could increase the cost of, developing infrastructure and buildings within our industrial development. If any of the above happens, our operating results could be harmed. 
 We are dependent on key personnel and the loss of one or more of those key personnel may materially and adversely affect our prospects . Our future success depends, to a significant degree, on the efforts of our senior management. The loss of key personnel could materially and adversely affect our results of operations, financial condition, or our ability to pursue land development. Our success will also depend in part on our ability to attract and retain additional qualified management personnel. 
 Volatile oil and natural gas prices could adversely affect our cash flows and results of operations. Our cash flows and results of operations are dependent in part on oil and natural gas prices, which are volatile. Oil and natural gas prices also impact the amount we receive for our mineral leases. Moreover, oil and natural gas prices depend on factors we cannot control, such as: changes in foreign and domestic supply and demand for oil and natural gas; weather; political conditions in other oil-producing countries, including the possibilities of insurgency or war in such areas; prices of foreign exports; domestic and international drilling activity; price and availability of alternate fuel sources; the value of the U.S. dollar relative to other major currencies; the level and effect of trading in commodity markets; and the effect of worldwide energy conservation measures and governmental regulations. Substantial or extended decline in the price of oil and gas could have a negative impact on our business, liquidity, financial condition and results of operations. Substantial or extended declines in future natural gas or crude oil prices could have an adverse effect on our future business, liquidity, financial condition and results of operations. 
 Our reserves and production will decline from their current levels. The rate of production from oil and natural gas properties generally decline as reserves are produced. Any decline in production or reserves could materially and adversely affect our future cash flow, liquidity and results of operations. 
 Water delivery and water availability continues to be a long-term concern within California. Any limitation of delivery of SWP water, limitations on our ability to move our water resources, and the absence of available reliable alternatives during drought periods could potentially cause permanent damage to orchards and vineyards and possibly impact future development opportunities. 
 Our future revenue and profitability related to our water resources will primarily be dependent on our ability to acquire and sell water assets. In light of the fact that our water resources represent a portion of our overall business at present, our long-term profitability will be affected by various factors, including the availability and timing of water resource acquisitions, regulatory 
 29 

approvals and permits associated with such acquisitions, transportation arrangements, and changing technology. We may also encounter unforeseen technical or other difficulties which could result in cost increases with respect to our water resources. Moreover, our profitability is significantly affected by changes in the market price of water. Future sales and prices of water may fluctuate widely as demand is affected by climatic, economic, demographic and technological factors as well as the relative strength of the residential, commercial, financial, and industrial real estate markets. The factors described above are not within our control. 
 Natural and man-made disasters, public health crises, political instability, and other potentially catastrophic events may have an adverse impact on our business and operating results and could decrease the value of our assets. Natural and man-made disasters, public health crises, political instability, and other potentially catastrophic events including terrorist attacks, particularly those that may cause a decline in global economic activity could have a material adverse impact on our business, our operating results, and the market price of our common stock. Catastrophic events occurring anywhere in the world may result in declining economic activity, which could reduce the demand for and the value of our properties. To the extent that catastrophic events impact our client tenants, their businesses similarly could be adversely affected, including their ability to continue to honor their lease obligations. Disruptions to the global economy can also impact demand for and the prices of our products, which could adversely affect our future cash flow and results of operations. 
 Information technology failures and data security breaches could harm our business. We use information technology and other computer resources to carry out important operational and marketing activities and to maintain our business records. These information technology systems are dependent upon global communications providers, web browsers, telephone systems and other aspects of the Internet infrastructure that have experienced security breaches, cyber-attacks, significant systems failures and electrical outages in the past. A material network breach in the security of our information technology systems could include the theft of customer, employee or company data. The release of confidential information as a result of a security breach may also lead to litigation or other proceedings against us by affected individuals or business partners, or by regulators, and the outcome of such proceedings, which could include penalties or fines, could have a significant negative impact on our business. We may also be required to incur significant costs to protect against damages caused by these information technology failures or security breaches in the future. However, we cannot provide assurance that a security breach, cyber-attack, data theft or other significant systems failure will not occur in the future, and such occurrences could have a material and adverse effect on our consolidated results of operations or financial position. 
 Increased cybersecurity requirements, vulnerabilities, threats and more sophisticated and targeted computer crime could pose a risk to our systems, networks, products, solutions, services and data. Increased global cybersecurity vulnerabilities, threats and more sophisticated and targeted cyber-related attacks pose a risk to our security and our customers', partners', suppliers' and third-party service providers' products, systems and networks and the confidentiality, availability and integrity of the data. We remain potentially vulnerable to additional known or unknown threats despite our attempts to mitigate these risks. We also may have access to sensitive, confidential or personal data or information that is subject to privacy and security laws, regulations or customer-imposed controls. Our efforts to protect sensitive, confidential or personal data or information, may nonetheless leave us vulnerable to material security breaches, theft, misplaced or lost data, programming errors, employee errors and/or malfeasance that could potentially lead to the compromising of sensitive, confidential or personal data or information, improper use of our systems, software solutions or networks, unauthorized access, use, disclosure, modification or destruction of information, production downtimes and operational disruptions. In addition, a cyber-related attack could result in other negative consequences, including damage to our reputation or competitiveness, remediation or increased protection costs, litigation or regulatory action. Additionally, violations of privacy or cybersecurity laws (including the California Consumer Privacy Act), regulations or standards increasingly lead to class-action and other types of litigation, which can result in substantial monetary judgments or settlements. Therefore, any such security breaches could have a material adverse effect on us. 
 Inflation can have a significant adverse effect on our operations. Inflation can have a major impact on our farming operations. The farming operations are most affected by escalating costs, unpredictable revenues and very high irrigation water costs. High fixed water costs related to our farm lands will continue to adversely affect earnings. Prices received for many of our products are dependent upon prevailing market conditions and commodity prices. Therefore, it is difficult for us to accurately predict revenue, just as we cannot pass on cost increases caused by general inflation, except to the extent reflected in market conditions and commodity prices. 
 Inflation can adversely impact our real estate operations, by increasing costs of material and labor as well as the cost of capital, which can impact operating margins. In an inflationary environment, we may not be able to increase prices at the same pace as the increase in inflation, which would further erode operating margins. 
 Government policies and regulations, particularly those affecting the agricultural sector and related industries, could adversely affect our operations and profitability. Agricultural commodity production and trade flows are significantly 
 30 

affected by government policies and regulations. Governmental policies affecting the agricultural industry, such as taxes, trade tariffs, duties, subsidies, import and export restrictions on commodities and commodity products, can influence industry profitability, the planting of certain crops, the location and size of crop production, whether unprocessed or processed commodity products are traded, and the volume and types of imports and exports. In addition, international trade disputes can adversely affect trade flows by limiting or disrupting trade between countries or regions. Future governmental policies, regulations or actions affecting our industry may adversely affect the supply of, demand for and prices of our products, restrict our ability to do business and cause our financial results to suffer. 
 Our efforts, goals and disclosures related to environmental stewardship and sustainability matters expose us to risks that can adversely affect our reputation and performance. Our commitment to sustainability with respect to climate change, air quality, and water conservation reflect our current plans and aspirations and are not guarantees that we will be able to achieve our goals. Our failure, or perceived failure, to achieve these goals and objectives on a timely basis, or at all, could adversely affect our reputation, stock price, operations, financial performance and growth, and expose us to increased scrutiny from the investment community as well as enforcement authorities. 
 FINANCIAL RISKS 
 Financial risk relates to our ability to meet financial obligations and mitigate exposure to broad market risks, including volatility in interest rates and commodity prices; credit risk; and liquidity risk, including risk related to our credit ratings and our availability and cost of funding. Credit risk is the risk of financial loss arising from a customer or counterparty failure to meet its contractual obligations. We face credit risk in our industrial businesses, as well as in our investing and leasing activities and derivative financial instruments activities. Liquidity risk refers to the potential inability to meet contractual or contingent financial obligations (whether on- or off-balance sheet) as they arise, and could potentially impact an institution s financial condition or overall safety and soundness. 
 Constriction of the credit markets or other adverse changes in capital market conditions could limit our ability to access capital and increase our cost of capital. During past economic downturns, we relied principally on positive operating cash flow, cash and investments, and equity offerings to meet current working capital needs, entitlement investment, and investment within our developments. Any slowdown in the economy could negatively impact our access to credit markets and may limit our sources of liquidity in the future and potentially increase our costs of capital. 
 We regularly assess our projected capital requirements to fund future growth in our business, repay our debt obligations, and support our other general corporate and operational needs, and we regularly evaluate our opportunities to raise additional capital. As market conditions permit, we may issue new equity securities through the public capital markets, enter new joint ventures, or obtain additional bank financing to fund our projected capital requirements or provide additional liquidity. Adverse changes in economic, or capital market conditions could negatively affect our business, liquidity and financial results. 
 Our business model is very dependent on transactions with strategic partners. We may not be able to successfully (1) attract desirable strategic partners; (2) complete agreements with strategic partners; and/or (3) manage relationships with strategic partners going forward, any of which could adversely affect our business. A key to our development and value creation strategies has been the use of joint ventures and strategic relationships. These joint venture partners bring development experience, industry expertise, financial resources, financing capabilities, brand recognition and credibility or other competitive assets. 
 A complicating factor in any joint venture is that strategic partners may have economic or business interests or goals that are inconsistent with ours or that are influenced by factors related to our business. These competing interests lead to the difficult challenges of successfully managing the relationship and communication between strategic partners and monitoring the execution of the partnership plan. We may also be subject to adverse business consequences if the market reputation or financial position of the strategic partner deteriorates. If we cannot successfully execute transactions with strategic partners, our business could be adversely affected. 
 Inability to comply with long-term debt covenants, restrictions or limitations could adversely affect our financial condition. Our ability to meet our debt service and other obligations and the financial covenants under our credit facility will depend, in part, upon our future financial performance. Our future results are subject to the risks and uncertainties described in this report. Our revenues and earnings vary with the level of general economic activity in the markets we serve and the level of commodity prices related to our farming and mineral resource activities. The factors that affect our ability to generate cash can also affect our ability to raise additional funds for these purposes through the addition of debt, the sale of equity, refinancing existing debt, or the sale of assets. 
 Our credit facility contains financial covenants requiring the maintenance of a maximum total liabilities to tangible net worth not greater than .75 to 1.0 at each quarter end, and a debt service coverage ratio not less than 1.25 to 1.00. A failure to comply 
 31 

with these requirements could allow the lending bank to terminate the availability of funds under our revolving credit facility and/or cause any outstanding borrowings to become due and payable prior to maturity. 
 MARKET RISKS 
 Market risk relates to the functioning of the marketplace. Many factors affect market function: investor anticipation, shocks in other markets, and anything that limits the efficient functioning of the marketplace. Market risks can affect the price of our Common Stock. 
 Only a limited market exists for our Common Stock, which could lead to price volatility . The limited trading market for our Common Stock may cause fluctuations in the market value of our Common Stock to be exaggerated, leading to price volatility in excess of that which would occur in a more active trading market of our Common Stock. 
 Concentrated ownership of our Common Stock creates a risk of sudden change in our share price . As of March 8, 2023, directors and members of our executive management team beneficially owned or controlled approximately 22.0 of our Common Stock. Investors who purchase our Common Stock may be subject to certain risks due to the concentrated ownership of our Common Stock. The sale by any of our large shareholders of a significant portion of that shareholder s holdings could have a material adverse effect on the market price of our Common Stock. In addition, the registration and sale of any significant number of additional shares of our Common Stock will have the immediate effect of increasing the public float of our Common Stock and any such increase may cause the market price of our Common Stock to decline or fluctuate significantly. 
 
 ITEM 1B. UNRESOLVED STAFF COMMENTS 
 None. 
 
 ITEM 2. PROPERTIES 
 Land 
 Our approximately 270,000 acres include portions of the San Joaquin Valley, portions of the Tehachapi Mountains and portions of the western end of the Antelope Valley. Each of our five reporting segments use various portions of this land. A number of key transportation and utility facilities cross our land, including Interstate 5, California Highways 58, 138 and 223, the California Aqueduct (which brings water from Northern California), and various transmission lines for electricity, oil, natural gas and communication systems. Our corporate offices are located on our property. 
 Approximately 247,000 acres of our land are located in Kern County, California. The Kern County general plan, or the General Plan, for this land contemplates continued commercial, resource utilization, farming, grazing and other agricultural uses, as well as certain new developments and uses, including residential and recreational facilities. While the General Plan is intended to provide guidelines for land use and development, it is subject to amendment to accommodate changing circumstances and needs. We have three major master planned real estate projects in Kern County: MV, TRCC and Grapevine. 
 The remainder of our land, approximately 23,000 acres, is in Los Angeles County. This area is accessible from Interstate 5 via Highway 138. Los Angeles County has adopted general plan policies that contemplate future residential development of portions of this land, subject to further assessments of environmental and infrastructure constraints. In 2019, the Los Angeles County Board of Supervisors' affirmed their final approval of Centennial, and now the 19,333 residential units are fully entitled. See Item 1, Business Real Estate Development Overview. 
 Portions of our land consist of mountainous terrain, much of which is not presently served by paved roads or by utility or water lines. Much of this property is included within the Conservation Agreement we entered into with five of the major environmental organizations in June 2008. As we receive entitlement approvals over the life span of our developments we will dedicate conservation easements on 145,000 acres of this land, which will preclude future development of the land. This acreage includes many of the most environmentally sensitive areas of our property and is home to many plant and wildlife species whose environments will remain undisturbed. 
 Any significant development on our currently undeveloped land would involve the construction of roads, utilities and other expensive infrastructure and would have to be done in a manner that accommodates a number of environmental concerns, including endangered species, wetlands issues, and greenhouse gas emissions. Accommodating these environmental concerns, could possibly limit development of portions of the land or result in substantial delays or certain changes to the scope of development in order to obtain governmental approval. 
 32 

Water Operations 
 Our existing long-term water contracts with the Wheeler Ridge-Maricopa Water Storage District, or WRMWSD, provide for water entitlements and deliveries from the SWP, to our agricultural and municipal/industrial operations in the San Joaquin Valley. The terms of these contracts extend to 2035. Under the contracts, we are entitled to annual water for 5,496 acres of land, or 15,547 acre-feet of water subject to SWP allocations, which is adequate for our present farming operations. It is assumed, that at the end of the current contract period all water contracts will be extended for approximately the same amount of annual water. 
 In addition to the WRMWSD contract water entitlements, we have an additional water entitlement from the SWP sufficient to service a substantial amount of future residential and/or commercial development in Kern County. TCWD, a local water district serving our land in the district and land we have sold in TRCC, has 5,749 acre-feet of SWP entitlement (also called Table A amount), subject to SWP allocations. In addition, TCWD has 52,554 acre-feet of water stored in Kern County water banks. Both the entitlement and the banked water are the subject of a long-term water supply contract extending to 2035 between TCWD and the Company. TCWD is the water supplier to TRCC, and will be the principal water supplier for any significant mixed-use development in MV. TCWD will also be the water district that provides services to the Grapevine and Centennial projects. 
 We have a 150-acre water bank consisting of nine ponds on our land in southern Kern County. Water is pumped into these ponds and then percolates into underground aquifers. Since 2006, we have banked 50,349 acre-feet of water from the Antelope Valley-East Kern Water Agency, or AVEK, which has been pumped from the California aqueduct and is currently retained in this water bank. We anticipate adding additional water to the water bank in the future, as water is available. 
 Over time we have also purchased water for our future use or sale. We have secured SWP entitlement under long-term SWP water contracts within the Tulare Lake Basin Water Storage District and the Dudley-Ridge Water District, totaling 3,444 acre-feet of SWP entitlement annually, subject to SWP allocations. These contracts extend through 2035. In 2013, the Company completed the acquisition of a water purchase agreement that will allow and require the Company to purchase 6,693 acre-feet of water each year from the Nickel Family, LLC, or Nickel, through the Kern County Water Agency. 
 The initial term of the water purchase agreement with Nickel runs through 2044 and includes a Company option to extend the contract for an additional 35 years. This contract allows us to purchase water each year. The purchase cost of water in 2022 was 861 per acre-foot. Purchase costs are subject to annual cost increases based on the greater of the consumer price index or 3 , resulting in a 2023 purchase cost of 928 per acre-foot. 
 The water purchased will ultimately be used in the development of the Company s land for commercial/industrial development, residential development, and farming. Interim uses may include the sale of portions of this water to third party users on an annual basis until the water is fully used for the Company s internal uses. 
 During 2022, SWP allocations were 5 of contract levels, and WRMWSD was able to supply us with water from various sources that when combined with our water sources provided sufficient water to meet our farming and real estate demands. In some years, there is also sufficient runoff from local mountain streams to allow us to capture some of this water in reservoirs and utilize it to offset some of the SWP water. In years where the supply of water is sufficient, both WRMWSD and TCWD are able to bank (percolate into underground aquifers) some of their excess supplies for future use. At this time, Wheeler Ridge expects to be able to deliver our entire contract water entitlement in any year that the SWP allocations exceed 30 by drawing on its ground water wells and water banking assets. Based on historical records of water availability, we do not believe we have material problems with our water supply. However, if SWP allocations are less than 30 of our entitlement in any year, or if shortages continue for a sustained period of several years, then WRMWSD may not be able to deliver 100 of our entitlement and we will have to rely on our own ground water sources, mountain stream runoff, water transfer from other sources, and water banking assets to supply the needs of our farming and development activities. Water from these sources may be more expensive than SWP water because of pumping costs and/or transfer costs. A 35 preliminary SWP water allocation has been made by the California Department of Water Resources, or DWR, for 2023. The current 35 allocation of SWP water will allow us to have sufficient water for our farming needs for the next year. 
 All SWP water contracts require annual payments related to the fixed and variable costs of the SWP and each water district, whether or not water is used or available. WRMWSD and TCWD contracts also establish a lien on benefited land. 
 Portions of our property also have available groundwater, which we believe would be sufficient to supply commercial development in the Interstate 5 corridor and support current agricultural operations. Ground water in the Antelope Valley Basin is subject to an adjudication of the water basin that limits groundwater pumping. 
 
 The Sustainable Groundwater Management Act, or SGMA, is a sustainable groundwater framework that became effective January 1, 2015. For the water districts in which the Company participates in the San Joaquin Valley, Groundwater 
 33 

Sustainability Plans have been developed and submitted to the DWR for review. Through these plans it will have to be demonstrated to the satisfaction of the DWR that the groundwater within the basins is sustainably managed by 2040 or 2042. To achieve sustainability, the GSPs could impose limitations on the use of groundwater. The Company's Kern County agricultural lands and development lands are located in the Kern Subbasin, the White Wolf Subbasin and the Castac Lake Basin. The Kern Subbasin is designated by DWR as a high priority, critically overdrafted basin, and its GSP was required by to be submitted to DWR by January of 2020. After their initial submittal to DWR of their GSPs, DWR notified the Groundwater Sustainability Agencies in the Kern Subbasin of deficiencies in their GSPs, which were to be addressed to DWR s satisfaction by July of 2022. The GSAs met that deadline and are awaiting a determination from DWR regarding the sufficiency of those GSPs. The White Wolf Subbasin is designated by DWR as a medium priority, non-critically overdrafted basin, and its GSP was required to be submitted to DWR by January 2022. The Board of Directors of the White Wolf GSA adopted the GSP for the White Wolf Subbasin and submitted it to DWR, where it remains under DWR review. The Castac Basin is a low priority basin, so there is no anticipation at this time of any restriction related to use of groundwater under SGMA. Regardless of any limitations on groundwater use that might result from SGMA, the Company's lands are in relatively good condition because of the diverse inventory of surface water supplies and banked water that the Company has access to as mentioned above. 
 There have been many environmental challenges regarding the movement of SWP water through the Sacramento Delta. Operation of the Delta pumps are of primary importance to the California water system because these pumps are part of the system that moves water from Northern California to Southern California. Biological Opinions, or BiOps, issued by the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, or FWS, and National Marine Fisheries Service, or NMFS, in 2008 and 2009 contained restrictions on pumping from the Delta and were challenged in the courts by both water agencies and environmental groups, which challenges were for the most part unsuccessful. Since then a number of developments have occurred that affect or potentially affect SWP supplies from the Delta. 
 One of these developments relates to the Coordinated Operation Agreement, or COA, that DWR and the Bureau of Reclamation, or the Bureau, which operates pumps in the Delta to supply water to its Central Valley Project, or CVP, entered into in 1986. The COA governs the concurrent state and federal pumping operations in the Delta. DWR and the Bureau renegotiated the COA in late 2018 to bring the COA up to date with various physical and legal changes that occurred over the course of thirty years. The renegotiated COA has generally resulted in reduced deliveries to SWP contractors. 
 Another development is DWR s plan for construction of a facility to convey water through the Delta in the form of a tunnel system that would divert water at or near the northern end of the Delta and convey the water underground via tunnel for delivery at or near the southern end of the Delta. Originally envisioned as a two-tunnel system known as California WaterFix, that project was rescinded and has been replaced with a proposed downsized single-tunnel system referred to as the Delta Conveyance Project, or DCP. In January of 2020, DWR began the environmental review process for the DCP by issuance of a Notice of Preparation of an EIR under CEQA. DWR circulated the Draft Environmental Impact Report for the DCP and the public comment period on the DEIR closed on December 16, 2022. DWR is reviewing the comments received and presumably working on the Final EIR for DCP. DWR and the SWP Contractors previously entered into an agreement in principle, or AIP, for terms of an amendment to the SWP long-term water supply contracts. If DWR adopts a Final EIR and approves the DCP, which could occur sometime late 2023, DWR and the SWP Contractors would need to execute amendments to the water supply contracts that provide for addition of the DCP to the SWP. The DCP is intended to increase the amount of water available for delivery across the Delta, particularly in wet years. 
 A third development is the Reinitiation of Consultation on the Coordinated Long-Term Operation of the Central Valley Project and State Water Project. This is a process that DWR and the Bureau jointly requested in 2016 and that resulted in new federal FWS and NMFS Biological Opinions, or BiOps, under Federal Endangered Species Act, or ESA, in 2019. The 2019 BiOps were intended to enhance reliability of water available for pumping out of the Delta based on updated best available science. The State of California and various non-governmental organizations filed a legal challenge to the new BiOps. Shortly after the 2019 BiOps were finalized, the State of California issued an Incidental Take Permit, or ITP, pursuant to the CESA, which is generally more restrictive on pumping out of the Delta in comparison to the BiOps. Several SWP Contractors, and others, filed litigation challenging the ITP on several grounds including CEQA and breach of contract. Additionally, the Bureau has reinitiated further consultation relative to the proposed actions in the federal BiOps. An interim operations plan for the Delta has been introduced that would govern Delta operations in the absence of final BiOps, and that plan is also the subject of legal challenges. It is expected that new biological options will be issued in 2024.

Other Activities 
 TRPFFA is a joint powers authority formed by Kern County and TCWD to finance public infrastructure within the Company s Kern County developments. TRPFFA has created two Community Facilities Districts, or CFDs, the West CFD and the East CFD. The West CFD has placed liens on 420 acres of the Company s land to secure payment of special taxes related to 19,540,000 of outstanding bond debt sold by TRPFFA for TRCC-West. The East CFD has placed liens on 1,931 acres of the Company s land to secure payments of special taxes related to 72,055,000 of outstanding bond debt sold by TRPFFA for TRCC-East. At TRCC-West, the West CFD has no additional bond debt approved for issuance. At TRCC-East, the East CFD has 44,035,000 of additional bond debt authorized by TRPFFA. Proceeds from the sales of these bonds are to reimburse the Company for public infrastructure related to TRCC-East. 
 We paid 2,899,000 and 2,860,000 in special taxes related to the CFDs in 2022 and 2021, respectively. As development continues to occur at TRCC, new owners of land and new lease tenants, through triple net leases, will bear an increasing portion of the assessed special tax. It is expected that we will have special tax payments in 2023 of 2,816,000, but this could change in the future based on the amount of bonds outstanding within each CFD and the amount of taxes paid by other owners and tenants. The assessment of each individual property sold or leased is not determinable at this time because it is based on the current tax rate and the assessed value of the property at the time of sale or on its assessed value at the time it is leased to a third-party. Accordingly, the Company is not required to recognize an obligation at December 31, 2022.

 OVERVIEW 
 Our Business 
 We are a diversified real estate development and agribusiness company committed to responsibly using our land and resources to meet the housing, employment, and lifestyle needs of Californians and to create value for our shareholders. In support of these objectives, we have been investing in land planning and entitlement activities for new industrial and residential land developments and in infrastructure improvements within our active industrial development. Our prime asset is approximately 270,000 acres of contiguous, largely undeveloped land that, at its most southerly border, is 60 miles north of Los Angeles and, at its most northerly border, is 15 miles east of Bakersfield. 
 Our business model is designed to create value through the execution of commercial/industrial development, entitlement and development of land for resort/residential uses, and the maximization of earnings from operating assets, while at the same time protecting significant portions of our land for conservation purposes. We operate our business near one of the country s largest population centers, which is expected to continue to grow well into the future. 
 We currently operate in five reporting segments: commercial/industrial real estate development; resort/residential real estate development; mineral resources; farming; and ranch operations. 
 Our commercial/industrial real estate segment generates revenues from real estate leases, and land and building sales. The primary commercial/industrial development is TRCC. The resort/residential real estate development segment is actively involved in the land entitlement and pre-development efforts both internally and through a joint venture. Within our resort/residential segment, the three active mixed-use master plan developments are MV, Centennial, and Grapevine. Our mineral resources segment generates revenues from oil and gas royalty leases, rock and aggregate mining leases, a lease with National Cement and sales of water. The farming segment produces revenues from the sale of wine grapes, almonds, and pistachios. Lastly, the ranch operation segment consists of game management revenues and ancillary land uses such as grazing leases and filming.

Financial Highlights 
 For 2022, net income attributable to common stockholders was 15,808,000 compared to net income attributed to common stockholders of 5,348,000 in 2021. Over the comparative period, commercial/industrial segment profits increased 16,636,000 resulting from the sale of three land parcels totaling 98.2 acres. Profits from the mineral resources segment increased by 1,198,000 as a result of greater oil royalties. Lastly, total other income increased 1,501,000 as a result of an increase in interest income along with receiving excess distributions and recognizing long-term deferred gains associated with the Company's former 18-19 West joint venture. The preceding improvements were offset by a 3,572,000 increase in income tax expense. 
 For 2021, net income attributable to common stockholders was 5,348,000 compared to a net loss attributed to common stockholders of 740,000 in 2020. Over the comparative period, commercial/industrial segment profits and our share of equity in earnings from our unconsolidated joint ventures increased 5,109,000 and 4,698,000, respectively. The increase in commercial/industrial segment profits was attributable to two land parcels sales comprised of 55.96 acres for a total revenues of 10,035,000. The increase in equity in earnings was primarily attributable to our share of the sale of lots 18 and 19 held by our joint venture with Rockefeller. Additionally, profits from mineral resources segment increased by 3,106,000 as a result of more water sales during the year due to dry 2021 winter conditions and low SWP allocations. The above mentioned increases were partially offset by a decline in farming segment profits of 1,840,000. The decline was primarily attributable to a decline in almond revenues due to supply chain disruptions and a decrease in pistachio revenue due to reduced insurance proceeds received when compared to the prior year. 
 During 2023, we will continue to invest funds towards litigation defense, permits, and maps for our master plan mixed-use developments and for master project infrastructure and vertical development within our active commercial and industrial development. Securing entitlements for our land is a long, arduous process that can take several years and involves litigation. During the next few years, our net income will fluctuate from year-to-year based upon, among other factors, commodity prices, production within our farming segment, the timing of land sales and the leasing of land and/or industrial space within our industrial developments, and equity in earnings realized from our unconsolidated joint ventures. 
 This Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations provides a narrative discussion of our results of operations. It contains the results of operations for each operating segment of the business and is followed by a discussion of our financial position. It is useful to read the business segment information in conjunction with Note 16 (Reporting Segments and Related Information) of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. 
 
 Critical Accounting Estimates 
 The preparation of our consolidated financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States, or GAAP, requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses, and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. We consider an accounting estimate to be critical if: (1) the accounting estimate requires us to make assumptions about matters that were highly uncertain at the time the accounting estimate was made, and (2) changes in the estimates that are likely to occur from period to period, or use of different estimates that we reasonably could have used in the current period, would have a material impact on our financial condition or results of operations. On an on-going basis, we evaluate our estimates, including those related to revenue recognition, impairment of long-lived assets, capitalization of costs, allocation of costs related to land sales and leases, and stock compensation. We base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions. 
 Management has discussed the development and selection of these critical accounting estimates with the Audit Committee of our Board of Directors and the Audit Committee has reviewed the foregoing disclosure. In addition, there are other items within our financial statements that require estimation, but are not deemed critical as defined above. Changes in estimates used in these and other items could have a material impact on our financial statements. See also Note 1 (Summary of Significant Accounting Policies) of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, which discusses accounting policies that we have selected from acceptable alternatives. 
 We believe the following critical accounting estimates reflect our more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements: 
 Impairment of Long-Lived Assets, Real Estate Development We evaluate our real estate development projects for impairment on an ongoing basis. Our evaluation for impairment involves an initial assessment of each real estate development to determine whether events or changes in circumstances exist that may indicate that the carrying amounts of a real estate development are no longer recoverable. Possible indications of impairment may include events or changes in circumstances affecting the 
 37 

entitlement process, government regulation, litigation, geographical demand for new housing, and market conditions related to pricing of new homes. 
 We make significant assumptions to evaluate each real estate development for possible indications of impairment. These assumptions include the identification of appropriate and comparable market prices, the consideration of changes to legal factors or the business climate, and assumptions surrounding continued positive cash flows and development costs. Considering that the planned development communities will be in a location that does not currently have many comparable homes, the Company must make assumptions surrounding the expected ability to sell the real estate assets at a price that is in excess of current accumulated costs. We use our internal forecasts and business plans to estimate future prices, absorption, and costs. We develop our forecasts based on recent sales data, input from marketing consultants, as well as discussions with commercial real estate brokers. 
 When events or changes in circumstances exist that result in an indicator of impairment, we perform an impairment calculation which compares the carrying value of the asset to the asset s estimated future cash flows (undiscounted). If the estimated future cash flows are less than the carrying value of the asset, we calculate an impairment loss. The impairment loss calculation compares the carrying value of the asset to the asset s estimated fair value, which may be based on estimated future cash flows (discounted). We recognize an impairment loss equal to the amount by which the asset s carrying value exceeds the asset s estimated fair value. If we recognize an impairment loss, the adjusted carrying amount of the asset will be its new cost basis. For a depreciable long-lived asset, the new cost basis will be depreciated (amortized) over the remaining useful life of that asset. Restoration of a previously recognized impairment loss is prohibited. If actual results are not consistent with our assumptions and judgments used in estimating future cash flows and asset fair values, we may be exposed to impairment losses that could be material to our results of operations. 
 At this time, there are no assets within any of our reporting segments that we believe are at risk of being impaired due to market conditions nor have we identified any impairment indicators. 
 We believe that the accounting estimate related to asset impairment is a critical accounting estimate because it is very susceptible to change from period to period; it requires management to make assumptions about future prices, production, and costs, and the potential impact of a loss from impairment could be material to our earnings. Management s assumptions regarding future cash flows from real estate developments are expected to fluctuate due to changes in prices, absorption, and costs as future market conditions change. 
 Allocation of Costs Related to Land Sales and Leases When we sell or lease land within one of our real estate developments, as we are currently doing within TRCC, and we have not completed all infrastructure development related to the total project, we determine the appropriate costs of sales for the sold land and the timing of recognition of the sale. In the calculation of cost of sales or allocations to leased land, we use estimates and forecasts to determine total costs at completion of the development project. These estimates of final development costs can change as conditions in the market and costs of construction change. 
 In preparing these estimates, we use internal budgets, forecasts, and engineering reports to help us estimate future costs related to infrastructure that has not been completed. These estimates become more accurate as the development proceeds forward, due to historical cost numbers and to the continued refinement of the development plan. These estimates are updated periodically throughout the year so that, at the ultimate completion of development, all costs have been allocated. Any increases to our estimates in future years will negatively impact net profits and liquidity due to an increased need for funds to complete development. If, however, this estimate decreases, net profits as well as liquidity will improve. 
 We believe that the estimates used related to cost of sales and allocations to leased land are critical accounting estimates and will become even more significant as we continue to move forward as a real estate development company. The estimates used are very susceptible to change from period to period, due to the fact that they require management to make assumptions about costs of construction, absorption of product, and timing of project completion, and changes to these estimates could have a material impact on the recognition of profits from the sale of land within our developments.

Results of Operations by Segment 
 We evaluate the performance of our reporting segments separately to monitor the different factors affecting financial results. Each reporting segment is subject to review and evaluation as we monitor current market conditions, market opportunities, and available resources. The performance of each reporting segment is discussed below: 
 Real Estate Commercial/Industrial 
 in thousands) 2022 2021 2020 Commercial/industrial revenues Pastoria Energy Facility Lease 4,859 4,380 4,584 TRCC Leasing 1,535 1,724 1,744 TRCC management fees and reimbursements 1,431 692 715 Commercial leases 646 627 580 Communication leases 1,011 952 927 Landscaping and other 1,237 1,066 986 Land sales 29,796 10,035 Total commercial revenues 40,515 19,476 9,536 Total commercial expenses 16,356 11,953 7,122 Operating income from commercial/industrial 24,159 7,523 2,414 
 2022 Operational Highlights: 
 During 2022, commercial/industrial segment revenues increased 21,039,000, or 108 , from 19,476,000 in 2021 to 40,515,000. The Company sold three land parcels in 2022, totaling 98.2 acres, for 29,796,000. 
 A 27.88 acre land parcel contributed with a fair value of 8,501,000 to TRC-MRC 5, LLC. The Company recognized revenues of 5,489,000 and deferred profit of 3,012,000 after applying the five-step revenue recognition model in accordance with ASC Topic 606 Revenue From Contracts With Customers and ASC Topic 323, Investments Equity Method and Joint Ventures. 
 58.0 acres of industrial land located at TRCC East to a major multinational corporation for 22,000,000. The Company recognized land sales revenue of 19,627,000 and deferred revenues of 2,373,000 attributable to a performance obligation within the contract after applying the five-step revenue recognition model in accordance with ASC Topic 606 - Revenue From Contracts With Customers. 
 12.3 acres of industrial land located at TRCC West to a third party for 4,680,000. 
 Commercial/industrial real estate segment expenses increased 4,403,000, or 37 , from 11,953,000 in 2021 to 16,356,000 in 2022. The increase in expenses is primarily attributed to additional land cost of sales of 4,372,000. 
 2021 Operational Highlights: 
 During 2021, commercial/industrial segment revenues increased 9,940,000, or 104 , from 9,536,000 in 2020 to 19,476,000. During 2021, the Company sold two land parcels, comprised of 55.96 acres, for 10,035,000. The first sale comprised of a 38.86 acre land parcel contributed with a fair value of 8,464,000 to TRC-MRC 4, LLC. The Company recognized revenues of 5,679,000 and deferred profit of 2,785,000 after applying the five-step revenue recognition model in accordance with ASC Topic 606 Revenue From Contracts With Customers and ASC Topic 323, Investments Equity Method and Joint Ventures. The second sale was to a third party for a 17.1 acre parcel for total consideration of 4,665,000. Under the terms of the sale, the Company recognized 4,355,000 in revenues and deferred 300,000 that will be recognized upon completion of a performance obligation in 2022. There were no land sales in 2020. 
 Commercial/industrial real estate segment expenses increased 4,831,000, or 68 , from 7,122,000 in 2020 to 11,953,000 in 2021. The increase in expenses is primarily attributed to land cost of sales of 4,246,000 and an increase in TCWD water assessments of 535,000 that is associated with the drought conditions. 
 For 2023, TRCC will continue to be the driver of new activity within the Company as construction begins on a, pre-leased, 446,400 square-foot industrial building that is expected to be completed in 2023. We also expect the commercial/industrial 
 39 

segment to continue to experience operating costs, net of amounts capitalized, primarily related to professional service fees, marketing, commissions, planning, and staffing costs as we continue to pursue these development opportunities. These costs are expected to remain consistent with current levels of expense with any variability in the future tied to specific absorption transactions in any given year and near term inflation impacts. TCWD water assessments may vary depending on water availability and its ability to sell water. 
 The actual timing and completion of development is difficult to predict due to the uncertainties of the market. Infrastructure development and marketing activities and costs will continue over several years as we develop our land holdings. Prices for building materials such as concrete and steel have increased over the past year and have longer than usual lead times. We will also continue to evaluate land resources to determine the highest and best uses for our land holdings. Future sales of land are dependent on market circumstances and specific opportunities. Our goal in the future is to increase land value and create future revenue growth through planning and development of commercial and industrial properties. 
 See Item 1, Business Real Estate Development Overview for discussion of the market outlook for the next year. 
 Real Estate Resort/Residential 
 Our resort/residential segment activities include defending entitlements, land planning and pre-construction engineering and conservation activities for our Centennial, Grapevine, and MV projects. 
 We are in the preliminary stages of development; hence, no revenues are attributed to this segment for these reporting periods. 
 2022 Operational Highlights: 
 In 2022, resort/residential segment expenses decreased 94,000 to 1,629,000, or 5 , when compared to 1,723,000 in 2021. The decrease is attributed to lower professional service costs. 
 2021 Operational Highlights: 
 In 2021, resort/residential segment expenses increased 111,000 to 1,723,000, or 7 , when compared to 1,612,000 in 2020. The increase is primarily associated with payroll expenses net of capitalization associated with the Company's development efforts. 
 The resort/residential segment will continue to incur costs in the future related to professional service fees, public relations costs, and staffing costs as we continue forward with permitting activities for the above communities. We expect these expenses to remain consistent with current years cost in the near term and only begin to increase as we move into the development phase of each project in the future. The actual timing and completion of entitlement-related activities and the beginning of development is difficult to predict due to the uncertainties of the approval process, the length of time related to litigation defense, and the status of the economy. We will also continue to evaluate land resources to determine the highest and best use for our land holdings. Our long-term goal through this process is to increase the value of our land and create future revenue opportunities through resort and residential development. 
 We are continuously monitoring the markets in order to identify the appropriate time in the future to begin infrastructure improvements and lot sales. Our long-term business plan of developing the communities of MV, Centennial, and Grapevine remains unchanged. As home buyer trends change in California to a more suburban orientation and the economy stabilizes, we believe the perception of land values will also begin to improve. Long-term macro fundamentals, primarily California's population growth and household formation will also support housing demand in our region. California also has a significant documented housing shortage, which we believe our communities will help ease as the population base within California continues to grow.

2022 Operational Highlights: 
 Revenues from our mineral resources segment increased 608,000, or 3 , to 21,595,000 in 2022 when compared to 20,987,000 in 2021. The increase is attributed to higher oil and gas royalties resulting from higher price per barrel and higher price per thousand cubic feet, respectively, when compared to 2021 pricing. These improvements were partially offset by an 865,000 reduction in water revenue. This decline was driven by less water available for sale but due to low statewide water supplies we were able to sell our available water at higher prices. 
 Mineral resources expenses decreased 590,000, or 4 , to 12,969,000 in 2022 when compared to 13,559,000 in 2021 as a result of having less water sales offset by an increase in property taxes. 
 2021 Operational Highlights: 
 Revenues from our mineral resources segment increased 10,251,000, or 95 , to 20,987,000 in 2021 when compared to 10,736,000 in 2020. The increase is attributed to a 9,614,000 increase in water sales driven by dry 2021 winter conditions and low SWP allocations. Comparatively, the Company sold 13,651 acre-feet and 5,022 acre-feet in 2021 and 2020, respectively. 
 Rock aggregate royalties increased as a result of higher demand and better pricing, fueled by the continuing growth in infrastructure projects throughout the state. 
 Mineral resources expenses increased 7,145,000, or 111 , to 13,559,000 in 2021 when compared to 6,414,000 in 2020 as a result of the increased water sales volume.

2022 Operational Highlights: 
 During 2022, farming segment revenues increased 1,962,000, or 18 , from 11,039,000 in 2021 to 13,001,000 in 2022. The factors contributing to this increase is as follow: 
 Almond revenues increased 3,021,000 due an increase in pounds sold in 2022 when compared to 2021. See table above for details of quantity sold. 
 Pistachio revenues decreased 1,843,000 because the 2022 crop did not bear any fruit due to a very mild winter which limited the number of optimum chill hours (temperatures below 42 degrees for an extended period of time), which impacts the trees ability to produce fruit. Pistachio revenues in 2022 comprised primarily of insurance proceeds and prior year crop bonuses. 
 Wine grape revenues increased 620,000 due to favorable wine grape pricing and yields. 
 During 2022, farming segment expenses increased 5,695,000, or 40 , from 14,116,000 in 2021 to 19,811,000 in 2022. The increase is largely attributed to a 1,529,000-pound increase in almond sales, inclusive of a 1,050,000 write-down in the carrying value for the Company's 2022 almond crop driven by an increase in costs due to high water expense, the impact of inflation to cultural costs, and the impact of low pricing in the almond market as described in Item 1 Business Farming Operations. Labor costs also continued to increase throughout 2022.

 2021 Operational Highlights: 
 During 2021, farming segment revenues decreased 2,827,000, or 20 , from 13,866,000 in 2020 to 11,039,000 in 2021. The factors contributing to this decrease is as follow: 
 Almond revenues decreased 1,921,000 due to supply chain disruptions that impacted our ability to deliver 2021 almond crop. In particular, there was a shortage of truck drivers needed to transport goods to the Los 
 44 

Angeles and Long Beach ports so that goods can be shipped overseas. Additionally, there was a shortage in food grade shipping containers that are necessary to ship almonds overseas. 
 Pistachio revenues decreased 1,343,000 primarily due to the decrease in insurance proceeds received in 2021 when compared to 2020. In 2020, we received pistachio insurance proceeds of 3,789,000, but because the 2021 pistachio crop year is a down bearing production year the insurance proceeds were only 466,000, a decrease of 3,323,000. The primary driver leading to higher insurance proceeds in 2020, was the assumption that 2020 production was based on yields typically seen during an on production year, which is much higher than that of the current down bearing production year. With respect to yields, the Company sold 1,615,000 and 456,000 pounds of pistachios in 2021 and 2020, respectively. The 2021 pistachio yields were in line with a normal off-production year. 
 Wine grape revenues increased 261,000 due to better wine grape pricing.

 2022 Operational Highlights: 
 Revenues from ranch operations decreased 5,000, or 0 , from 4,111,000 in 2021 to 4,106,000 in 2022, which is primarily attributed to an increase in hunting and membership revenues of 167,000 offset by a decline in grazing revenues of 172,000 resulting from a drought clause that resulted from having fewer cattle grazing on the Company's land. The increase in game management revenues is partially attributed to a 30 price increase in some of our more premium guided hunt offerings when compared to prior year. 
 Ranch operations expenses increased 345,000, or 7 , to 5,024,000 in 2022 from 4,679,000 in 2021. The increase is primarily attributed to increases in repairs and maintenance of 206,000, insurance of 57,000, and other services of 55,000. 
 2021 Operational Highlights: 
 Revenues from ranch operations increased 419,000, or 11 , from 3,692,000 in 2020 to 4,111,000 in 2021, which is primarily attributed to an increase in guided hunts of 123,000 and an increase in filming location fees of 292,000. Due to extended mandates and restrictions from COVID-19 in Los Angeles County, our vast open area was able to attract more production companies during 2021. 
 Ranch operations expenses decreased 217,000, or 4 , to 4,679,000 in 2021 from 4,896,000 in 2020. The decrease is primarily attributed to reduced payroll and overhead expenses of 218,000. 
 Other Income 
 Total other income increased 1,501,000, or 679 , from 221,000 in 2021 to 1,722,000 in 2022. In 2022, the Company had a higher average investment in marketable securities resulting in a 577,000 increase in interest income. In addition, the Company received excess distributions and recognized long-term deferred gains, as a result of the sale of the 18-19 West joint venture of 1,140,000. This amount is reflected in the Statement of Operations - Other Income, line item. 
 45 

Total other income decreased 2,104,000, or 90 , from 2,325,000 in 2020 to 221,000 in 2021. In 2020, the Company sold building and land that was previously operated by a fast food tenant to its joint venture, Petro Travel Plaza LLC. The Company received a cash distribution of 2,000,000 from the joint venture, and realized a Gain on Sale of Real Estate of 1,331,000. In addition, investment interest income decreased 489,000 as a result of having less marketable securities invested throughout the year. 
 Corporate Expenses 
 Corporate general and administrative costs decreased 144,000, or 1.5 , to 9,699,000 during 2022 when compared to 9,843,000 in 2021. The decrease is attributed to a 78,000 decrease in depreciation, a 44,000 decrease in insurance expense, and a 19,000 decrease in charitable contributions. 
 Corporate general and administrative costs increased 413,000, or 4.4 , to 9,843,000 during 2021 when compared to 9,430,000 in 2020. The increase is attributed to a 255,000 increase in insurance expense and a 128,000 increase in director expenses associated with the expansion of the Board of Directors to fulfill California state requirements on gender and underrepresented community requirements. 
 Equity in Earnings of Unconsolidated Joint Ventures 
 Equity in earnings of unconsolidated joint ventures is an important and growing component of our commercial/industrial activities and in the future, equity in earnings of unconsolidated joint ventures can become a significant part of our operations within the resort/residential segment. We continue to use joint ventures to advance our development projects at TRCC. This allows us to combine our resources with other real estate companies and gain greater access to capital, share in the risks of real estate developments, and share in the operating expenses. More importantly, it allows us to better manage the deployment of our capital and increase our leasing portfolio.

 During 2022, equity in earnings from unconsolidated joint ventures decreased 1,450,000, or 16 , to 7,752,000 when compared to 9,202,000 in 2021. 
 The 18-19 West LLC joint venture had a purchase option in place with a third-party to purchase lots l8 and 19 at a price of 15,213,000. In November 2021, the third-party exercised the land option and purchased the land from the joint venture for 15,213,000, the Company recognized 5,206,000 in equity in earnings from this land sale. 
 The Petro Travel Plaza equity in earnings increased 3,569,000 when compared to 2021, this increase is largely due to improved fuel margins; fuel margins improved 42 in 2022 when compared to 2021. 
 2021 Operational Highlights: 
 During 2021, equity in earnings from unconsolidated joint ventures increased 4,698,000, or 104 , to 9,202,000 when compared to 4,504,000 in 2020. 
 The 18-19 West LLC joint venture had a purchase option in place with a third-party to purchase lots l8 and 19 at a price of 15,213,000. In November 2021, the third-party exercised the land option and purchased the land from the joint venture for 15,213,000. 
 46 

The Petro Travel Plaza improved its fuel sales volume by 22 in 2021 when compared to 2020. However, the Company's share of operating results declined as a result of a 96 increase in the overall cost of fuel that was only partially mitigated by a 70 increase in fuel sales prices. Additionally, the joint venture also experienced an increase in labor costs due to increasing market wages. 
 Income Taxes 
 For the twelve months ended December 31, 2022, the Company's net income tax expense was 7,393,000 compared to 3,821,000 for the twelve months ended December 31, 2021. These represent effective income tax rates of approximately 32 and 42 for the twelve months ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. Our effective income tax rate for the year ended December 31, 2022 was higher than the federal statutory rate in the United States, a result of permanent differences arising from stock compensation and non-deductible compensation under Section 162(m) of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017. As of December 31, 2022 and 2021, we had an income tax receivable and payable of 636,000 and 1,217,000, respectively. 
 As of December 31, 2022, we had net deferred tax liabilities of 7,180,000. Our largest deferred tax assets were made up of temporary differences related to the capitalization of costs, pension adjustments, interest rate swap, deferred gains, and stock compensation. Deferred tax liabilities consist of depreciation, deferred gains, joint venture differences, and cost of sales adjustments. Due to the nature of most of our deferred tax assets, we believe they will be used in future years and an allowance is not necessary. 
 The Company classifies interest and penalties incurred on tax payments as income tax expenses. The Company made income tax payments of 8,237,000 in 2022 and 730,000 in 2021. The Company received refunds of 1,410,000 in 2022 and 483,000 in 2021. 
 For more detail, see Note 12. (Income Taxes), of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, included this Annual Report on Form 10-K. 
 Liquidity and Capital Resources 
 Cash Flow and Liquidity 
 Our financial position allows us to pursue our strategies of continued development of TRCC, funding of operating activities, land entitlement, development, and conservation. Accordingly, we have established well-defined priorities for our available cash, including investing in core operating segments to achieve profitable future growth. We have historically funded our operations with cash flows from operating activities, investment proceeds, and short-term borrowings from our bank credit facilities. In the past, we have also issued common stock and used the proceeds for capital investment activities. 
 To enhance shareholder value, we will continue to make investments in our real estate segments to secure land entitlement approvals, build infrastructure for our developments, invest in to be leased assets, ensure adequate future water supplies, and provide funds for general land development activities. Within our farming segment, we will make investments as needed to improve efficiency and add capacity to its operations when it is profitable to do so. 
 Our cash and cash equivalents and marketable securities totaled approximately 72,563,000 at December 31, 2022, an increase of 25,385,000, or 54 , from the corresponding amount at the end of 2021. 
 The following table summarizes the cash flow activities for the following years ended December 31: 
 in thousands) 2022 2021 2020 Operating activities 8,531 2,816 15,481 Investing activities (1,891) (14,652) 19,778 Financing activities (4,419) (6,086) (7,045) 
 
 Cash flows provided by operating activities are primarily dependent upon the rental rates of our leases, the collectability of rent and recovery of operating expenses from our tenants, distributions from joint ventures, the success of our crops and commodity prices within our mineral resource segment. 
 
 During 2022, our operations generated 8,531,000 in cash, primarily through joint venture distributions and receivable collections. 
 During 2021, our operations generated 2,816,000 in cash, primarily through joint venture distributions. 
 47 

During 2022, investing activities used 1,891,000, which was largely attributed to capital expenditures of 22,602,000 used primarily for real estate development. Of the 22,602,000, we spent 2,491,000 on permitting efforts for MV, 3,598,000 on litigation defense for Centennial, and 1,164,000 on permitting efforts for Grapevine. At TRCC, we primarily used 8,933,000 to expand the roads at TRCC. All real estate capital expenditures are inclusive of capitalized interest, payroll and overhead. Lastly, our farming segment had cash outlays of 5,915,000 for cultural and water costs tied to crops not yet in production, developing new almond orchards, grape vineyards, and replacing old farm equipment. Our mineral resources segment spent 988,000 to acquire water for use as needed and for future residential development activity. Lastly, the Company reinvested 63,882,000 into marketable securities. Offsetting cash outlays were maturities on marketable securities of 41,135,000, net proceeds from land sales of 24,950,000, distributions from unconsolidated joint ventures of 8,166,000, proceeds from water sales of 6,180,000, and CFD reimbursements of 5,950,000. 
 During 2021, investing activities used 14,652,000, which was largely attributed to capital expenditures of 20,879,000 used primarily for real estate development. Of the 20,879,000, we spent 4,004,000 on general planning and final map preparation for Phase 1 of MV, 2,939,000 on litigation defense for Centennial, and 1,121,000 on litigation for Grapevine. At TRCC, we primarily used 4,906,000 to expand water infrastructure at TRCC and early entitlement efforts for TRCC Residential. All real estate capital expenditures are inclusive of capitalized interest, payroll and overhead. Our mineral resources segment spent 2,415,000 to acquire water for use as needed and for future residential development activity. Lastly, our farming segment had cash outlays of 7,416,000 for cultural and water costs tied to crops not yet in production, developing new almond orchards, grape vineyards, and replacing old farm equipment. The Company also reinvested 14,586,000 into marketable securities. Offsetting cash outlays were maturities on marketable securities of 6,249,000, proceeds from water sales of 9,534,000, distributions from unconsolidated joint ventures of 5,734,000, and net proceeds from land sales of 4,413,000. 
 
 Our estimated capital investment for 2023 is primarily related to our real estate projects as it was in 2022. These estimated investments include approximately 14,187,000 of infrastructure development at TRCC-East to support continued commercial retail and industrial development and expanding water facilities to support future anticipated absorption. We are also investing approximately 5,115,000 to continue developing new almond orchards, wine grape vineyards, and replacing old farming equipment. The farm investments are part of a long-term farm management program to redevelop declining orchards and vineyards allowing the Company to maintain and improve future farm revenues. We expect to possibly invest up to 7,940,000 for permitting activities, predevelopment activities and land planning design at MV and Grapevine and litigation defense and supplemental recirculated environmental impact report preparation for Centennial. The timing of these investments is dependent on our coordination efforts with Los Angeles County regarding litigation defense for Centennial, permitting activities for Grapevine, and design, civil engineering, land planning and design, for MV. Our plans also include 1,800,000 for payment of annual water inventory and water related investments. We are also planning to potentially invest up to 351,000 in the normal replacement of operating equipment, such as ranch equipment, and vehicles. 
 
 We capitalize interest cost as a cost of the project only during the period for which activities necessary to prepare an asset for its intended use are ongoing, provided that expenditures for the asset have been made and interest cost has been incurred. Capitalized interest for the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, of 2,294,000 and 2,459,000, respectively, is classified in real estate development. We also capitalized payroll costs related to development, pre-construction, and construction projects which aggregated 2,387,000 and 2,467,000 for the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. Expenditures for repairs and maintenance are expensed as incurred. As noted above, these costs are included in the above investment numbers. 
 During 2022, financing activities used 4,419,000, which is comprised of long-term debt repayments of 51,708,000 and tax payments on vested stock grants of 2,733,000. This was partially offset by the issuance of new debt of 49,080,000. 
 During 2021, financing activities used 6,086,000, which is comprised of long-term debt repayments of 4,295,000 and tax payments on vested stock grants of 1,791,000. 
 It is difficult to accurately predict cash flows due to the nature of our businesses and fluctuating economic conditions. Our earnings and cash flows will be affected from period to period by the commodity nature of our farming and mineral operations, the timing of sales and leases of property within our development projects, and the beginning of development within our residential projects. The timing of sales and leases within our development projects is difficult to predict due to the time necessary to complete the development process and negotiate sales or lease contracts. Often, the timing aspect of land development can lead to particular years or periods having more or less earnings than comparable periods. Based on our experience, we believe we will have adequate cash flows, cash balances, and availability on our line of credit over the next twelve months to fund internal operations. As we move forward with the completion of the litigation, permitting and engineering design for our master planned communities and prepare to move into the development stage, we will need to secure additional funding through the issuance of equity and secure other forms of financing such as joint ventures and possibly debt and equity financing.

Capital Structure and Financial Condition 
 At December 31, 2022, total capitalization at book value was 527,534,000 consisting of 49,940,000 of debt, net of deferred financing costs, and 477,594,000 of equity, resulting in a debt-to-total-capitalization ratio of approximately 9.5 , representing a decrease when compared to the debt-to-total-capitalization ratio of 10.3 at December 31, 2021. 
 In 2014 the Company, as borrower, entered into an Amended and Restated Credit Agreement, a Term Note and a Revolving Line of Credit Note, with Wells Fargo, or collectively the Credit Facility. The Credit Facility added a 70,000,000 term loan, or Term Loan, to the then existing 30,000,000 revolving line of credit, or RLC. In 2019, the Company amended the Term Note (Amended Term Note) and extended its maturity to June 2029 and amended the RLC to expand the capacity from 30,000,000 to 35,000,000 and extend the maturity to October 2024. 
 The interest rate per annum applicable to the Amended Term Note was LIBOR (as defined in the Term Note) plus a margin of 170 basis points. The interest rate for the Amended Term Note was fixed at 4.16 through the use of an interest rate swap agreement. The Amended Term Note required monthly amortization payments, with the outstanding principal amount due June 5, 2029. The Amended Term Note was secured by the Company s farmland and farm assets, which include equipment, crops and crop receivables; the PEF power plant lease and lease site; and related accounts and other rights to payment and inventory. For the RLC, at the Company s option, the interest rate on this line of credit could float at 1.50 over a selected LIBOR rate or fixed at 1.50 above LIBOR for a fixed rate term. During the term of the RLC, the Company could have borrowed at any time and partially or wholly repaid any outstanding borrowings and then re-borrowed, as necessary. 
 On June 27, 2022, the Company paid off the Amended Term Note and terminated the related interest rate swap agreement with Wells Fargo and received a 1,123,000 cash termination fee from Wells Fargo for the interest rate swap. On June 30, 2022, the Company entered into a variable rate term note, or New Term Note, and a New Revolving Line of Credit Note, or New RLC, with Bank of America, N.A, (Lender) or collectively the New Credit Facility. The New Term Loan provides a principal amount of 49,080,000 and a maturity date of June 30, 2032, which was used to pay off the existing Wells Fargo Amended Term Note. The Company evaluated the exchange under ASC 470 and determined that the exchange should be treated as a debt extinguishment. The amount available on the New RLC under the New Credit Facility is 40,607,000. As a subfacility under the New RLC, the Lender agrees to provide up to 10,000,000 of capacity to issue standby letters of credit. The Company currently has 4,393,000 outstanding on a standby letter of credit (see Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements section below for further discussion). The Company can issue an additional 5,607,000 in standby letters of credit. The allocation of the credit availability to a letter of credit does not incur an interest cost. 
 The New Term Note had a 48,462,000 balance as of December 31, 2022. The interest rate per annum applicable to the New Term Loan is the daily secured overnight financing rate, or SOFR, plus a margin of 1.55 percentage points. The interest rate for the term of the New Term Note has been fixed through the use of an interest rate swap at a rate of 4.62 . The New Term Note requires monthly amortization payments pursuant to a schedule set forth in the New Term Note, with the final outstanding principal amount due June 30, 2032. The New Credit Facility is secured by the Company's farmland and farm assets, which include equipment, crops and crop receivables; the PEF power plant lease and lease site; and related accounts and other rights to payment and inventory. 
 The New RLC and the RLC had no outstanding balance at December 31, 2022 and December 31, 2021, respectively. At the Company s option, the interest rate on this line of credit can float at a rate equal to Daily SOFR plus 1.37 or can be fixed at a rate equal to Term SOFR plus 1.37 for interest periods elected by the Company. 
 Any future borrowings under the New RLC will be used for ongoing working capital requirements and other general corporate purposes. To maintain availability of funds under the New RLC, undrawn amounts under the New RLC will accrue a commitment fee of 10 basis points per annum. The Company's ability to borrow additional funds in the future under the New RLC is subject to compliance with certain financial covenants and making certain representations and warranties, which are typical in this type of borrowing arrangement. 
 The New Credit Facility requires compliance with two financial covenants: (a) total liabilities divided by tangible net worth not greater than 0.75 to 1.0 at each quarter end; and (b) a debt service coverage ratio not less than 1.25 to 1.00 as of each quarter end on a rolling four quarter basis. 
 The New Credit Facility also contains customary negative covenants that limit the ability of the Company to, among other things, make capital expenditures, incur indebtedness and issue guaranties, consummate certain assets sales, acquisitions or mergers, make investments, pay dividends or repurchase stock, make a change in capital ownership, or incur liens on any assets. 
 49 

The New Credit Facility contains customary events of default, including: failure to make required payments; failure to comply with terms of the New Credit Facility; bankruptcy and insolvency. The New Credit Facility contains other customary terms and conditions, including representations and warranties, which are typical for credit facilities of this type. 
 At December 31, 2022 and December 31, 2021, the Company was in compliance with all financial covenants. 
 The Company also has a 4,750,000 promissory note agreement with principal and interest due monthly. The interest rate on this promissory note is 4.25 per annum, with principal and interest payments ending on September 1, 2028. The proceeds from this promissory note were used to eliminate debt that had been previously used to provide long-term financing for a building being leased to Starbucks and provide additional working capital for future investment. In March 2020, the Company made an additional payment of 687,000 that was applied to the principal of the note. Subsequent principal and interest payments were reduced to 28,000 per month. The additional principal payment was tied to the release of collateral, which in April 2020 was contributed to Petro Travel Plaza LLC. The balance of this long-term debt instrument included in "Notes payable" above approximates the fair value of the instrument. The balance as of December 31, 2022 is 1,692,000. 
 Our current and future capital resource requirements will be provided primarily from current cash and marketable securities, cash flow from on-going operations, distributions from joint ventures, proceeds from the sale of developed and undeveloped parcels, potential sales of assets, additional use of debt or drawdowns against our line-of-credit, proceeds from the reimbursement of public infrastructure costs through CFD bond debt (described below under Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements ), and the issuance of common stock. In May 2022, we filed an updated shelf registration statement on Form S-3 that went effective in May 2022. Under the shelf registration statement, we may offer and sell in the future one or more offerings, common stock, preferred stock, debt securities, warrants or any combination of the foregoing. The shelf registration allows for efficient and timely access to capital markets and when combined with our other potential funding sources just noted, provides us with a variety of capital funding options that can then be used and appropriately matched to the funding needs of the Company. 
 As noted above, at December 31, 2022, we had 72,563,000 in cash and securities and as of the filing date of this Form 10-K, we had 40,607,000 available on credit lines to meet any short-term liquidity needs. 
 We continue to expect that substantial investments will be required in order to develop our land assets. In order to meet these capital requirements, we may need to secure additional debt financing and continue to renew our existing credit facilities. In addition to debt financing, we will use other capital alternatives such as joint ventures with financial partners, sales of assets, and the issuance of common stock. We will use a combination of the above funding sources to properly match funding requirements with the assets or development project being funded. As we move into 2023, we will be evaluating various options for funding the potential start of development projects. There is no assurance that we can obtain financing or that we can obtain financing at favorable terms. We believe we have adequate capital resources to fund our cash needs and our capital investment requirements in the near-term as described earlier in the cash flow and liquidity discussions. 
 Contractual Cash Obligations 
 The following table summarizes our contractual cash obligations and commercial commitments as of December 31, 2022, to be paid over the next five years: 
 Payments Due by Period in thousands) Total Less than a year 1-3 years 3-5 years More than 5 years Contractual Obligations: Estimated water payments 277,653 12,730 26,614 28,236 210,073 Long-term debt 50,154 1,779 3,824 4,209 40,342 Interest on long-term debt 17,823 2,266 4,279 3,912 7,366 Cash contract commitments 7,425 4,180 1,656 518 1,071 Defined Benefit Plan 4,905 341 839 993 2,732 SERP 5,231 515 1,059 1,108 2,549 Financing fees 163 163 Total contractual obligations 363,354 21,974 38,271 38,976 264,133 
 The table above includes only those contracts that include fixed or minimum obligations. It does not include normal purchases, which are made in the ordinary course of business. 
 50 

As discussed in Note 15 (Retirement Plans) of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, we have long-term liabilities for deferred employee compensation, including pension and supplemental retirement plans. Payments in the above table reflect estimates of future defined benefit plan contributions from the Company to the plan trust, estimates of payments to employees from the plan trust, and estimates of future payments to employees from the Company that are in the SERP program. During 2022, we made pension contributions of 165,000 and it is projected that we will make a similar contribution in 2023. 
 Our cash contract commitments consist of contracts in various stages of completion related to infrastructure development within our industrial developments and entitlement costs related to our industrial and residential development projects. Also, included in the cash contract commitments are estimated fees earned in 2014 by a consultant, related to the entitlement of the Grapevine Development Area. The Company exited a consulting contract in 2014 related to the Grapevine Development and is obligated to pay an earned incentive fee at the time of successful receipt of litigated project entitlements and at a value measurement date five-years after entitlements have been achieved for Grapevine. The final amount of the incentive fees will not be finalized until the future payment dates. The Company believes that net savings from exiting the contract over this future time period will more than offset the incentive payment costs. 
 Estimated water payments include the Nickel water contract, which obligates us to purchase 6,693 acre-feet of water annually through 2044 and SWP contracts with Wheeler Ridge Maricopa Water Storage District, Tejon-Castac Water District, Tulare Lake Basin Water Storage District, and Dudley-Ridge Water Storage District. These contracts for the supply of future water run through 2035. Please refer to Note 6 (Long-Term Water Assets) of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding water assets.

 Non-GAAP Financial Measures 
 EBITDA represents earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization, a non-GAAP financial measure, and is used by us and others as a supplemental measure of performance. We use Adjusted EBITDA to assess the performance of our core operations, for financial and operational decision making, and as a supplemental or additional means of evaluating period-to-period comparisons on a consistent basis. Adjusted EBITDA is calculated as EBITDA, excluding stock compensation expense. We believe Adjusted EBITDA provides investors relevant and useful information because it permits investors to view income from our operations on an unleveraged basis before the effects of taxes, depreciation and amortization, and stock compensation expense. By excluding interest expense and income, EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA allow investors to measure our performance independent of our capital structure and indebtedness and, therefore, allow for a more meaningful comparison of our performance to that of other companies, both in the real estate industry and in other industries. We believe that excluding charges related to share-based compensation facilitates a comparison of our operations across periods and among other companies without the variances caused by different valuation methodologies, the volatility of the expense (which depends on market forces outside our control), and the assumptions and the variety of award types that a company can use. EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA have limitations as measures of our performance. EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA do not reflect our historical cash expenditures or future cash requirements for capital expenditures or contractual commitments. While EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA are relevant and widely used measures of performance, they do not represent net income or cash flows from operations as defined by GAAP. Further, our computation of EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA may not be comparable to similar measures reported by other companies.

Net operating income (NOI) is a non-GAAP financial measure calculated as operating income, the most directly comparable financial measure calculated and presented in accordance with GAAP, excluding general and administrative expenses, interest expense, depreciation and amortization, and gain or loss on sales of real estate. We believe NOI provides useful information to investors regarding our financial condition and results of operations because it primarily reflects those income and expense items that are incurred at the property level. Therefore, we believe NOI is a useful measure for evaluating the operating performance of our real estate assets.

 The Company utilizes NOI of unconsolidated joint ventures as a measure of financial or operating performance that is not specifically defined by GAAP. We believe NOI of unconsolidated joint ventures provides investors with additional information concerning operating performance of our unconsolidated joint ventures. We also use this measure internally to monitor the operating performance of our unconsolidated joint ventures. Our computation of this non-GAAP measure may not be the same as similar measures reported by other companies. This non-GAAP financial measure should not be considered as an alternative to net income as a measure of the operating performance of our unconsolidated joint ventures or to cash flows computed in accordance with GAAP as a measure of liquidity nor are they indicative of cash flows from operating and financial activities of our unconsolidated joint ventures.

ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK 
 Market risk represents the risk of loss that may impact the financial position, results of operations, or cash flows of the Company due to adverse changes in financial or commodity market prices or rates. We are exposed to market risk in the areas of interest rates and commodity prices. 
 Financial Market Risks 
 Our exposure to financial market risks includes changes to interest rates and credit risks related to marketable securities, interest rates related to our outstanding indebtedness and trade receivables. 
 The primary objective of our investment activities is to preserve principal while at the same time maximizing yields and prudently managing risk. To achieve this objective and limit interest rate exposure, we limit our investments to securities with a maturity of less than five years and an investment grade rating from Moody s or Standard and Poor s. See Note 3 (Marketable Securities) of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. 
 Our current RLC has no outstanding balance. At the Company s option, the interest rate on this line of credit can float at a rate equal to Daily SOFR plus 1.37 or can be fixed at a rate equal to Term SOFR plus 1.37 above Term SOFR for interest periods elected by the Company. During the term of this RLC (which matures in June 2032), the Company can borrow at any time and partially or wholly repay any outstanding borrowings and then re-borrow, as necessary outstanding balances. 
 We are exposed to interest rate risk on our long-term debt. Long-term debt consists of two term loans, one for 48,462,000 and is tied to the daily secured overnight financing rate, or SOFR, plus a margin of 1.55 percentage points. The interest rate for the term of the New Term Note has been fixed through the use of an interest rate swap at a rate of 4.62 . The outstanding balance on the second term loan is 1,692,000 and has a fixed rate of 4.25 . We believe it is prudent at times to limit the variability of floating-rate interest payments and have from time-to-time entered into interest rate swap arrangements to manage those fluctuations, as we did with the Term Loan. 
 Market risk related to our farming inventories ultimately depends on the value of almonds, grapes, and pistachios at the time of payment or sale. Credit risk related to our receivables depends upon the financial condition of our customers. Based on historical experience with our current customers and periodic credit evaluations of our customers financial conditions, we believe our credit risk is minimal. Market risk related to our farming inventories is discussed below in the section pertaining to commodity price exposure.

 Our risk with regard to fluctuations in interest rates has decreased slightly related to marketable securities since these balances have decreased compared to the prior year. 
 Commodity Price Exposure 
 As of December 31, 2022, we have exposure to adverse price fluctuations associated with certain inventories and accounts receivable. Farming inventories consist of farming cultural and processing costs related to 2022 and 2021 crop production. The farming costs inventoried are recorded at actual costs incurred. Historically, these costs have been recovered each year when that year s crop harvest has been sold. 
 With respect to accounts receivable, the amount at risk relates primarily to farm crops. These receivables are recorded based on estimated final pricing. The final price is generally not known for several months following the close of our fiscal year. Of the 4,453,000 in outstanding receivables, there were no receivables at December 31, 2022 that were at risk for changing prices as there were no pistachio yields. Over the previous three years pistachio prices have fluctuated between 1.98 to 2.72.

Management s Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting 
 The management of the Company is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting and for the assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting. As defined in Rule 13a-15(f) of the Exchange Act, internal control over financial reporting is a process designed by, or supervised by, the Company s principal executive and principal financial officers and effected by the Company s board of directors, management and other personnel, to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. 
 The Company s internal control over financial reporting is supported by written policies and procedures, that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the Company s assets; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the Company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of the Company s management and directors; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of the Company s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements. 
 Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. 
 In connection with the preparation of the Company s annual financial statements, under the supervision and with the participation of the Company s management, including its Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, management of the Company has undertaken an assessment of the effectiveness of the Company s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2022 based on criteria established in Internal Control Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (2013 Framework), or COSO. Management s assessment included an evaluation of the design of the Company s internal control over financial reporting and testing of the operational effectiveness of the Company s internal control over financial reporting. 
 Based on this assessment, management did not identify any material weakness in the Company s internal control, and management has concluded that the Company s internal control over financial reporting was effective as of December 31, 2022. 
 Deloitte Touche LLP, the independent registered public accounting firm that audited the Company s financial statements included in this report, has issued a report on the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, a copy of which follows.

 We have also audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the consolidated financial statements as of and for the year ended December 31, 2022, of the Company and our report dated March 8, 2023, expressed an unqualified opinion on those financial statements based on our audit. 
 Basis for Opinion 
 The Company s management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in the accompanying Management s Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting.

We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. 
 We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk, and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion. 
 Definition and Limitations of Internal Control over Financial Reporting 
 A company s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements. 
 Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM 
 To the stockholders and the Board of Directors of Tejon Ranch Co. 
 Opinion on the Financial Statements 
 We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Tejon Ranch Co. and subsidiaries (the "Company") as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, the related consolidated statements of operations, comprehensive income (loss), equity, and cash flows, for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2022, and the related notes (collectively referred to as the "financial statements"). In our opinion, based on our audits and the report of the other auditors, the financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2022, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. 
 We did not audit the financial statements of Petro Travel Plaza Holdings LLC Petro ), the Company's investment in which is accounted for by use of the equity method as of December 31, 2021 and for the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020. The accompanying financial statements of the Company include its equity investment in Petro of 22,915,000 as of December 31, 2021, and its equity earnings in Petro of 4,957,000 and 5,722,000 for the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively. Those statements were audited by other auditors whose report has been furnished to us, and our opinion, insofar as it relates to the amounts included for Petro, is based solely on the report of the other auditors. 
 We have also audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the Company's internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2022, based on the criteria established in Internal Control Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission and our report dated March 8, 2023, expressed an unqualified opinion on the Company's internal control over financial reporting based on our audit. 
 Basis for Opinion 
 These financial statements are the responsibility of the Company's management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company's financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. 
 We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. Our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe that our audits and the report of the other auditors provide a reasonable basis for our opinion. 
 Critical Audit Matter 
 The critical audit matter communicated below is a matter arising from the current-period audit of the financial statements that was communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that (1) relates to accounts or disclosures that are material to the financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion on the financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matter below, providing a separate opinion on the critical audit matter or on the accounts or disclosures to which it relates. 
 Real Estate Real Estate Development - Refer to Notes 1, 5, 14, and 16 to the financial statements 
 Critical Audit Matter Description 
 The Company s evaluation of real estate development for impairment involves an initial assessment of each real estate development to determine whether events or changes in circumstances exist that may indicate that the carrying amounts of a real estate development are no longer recoverable. Possible indications of impairment may include events or changes in circumstances affecting the entitlement process, government regulation, litigation, geographical demand for new housing, and market conditions related to pricing of new homes. When events or changes in circumstances exist, the Company evaluates the real estate development for impairment by comparing undiscounted future cash flows expected to be generated over the life of the real estate development to the respective carrying amount. If the carrying amount of the real estate development exceeds the undiscounted future cash flows, an analysis is performed to determine the fair value of the asset. 
 The Company makes significant assumptions to evaluate each real estate development for possible indications of impairment. These assumptions include the identification of appropriate and comparable market prices, the consideration of changes to legal 
 70 

factors or the business climate, and assumptions surrounding continued positive cash flows and development costs. Considering that the planned development communities will be in a location that does not currently have many comparable homes, the Company must make assumptions surrounding the expected ability to sell the real estate assets at a price that is in excess of current accumulated costs. Further, the facts and circumstances utilized to make these assumptions may change from period to period. For the year ended December 31, 2022, no impairment loss has been recognized on any real estate development. 
 We identified the determination of impairment indicators for real estate development as a critical audit matter due to the quantitative significance of real estate development and because of the assumptions management makes when determining whether events or changes in circumstances have occurred indicating that the carrying amounts of any real estate development may not be recoverable. This required a high degree of auditor judgment when performing audit procedures to evaluate whether management appropriately identified impairment indicators. 
 How the Critical Audit Matter Was Addressed in the Audit 
 Our audit procedures related to the evaluation of real estate development for possible indications of impairment included the following, among others: 
 We tested the effectiveness of the controls over management s identification of possible circumstances that may indicate that the carrying amounts of any real estate development is no longer recoverable, including controls over management s evaluation of the entitlement process, government regulation, litigation, geographical demand for new housing and market conditions related to pricing of new homes. 
 We read and evaluated management s documentation, including relevant accounting policies and information obtained by management from outside sources. 
 We evaluated management s impairment analysis by: 
 Testing the real estate development for possible indications of impairment, including searching for adverse asset-specific and/or market conditions by reviewing publicly available information on home values and land values in the surrounding regions of the development, periodicals and news information relating to the Southern California housing market, and other independent market data, including considerations of the demand for housing in the market and changes to comparable home prices 
 Obtaining letters from legal counsel and performing inquiries with the Company s in-house legal counsel in order to evaluate any changes in the status of the litigation matters affecting the development properties and the potential impact on the ability to recover the accumulated costs, including any relevant government regulations and/or other matters impacting the entitlement process. 
 Developing an independent expectation of impairment indicators and comparing such expectation to management s analysis.

 1 In determining the classification of cash inflows and outflows related to water asset activity, the Company s practices are supported by Accounting Standards Codification ASC 230-10-45-22, which provides that Certain cash receipts and payments have aspects of more than one class of cash flows . If so, the appropriate classification shall depend on the activity that is likely to be the predominant source of cash flows for the item. Also, at the 2006 American Institution of Certified Public Accountants Conference on Current SEC and PCAOB Developments, the Securities and Exchange Commission, or SEC staff discussed that an entity should be consistent in how it classifies cash outflows and inflows related to an asset s purchase and sale and noted that when cash flow classification is unclear, registrants must use judgment and analysis that considers the nature of the activity and the predominant source of cash flow for these items. 
 
 Given the nature of our water assets and the aforementioned authoritative guidance, the Company estimates the appropriate classification of water assets purchased based on the timing of the sale of the water. Water purchased in prior periods that was classified as investing was sold for million in 2022, this cash inflow is appropriately classified in the Company s investing activities. The profit of million related to the water purchased in prior periods is appropriately being deducted from operating activities for the current period. The Company has and will continue to apply this methodology to water asset transactions that meet this fact pattern. 
 2 In determining the classification of cash inflows and outflows related to land development costs, the Company s practices are supported by Accounting Standards Codification ASC 230-10-45-22, which provides that Certain cash receipts and payments have aspects of more than one class of cash flows . If so, the appropriate classification shall depend on the activity that is likely to be the predominant source of cash flows for the item.

 Given the nature of our land development costs and the aforementioned authoritative guidance, the Company estimates the appropriate classification of land development costs based on the timing of the sale of land. Land development costs incurred during prior periods that were classified as investing were sold for million in gross proceeds in 2022, this cash inflow is appropriately classified in the Company s investing activities. The profit of million related to land development costs incurred in prior periods is appropriately being deducted from operating activities for the current period. The Company has and will continue to apply this methodology to land sale transactions that meet this fact pattern. 
 
 In December 2022, the Company contributed land with a fair value of million to TRC-MRC 5, LLC, an unconsolidated joint venture formed to pursue the development, construction, lease-up, and management of an approximately square foot industrial building located within TRCC-East. The total cost of the land was million. The Company recognized profit of million and deferred profit of million after applying the five-step revenue recognition model in accordance with ASC Topic 606 - Revenue From Contracts With Customers and ASC Topic 323, Investments - Equity Method and Joint Ventures. 
 
 In June 2021, the Company contributed land with a fair value of million to TRC-MRC 4, LLC, an unconsolidated joint venture formed to pursue the development, construction, leasing, and management of a square foot industrial building on the Company's property at TRCC-East. The total cost of the land was million. The Company recognized million in profit and deferred million of profit after applying the five-step revenue recognition model in accordance with Accounting Standards Codification (ASC) Topic 606 Revenue From Contracts With Customers and ASC Topic 323, Investments Equity Method and Joint Ventures. 
 
 Historically, cash outflows related to land development expenditures were accounted for within investing activities. For consistency, the Company will continue to classify cash outflows and cash inflows related to land development as investing activities. 
 
 3 The Company had an interest rate swap agreement with Wells Fargo Bank, N.A. to reduce its exposure to fluctuations in the floating interest rate tied to the London Inter-Bank Offered Rate, or LIBOR, under a term note with Wells Fargo. The hedging relationship qualified as an effective cash flow hedge at the initial assessment, based upon a regression analysis, and is recorded at fair value. On June 27, 2022, the Company terminated the interest rate swap agreement with Wells Fargo and received a cash termination fee from Wells Fargo. See Interest Rate Swap (Note 10) for further discussion.

 Tejon's prime asset is approximately acres of contiguous, largely undeveloped land that, at its most southerly border, is miles north of downtown Los Angeles and, at its most northerly border, is miles east of Bakersfield. The Company creates value by securing entitlements for its land, facilitating infrastructure development, strategic land planning, monetization of land through development and sales, and conservation, in order to maximize the highest and best use for its land. 
 The Company is involved in joint ventures that own, develop, and operate real estate properties. The Company enters into joint ventures as a means to facilitate the development of portions of its land. The Company is also actively engaged in land planning, land entitlement, and conservation projects. 
 Any references to the number of acres, number of buildings, square footage, number of leases, occupancy, and any amounts derived from these values in the notes to the consolidated financial statements are unaudited.

acre-feet of water each year from the Nickel Family LLC. The initial term of this contract runs through 2044. The purchase price of these contracts is being amortized under the straight-line basis over their contractual lives. Water contracts with the Wheeler Ridge Maricopa Water Storage District and the Tejon-Castac Water District are also in place, but were entered into with each district at inception and not purchased later from third parties, and therefore do not have a related financial value on the books of the Company. As a result, there is no amortization expense related to these contracts.

 The Company adopted ASU No. 2016-13, "Financial Instruments Credit Losses (Topic 326)" on January 1, 2020, prospectively. Under ASC Topic 326-30, the Company is now required to use an allowance approach when recognizing credit loss for available-for-sale debt securities, measured as the difference between the security's amortized cost basis and the amount expected to be collected over the security's lifetime. Under this approach, at each reporting date, the Company records impairment related to credit losses through earnings offset with an allowance for credit losses, or ACL. At December 31, 2022 the Company has not recorded any credit losses. 
 At December 31, 2022, the fair market value of investment securities was below the cost basis of securities. The Company s gross unrealized holding gains equal dollars and gross unrealized holding losses equal . As of December 31, 2022, the adjustment to accumulated other comprehensive loss in consolidated equity for the temporary change in the value of securities reflects a decrease in the market value of available-for-sale securities of , which includes estimated taxes of . 
 The Company elected to exclude applicable accrued interest from both the fair value and the amortized cost basis of the available-for-sale debt securities, and separately present the accrued interest receivable balance per ASC Topic 326-30-50-3A. The accrued interest receivables balance totaled as of December 31, 2022, and was included within the Prepaid expenses and other current assets line item of the Consolidated Balance Sheets. The Company elected not to measure an allowance for credit losses on accrued interest receivable as an allowance on possible uncollectible accrued interest is not warranted. 
 U.S. Treasury and agency notes 
 The unrealized losses on the Company's investments in U.S. Treasury and agency notes at December 31, 2022 were caused by relative changes in interest rates since the time of purchase. The contractual cash flows for these securities are guaranteed by U.S. government agencies. The unrealized losses on these debt security holdings are a function of changes in investment spreads and interest rate movements and not changes in credit quality. As of December 31, 2022, the Company did not intend to sell these securities and it is not more-likely-than-not that the Company would be required to sell these securities before recovery of their cost basis. Therefore, these investments did not require an ACL as of December 31, 2022.

 In 2014, the Company as borrower, entered into an Amended and Restated Credit Agreement, a Term Note and a Revolving Line of Credit Note, with Wells Fargo, or collectively the Credit Facility. The Credit Facility added a term loan, or Term Loan, to the then existing revolving line of credit, or RLC.

The Amended Term Note required monthly amortization payments, with the outstanding principal amount due June 5, 2029. The Amended Term Note was secured by the Company s farmland and farm assets, which include equipment, crops and crop receivables; the PEF power plant lease and lease site; and related accounts and other rights to payment and inventory. For the RLC, at the Company s option, the interest rate on this line of credit could float at above the Daily One Month LIBOR rate or fixed at above LIBOR for a fixed rate term. During the term of the RLC, the Company could have borrowed at any time and partially or wholly repaid any outstanding borrowings and then re-borrowed, as necessary. 
 
 On June 30, 2022, the Company entered into a variable rate term note, or New Term Note, and a new Revolving Line of Credit 
 Note, or New RLC, with Bank of America, N.A, or collectively the New Credit Facility. The New Term Loan provided a 
 principal amount of and a maturity date of June 30, 2032, which was used to pay off the existing Wells Fargo 
 Amended Term Note. The Company evaluated the debt exchange under ASC 470 and determined that the exchange should be treated as a debt extinguishment. The amount available of the New RLC under the New Credit Facility is . 
 
 The New Term Note had a balance as of December 31, 2022. The interest rate per annum applicable to the New Term Loan is the daily Secured Overnight Financing Rate, or SOFR, plus a margin of percentage points. The interest rate for the term of the New Term Note has been fixed through the use of an interest rate swap at a rate of . The New Term Note requires monthly amortization payments pursuant to a schedule set forth in the New Term Note, with the final outstanding 
 principal amount due June 28, 2032. The New Credit Facility is secured by the Company's farmland and farm assets, which, 
 include equipment, crops and crop receivables; the PEF power plant lease and lease site; and related accounts and other rights to payment and inventory. 
 
 The New RLC had outstanding balance as of December 31, 2022. At the Company s option, the interest rate on this line of credit can float at a rate equal to Daily SOFR plus or can be fixed at a rate equal to Term SOFR plus above Term SOFR for interest periods elected by the Company. During the term of this RLC (which matures on June 30, 2027), the Company can borrow at any time and partially or wholly repay any outstanding borrowings and then re-borrow, as necessary.

 On June 30, 2022, the Company entered into the New Term Note with Bank of America, N.A. for the New Term Loan as discussed in Note 8 (Line of Credit and Long-Term Debt) of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. On the same day, the Company entered into a new interest rate swap agreement to reduce its exposure to fluctuations in the floating interest rate tied to SOFR under the New Term Note. Per ASC 815, an entity may apply the shortcut method to hedging relationships that meet all of the conditions under ASC 815. The Company performed an initial assessment of the hedging relationship and determined it is appropriate to apply the shortcut method as all conditions were met. The new interest rate swap qualified as an effective cash flow hedge under the guidance of ASC 815. Applying the shortcut method allows the Company to assume that it has a perfectly effective hedging relationship, therefore there is no need for the Company to perform any quantitative assessments of whether the hedge is highly effective. 
 
 As of December 31, 2022, the fair value of the interest rate swap agreement was greater than its cost basis and as such is recorded within Other Assets on the Consolidated Balance Sheets.

 types of stock grant awards under these plans: restricted stock with service condition vesting; performance share grants that only vest upon the achievement of specified performance conditions, such as corporate cash flow goals or share price, or Performance Condition Grants; and performance share grants that include threshold, target, and maximum achievement levels based on the achievement of specific performance measures, or Performance Milestone Grants. Performance Condition Grants with market-based conditions are based on the achievement of a target share price. The share price used to calculate the grant date fair value for market-based awards is determined using a Monte Carlo simulation. Failure to achieve the target share price will result in the forfeiture of shares. Forfeiture of share awards with service conditions or performance-based restrictions will result in a reversal of previously recognized share-based compensation expense. Forfeiture of share awards with market-based restrictions does not result in a reversal of previously recognized share-based compensation expense.

 The unamortized cost associated with unvested stock grants and the weighted-average period over which it is expected to be recognized as of December 31, 2022 was and months, respectively. The fair value of restricted stock with time-based vesting features is based upon the Company s share price on the date of grant and is expensed over the service period. Fair value of performance grants that cliff vest based on the achievement of performance conditions is based on the share price of the Company s stock on the day of grant and is expensed over the performance period if it is probable that the award will vest. This fair value is expensed over the service period applicable to these grants. For performance grants that contain a range of shares from zero to maximum the Company determines, based on historic and projected results, the probability of (1) achieving the performance objective, and (2) the level of achievement. Based on this information, the Company determines the number of awards probable of vesting and expenses the grant date fair value of such awards over the service period related to these grants. Because the ultimate vesting of all performance grants is tied to the achievement of a performance condition, the Company estimates whether the performance condition will be met and over what period of time. Ultimately, the Company adjusts compensation cost according to the actual outcome of the performance condition. Under the Non-Employee Director Stock Incentive Plan, or NDSI Plan, each non-employee director, during the years presented, received his or her annual compensation in stock.

 is expected to be paid in 2023. These estimated water contract payments consist of SWP, contracts with Wheeler Ridge Maricopa Water Storage District, TCWD, Tulare Lake Basin Water Storage District, Dudley-Ridge Water Storage District and the Nickel water contract. The SWP contracts run through 2035 and the Nickel water contract runs through 2044, with an option to extend an additional years. As discussed in Note 6 (Long-Term Water Assets), the Company purchased the assignment of a contract to purchase water in late 2013. The assigned water contract is with Nickel and obligates the Company to purchase acre-feet of water annually through the term of the contract. The Company's contractual obligation for future water payments was as of December 31, 2022. 
 As of December 31, 2022, the Company has fulfilled its financial obligations to the Tejon Ranch Conservancy as prescribed in the Conservation Agreement that was entered into with five major environmental organizations in 2008. 
 The Company exited a consulting contract during the second quarter of 2014 related to the Grapevine Development and is obligated to pay an earned incentive fee at the time of successful receipt of litigated project entitlements and at a value measurement date after litigated entitlements have been achieved for Grapevine. The final amount of the incentive fees will not be finalized until the future payment dates. The Company believes that net savings from exiting the contract over this future time period will more than offset the incentive payment costs. 
 The Tejon Ranch Public Facilities Financing Authority, or TRPFFA, is a joint powers authority formed by Kern County and TCWD to finance public infrastructure within the Company s Kern County developments. For the development of TRCC, TRPFFA has created Community Facilities Districts, or CFDs: the West CFD and the East CFD. The West CFD has placed liens on acres of the Company s land to secure payment of special taxes related to of outstanding bond debt sold by TRPFFA for TRCC-West. The East CFD has placed liens on acres of the Company s land to secure payments of special taxes related to of outstanding bond debt sold by TRPFFA for TRCC-East. At TRCC-West, the West CFD has additional bond debt approved for issuance. At TRCC-East, the East CFD has approximately of additional bond debt authorized by TRPFFA that can be sold in the future. 
 In connection with the sale of bonds, there is a standby letter of credit for related to the issuance of East CFD bonds. The standby letter of credit is in place to provide additional credit enhancement and cover approximately ' worth of interest on the outstanding bonds. This letter of credit will not be drawn upon unless the Company, as the largest landowner in the CFD, fails to make its property tax payments. The Company believes that the letter of credit will never be drawn upon. The letter of credit is for and will be renewed in intervals as necessary. The annual cost related to the letter of credit is approximately . 
 The Company is obligated, as a landowner in each CFD, to pay its share of the special taxes assessed each year. The secured lands include both the TRCC-West and TRCC-East developments. Proceeds from the sale of West CFD bonds went to reimburse the Company for public infrastructure costs related to the TRCC-West development. At December 31, 2022 there were additional improvement funds remaining from West CFD bonds. There are of additional improvement funds remaining within the East CFD bonds for reimbursement of public infrastructure costs during future years. During 2022, the Company paid approximately in special taxes. As development continues to occur at TRCC, new owners of land and new lease tenants, through triple net leases, will bear an increasing portion of the assessed special tax. This amount could change in the future based on the amount of bonds outstanding and the amount of taxes paid by others. The assessment of each individual property sold or leased is not determinable at this time because it is based on the current tax rate and the assessed

 final average salary. The accounting for the defined benefit plan requires the use of assumptions and estimates in order to calculate periodic benefit cost and the value of the plan's assets and benefit obligation. These assumptions include discount rates, investment returns, and projected salary increases, amongst others. The discount rates used in valuing the plan's benefits obligations were determined with reference to high quality corporate and government bonds that are appropriately matched to the duration of the plan's obligation. 
 Contributions are intended to provide for benefits attributable to service both to date and expected to be provided in the future. The Company funds the plan in accordance with the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, or ERISA.

 Plan assets consist of equity, debt and short-term money market investment funds. The Benefit Plan s current investment policy changed during the third quarter of 2018. The new policy is an investment strategy in which the primary focus is to minimize the volatility of the funding ratio. This objective will result in a prescribed asset mix between "return seeking" assets (e.g. stocks) and a bond portfolio (e.g., long duration bonds) according to a pre-determined customized investment strategy based on the Plan's Funded Status as the primary input. This path will be used as a reference point as to the mix of assets, which by design will de-emphasize the return seeking portion as funded status improves. At December 31, 2022, the investment mix was approximately equity, debt, and money market funds. At December 31, 2021, the investment mix was approximately equity, debt and money market funds. Equity investments consist of a combination of individual equity securities plus value funds, growth funds, large cap funds and international stock funds. Debt investments consist of U.S. Treasury securities and investment grade corporate debt. The weighted-average discount rate used in determining the periodic pension cost is in 2022 and in 2021. The expected long-term rate of return on plan assets is in 2022 and in 2021. The long-term rate of return on plan assets is based on the historical returns within the plan and expectations for future returns.

The board of directors presently consists of three classes of directors based on when their terms expire. Each class is elected every three years to a three-year term.

 The Board has the authority, without any further action by stockholders, to issue 5,000,000 shares of preferred stock in one or more series with dividend rights, conversion rights, voting rights, redemption terms, liquidation preferences and other rights or preferences that could be senior to those of holders of common stock.

 Anti-Takeover Provisions 
 
 We are subject to Section 203 of the Delaware General Corporation Law, or DGCL.

 all other affirmative voting requirements imposed by applicable law or our restated certificate of incorporation are met. 
 
 Alternatively, the business combination can be approved by a majority of the Continuing Directors and such other vote as may be required by law or by our restated certificate of incorporation. 
 
 Related Person means any person, entity or group that beneficially owns five percent or more of the outstanding voting stock (subject to certain exceptions) and affiliates and associates of any such person, entity or group.

Consolidated Financial Statements 

As of December 31, 2022 and, 2021 and for the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020 

Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm 

To the Members of 
 Petro Travel Plaza Holdings LLC 
 
 Opinion 
 
 We have audited the consolidated financial statements of Petro Travel Plaza Holdings LLC and subsidiaries (the Company ), which comprise the consolidated balance sheet as of December 31, 2022, and the related consolidated statements of income, cash flows, and changes in members capital for the year then ended, and the related notes to the consolidated financial statements (collectively referred to as the financial statements ). 
 
 In our opinion, the accompanying financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of December 31, 2022, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for the year then ended in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. 
 
 Basis for Opinion 
 
 We conducted our audit in accordance with auditing standards generally accepted in the United States of America (GAAS). Our responsibilities under those standards are further described in the Auditor s Responsibilities for the Audit of the Financial Statements section of our report. We are required to be independent of the Company and to meet our other ethical responsibilities, in accordance with the relevant ethical requirements relating to our audit. We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our audit opinion. 
 
 Responsibilities of Management for the Financial Statements 
 
 Management is responsible for the preparation and fair presentation of the financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America, and for the design, implementation, and maintenance of internal control relevant to the preparation and fair presentation of financial statements that are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error. 
 
 In preparing the financial statements, management is required to evaluate whether there are conditions or events, considered in the aggregate, that raise substantial doubt about the Company s ability to continue as a going concern for one year after the date that the financial statements are available to be issued. 
 
 Auditor s Responsibilities for the Audit of the Financial Statements 
 
 Our objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements as a whole are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and to issue an auditor s report that includes our opinion. Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance but is not absolute assurance and therefore is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with GAAS will always detect a material misstatement when it exists. The risk of not detecting a material misstatement resulting from fraud is higher than for one resulting from error, as fraud may involve collusion, forgery, intentional omissions, misrepresentations, or the override of internal control. Misstatements are considered material if there is a substantial likelihood that, individually or in the aggregate, they would influence the judgment made by a reasonable user based on the financial statements. 
 
 In performing an audit in accordance with GAAS, we 
 
 Exercise professional judgment and maintain professional skepticism throughout the audit. 
 Identify and assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to fraud or error, and design and perform audit procedures responsive to those risks. Such procedures include examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. 
 1 

Obtain an understanding of internal control relevant to the audit in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Company s internal control. Accordingly, no such opinion is expressed. 
 Evaluate the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of significant accounting estimates made by management, as well as evaluate the overall presentation of the financial statements. 
 Conclude whether, in our judgment, there are conditions or events, considered in the aggregate, that raise substantial doubt about the Company s ability to continue as a going concern for a reasonable period of time. 
 
 We are required to communicate with those charged with governance regarding, among other matters, the planned scope and timing of the audit, significant audit findings, and certain internal control-related matters that we identified during the audit.

Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm 

To the Members of 
 Petro Travel Plaza Holdings LLC 

Opinion on the Financial Statements 
 We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Petro Travel Plaza Holdings LLC (the Company) as of December 31, 2021 and 2020, the related consolidated statements of income, cash flows, and changes in members capital for each of the two years in the period ended December 31, 2021, and the related notes to the consolidated financial statements (collectively, the financial statements). In our opinion, the financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of December 31, 2021 and 2020, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the two years in the period ended December 31, 2021, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. 
 
 Basis for Opinion 
 These financial statements are the responsibility of the Company s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company s financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB) and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. 
 
 We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB and in accordance with auditing standards generally accepted in the United States of America. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. The Company is not required to have, nor were we engaged to perform, an audit of its internal control over financial reporting. As part of our audits, we are required to obtain an understanding of internal control over financial reporting but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Company s internal control over financial reporting. Accordingly, we express no such opinion. 
 
 Our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.

(1) Summary of Significant Accounting Policies 
 General Information and Basis of Presentation 
 Petro Travel Plaza Holdings LLC (the Company ), a Delaware limited liability company, was formed on October 8, 2008, by Tejon Development Corporation., a California corporation Tejon ), and TA Operating LLC, a Delaware limited liability company TA and wholly-owned subsidiary of TravelCenters of America Inc. TA Inc. ). The Company has two wholly-owned subsidiaries Petro Travel Plaza LLC PTP and East Travel Plaza LLC ETP ), each of which is a California limited liability company. The Company's Limited Liability Company Operating Agreement, as amended, the Operating Agreement limits each members' liability to the fullest extent permitted by law. Pursuant to the terms of the Operating Agreement, TA manages the Company's operations and is responsible for the administrative, accounting and tax functions of the Company. 
 As of December 31, 2022, the Company has two travel centers, three convenience stores with retail gasoline stations and one standalone restaurant in Southern California, which we refer to collectively as the locations. One travel center and two convenience stores, owned by PTP, operate under the Petro brand and Goasis brand, respectively, and one travel center and one convenience store owned by ETP, operate under the TravelCenters of America brand and Goasis brand, respectively. The one standalone restaurant, owned by ETP, operates under the Black Bear Diner brand. The travel centers offer a broad range of products and services, including diesel fuel and gasoline, as well as nonfuel products and services such as truck repair and maintenance services, full service restaurants, quick service restaurants QSRs and various customer amenities, such as showers, weigh scales, a truck wash and laundry facilities. The convenience stores offer gasoline as well as a variety of nonfuel products and services, including coffee, groceries, fresh foods, and, in one store, a QSR. 
 The members and their interests in the Company are as follows Members Tejon 60.0 TA 40.0 
 In any fiscal year, the Company's profits or losses and distributions, if any, shall be allocated 60.0 to Tejon and 40.0 to TA pursuant to the terms of the Operating Agreement. 
 The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Company and its wholly owned subsidiaries, PTP and ETP, after eliminating intercompany transactions, profits and balances. The preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates. 
 Many of the restrictions that had been imposed in the United States during the COVID-19 pandemic have since been lifted and commercial activity in the United States generally has increasingly returned to pre-pandemic practices and operations. To date, the COVID-19 pandemic has not had a significant adverse impact on the Company's overall business. 
 The Company has evaluated subsequent events through March 7, 2023, which represents the date the financial statements were available to be issued. 
 
 Significant Accounting Policies 
 Inventory 
 Inventory is stated at the lower of cost or net realizable value. The Company determines cost principally on the weighted average cost method. The Company maintains reserves for the estimated amounts of obsolete and excess inventory. These estimates are based on unit sales histories and on hand inventory quantities, known market trends for inventory items and assumptions regarding factors such as future inventory needs, their ability and the related cost to return items to their suppliers and ability to sell inventory at a discount when necessary.

PETRO TRAVEL PLAZA HOLDINGS LLC 
 NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 
 (in thousands) 

Property and Equipment 
 Property and equipment are recorded at historical cost. Depreciation and amortization expense are provided using the straight line method over the estimated useful lives of the respective assets. Repairs and maintenance are charged to expense as incurred and amounted to 1,245, 961 and 872 for the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively. Renewals and betterments are capitalized. The cost and related accumulated depreciation of property and equipment sold, replaced or otherwise disposed is removed from the related accounts. 
 Impairment of Long Lived Assets 
 The Company reviews definite lived assets for potential indicators of impairment during each reporting period. The Company recognizes impairment charges when (a) the carrying value of a long lived asset or asset group to be held and used in the business is not recoverable and exceeds its fair value and (b) when the carrying value of a long lived asset or asset group to be disposed of exceeds the estimated fair value of the asset less the estimated cost to sell the asset. The Company's estimates of fair value are based on its estimates of likely market participant assumptions, including projected operating results and the discount rate used to measure the present value of projected future cash flows. The Company uses a number of assumptions and methods in preparing valuations underlying impairment tests including estimates of future cash flows and discount rate, and in some instances may obtain third party appraisals. The Company recognizes such impairment charges in the period during which the circumstances surrounding an asset or asset group to be held and used have changed such that the carrying value is no longer recoverable, or during which a commitment to a plan to dispose of the asset or asset group is made. The Company performs an impairment analysis for substantially all of its property and equipment at the individual site level because that is the lowest level of asset and liability groupings for which the cash flows are largely independent of the cash flows of other assets and liabilities. During 2022, 2021, and 2020 the Company did not record any impairment charges related to its long lived assets. 
 Contingencies 
 The Company records environmental remediation charges and penalties when the obligation to remediate is probable and the amount of associated costs is reasonably determinable. The Company estimates liabilities for other loss contingencies when it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of loss is reasonably estimable. The Company includes remediation expenses within operating expense in the consolidated statements of income. Generally, the timing of remediation expense recognized coincides with the completion of a feasibility study or the commitment to a formal plan of action. Accrued liabilities related to environmental matters are recorded on an undiscounted basis because of the uncertainty associated with the timing of the related future payments. In the Company's consolidated balance sheets, the accrual for environmental matters is included in other noncurrent liabilities, with the amount estimated to be expended within the subsequent 12 months included in other current liabilities. The Company recognizes a receivable for estimated future environmental costs that it may be reimbursed for once receipt of the recovery is probable and the Company is able to reasonably estimate the amount of the recovery, which is recorded within other noncurrent assets in the consolidated balance sheets. 
 Asset Retirement Obligations 
 The Company recognizes the future costs for the obligations related to the removal of underground storage tanks over the estimated useful lives of each asset requiring removal. The Company records a liability for the fair value of an asset retirement obligation with a corresponding increase to the carrying value of the related long lived asset at the time such an asset is installed. The Company bases the estimated liability on its historical experiences in removing these assets, their estimated useful lives, external estimates as to the cost to remove the assets in the future and regulatory or contractual requirements. Asset retirement obligations at December 31, 2022 and 2021 were 258 and 235, respectively and are presented in other noncurrent liabilities in the Company's consolidated balance sheets.

Self-Insurance Accruals 
 The Company has insurance programs for which it pays deductibles and for which the Company is partially self insured up to certain stop loss amounts, including claims under its general liability, workers compensation, motor vehicle and group health benefits policies and programs. Accruals are established under these insurance programs for both estimated losses on known claims and potential claims incurred but not asserted, based on claims histories and using actuarial methods. In the Company's consolidated balance sheets, as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, the accrual for self-insurance costs was 1,423 and 1,712, respectively, of which 977 and 1,166 are included in other noncurrent liabilities and 446 and 546 are presented in other current liabilities, respectively. 
 Revenue Recognition 
 The Company's revenues consist of fuel and nonfuel revenues. See Note 2 for more information about the Company's revenues. 
 Fuel Product Cost and Nonfuel Product Cost. 
 Fuel product cost primarily consists of the commodity fuel cost and related inbound transportation costs. Nonfuel product cost primarily consists of direct costs from suppliers. All site level labor expense is presented in site level operating expense in the consolidated statements of income. Depreciation and amortization expense is presented separately in depreciation and amortization expense in the consolidated statements of income. 
 In 2021, the Company executed separate branding agreements with two national retail gasoline suppliers to re-image certain sites to sell those brands of fuel. In 2022, these conversions were completed by the Company and the suppliers paid the Company up-front cash incentives and the reimbursement of certain expenses incurred to convert the sites. The Company has the right to terminate the branding agreements but would be obligated to return all or a portion of the incentives and reimbursements according to certain long-term milestone in the respective agreements. During the twelve months ended December 31, 2022, the Company did not amortize any portions of the deferred revenue related to the up-front incentives in the consolidated statements of income and expects to recognize in the future as reductions to fuel product cost in periods beyond 2023 as the retention milestones of the respective agreements are met. As of December 31, 2022, the Company has 2,970 of deferred revenue relating to these arrangements, which is recorded within other noncurrent liabilities in the consolidated balance sheets. 
 Advertising and Promotion Expense 
 Costs incurred in connection with advertising and promotions are expensed as incurred. Advertising and promotion expenses, which are included in site level operating expense in the consolidated statements of income, were 504, 483 and 322 for the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively. 
 Income Taxes 
 The Company is not subject to federal or state income taxes. Results of operations are allocated to the members in accordance with the provisions of the Operating Agreement and any taxes thereon are the responsibility of each member. 
 Comprehensive Income 
 As of December 31, 2022, the Company had no comprehensive income, other than the net income disclosed in the consolidated statements of income. 
 Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements 
 The following table summarizes recent accounting standard updates, or ASU, issued by the Financial Accounting Standards Board, or FASB, that could have an impact on the consolidated financial statements.

(2) Revenues 
 The Company recognizes revenues based on the consideration specified in the contract with the customer, excluding any sales incentives (such as customer loyalty programs and customer rebates) and amounts collected on behalf of third parties (such as sales and excise taxes). The majority of the Company's revenues are generated at the point of sale in its retail locations. 
 Fuel Revenues. The Company recognizes fuel revenues and the related costs at the time of sale to customers at its locations. The Company sells diesel fuel and gasoline to its customers at prices that it establishes daily or are indexed to market prices and reset daily. The Company sells diesel fuel under pricing arrangements with certain customers. 
 Nonfuel Revenues. The Company recognizes nonfuel revenues and the related costs at the time of sale to customers at its locations. The Company sells a variety of nonfuel products and services at stated retail prices in its travel centers, standalone convenience stores and standalone restaurant, as well as through the TA Truck Service Emergency Roadside Assistance program. Truck repair and maintenance goods or services may be sold at discounted pricing under pricing and rebate arrangements with certain customers. 
 Sales incentives and other promotional activities that the Company recognizes as a reduction to revenue include, but are not limited to, the following 
 Customer Loyalty Program. The Company offers travel center trucking customers the option to participate in TA's customer loyalty program. The customer loyalty program provides customers with the right to earn loyalty awards on qualifying purchases that can be used for discounts on future purchases of goods or services. The Company applies a relative standalone selling price approach to its outstanding loyalty awards whereby a portion of each sale attributable to the loyalty awards earned is deferred and will be recognized as revenue in the category in which the loyalty awards are redeemed upon the redemption or expiration of the loyalty awards. Significant judgment is required to determine the standalone selling price for loyalty awards. Assumptions used in determining the standalone selling price include the historic redemption rate and the use of a weighted average selling price for fuel to calculate the revenues attributable to the loyalty awards.

Accruals for environmental matters are recorded in operating expense when it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of the liability can be reasonably estimated. From time to time the Company has received, and in the future likely will receive, notices of alleged violations of environmental laws or otherwise has become or will become aware of the need to undertake corrective actions to comply with environmental laws at its properties. Investigatory and remedial actions were, and regularly are, undertaken with respect to releases of hazardous substances. The Company had an accrual for environmental matters of 23 as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, which was presented in the consolidated balance sheets in other noncurrent liabilities, with the amount estimated to be expended within the subsequent 12 months in accrued expenses and other current liabilities. Accruals are periodically evaluated and updated as information regarding the nature of the clean up work is obtained.
