Coronavirus
Impact (COVID-19) 

Due
to the recent outbreak of the coronavirus reported in many countries worldwide, local and federal governments have issued travel advisories,
canceled large scale public events and closed schools. In addition, companies have begun to cancel conferences and travel plans and require
employees to work from home. Global financial markets have also experienced extreme volatility and disruptions to capital and credit
markets. 

Adverse
events such as health-related concerns about working in our offices, the inability to travel, potential impact on our business partners
and customers, and other matters affecting the general work and business environment could harm our business and delay the implementation
of our business strategy. 

Management
is currently aware of the global and domestic issues arising from the Covid-19 pandemic and the possible direct and indirect effects
on the Company s operations which could have a material adverse effect on the Company s current financial position, future results of
operations, or liquidity, because its current operations are limited. However, investors should also be aware of factors, which includes
the possibility of Covid-19 effects on operational status, could have a negative impact on the Company s prospects and the consistency
of progress in the areas of revenue generation, liquidity, and generation of capital resources. These may include: (i) variations in
revenue, (ii) possible inability to attract investors for its equity securities or otherwise raise adequate funds from any source should
the company seek to do so, (iii) increased governmental regulation or significant changes in that regulation, (iv) increased competition,
(v) unfavorable outcomes to litigation involving the Company or to which the Company may become a party in the future, and (vi) a very
competitive and rapidly changing operating environment. The adverse events may also adversely impact our ability to raise capital or
to continue as a going concern. We continue to monitor the recent outbreak of the coronavirus on our operations. The global economic
slowdown and the other risks and uncertainties associated with the pandemic could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial
condition, results of operations and growth prospects. In addition, to the extent the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic adversely affects the
Company s business and results of operations, it may also have the effect of heightening many of the other risks and uncertainties which
the Company faces. 

Going
Concern 

On
December 31, 2022, we had total assets of 1,284 and total liabilities of 403,175. In the absence of significant revenue and profits,
we will be completely dependent on additional debt and equity financing. If we are unable to raise needed funds on acceptable terms,
we will not be able to execute our business plan, develop or enhance existing services, take advantage of future opportunities, if any,
or respond to competitive pressures or unanticipated requirements. If we do not obtain sufficient capital, we will not be able to continue
operations. 

As
of December 31, 2022, Gold Rock Holdings, Inc. had an accumulated deficit of 633,726, which included a net loss of 434,182. Also, during
the year ended December 31 2022, we used net cash of 40,292 for operating activities. These factors raise substantial doubt about our
ability to continue as a going concern. 

While
we are attempting to generate revenues, our cash position may not be significant enough to support our daily operations. Management
intends to raise additional funds by way of an offering of our debt or equity securities. Management believes that the actions
presently being taken to further implement our business plan and generate revenues provide the opportunity for BioForce to continue as
a going concern. ;While we believe in the viability of our strategy to generate revenues and in our ability to raise additional
funds, we may not be successful. 

Our
ability to continue as a going concern is dependent upon our capability to further implement our business plan and generate revenues. 

Results
of Operations 

Year
Ended December 31, 2022 Compared to Year Ended December 31, 2021. 

Revenues
for the Company s year ended December 31, 2022 and December 31, 2021 totaled -0- from the sales of the Company s UGnet construction
management, engineering services and fiber network design. 

Cost
of Goods Sold for the year ended December 31, 2022 and December 31, 2021 totaled -0-. 

Gross
margins for year ended December 2022 and 2021 was -0- due to no sales of the Company s UGnet construction management, engineering
services and fiber network design. 

Gross
profit for the year ended December 31, 2022 and 2021 was -0- due to -0- sales.. 

General
and Administrative expenses for the year ended December 31, 2022 totaled 41,682 compared to 50,044 for December 31, 2021, primarily
due to decreases in professional service fees. 

Net
Loss 

Net
loss for the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021 were 434,182 and 92,044, respectively. The increase in loss was due to increases
in consluting fees. 

Liquidity
and Capital Resources: 

As
of December 31, 2022, our assets totaled 1,284 in Cash. The Company s total liabilities were 403,175, which consisted of accounts payable
and accrued expenses and accrued board of directors compensation. As of December 31, 2022, the Company had an accumulated deficit of
 633,726 and working capital deficit of 402,891 

- 4 - 

The
Company s significant operating losses raise substantial doubt about its ability to continue as a going concern. The financial
statements do not include any adjustments that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty. As indicated herein, we need capital
for the implementation of our business plan, and we will need additional capital for continuing our operations. We do not have
sufficient revenues to pay our operating expenses at this time. Unless the Company is able to raise working capital, it is likely
that the Company will either have to cease operations or substantially change its methods of operations or change its business plan.
For the next 12 months the Company has an oral commitment from its CEO to advance funds as necessary to meeting our operating requirement. 

Investing
Activities 

Net
cash used in investing activities was 0 for both calendar years ended December 31, 2022, and 2021. 

Cash
from Financing Activities 

Net
cash provided by financing activities was 39,876 for year ended December 31, 2022, and was 45,959 for year ended December 31, 2021. 

Critical
Accounting Policies 

Our
consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes are prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in
the United States. Preparing financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that impact the reported
amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue, and expenses. These estimates and assumptions are affected by management s application
of accounting policies. Critical accounting policies include revenue recognition and impairment of long-lived assets. 

Revenue
Recognition 

In
accordance with ASC Topic 606, Revenue from Contracts with Customers ASC 606 ), revenues are recognized when control of the
promised goods or services is transferred to our clients, in an amount that reflects the consideration to which we expect to be entitled
in exchange for those goods and services. To achieve this core principle, we apply the following five steps: 1) Identify the contract
with a client; (2) Identify the performance obligations in the contract; (3) Determine the transaction price; (4) Allocate the transaction
price to performance obligations in the contract; and (5) Recognize revenues when or as the company satisfies a performance obligation. 

We
adopted this ASC on January 1, 2021. Although the new revenue standard is expected to have an immaterial impact, if any, on our ongoing
net income, we did implement changes to our processes related to revenue recognition and the control activities within them. 

Stock-Based
Compensation 

We
account for employee and non-employee stock-based compensation in accordance with the guidance of FASB ASC Topic 718, Compensation Stock
Compensation, which requires all share-based payments, including grants of stock options, to be recognized in the financial
statements based on their fair values. The fair value of the equity instrument is charged directly to compensation expense and
credited to additional paid-in capital over the period during which services are rendered. 

Recent
Accounting Pronouncements 

The
Company has implemented all new accounting pronouncements that are in effect and is evaluating any that may impact its financial statements,
including revenue recognition. The Company does not believe that there are any other new accounting pronouncements that have been
issued that might have a material impact on its financial position or results of operations. 

Off-Balance
Sheet Arrangements 

We
do not have any off-balance sheet arrangements.

and with the participation of management, including our Chief Operating Officer and Chief Financial Officer. Disclosure Controls are
controls and procedures designed to reasonably assure that information required to be disclosed in our reports filed under the Exchange
Act, such as this Form 10-K, is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the U.S. Securities
and Exchange Commission s rules and forms. Disclosure Controls are also designed to provide reasonable assurance that such information
is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our Chief Operating Officer and Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate
to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. 

The
evaluation of our Disclosure Controls included a review of the controls objectives and design, our implementation of the controls
and the effect of the controls on the information generated for use in this Form 10-K. Throughout the course of our evaluation of our
internal control over financial reporting, we advised our Board of Directors that we had identified a material weakness as defined under
standards established by the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). A material weakness is a deficiency, or combination
of deficiencies, in internal control over financial reporting, such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement
of the Company s annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis. The material weakness
we identified is discussed in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting below. Our Chief Operating Officer and Chief Financial
Officer have concluded that as a result of the material weakness, as of the end of the period covered by this Annual Report on Form 10-K,
our Disclosure Controls were not effective. 

Internal
Control over Financial Reporting 

Our
management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting; as such term is defined
in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) of the Exchange Act. 

Our
internal control system was designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation
of financial statements for external purposes, in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. Because of inherent limitations,
a system of internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of
effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate due to change in conditions, or that the
degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. 

Our
management, including our principal operating officer and principal accounting officer, conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness
of our internal control over financial reporting using the criteria set forth by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway
Commission (COSO) in Internal Control Integrated Framework. 

Based
on our evaluation, our management concluded that there is a material weakness in our internal control over financial reporting. The material
weakness identified did not result in the restatement of any previously reported financial statements or any related financial disclosure,
nor does management believe that it had any effect on the accuracy of the Company s financial statements for the current reporting
period. 

The Company has inadequate segregation of duties within its cash disbursement control design. 

During the year ended December 31, 2022, the Company internally performed all aspects of its financial reporting process, including,
but not limited to the underlying accounting records and the recording of journal entries and for the preparation of financial statements.
This process was deficient, because these duties were performed often times by the same people, and therefore a lack of review was created
over the financial reporting process that might result in a failure to detect errors in spreadsheets, calculations, or assumptions used
to compile the financial statements and related disclosures as filed with the SEC. These control deficiencies could result in a material
misstatement to our interim or annual financial statements that would not be prevented or detected. 

The Company is continuing the process of remediating its control deficiencies. However, the material weakness in internal control over
financial reporting that has been identified will not be remediated until numerous internal controls are implemented and operate for
a period of time, are tested, and the Company is able to conclude that such internal controls are operating effectively. The Company
cannot provide assurance that these procedures will be successful in identifying material errors that may exist in the financial statements.
The Company cannot make assurances that it will not identify additional material weaknesses in its internal control over financial reporting
in the future. Management plans, as capital becomes available to the Company, to increase the accounting and financial reporting staff
and provide future investments in the continuing education and public company accounting training of our accounting and financial professionals. 

- 6 - 

Our
internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that: 

(i)
pertain to the maintenance of records, that in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions
of our assets; 

(ii)
provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance
with generally accepted accounting principles, and that our receipts and expenditures are being made only in accordance with the authorization
of our management and directors, and; 

(iii)
provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of our assets that
could have a material effect on our financial statements. 

Because
of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of
any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions,
or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. 

Management,
including our Principal Executive Officer and Principal Financial Officer, assessed the effectiveness of our internal control over financial
reporting as of December 31, 2022. In making this assessment, management used the May 2013 updated criteria set forth by the Committee
of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO) in Internal Control over Financial Reporting - Guidance for Smaller Public
Companies. 

It
should be noted that any system of controls, however well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable, and not absolute, assurance
that the objectives of the system are met. In addition, the design of any control system is based in part upon certain assumptions about
the likelihood of future events. Because of these and other inherent limitations of control system, there can be no assurance that any
design will succeed in achieving its stated goals under all potential future conditions. 

Because
of the material weakness described above, management concluded that, as of December 31, 2021 our internal control over financial reporting
was not effective based on the criteria established in Internal Control-Integrated Framework issued by COSO. There has been no change
in our internal controls that occurred during our most recent fiscal period that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to
affect, our internal controls. 

In
May 2013, the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission COSO released an updated version of its
Internal Control - Integrated Framework 2013 Framework ), Initially issued in 1992, the original framework 1992 Framework provided guidance to organizations to design, implement and evaluate the effectiveness of internal control concepts and simplify their
use and application. The 2013 Framework is intended to improve upon systems of internal control over external financial reporting by
formalizing the principles embedded in the 1992 Framework, incorporating business and operating environment changes and increasing the
framework ease of use and application. The 1992 Framework remained available until December 15, 2014, after which it was superseded by
the 2013 Framework. The Company did not experience significant changes to its internal control over financial reporting as a result of
the transition to the 2013 Framework. 

This
annual report does not include an attestation report of the Company s registered public accounting firm regarding internal control
over financial reporting. Management s report was not subject to attestation by the Company s registered public accounting
firm pursuant to rules of the SEC that permit smaller reporting companies like us to provide only management s report in this annual
report. 

This
report shall not be deemed to be filed for purposes of Section 18 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, or otherwise subject to the
liabilities of that section, and is not incorporated by reference into any filing of the Company, whether made before or after the date
hereof, regardless of any general incorporation language in such filing. 

No
changes have occurred in the Company s internal controls over financial reporting during the Company s last fiscal quarter,
which has materially affected or is likely to affect such controls.

Report

To
the shareholders and the board of directors of Gold Rock Holdings, Inc. 

Opinion
on the Financial Statements 

We
have audited the accompanying balance sheets of Gold Rock Holdings, Inc. as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, the related statements of
operations, stockholders equity (deficit), and cash flows for the years then ended, and the related notes (collectively referred to
as the financial statements ). In our opinion, the financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial
position of the Company as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for the years then ended,
in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. 

Substantial
Doubt about the Company s Ability to Continue as a Going Concern 

The
accompanying financial statements have been prepared assuming that the Company will continue as a going concern. As discussed in Note
4 to the financial statements, the Company has suffered recurring losses from operations and has a significant accumulated deficit. In
addition, the Company continues to experience negative cash flows from operations. These factors raise substantial doubt about the Company s
ability to continue as a going concern. Management s plans in regard to these matters are also described in Note 4. The financial statements
do not include any adjustments that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty. 

Basis
for Opinion 

These
financial statements are the responsibility of the Company s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company s
financial statements based on our audit. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board
(United States) PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal
securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. 

We
conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain
reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. The Company
is not required to have, nor were we engaged to perform, an audit of its internal control over financial reporting. As part of our audits
we are required to obtain an understanding of internal control over financial reporting but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion
on the effectiveness of the Company s internal control over financial reporting. Accordingly, we express no such opinion. 

Our
audit included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or
fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding
the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audit also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant
estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe that our audit provides
a reasonable basis for our opinion.
