 Background 
 The Company (through its subsidiaries) provides turn-key wireless infrastructure services for wireless carriers, tower companies and equipment manufacturers, and distributes and services a comprehensive line of electronics and hardware for the telecommunications industry. The Company was incorporated under the laws of Oklahoma in September 1989 as ADDvantage Media Group, Inc. In December 1999, its name was changed to ADDvantage Technologies Group, Inc. In 2019, the Company moved its headquarters from Broken Arrow, Oklahoma to Carrollton, Texas and acquired Fulton Technologies, Inc. Fulton on January 4, 2019, which established the Company s Wireless Infrastructure Services segment. The Company s Telecommunications segment operates through its subsidiaries, Nave Communications Company Nave and ADDvantage Triton, LLC Triton ). 
 Our wireless infrastructure subsidiary provides services such as wireless macro site development, distributed antenna systems, small cells and project management expertise with national and regional scalability. Fulton's expertise includes site modifications, tower retrofits, including 5G, civil construction, tower erection, utility installation and testing, site acquisition including leasing, zoning and permitting, design and architect-engineering services. 
 For our telecommunications subsidiaries, we sell new, surplus-new and refurbished equipment that we purchase in the market as a result of telecommunications system upgrades or overstock supplies. We maintain one of the industry's largest inventories of new and used equipment, which allows us to expedite delivery of system-critical products to our customers. In addition, we offer our customers decommissioning services for surplus and obsolete equipment, which we in turn process through our recycling program. We continually evaluate new product offerings in the broader telecommunications industry as technology evolves and upgrade our product offerings to stay current with our customer s technology platforms.

 Change in year end 
 In September 2022, the Company's Board of Directors approved a change in the Company's fiscal year end from September 30 to December 31, effective for the fiscal year beginning January 1, 2022. As a result of the change in year end, the Company filed a Transition Report on Form 10-Q for the period from October 1, 2021 through December 31, 2021. 
 Operating Segments 
 The Company s current reportable segments are Wireless Infrastructure Services Wireless and Telecommunications Telco ). 
 Products and Services 
 Wireless Segment 
 We provide turn-key wireless infrastructure services for the four major U.S. wireless carriers, communication tower companies, national integrators, and original equipment manufacturers that support these wireless carriers. These services primarily consist of the installation and upgrade of technology on cell sites and the construction of new small cells for 5G. 
 
 Fulton has 90 employees. Fulton performs equipment installations, upgrades and maintenance services for its customers primarily on communication towers. Having the proper safety record, training capability and quality oversight is paramount in the industry. Fulton has prided itself in performing work in a safe and timely manner and delivering high-quality services to its clients. Demand for tower equipment installation and upgrade services has notably increased as observed. We expect this trend to continue for the foreseeable future as wireless carriers continue to add capacity, expand their networks and upgrade their current technology for high speed connectivity to 5G. 
 
 Fulton also supports the installation and support of temporary tower locations. This niche and growing business includes the erection of temporary towers to allow for the maintenance of permanent locations without causing a degradation of wireless coverage in the area. In addition, Fulton provides temporary tower solutions for special events that require an increase of coverage and capacity for festivals, concerts and sporting events. Fulton has an inventory of temporary poles of different sizes and uses a unique installation process for the quick deployment of a tower location with little to no environmental impact. 
 Telco Segment 
 The Telco segment provides quality new and used telecommunication networking equipment, including both central office and customer premise equipment, to its customer base of telecommunications providers, enterprise customers and resellers by utilizing its inventory from a broad range of manufacturers as well as other supply channels. This segment also offers its customers repair and testing services for telecommunications networking equipment. In addition, this segment offers its customers decommissioning services for surplus and obsolete equipment, which it in turn processes through its recycling partner. 
 Central Office Equipment Central office equipment includes optical transport, switching, and data center equipment on a customer s communication network. Optical equipment products aggregate and transport internet traffic; switching equipment products originate, terminate and route voice traffic; and data equipment products transport internet and voice over internet protocol traffic via routers. 
 
 Customer Premise Equipment Consumer premise equipment includes integrated access devices, channel banks, internet protocol private branch exchange or IP PBX phones, and routers that are placed inside the customer site that will receive the communication signal from the communication services provider. 
 4 

In addition, we offer our customers decommissioning services for surplus and obsolete telecom equipment, which we then process through a Responsible Recycling certified recycling partner. 
 Revenues by Geographic Areas 
 Our revenues by geographic areas were as follows for the year ended December 31, 2022, the transition period of three months ended December 31, 2021, and the year ended September 30, 2021, in thousands: 
 Year Ended Three Months Ended Year Ended December 31, December 31, September 30, 2022 2021 2021 United States Wireless 30,813 7,119 20,708 Telco 60,021 10,480 36,799 International Telco 6,194 1,091 4,653 97,028 18,690 62,160 
 Revenues attributed to geographic areas are based on the location of the customer. All of our long-lived assets are located within the United States. 
 Sales and Marketing 
 Wireless Segment 
 The Wireless segment accounted for 32 , 38 , and 33 of consolidated revenues for the year ended December 31, 2022, the transition period of three months ended December 31, 2021, and the year ended September 30, 2021, respectively. In 2022, wireless tower and temporary tower services, including the procurement of the requisite materials, represented substantially all of the Wireless segment s revenues. In this segment, we market and sell our services to wireless carriers, wireless equipment providers and tower companies. 
 Telco Segment 
 The Telco segment accounted for 68 , 62 , and 67 of consolidated revenues for the year ended December 31, 2022, the transition period of three months ended December 31, 2021, and the year ended September 30, 2021, respectively. Sales of new products in 2022 represented 16 of revenues and refurbished products represented 83 . Repair services, recycle sales and other services contributed the remaining 1 of Telco segment revenues. In this segment, we market and sell our products to franchise and private multiple-system operators,, telecommunication companies, system contractors, other industry resellers, enterprise customers and directly to consumers via online sales. Our sales and marketing are predominantly performed by our experienced internal sales and customer service staff, outside sales representatives located in various geographic and strategic areas of the country, and many online sales channel platforms such as our own website, Amazon, Walmart, eBay and Newegg. The majority of our sales activity is generated through customer relationships developed by our sales personnel and executives, referrals from manufacturers we represent, and online advertising. 
 We maintain a wide breadth of new and used products and many times can offer our customers same day shipments. We believe we carry one of the most diverse inventories of any telecommunication product reseller in the country, and we have access to additional inventory via our various supply channels. We believe our investment in on-hand inventory, our product supply channels, and our experienced sales and customer service team create a competitive advantage for us. 
 Suppliers 
 The Telco segment primarily purchases its used inventory from telecommunication companies and wholesale suppliers that have excess equipment on hand or have upgraded their systems or from other resellers in this industry. 
 5 

Seasonality 
 In the Wireless segment, the services that we provide on our customers wireless towers are outdoors and can be damaged by storms and power surges. Consequently, we can experience increased demand on certain product offerings during the months between late spring and early fall when severe weather or consistent rain tends to be more prominent than at other times during the year. Winter months are generally slower due to the cold weather conditions, and the inability to access wireless towers during periods of heavy snow and ice. 
 In the Telco segment, we do not anticipate that quarterly operating results will generally be impacted by seasonal fluctuations, other than normal business fluctuations during the winter holiday season. 
 Competition 
 Wireless Segment 
 
 The wireless infrastructure services business competes with other wireless service companies on a local, regional or national basis. In some areas, Fulton provides services that its customers can also provide utilizing their in-house personnel. However, most of the direct competition in the Wireless segment is regionally based from companies of a similar size. In niche areas of service, like our Special Events and Temporary Pole business in the Midwest and in certain markets, the Wireless segment has few competitors due to its expertise and the required investment in equipment and assets. The level of competition can vary based on demand characteristics in certain markets. 
 For the Wireless segment, we believe our differentiation from other service providers in the marketplace is primarily the following: 
 Past performance and experience developed over 30 years; 
 Robust safety organization; 
 Ability to recruit and retain personnel and a Midwest workforce of long-tenured personnel of 20 to 30-plus years of service; 
 Broad range of multi-year master service agreements in place with carriers, original equipment manufacturers (OEM s), tower owners and integrators; 
 Industry relationships; and 
 Having a diversified offering of services based on know-how and equipment. 
 Telco Segment 
 The overall telecommunications equipment industry is highly competitive. We compete with numerous resellers in the marketplace that sell both direct and online. 
 For the Telco segment, we believe our differentiation from other resellers includes: 
 Broad range of new, refurbished and used inventory, which allows us to meet our customers timing needs; 
 Ability to source unique and sometimes rare, high demand inventory; 
 Offer a range of repair and testing capabilities to help improve the quality of our inventory as well as offering repair and testing of equipment as a service to our customers and vendors; 
 Experienced sales support staff that maintain strong and longstanding relationships with our customers; 
 Sales force that has a strong technical knowledge of the products we offer; 
 Provide multiple services for our customers including deinstallation and decommission of products, storage and management of spare inventory and recycling. 
 Working Capital Practices 
 In the Wireless segment, we utilize quick payment accounts receivable programs with our major customers and our bank to decrease the amount of time between project completion and payment. The majority of working capital needs result from the payment of project related costs before invoicing the customer. This includes personnel, subcontractors, equipment rentals and materials. Although the quick payment programs are in place to accelerate receivable payments, working capital is necessary to complete the jobs and provide the necessary closeout packages required for customer approval. 
 In the Telco segment, we utilize quick payment accounts receivable programs with our bank to decrease the time between sale of inventory and collection. We choose to carry a relatively large volume of inventory due to our on-hand, on-demand business model. We typically utilize excess cash flows to reinvest in inventory to maintain or 
 6 

expand our product offerings. The greatest need for working capital occurs when we make bulk purchases of surplus-new and used inventory, or when our OEM suppliers offer additional discounts on large purchases. 
 On March 17, 2022, the Company replaced its 3.0 million credit facility for its Nave and Triton subsidiaries with its primary financial lender with new accounts receivable purchase facilities. The Company also restructured its accounts receivable purchase facilities secured by the Company s Fulton subsidiary s receivables. With the new and restructured receivables purchase facilities, the Company has an overall capacity to factor its accounts receivable of 19.0 million for working capital needs. 
 Significant Customers 
 During the year ended December 31, 2022, one wireless customer accounted for 17 of consolidated revenues, and 52 of our Wireless segment revenues. Our top five Wireless customers accounted for 29 of consolidated revenues and 92 of Wireless segment revenues during fiscal year 2022. One Telco customer accounted for 11 of consolidated revenues, and 17 of Telco segment revenues. Our top five Telco customers accounted for 32 of consolidated revenues and 47 of Telco segment revenues during fiscal year 2022. 
 During the transition period of three months ended December 31, 2021, one wireless customer accounted for 26 of consolidated revenues, and 68 of our Wireless segment revenues. Our top five Wireless customers accounted for 36 of consolidated revenues and 95 of Wireless segment revenues during fiscal year 2022. One Telco customer accounted for 11 of consolidated revenues, and 17 of Telco segment revenues. Our top five Telco customers accounted for 26 of consolidated revenues and 43 of Telco segment revenues during the transition period of three months ended December 31, 2021. 
 During the year ended September 30, 2021, though we were not dependent upon a single or few customers to support our consolidated revenues, one wireless customer accounted for 10 of consolidated revenues, and 31 of our Wireless segment revenues. Our top five Wireless customers accounted for 28 of consolidated revenues and 84 of Wireless segment revenues during fiscal year 2021. One Telco customer accounted for 18 of consolidated revenues, and 27 of Telco segment revenues. Our top five Telco customers accounted for 30 of consolidated revenues and 45 of Telco segment revenues during fiscal year 2021. 
 Impact of Inflation on Operations 
 Inflation in the United States did not have a material impact on our results of operations for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2022. For the fiscal year ended September 30, 2021, component price increases were observed in the fiscal fourth quarter, which negatively impacted our gross margins in the Wireless segment. 
 Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements 
 
 We have no off-balance sheet arrangements that have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on our financial condition, changes in financial condition, revenues or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources that is material to investors. 
 Personnel 
 At December 31, 2022, we had 147 employees, including 145 full-time employees. Management considers its relationships with its employees to be excellent. Our employees are not unionized, and we are not subject to any collective bargaining agreements. 
 
 Item 2. Properties. 
 Each subsidiary leases property for office, warehouse and service center facilities. Our corporate headquarters is located in Carrollton, Texas. Our Wireless Segment leases additional space in Chicago, Illinois, and our Telco Segment has operations in Miami, Florida. We believe that our current facilities are adequate to meet our needs. 
 The Company has a right-of-use for a building in Jessup, Maryland which was no longer being used in operations. The Maryland property was subleased as of December 31, 2022 and will end in November, 2023. 
 7 

Item 3. Legal Proceedings. 
 From time to time in the ordinary course of business, we are a party to various types of legal proceedings. We do not believe that these proceedings, individually or in the aggregate, will have a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations or cash flows.

 General 
 The Company reports its financial performance based on two external reporting segments: Wireless and Telecommunications. These reportable segments are described below. 
 Wireless Infrastructure Services Wireless 
 The Company's Wireless Segment, which consists entirely of the assets of Fulton, provides turn-key wireless infrastructure services for the four major U.S. wireless carriers, communication tower companies, national 
 9 

integrators, and original equipment manufacturers that support these wireless carriers. These services primarily consist of the installation and upgrade of technology on cell sites and the construction of new small cells for 5G. 
 Telecommunications Telco 
 The Company s Telco segment sells new and refurbished telecommunications networking equipment, including both central office and customer premise equipment, to its customer base of telecommunications providers, enterprise customers and resellers located primarily in North America. This segment also offers its customers repair and testing services for telecommunications networking equipment. In addition, this segment offers its customers decommissioning services for surplus and obsolete equipment, which it in turn processes through a recycling partner. 
 
 Recent Business Developments 
 Change in year end 
 In September 2022, the Company's Board of Directors approved a change in the Company's fiscal year end from September 30 to December 31, effective for the fiscal year beginning January 1, 2022. As a result of the change in year end, the Company filed a Transition Report on Form 10-Q for the period from October 1, 2021 through December 31, 2021. 
 Wireless Segment Operating Results 
 During 2022, Fulton achieved revenues of 30.8 million. Fulton has maintained a strong employee base, and we continue to successfully recruit strong industry talent throughout the business to help us implement operational improvements with a focus on improving our quality and project margins. We also have a large part of our workforce made up of reliable, high quality subcontractors that give us the ability to flex up and down with the changes in workload and to ramp up quickly for new programs. We are expecting increased activity in the industry as wireless carriers roll out 5G and the required densification of their networks. Our goal is to solidify our processes and project oversight to successfully and profitably take advantage of new growth opportunities as the 5G expansion becomes essential. 
 Telco Segment 
 The Telco segment achieved revenues of 66.2 million during 2022. We continue to focus our core team on sales and procurement. Both Nave and Triton grew over 40 year-over-year in 2022. 
 At Triton, our facility is designed to streamline our processes, including inventory management, shipping and receiving and the refurbishment operations. We have developed the internal systems necessary to expand our refurbishment capabilities and new equipment sales by adding additional product lines and manufacturers. We have also increased our focus on the brokerage business and internet sales by expanding our sales channels. We believe that Triton is poised to expand, capturing additional market share and developing new customers. 
 Our Nave business experienced significant upside during the year related to the global chip shortage along with expansion of our offerings to both wireless and optical network carriers to support both wireless and broadband connectivity for optical and IP transport. 
 
 Results of Operations 
 Comparison of Operating Results for the Years Ended December 31, 2022 and September 30, 2021 
 Consolidated 
 Consolidated sales increased 34.8 million, or 56 , to 97.0 million for 2022 from 62.2 million for 2021. The increase in sales was related to an increase of 24.7 million in the Telco segment mainly attributable to increased demand for refurbished network equipment resulting from the global chip shortage. Sales for the Wireless segment increased 10.1 million as a result of the 5G network rollout. 
 Consolidated gross profit increased 11.6 million, or 72 , to 27.8 million for 2022 from 16.1 million for 2021. Telco gross profit increased 9.3 million and our Wireless segment gross profit increased 2.3 million. The improvement in gross profit was due to strong demand in our Telco segment fueled by global supply issues, along 
 10 

with expansion of our offerings to both wireless and optical network carriers to support both wireless and broadband connectivity for optical and IP transport. 
 Consolidated operating expenses include indirect costs associated with operating our business. Indirect costs include indirect personnel costs, facility costs, vehicles, fuel, insurance, communication, and business taxes, among other cost categories. Operating expenses increased 0.5 million to 9.8 million for the twelve months ended December 31, 2022 compared with 9.3 million for the prior year. The increase in operating expenses was due primarily to our investment in our regional growth strategy to meet the demand of our customers in the Wireless segment, partially offset by cost control measures instituted by the Company during the latter part of the first quarter and continuing throughout 2022. 
 Consolidated selling, general and administrative ("SG A") expenses include overhead costs, which consist of personnel costs, insurance, professional services, and communication, among other less significant cost categories. SG A expense increased 0.7 million or 5 to 15.6 million in 2022 compared to 14.9 million in 2021. The increase in SG A relates primarily to increased selling and commissions expenses to support higher revenues. 
 The income tax provision (benefit) was 8 thousand for 2022 and (0.1) million for 2021, or an effective tax rate of 1.7 and (0.8) , respectively. The income tax provision in fiscal 2022 was the result of State income taxes which were not offset by losses from other subsidiaries. The income tax benefit in fiscal 2021 was the result of an increase in the valuation allowance against our deferred tax assets, offset by certain refundable credits generated in the current fiscal year. The Company continues to provide a valuation allowance of 9.1 million for net deferred assets where the Company believes it is more likely than not that those deferred taxes will not be realized. 
 Segment results 
 Wireless 
 Revenues for the Wireless segment were 30.8 million and 20.7 million for the years ended December 31, 2022 and September 30, 2021, respectively, an increase of 49 . The growth in revenues over the prior year relates to the pace of the 5G services activity undertaken on behalf of our expanded customer base. 
 Gross profit was 8.6 million, or 28 for the year ended December 31, 2022 and 6.3 million, or 30 , for the year ended September 30, 2021. The decrease in the gross profit percentage was the result of new business with a major customer at a lower margin level caused by deploying to new markets and related startup costs, and as a result of a couple of non-profitable markets, due to lower volume commitments from some customers, which we have exited. 
 Loss from operations was 4.8 million and 6.9 million for the years ended December 31, 2022 and September 30, 2021, respectively. The decrease is mainly attributable to the increase in revenues and improvements in operating efficiencies. 
 Telco 
 Revenues for the Telco segment were 66.2 million and 41.5 million for the years ended December 31, 2022 and September 30, 2021, respectively, an increase of 24.7 million, or 59 . The increase was related to increased sales of used and refurbished equipment as a result of global supply chain constraints along with expansion of our offerings to both wireless and optical network carriers to support both wireless and broadband connectivity for optical and IP transport. 
 Gross profit increased 9.3 million, or 95 , to 19.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2022 compared to 9.9 million for the year ended September 30, 2021. Gross margin was 29 and 24 for the years ended December 31, 2022 and September 30, 2021, respectively. Gross margin increased primarily as a result of the segment's increase in revenues coupled with an increase in gross profit percent by 5 due to price elasticity associated with global supply chain issues. 
 Income from operations was 6.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2022 compared to a loss of 2.4 million for the year ended September 30, 2021. The increase was attributable to the increase in revenue and the aforementioned improvements. 
 Comparison of Operating Results for the Three Months Ended December 31, 2021 and December 31, 2020 
 11 

Consolidated 
 Consolidated sales increased 6.0 million, or 47 , to 18.7 million for the three months ended December 31, 2021 from 12.7 million for the three months ended December 31, 2020. The increase was primarily due to a 1.9 million increase in Wireless revenue related to 5G tower work, and an increase of 4.1 million in Telco revenue due to increased demand for refurbished telecommunications equipment sold by the Telco segment. 
 Consolidated gross profit was 4.6 million, or 25 gross margin, compared to gross profit of 3.6 million, or 28 gross margin, for the same period last year. The net changes in gross profit were due to higher overall sales in both the Wireless and Telco segments, and the decrease in gross margin as a percent of sales was due to investments made with a new wireless customer and the impact of the Company onboarding new crews in anticipation of near-term wireless revenue increases. 
 Consolidated operating expenses increased 0.5 million to 2.5 million for the three months ended December 31, 2021 compared to 2.0 million the same period last year. The increase reflects the Company's investment in its regional growth strategy related to expected 5G infrastructure growth. 
 Consolidated SG A expense increased 0.5 million, or 15 , to 3.7 million for the three months ended December 31, 2021 from 3.2 million for the same period last year. The increase in SG A relates primarily to increased selling and commissions expenses to support higher revenues. 
 Segment Results 
 Wireless 
 Revenues for the Wireless segment increased 1.9 million to 7.1 million for the three months ended December 31, 2021 from 5.2 million for the same period of 2020. The growth in revenues over the prior year relates to the pace of the 5G services activity in 2021. 
 Gross profit was 1.5 million, or 21 for the three months ended December 31, 2021 and 1.6 million, or 31 , for the three months ended December 31, 2020. The decrease in the gross profit percentage was the result of new business with a major customer at a lower margin level, along with continuing investment in our regional growth strategy associated with anticipated 5G infrastructure build outs, which includes the expansion and training of new wireless service crews. 
 Loss from operations was 2.3 million and 1.1 million for three months ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively. The increase is mainly attributable to investment in our regional growth strategy associated with anticipated 5G infrastructure build outs. 
 Telco 
 Revenues for the Telco segment increased 4.1 million to 11.6 million for the three months ended December 31, 2021 from 7.5 million for the same period of 2020. The increase in revenues was related to increased sales of used and refurbished equipment as a result of global supply chain constraints along with expansion of our offerings to both wireless and optical network carriers to support both wireless and broadband connectivity for optical and IP transport.. 
 Gross profit was 3.1 million, or 27 for the three months ended December 31, 2021 and 2.0 million, or 27 for the three months ended December 31, 2020. The increased gross profit was due primarily to increased revenues of 4.1 million. 
 Income from operations was 0.4 million for the three months ended December 31, 2021 compared to a loss of 0.8 million for the same period last year, primarily due to the reasons discussed above.

Non-GAAP Financial Measure 
 Adjusted EBITDA is a supplemental, non-GAAP financial measure. EBITDA is defined as earnings before interest expense, income taxes, depreciation and amortization. Adjusted EBITDA as presented also excludes stock compensation expense, gain on extinguishment of debt, impairment of intangibles and right of use assets, other income, other expense, interest income and income from equity method investment. Adjusted EBITDA is presented below because this metric is used by the financial community as a method of measuring our financial performance and of evaluating the market value of companies considered to be in similar businesses. Since Adjusted EBITDA is not a measure of performance calculated in accordance with GAAP, it should not be considered in isolation of, or as a substitute for, net earnings as an indicator of operating performance. Adjusted EBITDA may not be comparable to similarly titled measures employed by other companies. In addition, Adjusted EBITDA is not necessarily a measure of our ability to fund our cash needs. 
 A reconciliation by segment of loss from operations to Adjusted EBITDA follows, in thousands: 
 For the year ended December 31, 2022 For the year ended September 30, 2021 Wireless Telco Total Wireless Telco Total Income (loss) from operations (4,792) 6,269 1,477 (6,864) (2,433) (9,297) Depreciation and amortization expense 749 485 1,234 715 513 1,228 Stock compensation expense 274 296 570 516 493 1,009 Adjusted EBITDA (a) (b)

In addition, the Telco segment includes a lower of cost or net realizable value charge of 0.2 million and 0.1 million for the years ended December 31, 2022 and September 30, 2021, respectively. 
 (b) The Company allocates its corporate general and administrative expenses to the reportable segments. See Note 14 - Segment Reporting in the Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion of segments. 

Liquidity and Capital Resources 
 Liquidity and Capital Resources 
 At December 31, 2022 we had 3.7 million in cash and equivalents and restricted cash. 
 During fiscal 2022, the Company replaced its 3.0 million credit facility for its Nave and Triton subsidiaries with its primary financial lender with new accounts receivable purchase facilities. The Company also restructured its accounts receivable purchase facilities secured by the Company s Fulton subsidiary s receivables. With the new and restructured receivables purchase facilities, the Company has an overall capacity to factor its accounts receivable of 19.0 million for working capital needs. At December 31, 2022, the Company had 7.0 million utilized under the receivables purchase facilities, leaving 12.0 million available to the Company to purchase new receivables generated in 2023. The Company is evaluating various funding arrangements to supplement working capital, which could include the filing of a registration statement for the sale of equity, and the issuance of debt, either convertible or non-convertible, which might or might not include the issuance of warrants or shares associated with the transaction.

 Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates 
 Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in this Form 10-K for fiscal year 2022 includes a summary of the significant accounting policies or methods used in the preparation of our Consolidated Financial Statements. Some of those significant accounting policies or methods require us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported by us. We believe the following items require the most significant judgments and often involve complex estimates. 
 General 
 The preparation of financial statements in conformity with United States generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. We base our estimates and judgments on historical experience, current market conditions, and various other factors we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results could differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions. The most significant estimates and assumptions are discussed below. 
 Inventory Valuation 
 For our Telco segment, our position in the telecommunications industry requires us to carry relatively large inventory quantities relative to annual sales, but it also allows us to realize high overall gross profit margins on our sales. We market our products primarily to telecommunication providers, telecommunication resellers, and other users of telecommunication equipment who are seeking products for which manufacturers have discontinued production or cannot ship new equipment on a same-day basis as well as providing used products as an alternative to new products from the manufacturer. Carrying these large inventory quantities represents our largest risk. 
 We are required to make judgments as to future demand requirements from our customers. We regularly review the value of our inventory in detail with consideration given to rapidly changing technology which can significantly affect future customer demand. For individual inventory items, we may carry inventory quantities that are excessive relative to market potential, or we may not be able to recover our acquisition costs for sales that we do make. In order to address the risks associated with our investment in inventory, we review inventory quantities on hand and reduce the carrying value when the loss of usefulness of an item or other factors, such as obsolete and excess inventories, indicate that cost will not be recovered when an item is sold. 
 14 

Our inventories are all carried in the Telco segment and consist of new and used electronic components for the telecommunications industry. Inventory is stated at the lower of cost or net realizable value, with cost determined using the weighted-average method. Net realizable value is the estimated selling price in the ordinary course of business, less reasonably predictable costs of completion, disposal, and transportation. At December 31, 2022, we had total inventory, before the reserve for excess and obsolete inventories, of 13.4 million, consisting of 2.3 million in new products and 11.1 million in used or refurbished products. 
 We identified certain inventory that more than likely will not be sold or that the cost will not be recovered when it is processed through recycling. Therefore, we have an obsolete and excess inventory reserve of 3.9 million at December 31, 2022. In 2022, we increased the reserve by 0.3 million. We also reviewed the cost of inventories against estimated market value and recorded a lower of cost or net realizable value write-off of 0.2 million for inventories that have a cost in excess of estimated net realizable value. If actual market conditions differ from those projected by management, this could have a material impact on our gross margin and inventory balances based on additional write-downs to net realizable value or a benefit from inventories previously written down. 
 Inbound freight charges are included in cost of sales. Purchasing and receiving costs, inspection costs, warehousing costs, internal transfer costs and other inventory expenditures are included in operating expenses, since the amounts involved are not considered a material component of cost of sales. 
 Accounts Receivable Valuation 
 Management judgments and estimates are made in connection with establishing the allowance for doubtful accounts. Specifically, we analyze the aging of accounts receivable balances, historical bad debts, customer concentrations, customer credit-worthiness, current economic trends and changes in our customer payment terms. Significant changes in customer concentration or payment terms, deterioration of customer credit-worthiness, or weakening in economic trends could have a significant impact on the collectability of receivables and our operating results. If the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate, resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments, an additional provision to the allowance for doubtful accounts may be required. The reserve for bad debts was 0.3 million as of December 31, 2022, 2021, and September 30, 2021. At December 31, 2022, 2021, and September 30, 2021, accounts receivable, net of allowance for doubtful accounts, were 1.7 million, 6.5 million and 7.0 million, respectively. 
 Intangibles 
 Intangible assets that have finite useful lives are amortized on a straight-line basis over their estimated useful lives ranging from 3 to 10 years. Intangible assets are also tested for impairment when events and circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable. 
 
 Impairment of Long-Lived Assets 
 The Company reviews long-lived assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the asset s carrying amount may not be recoverable. The Company conducts its long-lived asset impairment analyses in accordance with Accounting Standards Codification ASC 360-10-15, Impairment or Disposal of Long-Lived Assets. ASC 360-10-15 requires the Company to group assets and liabilities at the lowest level for which identifiable cash flows are largely independent of the cash flows of other assets and liabilities and evaluate the asset group against the sum of the undiscounted future cash flows. If the undiscounted cash flows do not indicate the carrying amount of the asset is recoverable, an impairment charge is measured as the amount by which the carrying amount of the asset group exceeds its fair value based on discounted cash flow analysis or appraisals.

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM 
 To the Shareholders and the Board of Directors of 
 ADDvantage Technologies Group, Inc. 
 
 Opinion on the Financial Statements 
 
 We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of ADDvantage Technologies Group, Inc. and its subsidiaries (the Company) as of December 31, 2022, December 31, 2021, and September 30, 2021, and the related consolidated statements of operations, changes in shareholders' equity, and cash flows for the year ended December 31, 2022, the three months ended December 31, 2021, and the fiscal year ended September 30, 2021, and the related notes to the consolidated financial statements (collectively, the financial statements). In our opinion, the financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of December 31, 2022, December 31, 2021, and September 30, 2021, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for the year ended December 31, 2022, the three months ended December 31, 2021, and the fiscal year ended September 30, 2021, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. 
 
 Basis for Opinion 
 
 These financial statements are the responsibility of the Company's management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB) and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. 
 
 We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. The Company is not required to have, nor were we engaged to perform, an audit of its internal control over financial reporting. As part of our audits we are required to obtain an understanding of internal control over financial reporting but not for the purposes of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Company's internal control over financial reporting. Accordingly, we express no such opinion. 
 
 Our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures include examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion. 
 
 Critical Audit Matters 
 
 The critical audit matters communicated below are matters arising from the current period audit of the financial statements that were communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that: (1) relate to accounts or disclosures that are material to the financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective or complex judgments. The communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion on the financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matters below, providing separate opinions on the critical audit matters or on the accounts or disclosures to which they relate. 
 
 Inventory valuation 
 
 As discussed in Note 1 to the financial statements, the Company assesses the recoverability of its inventory based on judgments and assumptions about future demand and market conditions. Future demand is determined based on historical sales and expected future sales. The Company reduces its inventory to its lower of cost or net realizable value on a part-by-part basis to account for its obsolescence or lack of marketability. Reductions are calculated as the difference between the cost of inventory and its net realizable value based upon the assumptions about future demand, market conditions, and costs. 
 
 We identified inventory valuation as a critical audit matter. The principal consideration for our determination that inventory valuation is a critical audit matter is that management's estimates of future demand and market conditions are subject to a high level of estimation uncertainty. Therefore, subjective and complex auditor judgment is necessary to evaluate the reasonableness of management's judgments and assumptions since historical results 
 17 

may not be indicative of the future due to uncertainties arising from technological advances, industry consolidation and economic factors. 
 
 Addressing the matter involved performing procedures and evaluating audit evidence in connection with forming our overall opinion on the financial statements. Our audit procedures related to the inventory valuation reserve included the following, among others: 
 
 We evaluated the appropriateness and consistency of management's methods and assumptions used in developing their estimate of the inventory valuation reserve, which included consideration of recent changes in the Company's strategy and technology in the market. 
 We evaluated the appropriateness of specific inputs supporting management's estimate, including the age of on-hand inventory levels, historic inventory trends, salvage values, and projected sales used in the forecasted periods. 
 We tested the accuracy, completeness, and relevance of the reports and inputs used in the Company's analysis. 
 We evaluated management's calculation of the inventory valuation reserve by testing the mathematical accuracy of the Company's reserve calculation. 
 
 Revenue Recognition 
 
 For the year ended December 31, 2022, contract revenues recognized by the Company were 30.8 million for wireless service sales. As described in Note 1 of the financial statements, the Company generally recognizes revenues for these contracts over time as performance obligations are satisfied. The Company generally measures its progress towards completion using an input measure of total costs incurred divided by total costs expected to be incurred. In addition, the Company's estimate of transaction price includes variable consideration associated with claims only to the extent that a significant reversal would not be probable. 
 
 Recognition of revenue over time as performance obligations are satisfied for fixed price contracts is highly judgmental as it requires the Company to prepare estimates of total contract revenue and total contract costs, including costs to complete in-process contracts. These estimates are dependent upon a number of factors, including the accuracy of estimates made at the balance sheet date, such as progress, material quantities, labor productivity and cost estimates. 
 We identified revenue recognition as a critical audit matter. The principal consideration for our determination is contract revenue recognition is complex and highly judgmental due to the variability and uncertainty associated with estimating the costs to complete and amounts expected to be recovered from variable consideration. Changes in these estimates would have a significant effect on the amount of contract revenue recognized. Our audit procedures related to contract revenue recognition included the following, among others: 
 
 We obtained an understanding, evaluated the design effectiveness of controls that address the risk of material misstatement of contract revenue including those associated with cost to complete estimates for fixed price contracts and estimates of amounts expected to be recovered from variable consideration. 
 
 To evaluate the Company's determination of estimated costs to complete, we selected a sample of contracts and, among other things, inspected the executed contracts including any significant amendments; tested key components of the cost to complete estimates, including materials, labor, and subcontractors costs; compared actual project margins to historical and expected results; and recalculated revenues recognized. 
 
 We tested management's estimation process by performing a lookback analysis to evaluate projects completed in the current year compared to management's prior year estimates. We also performed a look forward analysis to evaluate projects completed subsequent to year end and compared to management's current year estimates.

 Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting 
 
 During the year ended December 31, 2022, there have been no changes, including the impact of COVID-19, in our internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rule 13a-15(f) under the Exchange Act) that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting. 
 Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures. 
 We maintain disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Exchange Act Rule 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e)) that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by us in the reports that we file or submit to the Securities and Exchange Commission under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified by the Commission s rules and forms, and that information is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and our Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. Our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer evaluated our disclosure controls and procedures as of December 31, 2022. Based on that evaluation, the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures are effective. 
 Management s Annual Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting. 
 Our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934) and for the assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting. Our internal control system was designed to provide reasonable assurance to our management and board of directors regarding the preparation and fair presentation of financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. Our internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (i) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of our assets; (ii) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that our receipts and expenditures are being made only in accordance with authorization of our management and board of directors; and (iii) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of our assets that could have a material effect on our financial statements. 
 All internal control systems, no matter how well designed, have inherent limitations. Therefore, even those systems determined to be effective can provide only reasonable assurance with respect to financial statement preparation and presentation. Projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. 
 Our management assessed the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2022. In making this assessment, management used the criteria set forth by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO) in Internal Control Integrated Framework (2013). 
 Based on our assessment, we believe that, as of December 31, 2022, our internal control over financial reporting is effective. 
 This annual report does not include an attestation report of our registered public accounting firm regarding internal control over financial reporting. Management s report was not subject to attestation by our registered public

The fair value of the stock awards is amortized over the vesting period to compensation expense in the Consolidated Statements of Operations contained in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. The fair value of the stock awards was based on the closing market prices of the stock on the dates of the grants. The actual value that an executive officer will realize upon vesting of performance or time-based awards will depend upon the market price of the Company s stock on the vesting date, so there is no assurance that the value realized by an executive officer will be at or near the value of the market price of the Company s stock on the grant date. Mr. Hart's amount for fiscal year 2021 was inadvertently omitted from the 10-K/A and the Proxy statement filed on January 27, 2022 and August 12, 2022, respectively. (3) Represents amounts paid by the Company on behalf of an officer for matching contributions to the Company s qualified 401(k) plan, group term life, and auto allowance received during the year. Mr. Francis's other compensation includes severance payments. (4) Mr. Rutledge's salary for 2021 represents his prorated annual salary of 250,000 as per the terms of his employment agreement from his September 2021 start date. (5) Mr. Francis was the Vice President and Chief Accounting Officer of the Company until his departure in March 2021. Mr. Francis served as the interim Chief Accounting Officer through August 2021 as an independent contractor. (6) Mr. Taylor retired in July, 2022. 
 Potential Payments Upon Termination or Change of Control 
 We have entered into employment/severance agreements with Mr. Hart and Mr. Rutledge. These agreements are designed to promote stability, continuity and focus for key members of leadership during periods of uncertainty that may be created by change of control situations. Additionally, the use of such agreements is a competitive practice that enhances our ability to attract and retain leadership talent. 
 These agreements have no stated term but provide for the payment of severance benefits in most situations where the employee is terminated without cause or is terminated or resigns in connection with a Change in Control of the Company. Mr. Hart, in this event, will be paid the amount of his annual base salary immediately preceding the termination without cause or Change of Control. Mr. Rutledge will be paid the amount of 50 of his annual base salary immediately preceding the termination without cause or Change of Control. Most executive equity awards which are subject to vesting provide for accelerated vesting upon the occurrence of a change in control. 
 Change of Control as used in these agreements has a fairly customary definition designed to reflect that a fundamental change in beneficial ownership or control of the Company has occurred. Specifically, the agreements incorporate the term a change of control event , as defined in United States Treasury Regulations Regulations promulgated under section 409A of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended Section 409A that results from an event in which a person comes to be the owner, directly or indirectly, of 50 or more of outstanding voting securities of the Company or its parent company or the transfer or disposition of all or substantially all of the assets of the Company, its parent or their successor or a person, acquires, directly or indirectly, the voting power to elect a majority of the members of the Board of the Company or its parent (other than in the normal course) or any other similar transaction or series of related transactions.
