PART I 
 ITEM 1. B USINESS 
 Overview 
 The Invesco CurrencyShares Canadian Dollar Trust (the Trust is a grantor trust that was formed on June 8, 2006. The Shares began trading on the New York Stock Exchange under the ticker symbol FXC on June 26, 2006. The primary listing of the Shares was transferred to NYSE Arca, Inc. NYSE Arca on October 30, 2007. The Trust issues shares (the Shares in blocks of 50,000 (a Basket in exchange for deposits of Canadian Dollars and distributes Canadian Dollars in connection with the redemption of Baskets. 
 The investment objective of the Trust is for the Shares to reflect the price in USD of the Canadian Dollar plus accrued interest, if any, less the expenses of the Trust s operations. The Shares are intended to offer investors an opportunity to participate in the market for the Canadian Dollar through an investment in securities. The Shares are intended to provide institutional and retail investors with a simple, cost-effective means of gaining investment benefits similar to those of holding the Canadian Dollar. The Shares are bought and sold on NYSE Arca like any other exchange-listed security. The Shares are backed by the assets of the Trust, which does not hold or use derivative products. The Trust is a passive investment vehicle and does not have any officers, directors or employees. The Trust does not engage in any activities designed to obtain profit from, or ameliorate losses caused by, changes in the price of the Canadian Dollar. Investing in the Shares does not insulate the investor from certain risks, including price volatility. The value of the holdings of the Trust is reported on the Trust s website, www.invesco.com/etfs, each business day. 
 The Trust 
 General 
 The Trust holds Canadian Dollars and, from time to time, issues Baskets in exchange for deposits of Canadian Dollars and distributes Canadian Dollars in connection with redemptions of Baskets. The Canadian Dollars held by the Trust will be sold only (1) if needed to pay Trust expenses, (2) in the event the Trust terminates and liquidates its assets or (3) as otherwise required by law or regulation. 
 The Sponsor 
 The Sponsor of the Trust generally oversees the performance of the Trustee and the Trust s principal service providers. The Sponsor is Invesco Specialized Products, LLC, a Delaware limited liability company. The Sponsor changed its name from Rydex Specialized Products LLC to Guggenheim Specialized Products, LLC on March 30, 2012, and subsequently changed its name to Invesco Specialized Products, LLC as of April 6, 2018. 
 The Trust s only ordinary recurring expense is the Sponsor s fee. The Sponsor is responsible for payment of the following administrative and marketing expenses of the Trust: the Trustee s monthly fee, typical maintenance and transaction fees of the Depository, NYSE Arca listing fees, printing and mailing costs, audit fees and expenses, up to 100,000 per year in legal fees and expenses, and applicable license fees. The Sponsor also paid the costs of the Trust s organization, including the applicable Securities and Exchange Commission SEC registration fees. The Sponsor s fee accrues daily at an annual nominal rate of 0.40 of the Canadian Dollars in the Trust (including all unpaid interest but excluding unpaid fees, each as accrued through the immediately preceding day). The Trust incurred 466,642 for the year ended December 31, 2022 in Sponsor s fees. 
 The Trustee 
 The Bank of New York Mellon, a banking corporation with trust powers organized under the laws of the State of New York, serves as the Trustee. The Trustee is responsible for the day-to-day administration of the Trust, including keeping the Trust s operational records.

Net Asset Value 
 The Trustee calculates, and the Sponsor publishes, the Trust s Net Asset Value NAV each business day. To calculate the NAV, the Trustee adds to the amount of Canadian Dollars in the Trust at the end of the preceding day accrued but unpaid interest, if any, Canadian Dollars receivable under pending purchase orders and the value of other Trust assets, and subtracts the accrued but unpaid Sponsor s fee, Canadian Dollars payable under pending redemption orders and other Trust expenses and liabilities, if any. The NAV is expressed in U.S. Dollars USD based on the Canadian Dollar/USD exchange rate as determined by The WM Company at 4:00 PM (London time / London fixing) (the Closing Spot Rate on each day that NYSE Arca is open for regular trading. If, on a particular evaluation day, the Closing Spot Rate has not been determined and announced by 6:00 PM (London time), then the most recent Closing Spot Rate is used to determine the NAV of the Trust unless the Trustee, in consultation with the Sponsor, determines that such price is inappropriate to use as the basis for the valuation. 
 The Trustee also determines the NAV per Share, which equals the NAV of the Trust divided by the number of outstanding Shares. The NAV of the Trust and the NAV per Share are published by the Sponsor on each day that NYSE Arca is open for regular trading and are posted on the Trust s website, www.invesco.com/etfs. 
 Depository and Deposit Accounts 
 JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., London Branch, is the Depository. The Depository maintains two deposit accounts for the Trust, a primary deposit account that may earn interest and a secondary deposit account that does not earn interest (collectively, the Deposit Accounts ). Interest on the primary deposit account, if any, accrues daily and is paid monthly. If the Sponsor believes that the interest rate paid by the Depository is not competitive, the Sponsor s recourse is to remove the Depository by terminating the Deposit Account Agreement and closing the Deposit Accounts. The Depository is not paid a fee for its services to the Trust. The Depository may earn a spread or margin over the rate of interest it pays to the Trust on the Canadian Dollar deposit balances. 
 The secondary deposit account is used to account for any interest that may be received and paid on creations and redemptions of Baskets. The secondary deposit account is also used to account for interest earned on the primary deposit account, if any, pay Trust expenses and distribute any excess interest to Shareholders on a monthly basis. In the event that the interest deposited exceeds the sum of the Sponsor s fee for the prior month plus other Trust expenses, if any, then the Trustee will direct that the excess be converted into USD at the prevailing market rate and the Trustee will distribute the USD as promptly as practicable to Shareholders on a pro-rata basis (in accordance with the number of Shares that they own). 
 Trust Expenses 
 In certain cases, the Trust may pay expenses in addition to the Sponsor s fee. These exceptions include expenses not assumed by the Sponsor, expenses resulting from a negative interest rate, taxes and governmental charges, expenses and costs of any extraordinary services performed by the Trustee or the Sponsor on behalf of the Trust or action taken by the Trustee or the Sponsor to protect the Trust or the interests of Shareholders, indemnification of the Sponsor under the Depositary Trust Agreement, and legal expenses in excess of 100,000 per year. 
 Termination 
 The Trust will terminate upon the occurrence of any of the termination events listed in the Depositary Trust Agreement and will otherwise terminate on June 8, 2046. 
 The Shares 
 General 
 Each Share represents a proportional interest, based on the total number of Shares outstanding, in the Canadian Dollars owned by the Trust, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, less accrued but unpaid expenses (both asset-based and non-asset based) of the Trust. All Shares are of the same class with equal rights and privileges. Each Share is transferable, is fully paid and non-assessable and entitles the holder to vote on the limited matters upon which Shareholders may vote under the Depositary Trust Agreement. 
 Limited Rights 
 The Shares are not a traditional investment. They are dissimilar from the shares of a corporation operating a business enterprise, with management and a board of directors. Trust Shareholders do not have rights normally associated with owning shares of a business corporation, including, for example, the right to bring oppression or derivative actions. Shareholders have only those rights explicitly set forth in the Depositary Trust Agreement. The Shares do not entitle their holders to any conversion or pre-emptive rights or, except as described herein, any redemption or distribution rights. 
 2 

Voting and Approvals 
 Shareholders have no voting rights under the Depositary Trust Agreement, except in limited circumstances. If the holders of at least 25 of the Shares outstanding determine that the Trustee is in material breach of its obligations under the Depositary Trust Agreement, they may provide written notice to the Trustee (or require the Sponsor to do so) specifying the default and requiring the Trustee to cure such default. If the Trustee fails to cure such breach within 30 days after receipt of such notice, the Sponsor, acting on behalf of the Shareholders, may remove the Trustee. The holders of at least 66 2/3 of the Shares outstanding may vote to remove the Trustee. The Trustee must terminate the Trust at the request of the holders of at least 75 of the outstanding Shares. 
 Creation and Redemption of Shares 
 The creation and redemption of Baskets requires the delivery to the Trust or the distribution by the Trust of the amount of Canadian Dollars represented by the Baskets being created or redeemed. This amount is based on the combined NAV per Share of the number of Shares included in the Baskets being created or redeemed, determined on the day the order to create or redeem Baskets is accepted by the Trustee. 
 Only Authorized Participants may place orders to create and redeem Baskets. An Authorized Participant is a Depository Trust Company DTC participant that is a registered broker-dealer or other securities market participant, such as a bank or other financial institution that is not required to register as a broker-dealer to engage in securities transactions. 
 Before initiating a creation or redemption order, an Authorized Participant must have entered into a Participant Agreement with the Sponsor and the Trustee. The Participant Agreement provides the procedures for the creation and redemption of Baskets and for the delivery of Canadian Dollars required for creations and redemptions. The Participant Agreements may be amended by the Trustee and the Sponsor. Authorized Participants pay a transaction fee of 500 to the Trustee for each order that they place to create or redeem one or more Baskets. In addition to the 500 transaction fee paid to the Trustee, Authorized Participants pay a variable fee to the Sponsor for creation orders and redemption orders of two or more Baskets to compensate the Sponsor for costs associated with the registration of Shares. The variable fee paid to the Sponsor by an Authorized Participant will not exceed 2,000 for each creation or redemption order, as set forth in the Participant Agreement. Authorized Participants who make deposits with the Trust in exchange for Baskets receive no fees, commissions or other form of compensation or inducement of any kind from either the Sponsor or the Trust. No Authorized Participant has any obligation or responsibility to the Sponsor or the Trust to effect any sale or resale of Shares. 
 Availability of SEC Reports and Other Information 
 The Sponsor, on behalf of the Trust, files quarterly and annual reports and other information with the SEC which are available on the SEC s Internet site at http://www.sec.gov. The reports and other information can be accessed through the Trust s website at www.invesco.com/etfs. 
 ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS 
 You should consider carefully the risks described below before making an investment decision. You should also refer to the other information included in this report, including the Trust s financial statements and the related notes . 
 ECONOMIC CONDITIONS 
 The value of the Shares relates directly to the value of the Canadian Dollars held by the Trust. Fluctuations in the price of the Canadian Dollar could materially and adversely affect the value of the Shares. 
 The Shares are designed to reflect the price of the Canadian Dollar, plus accumulated interest, if any, less the Trust s expenses. Several factors may affect the price of the Canadian Dollar, including: 
 Sovereign debt levels and trade deficits; 

Domestic and foreign inflation rates and interest rates and investors expectations concerning those rates; 

Currency exchange rates; 

Investment and trading activities of mutual funds, hedge funds and currency funds; and 

Global, regional or national political, economic or financial events and situations. 

3 

In addition, the Canadian Dollar may not maintain its long-term value in terms of purchasing power in the future. When the price of the Canadian Dollar declines, the Sponsor expects the price of a Share to decline as well. 
 The Canadian Dollar/USD exchange rate, like foreign exchange rates in general, can be volatile and difficult to predict. This volatility could materially and adversely affect the performance of the Shares. 
 Foreign exchange rates are influenced by the factors identified in the preceding risk factor and may also be influenced by: changing supply and demand for a particular currency; monetary policies of governments (including exchange control programs, restrictions on local exchanges or markets and limitations on foreign investment in a country or on investment by residents of a country in other countries); changes in balances of payments and trade; trade restrictions; and currency devaluations and revaluations. Also, governments from time to time intervene in the currency markets, directly and by regulation, in order to influence prices directly. These events and actions are unpredictable. The resulting volatility in the Canadian Dollar/USD exchange rate could materially and adversely affect the performance of the Shares. 
 If interest earned by the Trust does not exceed the Trust s expenses, the Trustee will withdraw Canadian Dollars from the Trust to pay these excess expenses, which will reduce the amount of Canadian Dollars represented by each Share on an ongoing basis and may result in adverse tax consequences for Shareholders. 
 Each outstanding Share represents a fractional, undivided interest in the Canadian Dollars held by the Trust. Recently, the amount of interest earned by the Trust has not exceeded the Trust s expenses; accordingly, the Trustee has been required to withdraw Canadian Dollars from the Trust to pay these excess expenses. As long as the amount of interest earned does not exceed expenses, the amount of Canadian Dollars represented by each Share will gradually decline over time. This is true even if additional Shares are issued in exchange for additional deposits of Canadian Dollars into the Trust, as the amount of Canadian Dollars required to create Shares will proportionately reflect the amount of Canadian Dollars represented by the Shares outstanding at the time of creation. Assuming a constant Canadian Dollar price, if expenses exceed interest earned, the trading price of the Shares will gradually decline relative to the price of the Canadian Dollar as the amount of Canadian Dollars represented by the Shares gradually declines. In this event, the Shares will only maintain their original price if the price of the Canadian Dollar increases. There is no guarantee that interest earned by the Trust in the future will exceed the Trust s expenses. 
 Investors should be aware that a gradual decline in the amount of Canadian Dollars represented by the Shares may occur regardless of whether the trading price of the Shares rises or falls in response to changes in the price of the Canadian Dollar. The estimated ordinary operating expenses of the Trust, which accrue daily, are described in Business The Trust Trust Expenses. 
 The payment of expenses by the Trust will result in a taxable event to Shareholders. To the extent Trust expenses exceed interest paid to the Trust, a gain or loss may be recognized by Shareholders depending on the tax basis of the tendered Canadian Dollars. 
 The interest rate paid by the Depository, if any, may not be the best rate available. If the Sponsor determines that the interest rate is inadequate, then its sole recourse is to remove the Depository and terminate the Deposit Accounts. 
 The Depository is committed to endeavor to pay a competitive interest rate on the balance of Canadian Dollars in the primary deposit account of the Trust, but there is no guarantee of the amount of interest that will be paid, if any, on this account. Interest on the primary deposit account, if any accrues daily and is paid monthly. The Depository may change the rate at which interest accrues, including reducing the interest rate to zero or below zero, based upon changes in market conditions or the Depository s liquidity needs. The Depository notifies the Sponsor of the interest rate applied each business day after the close of such business day. The Sponsor discloses the current interest rate on the Trust s website. If the Sponsor believes that the interest rate paid by the Depository is not adequate, the Sponsor s sole recourse is to remove the Depository and terminate the Deposit Accounts. The Depository is not paid a fee for its services to the Trust; rather, it generates income or loss based on its ability to earn a spread or margin over the interest it pays to the Trust by using the Trust s Canadian Dollars to make loans or in other banking operations. For these reasons, you should not expect that the Trust will be paid the best available interest rate at any time or over time. 
 If the Trust incurs expenses in USD, the Trust would be required to sell Canadian Dollars to pay these expenses. The sale of the Trust s Canadian Dollars to pay expenses in USD at a time of low Canadian Dollar prices could adversely affect the value of the Shares. 
 The Trustee will sell Canadian Dollars held by the Trust to pay Trust expenses, if any, incurred in USD, irrespective of then-current Canadian Dollar prices. The Trust is not actively managed and no attempt will be made to buy or sell Canadian Dollars to protect against or to take advantage of fluctuations in the price of the Canadian Dollar. Consequently, if the Trust incurs expenses in 
 4 

USD, the Trust s Canadian Dollars may be sold at a time when the Canadian Dollar price is low, resulting in a negative effect on the value of the Shares. 
 The Shares may trade at a price which is at, above, or below the NAV per Share. 
 The NAV per Share fluctuates with changes in the market value of the Trust s assets. The market price of Shares can be expected to fluctuate in accordance with changes in the NAV per Share, but also in response to market supply and demand. As a result, the Shares might trade at prices at, above or below the NAV per Share. 
 Disruptions in the ability to create and redeem Baskets may adversely impact the price of the Shares. 
 It is generally expected that the public trading price per Share will track the NAV per Share closely over time. The relationship between the public trading price per Share and the NAV per Share depends, to a considerable degree, on the ability of Authorized Participants or their clients or customers to purchase and redeem Baskets in the ordinary course. If the Trust were to issue all Shares that have been registered or if the Trust does not have an effective registration statement with the SEC with sufficient Shares available, each of which may happen from time to time, the Trust would not be able to create new Baskets until it registered additional Shares and those additional Shares became available for sale. In addition, the Trust may, in its discretion, suspend the creation of Baskets for any reason and at any time. If the process for creating or redeeming Shares is impaired for any reason, Authorized Participants and their clients or customers may not be able to purchase and redeem Baskets. The inability to purchase and redeem Baskets could result in the Shares trading at a premium or discount to the NAV of the Trust. Such a premium or discount could be significant, depending upon the nature or duration of the impairment. 
 Substantial sales of Canadian Dollars by the official sector could adversely affect an investment in the Shares. 
 The official sector consists of central banks, other governmental agencies and multi-lateral institutions that buy, sell and hold Canadian Dollars as part of their reserve assets. The official sector holds a significant amount of Canadian Dollars that can be mobilized in the open market. In the event that future economic, political or social conditions or pressures require members of the official sector to sell their Canadian Dollars simultaneously or in an uncoordinated manner, the demand for Canadian Dollars might not be sufficient to accommodate the sudden increase in the supply of Canadian Dollars to the market. Consequently, the price of the Canadian Dollar could decline, which would adversely affect an investment in the Shares. 
 REGULATORY MATTERS 
 Changes to United States tariff and trade policies may increase the volatility of foreign exchange rates. This volatility could materially and adversely affect the performance of the Shares. 
 There have been ongoing discussions and commentary regarding potential significant changes to United States trade policies, treaties and tariffs. These developments, or the perception that any of them could occur, may have a material adverse effect on global economic conditions and the stability of global financial markets, and may increase the volatility of foreign exchange rates, including the USD/Canadian Dollar exchange rate. The resulting volatility could materially and adversely affect the performance of the Shares. 
 The Deposit Accounts are not entitled to payment at any office of JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. located in the United States. 
 The federal laws of the United States prohibit banks located in the United States from paying interest on unrestricted demand deposit accounts. Therefore, payments out of the Deposit Accounts will be payable only at the London branch of JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., located in England. The Trustee will not be entitled to demand payment of these accounts at any office of JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. that is located in the United States. JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. will not be required to repay the deposit if its London branch cannot repay the deposit due to an act of war, insurrection or civil strife or an action by a foreign government or instrumentality (whether de jure or de facto in England. 
 Shareholders do not have the protections associated with ownership of a demand deposit account insured in the United States by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation or the protection provided for bank deposits under English law. 
 Neither the Shares nor the Deposit Accounts and the Canadian Dollars deposited in them are deposits insured against loss by the FDIC, any other federal agency of the United States or the Financial Services Compensation Scheme of England. 
 Shareholders do not have the protections associated with ownership of shares in an investment company registered under the Investment Company Act of 1940. 
 The Investment Company Act is designed to protect investors by preventing: insiders from managing investment companies to their benefit and to the detriment of public investors; the issuance of securities having inequitable or discriminatory provisions; the management of investment companies by irresponsible persons; the use of unsound or misleading methods of computing earnings and 
 5 

asset value; changes in the character of investment companies without the consent of investors; and investment companies from engaging in excessive leveraging. To accomplish these ends, the Investment Company Act requires the safekeeping and proper valuation of fund assets, restricts greatly transactions with affiliates, limits leveraging, and imposes governance requirements as a check on fund management. 
 The Trust is not registered as an investment company under the Investment Company Act and is not required to register under that act. Consequently, Shareholders do not have the regulatory protections afforded to investors in registered investment companies. 
 Shareholders do not have the rights enjoyed by investors in certain other financial instruments. 
 As interests in a grantor trust, the Shares have none of the statutory rights normally associated with the ownership of shares of a business corporation, including, for example, the right to bring oppression or derivative actions. Apart from the rights afforded to them by federal and state securities laws, Shareholders have only those rights relative to the Trust, the Trust property and the Shares that are set forth in the Depositary Trust Agreement. In this connection, the Shareholders have limited voting and distribution rights. They do not have the right to elect directors. See Business The Shares Limited Rights for a description of the limited rights of the Shareholders. 
 Shareholders that are not Authorized Participants may only purchase or sell their Shares in secondary trading markets. 
 Only Authorized Participants may create or redeem Baskets through the Trust. All other investors that desire to purchase or sell Shares must do so through NYSE Arca or in other markets, if any, in which the Shares are traded. 
 INSOLVENCY OR TERMINATION OF THE DEPOSITORY OR TRUST 
 If the Depository becomes insolvent, its assets may not be adequate to satisfy a claim by the Trust or any Authorized Participant. In addition, in the event of the insolvency of the Depository, the U.S. bank of which it is a branch or any local cash correspondent holding the currency on deposit for the benefit of the Trust, there may be a delay and costs incurred in recovering the Canadian Dollars held in the Deposit Accounts. 
 Canadian Dollars deposited in the Deposit Accounts by an Authorized Participant are commingled with Canadian Dollars deposited by other Authorized Participants and are held by the Depository in either the primary deposit account or the secondary deposit account of the Trust. Canadian Dollars held in the Deposit Accounts are not segregated from the Depository s other assets. 
 The Trust has no proprietary rights in or to any specific Canadian Dollars held by the Depository and will be an unsecured creditor of the Depository with respect to the Canadian Dollars held in the Deposit Accounts in the event of the insolvency of the Depository or the U.S. bank of which it is a branch. In the event the Depository, the U.S. bank of which it is a branch or any local cash correspondent holding the currency on deposit for the benefit of the Trust becomes insolvent, the Depository s assets may not be adequate to satisfy a claim by the Trust or any Authorized Participant for the amount of Canadian Dollars deposited by the Trust or the Authorized Participant and, in such event, the Trust and any Authorized Participant will generally have no right in or to assets other than those of the Depository. 
 In the case of insolvency of the Depository or JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., the U.S. bank of which the Depository is a branch, a liquidator may seek to freeze access to the Canadian Dollars held in all accounts by the Depository, including the Deposit Accounts. In the case of insolvency of a local cash correspondent, a liquidator may seek to freeze access to the Canadian Dollars held in all accounts by such local cash correspondent, including the Deposit Accounts held by such cash correspondent. The Trust and the Authorized Participants could incur expenses and delays in connection with asserting their claims. These problems would be exacerbated by the fact that the Deposit Accounts are not held in the U.S. but instead are held at the London branch of a U.S. national bank or with a local cash correspondent, where they are subject to English or Canadian insolvency law. Further, under U.S. law, in the case of the insolvency of JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., the claims of creditors in respect of accounts (such as the Trust s Deposit Accounts) that are maintained with an overseas branch of JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. or with a local cash correspondent will be subordinate to claims of creditors in respect of accounts maintained with JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. in the U.S., greatly increasing the risk that the Trust and the Trust s beneficiaries would suffer a loss. 
 The License Agreement with The Bank of New York Mellon may be terminated by The Bank of New York Mellon in the event of a material breach. Termination of the License Agreement might lead to early termination and liquidation of the Trust. 
 The Bank of New York Mellon and the Sponsor have entered into a License Agreement granting the Sponsor a non-exclusive, personal and non-transferable license to certain patent applications made by The Bank of New York Mellon covering systems and methods for securitizing a commodity for the life of such patents and patent applications. The license grant is solely for the purpose of allowing the Sponsor to establish, operate and market a currency-based securities product based solely on the securitization, in whole or in part, of a single non-U.S. currency. The License Agreement provides that either party may provide notice of intent to terminate 
 6 

the License Agreement in the event the other party commits a material breach. If the License Agreement is terminated and one or more of The Bank of New York Mellon s patent applications issue as patents, then The Bank of New York Mellon may claim that the operation of the Trust violates its patent or patents and seek an injunction forcing the Trust to cease operation and the Shares to cease trading. In that case, the Trust might be forced to terminate and liquidate, which would adversely affect Shareholders. 
 Shareholders may incur significant fees upon the termination of the Trust. 
 The occurrence of any one of several events would either require the Trust to terminate or permit the Sponsor to terminate the Trust. For example, if the Depository were to resign or be removed, then the Sponsor would be required to terminate the Trust. Shareholders tendering their Shares within 90 days of the Trust s termination will receive the amount of Canadian Dollars represented by their Shares. Shareholders may incur significant fees if they choose to convert the Canadian Dollars they receive to USD. 
 DEPOSITARY TRUST AGREEMENT 
 The Depository owes no fiduciary duties to the Trust or the Shareholders, is not required to act in their best interest and could resign or be removed by the Sponsor, which would trigger early termination of the Trust. 
 The Depository is not a trustee for the Trust or the Shareholders. As stated above, the Depository is not obligated to maximize the interest rate paid to the Trust. In addition, the Depository has no duty to continue to act as the depository of the Trust. The Depository can terminate its role as depository for any reason whatsoever upon 90 days notice to the Trust. If directed by the Sponsor, the Trustee must terminate the Depository. Such a termination might result, for example, if the Sponsor determines that the interest rate paid by the Depository is inadequate. In the event that the Depository was to resign or be removed, the Trust will be terminated. 
 Redemption orders are subject to rejection by the Trustee under certain circumstances. 
 The Trustee will reject a redemption order if the order is not in proper form as described in the Participant Agreement or if the fulfillment of the order, in the opinion of its counsel, might be unlawful. Any such rejection could adversely affect a redeeming Shareholder. For example, the resulting delay would adversely affect the value of the Shareholder s redemption distribution if the NAV were to decline during the delay. In the Depositary Trust Agreement, the Sponsor and the Trustee disclaim any liability for any loss or damage that may result from any such rejection. 
 The liability of the Sponsor and the Trustee under the Depositary Trust Agreement is limited and, except as set forth in the Depositary Trust Agreement, they are not obligated to prosecute any action, suit or other proceeding in respect of any Trust property. 
 The Depositary Trust Agreement provides that neither the Sponsor nor the Trustee assumes any obligation or is subject to any liability under the Trust Agreement to any Shareholder, except that they each agree to perform their respective obligations specifically set forth in the Depositary Trust Agreement without negligence or bad faith. Additionally, neither the Sponsor nor the Trustee is obligated to, although each may in its respective discretion, prosecute any action, suit or other proceeding in respect of any Trust property. The Depositary Trust Agreement does not confer upon Shareholders the right to prosecute any such action, suit or other proceeding. 
 The Depositary Trust Agreement may be amended to the detriment of Shareholders without their consent. 
 The Sponsor and the Trustee may amend most provisions (other than those addressing core economic rights) of the Depositary Trust Agreement without the consent of any Shareholder. Such an amendment could impose or increase fees or charges borne by the Shareholders. Any amendment that increases fees or charges (other than taxes and other governmental charges, registration fees or other expenses), or that otherwise prejudices any substantial existing rights of Shareholders, will not become effective until 30 days after written notice is given to Shareholders. 
 COVID-19 PANDEMIC 
 The ongoing COVID-19 pandemic continues to impact global, regional and national economies in unexpected and unpredictable ways that could materially and adversely affect the value of the Shares. 
 The ongoing COVID-19 pandemic continues to have material adverse effects on the global economy and has increased economic uncertainty and financial market volatility and caused a decline in consumer and business confidence. No assurance can be given that the disruption will end soon or that the value of the Shares will not be affected materially and adversely by the pandemic 
 7 

and its ongoing global economic impact. Escalation or prolonged continuation of the pandemic could exacerbate other risk factors identified in this Report and materially and adversely affect the value of the Shares. 
 OTHER RISKS 
 Due to the increased use of technologies, intentional and unintentional cyber attacks pose operational and information security risks. 
 With the increased use of technologies such as the Internet and the dependence on computer systems to perform necessary business functions, the Trust is susceptible to operational and information security risks. In general, cyber incidents can result from deliberate attacks or unintentional events. Cyber attacks include, but are not limited to gaining unauthorized access to digital systems for purposes of misappropriating assets or sensitive information, corrupting data, or causing operational disruption. 
 Cyber attacks may also be carried out in a manner that does not require gaining unauthorized access, such as causing denial-of-service attacks on websites. Cyber security failures or breaches of the Trust s third party service providers (including, but not limited to, the Trustee and the Sponsor) have the ability to cause disruptions and impact business operations, potentially resulting in financial losses, the inability of Shareholders or Authorized Participants to transact business in Shares and Baskets respectively, violations of applicable privacy and other laws, regulatory fines, penalties, reputational damage, reimbursement or other compensation costs, and/or additional compliance costs. In addition, substantial costs may be incurred in order to prevent any cyber incidents in the future. The Trust and its Shareholders could be negatively impacted as a result. 
 While the Sponsor has established business continuity plans and systems reasonably designed to detect and prevent such cyber attacks from being effective, there are inherent limitations in such plans and systems. For instance, it is possible that certain existing risks have not been identified or that new risks will emerge before countervailing measures can be implemented. Furthermore, the Trust cannot control, or even necessarily influence, the cyber security plans and systems put in place by the Trust s third party service providers. Since the Trust is dependent upon third party service providers (including the Sponsor and Trustee) for substantially all of its operational needs, the Trust is subject to the risk that a cyber attack on a service provider will materially impair its normal operations even if the Trust itself is not subject to such an attack. In addition, a service provider that has experienced a cyber security incident may divert resources normally devoted to servicing the Trust to addressing the incident, which would be likely to have an adverse effect on the Trust s operations.

ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS 
 Introduction 
 The following discussion and analysis was prepared to supplement information contained in the accompanying financial statements and is intended to explain certain items regarding the Trust s financial condition as of December 31, 2022, and its results of operations for the fiscal years ended December 31, 2022 and December 31, 2021. It should be read in conjunction with the audited financial statements and related notes thereto contained in this report. 
 Cautionary Statement Regarding Forward-Looking Information 
 This report contains forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Forward-looking statements can be identified by words such as anticipate, expect, intend, plan, believe, seek, outlook and estimate and other similar words. Forward-looking statements are based upon our current expectations and beliefs concerning future developments and their potential effects on us. Such forward-looking statements are not guarantees of future performance. Various factors may cause our actual results to differ materially from those expressed in our forward-looking statements. These factors include fluctuations in the price of the Canadian Dollar, as the value of the Shares relates directly to the value of the Canadian Dollars held by the Trust and price fluctuations could materially adversely affect an investment in the Shares. Readers are urged to review the Risk Factors section in this report for a description of other risks and uncertainties that may affect an investment in the Shares. 
 Neither the Sponsor nor any other person assumes responsibility for the accuracy or completeness of forward-looking statements contained in this report. The forward-looking statements are made as of the date of this report, and will not be revised or updated to reflect actual results or changes in the Sponsor s expectations or predictions. 
 Movements in the Price of the Canadian Dollar 
 The investment objective of the Trust is for the Shares to reflect the price in USD of the Canadian Dollar plus accrued interest, if any, less the expenses of the Trust s operations. The Shares are intended to provide institutional and retail investors with a simple, cost-effective means of gaining investment benefits similar to those of holding Canadian Dollars. Each outstanding Share represents a proportional interest in the Canadian Dollars held by the Trust. The following chart provides recent trends on the price of the Canadian Dollar. The chart illustrates movements in the price of the Canadian Dollar in USD and is based on the Closing Spot Rate:

NAV per Share; Valuation of the Canadian Dollar 
 The following chart illustrates the movement in the price of the Shares based on (1) NAV per Share, (2) the bid and ask midpoint offered on NYSE Arca and (3) the Closing Spot Rate, expressed as a multiple of 100 Canadian Dollars: 

Liquidity and Capital Resources 
 The Sponsor is not aware of any known trends, demands, commitments, events or uncertainties that will result in, or are reasonably likely to result in, material changes to the Trust s liquidity and capital resources needs. The Trust s Depository, JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., London Branch, maintains two deposit accounts for the Trust, a primary deposit account that may earn interest and a secondary deposit account that does not earn interest. Interest on the primary deposit account, if any, accrues daily and is paid monthly. The interest rate in effect as of December 31, 2022 was an annual nominal rate of 1.80 . The following chart provides the daily rate paid by the Depository since December 31, 2017:

In exchange for a fee, the Sponsor bears most of the expenses incurred by the Trust. As a result, the only ordinary expense of the Trust during the period covered by this report was the Sponsor s fee. Each month the Depository deposits into the secondary deposit account accrued but unpaid interest, if any, and the Trustee withdraws Canadian Dollars from the secondary deposit account to pay the accrued Sponsor s fee for the previous month plus other Trust expenses, if any. When the interest deposited, if any, exceeds the sum of the Sponsor s fee for the prior month plus other Trust expenses, if any, the Trustee converts the excess into USD at the prevailing market rate and distributes the USD as promptly as practicable to Shareholders on a pro-rata basis (in accordance with the number of Shares that they own). Distributions paid during the current reporting period follow (annualized yield reflects the estimated annual yield an investor would receive if a monthly distribution stayed the same for the entire year going forward, and is calculated by annualizing the monthly distribution and dividing by the Trust NAV for the dates listed below):

Results of Operations 
 During the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, the Trust s net comprehensive income (loss) was, in part, impacted by market volatility and uncertainty caused by the novel coronavirus known as COVID-19, which is considered to be an unusual or infrequent event. Although the full and direct impact of COVID-19 on the Trust s net comprehensive income (loss) during the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021 cannot be known, it is believed that COVID-19 has impacted the Closing Spot Rate, the interest rate paid by the Depository, and the global economy and markets generally, including the number of Shares created and redeemed by the Trust. 
 The Canadian Dollar (CAD/USD) posted a loss in 2022. As the only G10 currency to gain against the US dollar in 2021, the CAD continued its positive performance through the first quarter of the year, benefiting from surging oil prices resulting from the war in Ukraine and anticipation for more hawkish monetary policies from the Bank of Canada. However, dollar strength in Q2 and Q3 amid growing recession fears, boosting safe haven demand, and a more hawkish U.S. Federal Reserve System (the Fed heavily weighed on the currency pair, while falling crude oil prices removed the soft floor for the CAD. Though prices rebounded a bit in Q4 amid easing dollar pressure, it wasn t enough to fully counter earlier losses. 
 2021 was a positive year for the Canadian Dollar (CAD/USD), closing out as the only G10 currency to have advanced against the U.S. Dollar, which posted its best year since 2015. CAD/USD strength was bolstered by the Canadian economy's strong economic rebound and market expectations that the Bank of Canada would be one of the most aggressive among the G10 countries in tightening monetary policy in 2022, potentially even surpassing the Fed. Strengthening energy prices throughout the year also provided a boost for the currency pair, as oil is one of Canada s major exports. 
 Additionally, the interest rate paid by the Depository has generally trended downward over the past several years, slightly offset by improvements this year to the current interest rate of 1.80 , as set forth in the FXC Rate Chart above. As long as the Sponsor s fee and the interest expense on currency deposits, if any, exceed interest income, the Trust will incur a net comprehensive loss. 
 Critical Accounting Estimates 
 The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America requires the Sponsor s management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of the assets and liabilities and disclosures of contingent liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the period covered by this report. 
 In addition to the description below, please refer to Note 3 to the financial statements for further discussion of our accounting policies. 
 The functional currency of the Trust is the Canadian Dollar in accordance with ASC 830, Foreign Currency Translation. 
 ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK 
 Except as described above with respect to fluctuations in the Canadian Dollar/USD exchange rate and changes in the nominal annual interest rate paid by the Depository on Canadian Dollars held by the Trust, the Trust is not subject to market risk. The Trust does not hold securities and does not invest in derivative instruments.

Report of Management on Internal Control 
 Over Financial Reporting 
 Management of Invesco Specialized Products, LLC, as sponsor (the Sponsor of the Invesco CurrencyShares Canadian Dollar Trust (the Trust ), is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting, as defined under Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the Exchange Act ). Internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. 
 Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. 
 We, Anna Paglia, Principal Executive Officer, and Kelli Gallegos, Principal Financial and Accounting Officer, Investment Pools, of the Sponsor, assessed the effectiveness of the Trust s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2022. In making this assessment, we used the criteria set forth by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission COSO in Internal Control Integrated Framework (2013). Based on our assessment and those criteria, we have concluded that the Trust maintained effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2022. 
 The Trust s independent registered public accounting firm, , has audited the Trust s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2022, as stated in their report on page 15 of the Trust s Annual Report on Form 10-K.

Report of Independent Regist ered Public Accounting Firm 
 
 To the Board of Managers of Invesco Specialized Products, LLC (as Sponsor of Invesco CurrencyShares Canadian Dollar Trust) and Shareholders of Invesco CurrencyShares Canadian Dollar Trust 
 
 Opinions on the Financial Statements and Internal Control over Financial Reporting 
 
 We have audited the accompanying statements of financial condition of Invesco CurrencyShares Canadian Dollar Trust (the Trust as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, and the related statements of comprehensive income, of changes in shareholders equity and redeemable capital shares and of cash flows for each of the two years in the period ended December 31, 2022, including the related notes (collectively referred to as the financial statements ). We also have audited the Trust's internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2022, based on criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO). 
 
 In our opinion, the financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Trust as of December 31, 2022 and 2021 , and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the two years in the period ended December 31, 2022 in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. Also in our opinion, the Trust maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2022, based on criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the COSO. 
 
 Basis for Opinions 
 
 The Trust's management is responsible for these financial statements, for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting, and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in the accompanying Report of Management on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express opinions on the Trust s financial statements and on the Trust's internal control over financial reporting based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB) and are required to be independent with respect to the Trust in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. 
 
 We conducted ouraudits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audits to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud, and whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. 
 
 Our audits of the financial statements included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. Our audit of internal control over financial reporting included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk. Our audits also included performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinions. 
 
 Definition and Limitations of Internal Control over Financial Reporting 
 
 A company s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (i) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (ii) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (iii) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements. 
 
 15 

Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. 

Critical Audit Matters 
 
 Critical audit matters are matters arising from the current period audit of the financial statements that were communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that (i) relate to accounts or disclosures that are material to the financial statements and (ii) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. We determined there are no critical audit matters.

when the Sponsor deposited Canadian Dollars in the Trust s primary deposit account held by JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., London Branch (the Depository ). The Sponsor is a Delaware limited liability company whose sole member is Invesco Capital Management. The Trust has an unlimited number of shares authorized for issuance. The investment objective of the Trust is for the Trust s shares (the Shares to reflect the price in U.S. Dollars USD of the Canadian Dollar plus accrued interest, if any, less the Trust s expenses and liabilities. The Shares are intended to provide investors with a simple, cost-effective means of gaining investment benefits similar to those of holding Canadian Dollars. The Trust s assets primarily consist of Canadian Dollars on demand deposit in deposit accounts maintained by the Depository: a primary deposit account which may earn interest and a secondary deposit account which does not earn interest. The secondary deposit account is used to account for any interest that may be received and paid out on creations and redemptions of blocks of Shares Baskets ). The secondary account is also used to account for interest earned, if any, on the primary deposit account, pay Trust expenses and distribute any excess interest to holders of Shares Shareholders on a monthly basis.

 per year. The only expense of the Trust during the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021 was the Sponsor s fee. 
 provision for federal income taxes is required. Interest, gains and losses are passed through to the Shareholders. Shareholders generally will be treated, for U.S. federal income tax purposes, as if they directly owned a pro-rata share of the assets held in the Trust. Shareholders also will be treated as if they directly received their respective pro-rata portion of the Trust s income, if any, and as if they directly incurred their respective pro-rata portion of the Trust s expenses. The acquisition of Shares by a U.S. Shareholder as part of a creation of a Basket will not be a taxable event to the Shareholder. The Sponsor s fee accrues daily and is payable monthly. For U.S. federal income tax purposes, an accrual-basis U.S. Shareholder generally will be required to take into account as an expense its allocable portion of the USD-equivalent of the amount of the Sponsor s fee that is accrued on each day, with such USD-equivalent being determined by the currency exchange rate that is in effect on the respective day. To the extent that the currency exchange rate on the date of payment of the accrued amount of the Sponsor s fee differs from the currency exchange rate in effect on the day of accrual, the U.S. Shareholder will recognize a currency gain or loss for U.S. federal income tax purposes. The Trust does not expect to generate taxable income except for interest income (if any) and gain (if any) upon the sale of Canadian Dollars. A non-U.S. Shareholder generally will not be subject to U.S. federal income tax with respect to gain recognized upon the sale or other disposition of Shares, or upon the sale of Canadian Dollars by the Trust, unless: (1) the non-U.S. Shareholder is an individual and is present in the United States for days or more during the taxable year of the sale or other disposition, and the gain is treated as being from United States sources; or (2) the gain is effectively connected with the conduct by the non-U.S. Shareholder of a trade or business in the United States. A non-U.S. Shareholder s portion of any interest income earned by the Trust generally will not be subject to U.S. federal income tax unless the Shares owned by such non-U.S. Shareholder are effectively connected with the conduct by the non-U.S. Shareholder of a trade or business in the United States.

period for settlement of each creation or redemption, the Trust reflects Shares created as a receivable on the trade date. Shares redeemed are reflected as a liability on the trade date. Outstanding Shares are reflected at redemption value, which is the NAV per Share at the period end date. Adjustments to redeemable capital Shares at redemption value are recorded directly to redeemable capital shares and retained earnings. The Trustee calculates the Trust s NAV each business day. To calculate the NAV, the Trustee subtracts the Sponsor s accrued fee through the previous day from the Canadian Dollars held by the Trust (including all unpaid interest, if any, accrued through the preceding day) and calculates the value of the Canadian Dollars in USD based upon the Closing Spot Rate. If, on a particular evaluation day, the Closing Spot Rate has not been determined and announced by 6:00 PM (London time), then the most recent Closing Spot Rate will be used to determine the NAV of the Trust unless the Trustee, in consultation with the Sponsor, determines that such price is inappropriate to use as the basis for the valuation. If the Trustee and the Sponsor determine that the most recent Closing Spot Rate is not an appropriate basis for valuation of the Trust s Canadian Dollars, they will determine an alternative basis for the valuation. The Trustee also determines the NAV per Share, which equals the NAV of the Trust, divided by the number of outstanding Shares. Shares deliverable under a purchase order are considered outstanding for purposes of determining NAV per Share; Shares deliverable under a redemption order are not considered outstanding for this purpose.
