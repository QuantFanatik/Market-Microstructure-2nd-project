All statements, other than statements of historical fact or present financial information, that address activities, outcomes and other matters that should or may occur in the future, including, without limitation, statements regarding the financial position, business strategy, production and reserve growth and other plans and objectives for our future operations, are forward-looking statements. Although we believe the expectations expressed in such forward-looking statements are based on reasonable assumptions, such statements are not guarantees of future performance. We have no obligation and make no undertaking to publicly update or revise any forward-looking statements, except as may be required by law. 
 Forward-looking statements include the items identified in the preceding paragraph, information concerning possible or assumed future results of operations and other statements in this Annual Report identified by words such as anticipate, intend, plan, project, estimate, continue, potential, should, could, may, will, objective, guidance, outlook, effort, expect, believe, predict, budget, projection, goal, forecast, model, target or similar words. Statements may be forward-looking even in the absence of these particular words. 
 You should not place undue reliance on forward-looking statements. They are subject to known and unknown risks, uncertainties and other factors that may affect our operations, markets, products, services and prices and cause our actual results, performance or achievements to be materially different from any future results, performance or achievements expressed or implied by the forward-looking statements. These forward-looking statements are based on management s current beliefs, based on currently available information, as to the outcome and timing of future events.

 credit risk relating to the risk of loss as a result of non-performance by our counterparties; 
 our hedging strategy and results; 
 our ability to obtain debt or equity financing on satisfactory terms; and 
 any other factors listed in the reports we have filed and may file with the Securities and Exchange Commission SEC ). 
 Should one or more of the risks or uncertainties described above or elsewhere in this Annual Report occur, or should underlying assumptions prove incorrect, our actual results and plans could differ materially from those expressed in any forward-looking statements. We specifically disclaim all responsibility to update publicly any information contained in a forward-looking statement or any forward-looking statement in its entirety and therefore disclaim any resulting liability for potentially related damages. 
 Reserve engineering is a process of estimating underground accumulations of natural gas, oil and NGLs that cannot be measured in an exact way. The accuracy of any reserve estimate depends on the quality of available data, the interpretation of such data and price and cost assumptions made by reserve engineers. In addition, the results of drilling, testing and production activities may justify revisions of estimates that were made previously. If significant, such revisions would change the schedule of any further production and our development program. Accordingly, reserve estimates may differ significantly from the quantities of natural gas, oil and NGLs that are ultimately recovered. 
 All forward-looking statements attributable to us are expressly qualified in their entirety by this cautionary statement. 
 
 GLOSSARY OF CERTAIN INDUSTRY TERMS 
 The definitions set forth below include indicated terms in this Annual Report.

 Development project A development project is the means by which petroleum resources are brought to the status of economically producible. As examples, the development of a single reservoir or field, an incremental development in a producing field, or the integrated development of a group of several fields and associated facilities with a common ownership may constitute a development project. For additional information, see the SEC s definition in Rule 4-10(a) (8) of Regulation S-X, a link for which is available at the SEC s website. 
 Development well A well drilled within the proved area of an oil or gas reservoir to the depth of a stratigraphic horizon known to be productive. For additional information, see the SEC s definition in Rule 4-10(a) (9) of Regulation S-X, a link for which is available at the SEC s website. 
 E P Exploration for and production of natural gas, oil and NGLs. 
 Economically producible The term economically producible, as it relates to a resource, means a resource which generates revenue that exceeds, or is reasonably expected to exceed, the costs of the operation. The value of the products that generate revenue shall be determined at the terminal point of oil and gas producing activities. For additional information, see the SEC s definition in Rule 4-10(a) (10) of Regulation S-X, a link for which is available at the SEC s website. 
 ESG Environmental, Social and Governance matters.

For additional information, see the SEC s definition in Rule 4-10(a) (11) of Regulation S-X, a link for which is available at the SEC s website. 
 Exploitation The development of a reservoir to extract its natural gas and/or oil. 
 Exploratory well An exploratory well is a well drilled to find a new field or to find a new reservoir in a field previously found to be productive of oil or gas in another reservoir. Generally, an exploratory well is any well that is not a development well, an extension well, a service well, or a stratigraphic test well as those items are defined in this section. For additional information, see the SEC s definition in Rule 4-10(a) (13) of Regulation S-X, a link for which is available at the SEC s website. 
 Field An area consisting of a single reservoir or multiple reservoirs all grouped on or related to the same individual geological structural feature and/or stratigraphic condition. There may be two or more reservoirs in a field that are separated vertically by intervening impervious, strata, or laterally by local geologic barriers, or by both. Reservoirs that are associated by being in overlapping or adjacent fields may be treated as a single or common operational field. The geological terms structural feature and stratigraphic condition are intended to identify localized geological features as opposed to the broader terms of basins, trends, provinces, plays, areas-of-interest, etc. For additional information, see the SEC s definition in Rule 4-10(a) (15) of Regulation S-X, a link for which is available at the SEC s website.

 Play A term applied to a portion of the exploration and production cycle following the identification by geologists and geophysicists of areas with potential oil and natural gas reserves. 
 Pressure pumping spread All of the equipment needed to carry out a hydraulic fracturing job. 
 Probabilistic estimate The method of estimation of reserves or resources is called probabilistic when the full range of values that could reasonably occur for each unknown parameter (from the geoscience and engineering data) is used to generate a full range of possible outcomes and their associated probabilities of occurrence. For additional information, see the SEC s definition in Rule 4-10(a) (19) of Regulation S-X, a link for which is available at the SEC s website. 
 Producing property A natural gas and oil property with existing production.

 Proppant Sized particles mixed with fracturing fluid to hold fractures open after a hydraulic fracturing treatment. In addition to naturally occurring sand grains, man-made or specially engineered proppants, such as resin-coated sand or high-strength ceramic materials like sintered bauxite, may also be used. Proppant materials are carefully sorted for size and sphericity to provide an efficient conduit for production of fluid from the reservoir to the wellbore. 
 Proved developed producing or PDP Proved developed reserves that can be expected to be recovered from a reservoir that is currently producing through existing wells. 
 Proved developed reserves Proved natural gas, oil and NGLs that are also developed natural gas, oil and NGL reserves. 
 Proved natural gas, oil and NGL reserves Proved natural gas, oil and NGL reserves are those quantities of natural gas, oil and NGLs that, by analysis of geoscience and engineering data, can be estimated with reasonable certainty to be economically producible from a given date forward, from known reservoirs, and under existing economic conditions, operating methods, and government regulations prior to the time at which contracts providing the right to operate expire, unless evidence indicates that renewal is reasonably certain, regardless of whether deterministic or probabilistic methods are used for the estimation. The project to extract the hydrocarbons must have commenced or the operator must be reasonably certain that it will commence the project within a reasonable time. Also referred to as proved reserves. For additional information, see the SEC s definition in Rule 4-10(a) (22) of Regulation S-X, a link for which is available at the SEC s website.

 PV-10 When used with respect to natural gas, oil and NGL reserves, PV-10 means the estimated future gross revenue to be generated from the production of proved reserves, net of estimated production and future development costs, using prices and costs in effect as of the date of the report or estimate, without giving effect to non-property related expenses such as general and administrative expenses, debt service and future income tax expense or to depreciation, depletion and amortization, discounted using an annual discount rate of 10 . Also referred to as present value. After-tax PV-10 is also referred to as standardized measure and is net of future income tax expense. 
 Reserve life index The quotient resulting from dividing total reserves by annual production and typically expressed in years. 
 Reserve replacement ratio The sum of the estimated net proved reserves added through discoveries, extensions, infill drilling and acquisitions (which may include or exclude reserve revisions of previous estimates) for a specified period of time divided by production for that same period of time. 
 Reservoir A porous and permeable underground formation containing a natural accumulation of producible oil and/or gas that is confined by impermeable rock or water barriers and is individual and separate from other reservoirs. For additional information, see the SEC s definition in Rule 4-10(a) (27) of Regulation S-X, a link for which is available at the SEC s website. 
 Royalty interest An interest in a natural gas and oil property entitling the owner to a share of natural gas, oil or NGL production free of production costs.

 Standardized measure Discounted future net cash flows estimated by applying year-end prices to the estimated future production of year-end proved reserves. Future cash inflows are reduced by estimated future production and development costs based on period-end costs to determine pre-tax cash inflows. Future income taxes, if applicable, are computed by applying the statutory tax rate to the excess of pre-tax cash inflows over our tax basis in the natural gas and oil properties. Future net cash inflows after income taxes are discounted using a 10 annual discount rate. 
 Tcfe One trillion cubic feet of natural gas equivalent, with liquids converted to an equivalent volume of natural gas using the ratio of one barrel of oil to six Mcf of natural gas. 
 Unconventional play A play in which the targeted reservoirs generally fall into one of three categories: tight sands, coal beds, or shales. The reservoirs tend to cover large areas and lack the readily apparent traps, seals and discrete hydrocarbon-water boundaries that typically define conventional reservoirs. These reservoirs generally require fracture stimulation treatments or other special recovery processes in order to produce economic flow rates. 
 Undeveloped acreage Those leased acres on which wells have not been drilled or completed to a point that would permit the production of economic quantities of oil or gas regardless of whether such acreage contains proved reserves. For additional information, see the SEC s definition in Item 1208(c)(4) of Regulation S-K, a link for which is available at the SEC s website. 
 Undeveloped natural gas, oil and NGL reserves Undeveloped natural gas, oil and NGL reserves are reserves of any category that are expected to be recovered from new wells on undrilled acreage, or from existing wells where a relatively major expenditure is required for recompletion. Also referred to as undeveloped reserves. For additional information, see the SEC s definition in Rule 4-10(a) (31) of Regulation S-X, a link for which is available at the SEC s website. 
 Undeveloped reserves See undeveloped natural gas, oil and NGL reserves. 
 Wells to sales Wells that have been placed on sales for the first time. 
 Working interest An operating interest that gives the owner the right to drill, produce and conduct operating activities on the property and to receive a share of production. 
 Workovers Operations on a producing well to restore or increase production. 
 WTI West Texas Intermediate, the benchmark oil price in the United States. 
 
 SUMMARY RISK FACTORS 
 Risks Related to Our Business 
 Natural gas, oil and NGL prices and basis differentials greatly affect our revenues and thus profits, liquidity, growth, ability to repay our debt and the value of our assets. 
 Significant capital investment is required to develop and replace our reserves and conduct our business. 
 If we are not able to develop and replace reserves, our production levels and thus our revenues and profits may decline. 
 Our business depends on access to natural gas, oil and NGL gathering, processing and transportation systems and facilities. Changes to access and cost of these systems and facilities could adversely impact our business and financial condition. Our commitments to assure availability of transportation could lead to substantial payments for capacity we do not use if production falls below projected levels. 
 Strategic determinations, including the allocation of capital and other resources to strategic opportunities, are challenging in the face of shifting market conditions, and our failure to appropriately allocate capital and resources among our strategic opportunities may adversely affect our financial condition and reduce our future growth rate. 
 Certain of our undeveloped assets are subject to leases that will expire over the next several years unless production is established on units containing the acreage.

PART I 
 ITEM 1. BUSINESS 
 Southwestern Energy Company (including its subsidiaries, collectively, we , our , us , the Company or Southwestern is an independent energy company engaged in development, exploration and production activities, including the related marketing of natural gas, associated NGLs and oil produced in our operations. Southwestern is a holding company whose assets consist of direct and indirect ownership interests in, and whose business is conducted substantially through, its subsidiaries. Currently we operate exclusively in the United States. Our common stock is listed and traded on the NYSE under the ticker symbol SWN. 
 Our Business Strategy 
 We aim to deliver economic returns and optimize our ability to generate free cash flow (defined below) through responsible natural gas (and related liquids) development. 
 As we develop our core positions in the Appalachian and Haynesville natural gas basins in the U.S., we will concentrate on: 
 Creating Sustainable Value. We seek to create value for our stakeholders by allocating capital that is focused on earning economic returns and optimizing the value of our assets; delivering sustainable free cash flow through the cycle; upgrading the quality, depth and capital efficiency of our drilling inventory; and converting resources to proved reserves. 
 Protecting Financial Strength. We intend to protect our financial strength by lowering our leverage ratio and total debt; maintaining a strong liquidity position and attractive debt maturity profile; lowering our weighted average cost of debt; and deploying hedges to balance revenue protection with commodity upside exposure. 
 Progressing Execution. We are focused on operating effectively and efficiently with HSE and ESG as core values; leveraging our data analytics, operating execution, strategic sourcing, vertical integration and large-scale asset development expertise; further enhancing well performance, optimizing well costs and reducing base production declines; and growing margins and securing flow assurance through commercial and marketing arrangements. 
 Capturing the Tangible Benefits of Scale. We strive to enhance our enterprise returns by leveraging the scale gained from our past strategic transactions to deliver operating synergies, drive cost savings, expand our economic inventory, lower our enterprise risk profile, and expand our opportunity set and optionality. 
 We remain committed to achieving these objectives through being environmentally conscious and proactive while maintaining best practices in social stewardship and corporate governance. We believe that we and our industry will continue to face challenges due to evolving environmental standards by both regulators and investors, the uncertainty of natural gas, oil and NGL prices in the United States, changes in laws, regulations and investor sentiment, and other key factors described in this Annual Report. As such, we aim to monitor and seek ways to minimize the environmental impact of our operations. 
 Our Company s formula, The Right People doing the Right Things, wisely investing the cash flow from our underlying Assets will create Value+, guides how we conduct our business: 
 
 We strive to attract and retain strong talent, to work safely, to act ethically with steadfast vigilance for the environment and the communities in which we live and operate, and to apply technical skills to grow and develop our asset base. We believe these practices will enhance long-term value for our shareholders.

 During 2022 we executed on this strategy by: 
 Integrating the natural gas assets acquired in our September 2021 merger with Indigo Natural Resources (the Indigo Merger ), and our December 2021 merger with GEP Haynesville (the GEPH Merger ), which created and subsequently expanded our operations in the Haynesville and Bossier shales; 
 Using free cash flow generated to lower our debt level by over 1 billion with related improvement to our net leverage ratio to below 1.5x; 
 Securing upgrades from all three credit agencies to one rating below Investment Grade; 
 Improving our weighted average years to maturity of our debt through extending the maturity date of our revolving line of credit; 
 Initiating a share repurchase program and repurchasing 17,261,469 shares of our outstanding common stock for approximately 125 million at an average price of 7.24 per share; 
 Focusing on delivering operational results, such as improved well productivity and economics from more efficient drilling, enhanced completion techniques, optimization of surface equipment and managing reservoir drawdown as well as base production declines; 
 Achieving year-end reserves of 21.6 Tcfe 37.6B PV-10 value); 
 Maintaining a multi-year hedging program to balance revenue protection with commodity upside exposure; 
 Expanding our responsibly sourced gas certification to cover both of our operating areas; and 
 Establishing new long-term greenhouse gas (GHG) reduction targets to reduce Scope 1 GHG emissions 50 by 2035 based on our current strategy of investing to maintain production levels consistent with the prior year and assuming no organic production growth or acquisitions. 
 The bulk of our operations, which we refer to as Exploration and Production E P ), are focused on the development of natural gas and associated NGL and oil reserves. We are also focused on creating and capturing additional value through our marketing business, which we refer to as Marketing. 
 Exploration and Production 
 Overview 
 Our primary business is the development, exploration and production of natural gas as well as associated NGLs and oil in our core positions in the Appalachia and Haynesville natural gas basins in the U.S. We are currently focused on the development of unconventional natural gas reservoirs located in Louisiana, West Virginia, Pennsylvania, and Ohio. Our operations in West Virginia, Pennsylvania and Ohio (herein referred to as Appalachia are primarily focused on the Marcellus Shale, the Utica and the Upper Devonian unconventional natural gas and liquids reservoirs. Our operations in Louisiana (herein referred to as Haynesville are primarily focused on the Haynesville and Bossier natural gas reservoirs. 
 Our E P segment recorded operating income of 7,253 million in 2022, compared to operating income of 2,583 million in 2021. Our operating income increased 4,670 million compared to the same period in 2021 primarily due to a 63 increase in our weighted average realized commodity prices, excluding derivatives, and a 40 increase in production volumes mostly attributable to the Indigo Merger and the GEPH Merger (as defined herein). 
 Our E P segment cash flow from operations was 3,175 million in 2022, compared to 1,718 million in 2021. E P segment cash flow from operations increased 1,457 million as a 21 increase in our net weighted average realized commodity prices, including settled derivatives, and a 40 increase in production volumes was only partially offset by a 42 increase in operating costs and expenses.

 Oilfield Services Vertical Integration 
 We provide certain oilfield services that are strategic and economically beneficial for our E P operations when our E P activity levels and market pricing support these activities. Currently, our vertically integrated operations only perform services on on our operated wells. This vertical integration may lower our well costs, dampens inflationary pressures, promotes operating efficiency, enables quick reaction to rapid changes in market conditions and helps to mitigate certain operational and environmental risks. These services include drilling, completions and water management and movement. As of December 31, 2022, we operated a fleet of drilling rigs and have leased two pressure pumping spreads with a total capacity of 69,000 horsepower along with additional supporting pump down equipment with a total capacity of 36,000 horsepower. These assets provide us greater flexibility to align our operational activities with commodity prices. In 2022, we provided drilling rigs for 85 drilled wells.

We believe that the presentation of pre-tax PV-10 is relevant and useful to our investors as supplemental disclosure to the standardized measure of discounted future cash flows standardized measure ), or after-tax PV-10 amount, because it presents the discounted future net cash flows attributable to our proved reserves prior to taking into account future corporate income taxes and our current tax structure. While the standardized measure is dependent on the unique tax situation of each company, pre-tax PV-10 is based on a pricing methodology and discount factors that are consistent for all companies. Because of this, pre-tax PV-10 can be used within the industry and by creditors and securities analysts to evaluate estimated net cash flows from proved reserves on a more comparable basis. The difference between the standardized measure and the pre-tax PV-10 amount is the discounted amount of estimated future income taxes. See Supplemental Oil and Gas Disclosures (Unaudited) to the consolidated financial statements of this Annual Report for more information about the calculation of standardized measure. 
 Our year-end 2022 reserve estimates totaled 21.6 Tcfe with an after-tax PV-10 of 37.6 billion. Our reserve estimates and the after-tax PV-10 measure, or standardized measure, are highly dependent upon the respective commodity price used in our reserve and after-tax PV-10 calculations. 
 Our reserves increased 2 in 2022, compared to 2021, primarily related to extensions, discoveries and other additions partially offset by production. 
 Our after-tax PV-10 value increased in 2022 compared to 2021 primarily due to an increase in the SEC 12-month backward-looking commodity prices. 
 We are the designated operator of approximately 98 of our reserves, based on the pre-tax PV-10 value of our proved developed producing reserves, and our reserve life index was approximately 12.5 years at year-end 2022.

 The difference in after-tax PV-10, or standardized measure, and pre-tax PV-10 (a non-GAAP measure which is reconciled in the 2022 Proved Reserves by Category and Summary Operating Data table below) is the discounted value of future income taxes on the estimated cash flows. 
 We believe that the pre-tax PV-10 value of the estimated cash flows related to our estimated proved reserves is a useful supplemental disclosure to the after-tax PV-10 value. Pre-tax PV-10 is based on prices, costs and discount factors that are comparable from company to company, while the after-tax PV-10 is dependent on the unique tax situation of each individual company. We understand that securities analysts use pre-tax PV-10 as one measure of the value of a company s current proved reserves and to compare relative values among peer companies without regard to income taxes. We refer you to Supplemental Oil and Gas Disclosures in Item 8 of Part II of this Annual Report for a discussion of our standardized measure of discounted future cash flows related to our proved natural gas, oil and NGL reserves, to the risk factor Our proved natural gas, oil and NGL reserves are estimates that include uncertainties. Any material changes to these uncertainties or underlying assumptions could cause the quantities and net present value of our reserves to be overstated or understated in Item 1A of Part I of this Annual Report, and to Cautionary Statement about Forward-Looking Statements in this Annual Report for a discussion of the risks inherent in utilization of standardized measure and estimated reserve data. 
 Lower natural gas, oil and NGL prices can reduce the value of our assets, both by a direct reduction in what the production could be sold for and by making some properties uneconomic, resulting in decreases to the overall value of our reserves and potential non-cash impairment charges to earnings. Further non-cash impairments in future periods could occur if the trailing 12-month commodity prices decrease as compared to the average used in prior periods.

 Performance, production and price revisions consist of revisions to reserves associated with wells having proved reserves in existence as of the beginning of the year. Extensions, discoveries and other additions include new reserves locations added in the current year. 
 As of December 31, 2022, we had 9,480 Bcfe of proved undeveloped reserves, all of which we expect will be developed within five years of the initial disclosure as the starting reference date. The downward revision to previous estimates of 312 Bcfe includes additions associated with infill development of 577 Bcfe and positive performance revisions of 435 Bcfe that were more than offset by 1,324 Bcfe of reserves reclassified to unproved due to changes in development plans, which resulted in these reserves not being scheduled for development within five years of initial disclosure. Additionally, we had extensions and discoveries of 2.0 Tcfe and positive price revisions of 14 Bcfe. 
 During 2022, we invested 791 million in connection with converting 1,275 Bcfe, or 21 , of our proved undeveloped reserves as of December 31, 2021 into proved developed reserves and added 1,038 Bcfe of proved undeveloped reserves for our Appalachia operations. During 2022, we invested 1,135 million in connection with converting 782 Bcfe, or 21 , of our proved undeveloped reserves as of December 31, 2021 into proved developed reserves and added 984 Bcfe of proved undeveloped reserves for our Haynesville operations. 
 As of December 31, 2021, we had 9,813 Bcfe of proved undeveloped reserves. During 2021, we invested 388 million in connection with converting 1,153 Bcfe, or 30 , of our proved undeveloped reserves as of December 31, 2020 into proved developed reserves and added 1,764 Bcfe of proved undeveloped reserves. Revisions to previous estimates of 1,719 Bcfe include infill additions of 1,747 Bcfe and negative performance revisions of 28 Bcfe. Additionally, we added 3,692 Bcfe of proved undeveloped reserves through the Indigo Merger and GEPH Merger and positive price revisions of 4 Bcfe. 
 Our proved reserves as of December 31, 2022 included no proved undeveloped reserves that had a positive present value on an undiscounted basis in compliance with proved reserve requirements but did not have a positive present value when discounted at 10 . 
 We expect that the development costs for our proved undeveloped reserves of 9,480 Bcfe as of December 31, 2022 will require us to invest an additional 6.9 billion for those reserves to be brought to production. Our ability to make the necessary investments to generate these cash inflows is subject to factors that may be beyond our control. We refer you to the risk factors Natural gas, oil and NGL prices greatly affect our revenues and thus profits, liquidity, growth, ability to repay our debt and the value of our assets and Significant capital investment is required to replace our reserves and conduct our business in Item 1A of Part I of this Annual Report and to Cautionary Statement about Forward-Looking Statements in this Annual Report for a more detailed discussion of these factors and other risks. 
 Preparation of Reserve Estimates 
 Our proved reserve estimates as of December 31, 2020, 2021 and 2022 included in this Annual Report were prepared by our internal reservoir engineers under the supervision of our management, in accordance with petroleum engineering and evaluation standards published by the Society of Petroleum Evaluation Engineers and definitions and guidelines established by the SEC. These proved reserve estimates have been audited by our independent engineers, Netherland, Sewell Associates, Inc. NSAI ). Reserve estimates are prepared for each of our properties annually by the reservoir engineers assigned to the asset management team for that property. The reservoir engineering and financial data included in these estimates are reviewed by senior engineers, who are not part of the asset management teams, and by our Director of Reserves, who is the technical person primarily responsible for overseeing the preparation of our reserves estimates. Our Director of Reserves has more than 28 years of experience in petroleum engineering, including the estimation of natural gas and oil reserves, and holds a Bachelor of Science in Petroleum Engineering. Prior to joining us in 2018, our Director of Reserves served in various reservoir engineering roles for EP Energy Company, El Paso Corporation, Cabot Oil Gas Corporation, Schlumberger and H.J. Gruy Associates, and is a member of the Society of Petroleum Engineers. He reports to our Executive Vice President and Chief Operating Officer, who has more than 34 years of experience in petroleum engineering including the estimation of natural gas, oil and NGL reserves in multiple basins in the United States, and holds a Bachelor of Science in Petroleum Engineering. Prior to joining Southwestern in 2017, our Chief Operating Officer served in various engineering and leadership roles for EP Energy Corporation, El Paso Corporation, ARCO Oil and Gas Company, Burlington Resources and Peoples Energy Production, and is a member of the Society of Petroleum Engineers. 
 We engage NSAI, a worldwide leader of petroleum property analysis for industry and financial organizations and government agencies, to independently audit our proved reserves estimates as discussed in more detail below. NSAI was founded in 1961 and performs consulting petroleum engineering services under Texas Board of Professional Engineers Registration No. F-002699. Within NSAI, the two technical persons primarily responsible for auditing our proved reserves estimates (1) have over 26 years and over 21 years of practical experience in petroleum geosciences and petroleum engineering, respectively; (2) have

 Our Reserve Replacement 
 The reserve replacement ratio measures the success of an E P company in adding new reserves to replace the reserves that are being depleted by its current production volumes. We believe the reserve replacement ratio is an important analytical measure used by investors and peers in the E P industry to evaluate performance results and long-term prospects. Reserve replacement represents the net change in reserves, net of production, divided by our current year production, as shown in our supplemental reserve table disclosures. The reserve replacement ratio is a statistical indicator that has limitations, including its predictive and comparative value. As an annual measure, the reserve replacement ratio can be limited because it may vary widely based on the extent and timing of new discoveries and the varying effects of changes in prices and well performance. In addition, because the reserve replacement ratio does not consider the cost or timing of future production of new reserves or the type of reserves, such measure may not be an adequate measure of value creation. 
 We replaced 127 of our production volumes in 2022 with 2,198 Bcfe of proved reserve additions and performance revisions. The following table summarizes the changes in our proved natural gas, oil and NGL reserves for the year ended December 31, 2022:

 Our Operations 
 Appalachia 
 Appalachia represented 61 of our total 2022 net production and 72 of our total reserves as of December 31, 2022. In 2022, our production decreased by 54 Bcfe, primarily due to a higher capital allocation to our Haynesville assets. Our reserves in Appalachia increased by 139 Bcfe as of December 31, 2022. We had production of 1,054 Bcfe, disposition of reserves in place of 43 Bcfe, net downward price revisions of 4 Bcfe, and a downward change in development plan of 991 Bcfe offset by extensions and discoveries of 1,273 Bcfe, additions associated with infill development of 577 Bcfe and positive performance revisions of 381 Bcfe. As of December 31, 2022, we had approximately 765,648 net acres in Appalachia and had a total of 1,575 wells on production that we operated. Below is a summary of Appalachia s operating results for the latest two years:

 Haynesville 
 Haynesville represented 39 of our total 2022 net production and 28 of our total reserves as of December 31, 2022. In 2022, our production increased by 547 Bcfe. Our reserves in Haynesville increased 338 Bcfe as of December 31, 2022. We had production of 679 Bcfe and a downward change in development plan of 333 Bcfe more than offset by extensions and discoveries of 1,155 Bcfe, positive performance revisions of 136 Bcfe, and net positive price revisions of 59 Bcfe. As of December 31, 2022, we had approximately 285,590 net acres in Haynesville and had a total of 748 wells on production that we operated.

 Excluding 2,518,519 acres in New Brunswick, Canada, which have been subject to a government-imposed drilling moratorium since 2015, we did not hold any net undeveloped acres for the potential development of new resources as of December 31, 2022 in areas outside of Appalachia and Haynesville as these positions were either sold or expired during 2022. This compares to 650 net undeveloped acres held at year-end 2021 in areas outside of Appalachia and Haynesville, excluding the New Brunswick acreage. 
 New Brunswick, Canada. We currently hold exclusive licenses to search and conduct an exploration program covering 2,518,519 net acres in New Brunswick. In 2015, the provincial government in New Brunswick imposed a moratorium on hydraulic fracturing until it is satisfied with a list of conditions. In May 2016, the provincial government announced that the moratorium would continue indefinitely. Given this development, we fully impaired our investment in New Brunswick in 2016. In 2021, we were granted a further extension of the licenses through March 2026. Unless and until the moratorium is lifted, we will not be able to develop these assets. 
 Acquisitions and Divestitures 
 In November 2020, we closed on our Agreement and Plan of Merger with Montage Resources Corporation Montage ), pursuant to which Montage merged with and into Southwestern (the Montage Merger ). At the effective time of the Montage Merger, we acquired all of the outstanding shares of common stock in Montage in exchange for 1.8656 shares of our common stock per share of Montage common stock. The Montage Merger increased our footprint in West Virginia and Pennsylvania and expanded our operations into Ohio. 
 On September 1, 2021, we closed on our Agreement and Plan of Merger with Ikon Acquisition Company, LLC Ikon ), Indigo Natural Resources LLC Indigo and Ibis Unitholder Representative LLC, pursuant to which Indigo merged with and into Ikon, a subsidiary of Southwestern, and became a subsidiary of Southwestern (the Indigo Merger ). The outstanding equity interests in Indigo were cancelled and converted into the right to receive (i) 373 million in cash consideration, and (ii) 337,827,171 shares of Southwestern common stock. Additionally, we assumed 700 million in aggregate principal amount of Indigo s 5.375 Senior Notes due 2029 (the Indigo Notes ). The shares of Southwestern common stock had an aggregate dollar value equal to 1,588 million, based on the closing price of 4.70 per share of Southwestern common stock on the NYSE on September 1, 2021. The Indigo Merger diversified our operations by expanding our portfolio into the Haynesville and Bossier formations, deepened our inventory of economic wells, reduced our enterprise risk profile and gave us additional exposure to the LNG and other markets on the U.S. Gulf Coast. 
 On December 31, 2021, we closed on our Agreement and Plan of Merger with GEP Haynesville, LLC GEPH ), pursuant to which we acquired GEPH for aggregate consideration of approximately 1,726 million, consisting of a combination of 1,263 million cash (including post close adjustments) and 99,337,748 shares of our common stock, with GEPH becoming our wholly owned subsidiary (the GEPH Merger and, together with the Montage Merger and the Indigo Merger, the Mergers ). The shares issued as consideration had an aggregate dollar value equal to approximately 463 million based on the closing price of 4.66 per share of Southwestern common stock on the NYSE on December 31, 2021. The GEPH Merger furthered the benefits of the Indigo Merger and enhanced our scale and operating and marketing optionality in the Haynesville.

 Our E P capital investing in 2022 totaled 2.2 billion. 
 E P capital investing in 2022 increased 98 , as compared to the prior year, due to the increased capital investment required to maintain daily production consistent with the end of the prior year, primarily related to increased scale resulting from the Indigo Merger and the GEPH Merger, along with the impacts of inflation. 
 In 2022, we drilled 138 wells, completed 139 wells, placed 133 wells to sales and had 69 wells in progress at year-end. 
 Of the 69 wells in progress at year-end, 33 were located in Appalachia and 36 were located in Haynesville.

 Sales of natural gas, oil and NGL production are conducted under contracts that reflect current prices and are subject to seasonal price swings. We are unable to predict changes in the market demand and price for these commodities, including changes that may be induced by the effects of weather on demand for our production. We regularly enter into various derivative and other financial arrangements with respect to a portion of our projected production to support certain desired levels of cash flow and to minimize the impact of adverse price movements. We limit derivative agreements to counterparties with appropriate credit standings, and our policies prohibit speculation.

We refer you to Item 7A of Part II of this Annual Report, Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk , for further information regarding our derivatives and risk management as of December 31, 2022. 
 During 2022, the average price we received for our natural gas production, excluding the impact of derivatives and including the cost of transportation, was approximately 0.66 per Mcf lower than average NYMEX prices, an increased basis differential of 25 over the prior year differential. Differences between NYMEX and price realized (basis differentials) are due primarily to locational differences and transportation cost.

 We refer you to Note 6 to the consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report for additional discussion about our derivatives and risk management activities. 
 Delivery Commitments. As of December 31, 2022, we had natural gas delivery commitments of 1,273 Bcf in 2023 and 715 Bcf in 2024 under existing agreements. These amounts are well below our expected 2023 natural gas production from Appalachia and Haynesville and expected 2024 production from our available reserves, which are not subject to any priorities or curtailments that may affect quantities delivered to our customers or any priority allocations or price limitations imposed by federal or state regulatory agencies, or any other factors beyond our control that may affect our ability to meet our delivery commitments other than those discussed in Item 1A Risk Factors of Part I of this Annual Report. We expect to be able to fulfill all of our short-term and long-term delivery commitments to provide natural gas from our own production of available reserves; however, if we are unable to do so, we may have to purchase natural gas at market to fulfill our obligations. 
 Customers. Our E P production is marketed primarily by our Marketing segment. Our customers include LNG exporters, major energy companies, utilities and industrial purchasers of natural gas. For the year ended December 31, 2022, one purchaser 
 24 

Table of Contents 
 I ndex to Financial Statements 

 accounted for 17 of our revenues. A default or operational disruption on this account could have a material impact on the Company. For the year ended December 31, 2021, one purchaser accounted for 12 of our revenues. If we had completed the Indigo Merger and GEPH Merger at the beginning of 2021, this same purchaser would have accounted for approximately 16 of our revenues. No other purchasers accounted for more than 10 of consolidated revenues. 
 Competition 
 All phases of the natural gas and associated liquids industry are highly competitive. We compete in the acquisition and disposition of properties, the search for and development of reserves, the production and marketing of natural gas, oil and NGLs, and the securing of labor, services and equipment required to conduct our operations. Our competitors include major oil and natural gas companies, other independent oil and natural gas companies and individual producers. Many of these competitors have financial and other resources that substantially exceed those available to us. Consequently, we will encounter competition that may affect both the price we receive and contract terms we must offer. We also face competition in accessing pipeline and other services to transport our product to market. Likewise, there are substitutes for the commodities we produce, such as other fuels for power generation, heating and transportation, and those markets in effect compete with us. 
 We cannot predict whether and to what extent any regulatory changes initiated by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, or the FERC, or any other new energy legislation or regulations will achieve the goal of increasing competition, lessening preferential treatment and enhancing transparency in markets in which our natural gas production is sold. Similarly, we cannot predict whether legal constraints that have hindered the development of new transportation infrastructure, particularly in the northeastern United States, will continue. However, we do not believe that we will be disproportionately affected as compared to other natural gas and oil producers and marketers by any action taken by the FERC or any other legislative or regulatory body or the status of the development of transportation facilities. 
 Regulation 
 Producing natural gas, oil and NGL resources and transporting and selling production historically have been heavily regulated. For example, state governments regulate the location of wells and establish the minimum size for spacing units. Permits typically are required before drilling. State and local government zoning and land use regulations may also limit the locations for drilling and production. Similar regulations can also affect the location, construction and operation of gathering and other pipelines needed to transport production to market. Regulations additionally govern the handling, transport and disposal of the water involved in our development efforts. In addition, various suppliers of goods and services may require licensing. 
 Currently in the United States, the price at which natural gas, oil or NGLs may be sold is not regulated. Congress has imposed price regulation from time to time, and there can be no assurance that the current, less stringent regulatory approach will continue. In 2015, the federal government repealed a 40-year ban on the export of crude oil. The export of natural gas continues to require federal permits. Broader freedom to export could lead to higher prices. In addition, the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (the Dodd-Frank Act and the rules that the U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission, (the CFTC ), the SEC, and certain other regulators have issued thereunder regulate certain swaps, futures and options contracts in the major energy markets, including for natural gas, oil and NGLs. 
 Producing and transporting natural gas, oil and NGLs is also subject to extensive environmental regulation. We refer you to Other Environmental Regulation in Item 1 of Part 1 of this Annual Report and the risk factor We, our service providers and our customers are subject to complex federal, state and local laws and regulations that could adversely affect the cost, manner or feasibility of conducting our operations or expose us to significant liabilities in Item 1A of Part I of this Annual Report for a discussion of the impact of environmental regulation on our business.

 Marketing 
 We engage in marketing activities which primarily support our E P operations and generate revenue through the marketing of natural gas, oil and NGLs. 
 For the years ended December 31, 2022 2021 Marketing revenues (in millions)

 2,266 1,542 Percent natural gas production marketed from affiliated E P operations 94 95 Percent oil and NGL production marketed from affiliated E P operations 88 82 
 Marketing operating income increased 49 million for the year ended December 31, 2022, compared to 2021, primarily due to a 51 million increase in the marketing margin, as well as a 1 million reduction in operating expenses which was partially offset by a 1 million reduction in gas storage gains and a 2 million reduction in non-performance damages received, both recorded in other operating revenues. 
 Marketing revenues increased in 2022, compared to 2021, primarily due to a 60 increase in the price received for volumes marketed and a 724 Bcfe increase in marketed volumes. 
 The margin generated from marketing activities increased 51 million for the year ended December 31, 2022, as compared to the prior year, primarily due to a 47 increase in volumes marketed and a corresponding reduction in third-party purchases and sales, which were used in 2021 to optimize our transportation folio, due to increased affiliated volumes available for marketing. 
 Marketing 
 We attempt to capture opportunities related to the marketing and transportation of natural gas, oil and NGLs primarily involving the marketing of our own equity production and that of royalty owners in our wells. Additionally, we manage portfolio and locational, or basis, risk, acquire transportation rights on third-party pipelines and, in limited circumstances, purchase third-party natural gas to fulfill commitments specific to a geographic location. 
 Appalachia. Our transportation portfolio for all products in Appalachia is highly diversified, allows us to capitalize on strengthening markets, including city-gate markets, and provides production flow assurance. Agreements with Rover Pipeline LLC and Mountaineer Xpress / Gulf Xpress pipelines allow us to access growing high-demand markets in the U.S. Gulf Coast region while low-cost transportation on other northeast pipelines allows us to capture in-basin pricing, and our agreements with Rover Pipeline LLC and Rockies Express Pipeline LLC provide access to Midwest markets. In addition to our natural gas transportation, we have ethane take-away capacity that provides direct access to Mont Belvieu pricing. Certain of our capacity agreements contain multiple extension and reduction options that allow us to right-size our transportation portfolio as needed for our production or to capture future market opportunities. The table below details our firm transportation, firm sales and total takeaway capacity over the next three years as of February 21, 2023:

 (1) We have extension options and potential contract renewal capacity of 220,000 MMBtu per day for 2023 and 320,000 MMBtu per day for 2024 for Appalachia. 
 Haynesville. Our transportation portfolio for Haynesville allows for access to the U.S. Gulf Coast and LNG corridor markets. Agreements with ETC Tiger, Gulf South and Enable Line CP provide transport to the Southeast Supply Header SESH and Perryville Hub, a central trading location with high demand and amply liquidity, while Acadian, Midcoast and LEAP pipelines deliver to the growing LNG corridor, with direct access to LNG shippers at sales prices close to Henry Hub pricing. Our diversified transportation portfolio provides flow optionality and allows for advantageous pricing year-round as the Haynesville

 As of December 31, 2022, our obligations for demand and similar charges under the firm transportation agreements and gathering agreements totaled approximately 10.4 billion, 1,326 million of which related to access capacity on future pipeline and gathering infrastructure projects that still require the granting of regulatory approvals and additional construction efforts. We also have guarantee obligations of up to 929 million of that amount. We regularly monitor our proved reserves to ensure sufficient availability to fully utilize our firm transportation commitments. 
 We refer you to Note 10 to the consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report for further details on our demand charges and the risk factor Our business depends on access to natural gas, oil and NGL gathering, processing and transportation systems and facilities. Changes to access and cost of these systems and facilities could adversely impact our business and financial condition. Our commitments to assure availability of transportation could lead to substantial payments for capacity we do not use if production falls below projected levels, in Item 1A of Part I of this Annual Report. 
 Competition 
 Our marketing activities compete with numerous other companies offering the same services, many of which possess larger financial and other resources than we have. Some of these competitors are other producers and affiliates of companies with extensive pipeline systems that are used for transportation from producers to end users. Other factors affecting competition are the cost and availability of alternative fuels, the level of consumer demand and the cost of and proximity to pipelines and other transportation facilities. We believe that our ability to compete effectively within the marketing segment in the future depends upon establishing and maintaining strong relationships with customers. 
 Customers 
 Our marketing customers include LNG exporters, major energy companies, utilities and industrial purchasers of natural gas. For the year ended December 31, 2022, one purchaser accounted for 17 of our revenues. A default or operational disruption on this account could have a material impact on the Company. For the year ended December 31, 2021, one purchaser accounted for 12 of our revenues. If we had completed the Indigo Merger and the GEPH Merger at the beginning of 2021, this same purchaser would have accounted for approximately 16 of our revenues. No other purchasers accounted for more than 10 of consolidated revenues. 
 Regulation 
 The transportation of natural gas, oil and NGLs is heavily regulated. FERC regulates the rates and the terms and conditions of transportation service provided by interstate natural gas, crude oil and NGL pipelines. State governments typically must authorize the construction of pipelines for intrastate service. Moreover, the rates charged for intrastate transportation by pipeline are subject to regulation by state regulatory commissions. The basis for intrastate pipeline regulation, and the degree of regulatory oversight and scrutiny given to intrastate pipeline rates, varies from state to state. Currently, all pipelines we own are intrastate and immaterial to our operations. 
 State and local permitting, zoning and land use regulations can affect the location, construction and operation of gathering and other pipelines needed to transport production to market, and the lack of new pipeline capacity can limit our ability to reach relevant markets for the sale of the commodities we produce. 
 The transportation of natural gas and oil is also subject to extensive environmental regulation. We refer you to Other Environmental Regulation in Item 1 of Part I of this Annual Report and the risk factor We, our service providers and our customers are subject to complex federal, state and local laws and regulations that could adversely affect the cost, manner or feasibility of conducting our operations or expose us to significant liabilities in Item 1A of Part I of this Annual Report for a discussion of the impact of environmental regulation on our business.

 Environmental Regulation 
 General. Our operations are subject to laws and regulations governing protection of the environment and natural resources in the jurisdictions in which we operate. These laws and regulations require permits for drilling wells and the maintenance of bonding requirements to drill or operate wells, and also regulate the spacing and location of wells, the method of drilling and casing wells, the surface use and restoration of properties upon which wells are drilled, the plugging and abandoning of wells and the prevention and cleanup of pollutants and other matters. We maintain insurance for clean-up costs in limited instances arising out of sudden and accidental events, but otherwise we may not be fully insured against all such risks. Although future environmental obligations are not expected to have a material impact on the results of our operations or financial condition, there can be no assurance that future developments, such as increasingly stringent environmental laws or enforcement thereof, will not cause us to incur material environmental liabilities or costs. 
 Failure to comply with these laws and regulations may result in the assessment of administrative, civil and criminal fines and penalties and the imposition of injunctive relief. Certain laws and legal principles can make us liable for environmental damage to properties we previously owned, and, although we generally require purchasers to assume that liability, there is no assurance that they will have sufficient funds should a liability arise. Changes in environmental laws and regulations occur frequently, and any changes may result in more stringent and costly waste handling, storage, transportation, disposal or cleanup requirements. We do not expect continued compliance with existing requirements to have a material adverse impact on us, but there can be no assurance that this will continue in the future. We refer you to Other Environmental Regulation in Item 1 of Part 1 of this Annual Report and the risk factor We, our service providers and our customers are subject to complex federal, state and local laws and regulations that could adversely affect the cost, manner or feasibility of conducting our operations or expose us to significant liabilities in Item 1A of Part I of this Annual Report for a discussion of the impact of environmental regulation on our business. 
 The following is a summary of the more significant existing environmental and worker health and safety laws and regulations to which we are subject. 
 Generation and Disposal of Wastes. The Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act, as amended, also known as CERCLA or the Superfund law, imposes liability, without regard to fault or the legality of the original conduct, on certain classes of persons that are considered to be responsible for the release of a hazardous substance into the environment. These persons include the current or former owner or operator of a site where the release occurred, as well as persons that transported or disposed, or arranged for the transportation or disposal of, the hazardous substances found at the site. Persons who are or were responsible for releases of hazardous substances under CERCLA may be subject to strict, joint and several liability for the costs of cleaning up the hazardous substances that have been released into the environment and for damages to natural resources, and it is not uncommon for neighboring landowners and other third parties to file claims for personal injury and property damage allegedly caused by the hazardous substances released into the environment. 
 The Resource Conservation and Recovery Act, as amended, or RCRA, generally does not regulate wastes generated by the exploration and production of natural gas and oil. RCRA specifically excludes from the definition of hazardous waste drilling fluids, produced waters and other wastes associated with the exploration, development or production of oil, natural gas or geothermal energy. However, legislative and regulatory initiatives have been considered from time to time that would reclassify certain natural gas and oil exploration and production wastes as hazardous wastes, which would make the reclassified wastes subject to more stringent handling, disposal and clean-up requirements. If such measures were enacted, it could have a significant impact on our operating costs. 
 The Clean Water Act, as amended, or CWA, and analogous state laws, impose restrictions and strict controls regarding the discharge of produced waters and other natural gas and oil waste into waters of the United States WOTUS ). Permits must be obtained to discharge pollutants to, and to conduct construction activities in, WOTUS. The CWA and similar state laws provide for civil, criminal and administrative penalties for any unauthorized discharges of pollutants and unauthorized discharges of reportable quantities of oil and other hazardous substances. The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency EPA has adopted regulations requiring certain natural gas and oil exploration and production facilities to obtain permits for storm water discharges. Costs may be associated with the treatment of wastewater or developing and implementing storm water pollution prevention plans. 
 The scope of federal jurisdictional reach over WOTUS has been subject to substantial revision in recent years. In 2015, the EPA and the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers Corps issued a rule defining the scope of the EPA s and the Corps jurisdiction 
 28 

Table of Contents 
 I ndex to Financial Statements 

 over WOTUS, which never took effect before being replaced by the Navigable Waters Protection Rule NWPR in 2020. A coalition of states and cities, environmental groups, and agricultural groups challenged the NWPR, which was vacated by a federal district court in August 2021. The EPA is undergoing a rulemaking process to redefine the definition of WOTUS, which could be impacted by the U.S. Supreme Court s upcoming decision in Sackett v. EPA, a case regarding the proper test in determining whether wetlands qualify as WOTUS. In the interim, the EPA is expected to finalize a new rule codifying the pre-2015 definition. In addition, in an April 2020 decision defining the scope of the CWA that was issued days after the NWPR was published, the U.S. Supreme Court held that, in certain cases, discharges from a point source to groundwater could fall within the scope of the CWA and require a permit. The Court rejected the EPA and the Corps assertion that groundwater should be totally excluded from the CWA. As a result, future implementation is uncertain at this time. 
 The Oil Pollution Act, as amended, or OPA, and regulations promulgated thereunder impose a variety of requirements on responsible parties related to the prevention of oil spills and liability for damages resulting from such spills into WOTUS. A responsible party includes the owner or operator of an onshore facility, pipeline or vessel, or the lessee or permittee of the area in which an offshore facility is located. OPA assigns liability to each responsible party for oil cleanup costs and a variety of public and private damages. Although liability limits apply in some circumstances, a party cannot take advantage of liability limits if the spill was caused by gross negligence or willful misconduct or resulted from violation of a federal safety, construction or operating regulation. If the party fails to report a spill or to cooperate fully in the cleanup, liability limits likewise do not apply. Few defenses exist to the liability imposed by OPA. OPA imposes ongoing requirements on a responsible party, including the preparation of oil spill response plans and proof of financial responsibility to cover environmental cleanup and restoration costs that could be incurred in connection with an oil spill. Oil accounted for 2 of our total production in 2022, 3 in 2021 and 4 in 2020. 
 We own or lease, and have in the past owned or leased, onshore properties that for many years have been used for or associated with the exploration for and production of natural gas and oil. Although we have utilized operating and disposal practices that were standard in the industry at the time, hydrocarbons or other wastes may have been disposed of or released on or under the properties owned or leased by us and/or on or under other locations where such wastes have been taken for disposal. In addition, some of these properties have been operated by third parties whose treatment and disposal or release of wastes was not under our control. Under CERCLA, the CWA, RCRA and analogous state laws, we could be required to remove or remediate previously disposed wastes (including waste disposed of or released by prior owners or operators) or property contamination (including groundwater contamination by prior owners or operators), or to perform remedial plugging or closure operations to prevent future contamination. 
 Air Emissions. The Clean Air Act, as amended, restricts emissions into the atmosphere. Various activities we conduct as part of our operations, such as drilling, pumping and the use of vehicles, can result in emissions to the environment. We must obtain permits, typically from local authorities, to conduct various regulated activities. Federal and state governmental agencies are taking steps to regulate methane and other emissions from oil and natural gas activities, and further regulation could increase our costs or restrict our ability to produce. For example, on November 15, 2021, the EPA issued a proposed rule under the Clean Air Act s New Source Performance Standards NSPS ), known as Subpart OOOOa, which is intended to reduce methane emissions from new and existing oil and gas sources. The proposed rule would make the existing regulations in Subpart OOOOa more stringent and create a Subpart OOOOb to expand reduction requirements for new, modified, and reconstructed oil and gas sources, including standards focusing on certain source types that have never been regulated under the Clean Air Act (including intermittent vent pneumatic controllers, associated gas, and liquids unloading facilities). In addition, the proposed rule would establish Emissions Guidelines, creating a Subpart OOOOc that would require states to develop plans to reduce methane emissions from existing sources that must be at least as effective as presumptive standards set by the EPA. Under the proposed rule, states would have three years to develop their compliance plan for existing sources and the regulations for new sources would take effect immediately upon issuance of a final rule. On November 11, 2022, the EPA issued a proposed rule supplementing the November 2021 proposed rule. Among other things, the November 2022 supplemental proposed rule removes an emissions monitoring exemption for small wellhead-only sites and creates a new third-party monitoring program to flag large emissions events, referred to in the proposed rule as super emitters . The EPA is expected to issue a final rule by May 2023. We are required to report emissions of various greenhouse gases, including methane. In addition, in August 2022, the current administration signed into law the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022. Among other things, the Inflation Reduction Act amends the Clean Air Act to include a Methane Emissions and Waste Reduction Incentive Program for petroleum and natural gas systems. This program requires the EPA to impose a waste emissions charge on certain oil and gas sources that are already required to report under the EPA s Greenhouse Gas Reporting Program. The emissions fee and funding provisions of the law could increase operating costs within the oil and gas industry and accelerate the transition away from fossil fuels, which could in turn adversely affect our business and results of operations. 
 Threatened and Endangered Species. The Endangered Species Act and comparable state laws protect species threatened with possible extinction. Similar protections are afforded to migratory birds under the Migratory Bird Treaty Act MBTA ). 
 29 

Table of Contents

 Protection of threatened and endangered species may have the effect of prohibiting or delaying us from obtaining drilling and other permits and may include restrictions on road building and other activities in areas containing the affected species or their habitats. Based on the species that have been identified and listed to date, we do not believe there are any species protected under the Endangered Species Act that would materially and adversely affect our operations at this time. To the extent species that are listed under the Endangered Species Act or similar state laws, or are protected under the MBTA, live in the areas where we operate, our ability to conduct or expand operations could be limited, or we could be forced to incur material additional costs. Moreover, our drilling activities may be delayed, restricted or precluded in protected habitat areas or during certain seasons, such as breeding and nesting seasons. The designation of previously unidentified endangered or threatened species could cause our operations to become subject to operating restrictions or bans, and limit future development activity in affected areas. In addition, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service and similar state agencies may designate critical or suitable habitat areas that they believe are necessary for the survival of threatened or endangered species. Such a designation could materially restrict use of or access to federal, state and private lands, which may reduce the profitability of our interests to the extent they are associated with such designations. 
 Hydraulic Fracturing. We utilize hydraulic fracturing in drilling wells as a means of maximizing their productivity. It is an essential and common practice in the oil and gas industry used to stimulate the production of oil, natural gas, and associated liquids from dense and deep rock formations. Hydraulic fracturing involves using water, sand, and certain chemicals to fracture the hydrocarbon-bearing rock formation to allow the flow of hydrocarbons into the wellbore. 
 In the past several years, there has been an increased focus on the environmental aspects of hydraulic fracturing, both in the United States and abroad. In the United States, hydraulic fracturing is typically regulated by state oil and natural gas commissions, but federal agencies have started to assert regulatory authority over certain aspects of the process. In addition to the EPA s Subpart OOOO regulations discussed above, the EPA finalized pretreatment standards that prohibit the indirect discharge of wastewater from onshore unconventional oil and gas extraction facilities to publicly owned treatment works. Based on our current operations and practices, management believes such rules will not have a material adverse impact on our financial position, results of operations or cash flows but these matters are subject to inherent uncertainties and management s view may change in the future. 
 In addition, there are certain governmental reviews either underway or proposed that focus on environmental aspects of hydraulic fracturing practices. A number of federal agencies are analyzing, or have been requested to review, a variety of environmental issues associated with hydraulic fracturing. For example, the EPA released a report regarding the potential impacts of hydraulic fracturing on drinking water resources, concluding that water cycle activities associated with hydraulic fracturing may impact drinking water resources under certain circumstances such as water withdrawals for fracturing in times or areas of low water availability, surface spills during the management of fracturing fluids, chemicals or produced water, injection of fracturing fluids into wells with inadequate mechanical integrity, injection of fracturing fluids directly into groundwater resources, discharge of inadequately treated fracturing wastewater to surface waters and disposal or storage of fracturing wastewater in unlined pits. The results of these studies could lead federal and state governments and agencies to develop and implement additional regulations. 
 Some states in which we operate have adopted, and other states are considering adopting, regulations that could impose more stringent permitting, public disclosure, waste disposal and well construction requirements on hydraulic fracturing operations or otherwise seek to ban fracturing activities altogether. In addition to state laws, local land use restrictions, such as city ordinances, may restrict or prohibit the performance of well drilling in general and/or hydraulic fracturing in particular. In the event state, local, or municipal legal restrictions are adopted in areas where we are currently conducting, or in the future plan to conduct, operations, we may incur additional costs to comply with such requirements that may be significant in nature, experience delays or curtailment in the pursuit of exploration, development, or production activities, and perhaps even be precluded from the drilling and/or completion of wells. 
 Increased regulation and attention given to the hydraulic fracturing process has led to greater opposition, including litigation, to oil and gas production activities using hydraulic fracturing techniques. Additional legislation or regulation could also lead to operational delays or increased operating costs in the production of oil, natural gas, and associated liquids including from the development of shale plays, or could make it more difficult to perform hydraulic fracturing. The adoption of additional federal, state or local laws or the implementation of regulations regarding hydraulic fracturing could potentially cause a decrease in the completion of new oil and gas wells and increased compliance costs and time, which could adversely affect our financial position, results of operations and cash flows. In addition, various officials and candidates at the federal, state and local levels, including past presidential candidates, have proposed banning hydraulic fracturing altogether. We refer you to the risk factor We, our service providers and our customers are subject to complex federal, state and local laws and regulations that could adversely affect the cost, manner or feasibility of conducting our operations or expose us to significant liabilities in Item 1A of Part I of this Annual Report.

 In addition, concerns have been raised about the potential for seismic activity to occur from the use of underground injection control wells, a predominant method for disposing of waste water from oil and gas activities. New rules and regulations may be developed to address these concerns, possibly limiting or eliminating the ability to use disposal wells in certain locations and increasing the cost of disposal in others. We utilize third parties to dispose of waste water associated with our operations. These third parties may operate injection wells and may be subject to regulatory restrictions relating to seismicity, which could result in increased costs for their services to dispose of waste water from our operations. 
 Greenhouse Gas Emissions and Climate Change. In response to findings regarding the potential impact of emissions of carbon dioxide, methane and other greenhouse gases on human health and the environment, the EPA has adopted regulations under existing provisions of the federal Clean Air Act that, among other things, establish Prevention of Significant Deterioration, or PSD, construction and Title V operating permit reviews for certain large stationary sources. The Company s operations are not currently impacted by said regulations. Facilities required to obtain PSD permits for their greenhouse gas emissions also will be required to meet best available control technology standards that will be established on a case-by case basis. In addition, the EPA adopted rules requiring the monitoring and reporting of greenhouse gas emissions from specified onshore and offshore oil and gas production sources in the United States on an annual basis, which includes certain of our operations. The EPA also proposed rules in November 2021 and November 2022 intended to reduce methane emissions from new and existing oil and gas sources (discussed above). EPA rulemakings related to greenhouse gas emissions could adversely affect our operations and restrict or delay our ability to obtain air permits for new or modified sources. 
 In recent years, the U.S. Congress has considered legislation to reduce emissions of greenhouse gases, including methane, a primary component of natural gas, and carbon dioxide, a byproduct of the burning of natural gas. It presently appears unlikely that comprehensive climate legislation will be passed by either house of Congress in the near future, although energy legislation and other regulatory initiatives have been proposed that are relevant to greenhouse gas emissions issues. For example, the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022, which appropriates significant federal funding for renewable energy initiatives and, for the first time ever, imposes a fee on greenhouse gas emissions from certain facilities, was signed into law in August 2022. The emissions fee and funding provisions of the law could increase operating costs within the oil and gas industry and accelerate the transitions away from fossil fuels, which could in turn adversely affect our business and results of operations. Moreover, the current administration has highlighted addressing climate change as a priority and has issued several Executive Orders addressing climate change. In addition, a number of states, including states in which we operate, have enacted or passed measures to track and reduce emissions of greenhouse gases, primarily through the planned development of greenhouse gas emission inventories and regional greenhouse gas cap-and-trade programs. Most of these cap-and-trade programs require major sources of emissions or major producers of fuels to acquire and surrender emission allowances, with the number of allowances available for purchase reduced each year until the overall greenhouse gas emission reduction goal is achieved. These reductions may cause the cost of allowances to escalate significantly over time. 
 Additionally, on March 21, 2022, the SEC issued a proposed rule regarding the enhancement and standardization of mandatory climate-related disclosures for investors. The proposed rule would require registrants to include certain climate-related disclosures in their registration statements and periodic reports, including, but not limited to, information about the registrant s governance of climate-related risks and relevant risk management processes; climate-related risks that are reasonably likely to have a material impact on the registrant s business, results of operations, or financial condition and their actual and likely climate-related impacts on the registrant s business strategy, model, and outlook; climate-related targets, goals and transition plan (if any); certain climate-related financial statement metrics in a note to their audited financial statements; Scope 1 and Scope 2 GHG emissions; and Scope 3 GHG emissions and intensity, if material, or if the registrant has set a GHG emissions reduction target, goal or plan that includes Scope 3 GHG emissions. Although the proposed rule s ultimate date of effectiveness and the final form and substance of these requirements is not yet known and the ultimate scope and impact on our business is uncertain, compliance with the proposed rule, if finalized, may result in increased legal, accounting and financial compliance costs, make some activities more difficult, time-consuming and costly, and place strain on our personnel, systems and resources. 
 The adoption and implementation of regulations that require reporting of greenhouse gases or other climate-related information, or otherwise limit emissions of greenhouse gases from our equipment and operations could require us to incur increased operating costs, including costs to monitor and report on greenhouse gas emissions, install new equipment to reduce emissions of greenhouse gases associated with our operations, acquire emissions allowances or comply with new regulatory requirements. In addition, these regulatory initiatives could drive down demand for our products, stimulating demand for alternative forms of energy that do not rely on combustion of fossil fuels that serve as a major source of greenhouse gas emissions, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. While some new laws and regulations are prompting power producers to shift from coal to natural gas, which has a positive effect on demand, regulatory incentives or requirements to conserve energy, use alternative sources or reduce greenhouse gas emissions in product supply chains could reduce demand for the products we produce.

 In December 2015, over 190 countries, including the United States, reached an agreement to reduce global greenhouse gas emissions (the Paris Agreement ). The Paris Agreement entered into effect in November 2016 after more than 70 nations, including the United States, ratified or otherwise indicated their intent to be bound by the agreement. In 2021, the United States re-joined the Paris Agreement, and publicly announced that it was setting an economy-wide target of reducing U.S. greenhouse gas emissions by 50-52 percent below 2005 levels by 2030. The United States also announced the Global Methane Pledge, a pact that aims to reduce global methane emissions at least 30 below 2020 levels by 2030, including all feasible reductions in the energy sector. Since its formal launch at the United Nations Climate Change Conference COP26 ), over 150 countries have joined the pledge. Furthermore, many state and local leaders have intensified or stated their intent to intensify efforts to support the international climate commitments. Most recently, at the 27th conference of parties, the current administration announced the EPA s supplemental proposed rule to reduce methane emissions from existing oil and gas sources, and agreed, in conjunction with the European Union and a number of other partner countries, to develop standards for monitoring and reporting methane emissions to help create a market for low methane-intensity natural gas. Various state and local governments have also publicly committed to furthering the goals of the Paris Agreement. To the extent that governmental entities in the United States or other countries implement or impose climate change regulations on the oil and gas industry, it could have an adverse effect on our business. 
 The Company is committed to responsible energy development, and we recognize stakeholder concerns about climate change. We also understand that regulations and practices aimed at protecting the environment, and specifically reducing greenhouse gas emissions, can affect our business. We consider addressing these issues as part of our risk management process. We have published an updated climate change scenario analysis as a part of our 2022 Corporate Responsibility Report (which covers the year 2021 and is not incorporated by reference into this filing). This report and our corporate responsibility reporting is informed by recommendations from the Task Force on Climate-Related Financial Disclosures framework. 
 Employee Health and Safety. Our operations are subject to a number of federal and state laws and regulations, including the federal Occupational Safety and Health Act, or OSHA, and comparable state statutes, whose purpose is to protect the health and safety of workers. In addition, the OSHA hazard communication standard, the EPA community right-to-know regulations under Title III of the federal Superfund Amendments and Reauthorization Act and comparable state statutes require that information be maintained concerning hazardous materials used or produced in operations and that this information be provided to employees, state and local government authorities and citizens. 
 Canada. Our activities in Canada have, to date, been limited to certain geological and geophysical activities and now are subject to a moratorium. If and when the moratorium ends and should we begin drilling and development activities in New Brunswick, we will be subject to Canadian federal, provincial and local environmental regulations. 
 Human Capital 
 We aim to provide a safe, healthy, respectful and fair workplace for all employees. We focus our actions to ensure our people are engaged and have the tools and skills to work safely and to be successful. Human capital management is primarily overseen by the Compensation Committee s area of risk oversight. Further, the Board s Health, Safety, Environmental Corporate Responsibility Committee is tasked with overseeing and discussing workforce safety and community concerns and assessing related risks. 
 Workplace Culture/Respect, Diversity, and Inclusion. Southwestern is committed to respect in the workplace. We believe that sound, collaborative and respectful relationships among Company employees are essential to achieving and maintaining a high level of productivity and ethical business conduct. All employees are required to participate in a program addressing workplace behavior and respect on an annual basis. We recognize that every person should be treated fairly, and that every employment-related decision should be based on merits and qualifications for a particular job, including capability, performance and reflection of our corporate mission and values. Our policy requires that all decisions regarding recruiting, hiring, training, evaluation, assignment, advancement and termination of employment are made without unlawful discrimination on the basis of race, color, national origin, ancestry, citizenship, sex, sexual orientation, gender identity or expression, religion, age, pregnancy, disability, present military status or veteran status, genetic information, marital status or any other factor that the law protects from employment discrimination. We also seek to advance workplace respect, diversity and inclusion through actively recruiting with key diversity organizations, working to build a diverse and local talent pool by encouraging diversity in science, technology, engineering and math education. During 2022, approximately 87 of our supervisors and above, including officers and executive management, attended Diversity and Inclusiveness training, which is expected to be rolled out to our entire organization during 2023. We intend to continue to support and expand diversity initiatives within our organization. 
 Our Human Rights Policy, which is consistent with the International Labour Organization s Declaration on Fundamental Principles and Rights at Work, underscores our commitment to our workforce and extends to vendors and contractors.

 Employee Engagement. Our human capital management objectives include identifying, recruiting, training, retaining, incentivizing and integrating our existing and additional employees. Our employee development programs aim to provide Company employees with the right tools, training and resources to be successful. We offer a range of development solutions targeted at meeting individual employees needs, including technical and non-technical training programs. We also measure employee engagement and enablement through a bi-annual survey, which is administered by a third-party vendor, and then work to create and implement an action plan based on feedback from the survey. 
 We aim to offer and maintain market competitive compensation and benefit programs for all of our employees in order to attract and retain superior and diverse talent. Compensation is based on several primary factors, including performance, skills, years of experience, time in position and market data. 
 Employee Health and Safety. We are focused on minimizing the risk of workplace incidents and preparing for emergencies, and strive to comply with all applicable occupational health and safety laws and regulations. Our leaders, including senior management, are evaluated in part on and held accountable for the HSE performance of their teams. HSE considerations are important factors in our business decisions, and we work to foster a true ONE Team culture, where our employees and contractors work together to uphold the same high safety standards. Our safety management approach is also articulated for all employees and contractors in our HSE Handbook, and we require employee training on the handbook and signed acknowledgment of the understanding of an agreement to follow handbook content. We provide a wide range of HSE training to fortify our safety culture, including hands-on Safety Leadership Training and our Training Assurance Program, which is a required HSE training program for all our contractors and employees working in the field. We use a robust incident management system database to track, analyze, report and follow up on HSE incidents. The goal of our incident management program is to identify trends and hazards to avoid incidents before they happen. We aim to analyze recordable incidents by type so that we can determine the most common incident types and develop targeted training. 
 As of December 31, 2022, we had 1,118 total employees, a 19 increase compared to year-end 2021. None of our employees were covered by a collective bargaining agreement at year-end 2022. We believe that our relationships with our employees are good. 
 Seasonality 
 Weather conditions and seasonality affect the demand for and prices of natural gas, oil and NGLs. Due to these fluctuations, results of operations for quarterly interim periods may not be indicative of the results realized on an annual basis.

 ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS 
 You should carefully consider the following risk factors in addition to the other information included in this Annual Report. Each of these risk factors could adversely affect our business, operating results and financial condition, as well as adversely affect the value of an investment in our common stock. 
 Risks Related to Our Business 
 Natural gas, oil and NGL prices and basis differentials greatly affect our revenues and thus profits, liquidity, growth, ability to repay our debt and the value of our assets. 
 Our revenues, profitability, liquidity, growth, ability to repay our debt and the value of our assets greatly depend on prices for natural gas, oil and NGLs. The markets for these commodities are volatile, and we expect that volatility to continue. The prices of natural gas, oil and NGLs fluctuate in response to changes in supply and demand (global, regional and local), transportation costs, market uncertainty and other factors that are beyond our control. Short- and long-term prices are subject to a myriad of factors such as: 
 overall demand, including the relative cost of competing sources of energy or fuel; 
 overall supply, including costs of production; 
 the availability, proximity and capacity of pipelines, other transportation facilities and gathering, processing and storage facilities; 
 regional basis differentials; 
 national and worldwide economic and political conditions; 
 weather conditions and seasonal trends; 
 government regulations, such as regulation of natural gas transportation and price controls; 
 inventory levels; and 
 market perceptions of future prices, whether due to the foregoing factors or others. 
 For example, in 2022 and 2021, the NYMEX settlement price for natural gas ranged from a low of 2.47 per MMBtu in January 2021 to a high of 9.35 per MMBtu in September 2022, and during these periods our production was 82 and 88 natural gas, respectively. Although we hedge a large portion of our production against changing prices, derivatives do not protect all our future volumes, may result in our forgoing profit opportunities if markets rise and, for NGLs, are not always available for substantial periods into the future. In 2022, we paid 5,283 million, net of amounts we received, in settlement of hedging arrangements due to increased commodity pricing. 
 Lower natural gas, oil and NGL prices directly reduce our revenues and thus our operating income and cash flow. Lower prices also reduce the projected profitability of further drilling and therefore are likely to reduce our drilling activity, which in turn means we will have fewer wells on production in the future. Lower prices also reduce the value of our assets, both by a direct reduction in what the production would be worth and by making some properties uneconomic, resulting in non-cash impairments to the recorded value of our reserves and non-cash charges to earnings. For example, in 2020, we reported non-cash impairment charges on our natural gas and oil properties totaling 2,825 million, primarily resulting from decreases in trailing 12-month average first-day-of-the-month natural gas prices throughout 2020, as compared to 2019. Although general commodity prices increased in 2022, further non-cash impairments in future periods could occur if the trailing 12-month commodity prices decrease as compared to the average used in prior periods. 
 As of December 31, 2022, we had 4.4 billion of debt outstanding, consisting principally of senior notes maturing in various increments from 2025 to 2032 and 250 million of borrowings under our 2022 credit facility (defined below), which matures in 2027. At current commodity price levels, our net cash flow from operations is substantially higher than our interest obligations under this debt, but significant drops in realized prices could affect our ability to pay our current obligations or refinance our debt as it becomes due. 
 Moreover, general industry conditions may make it difficult or costly to refinance increments of this debt as it matures. Although our indentures do not contain significant covenants restricting our operations and other activities, our bank credit agreements contain financial covenants with which we must comply. We refer you to the risk factor Our current and future levels of indebtedness may adversely affect our results and limit our growth. Our inability to pay our current obligations or refinance our debt as it becomes due could have a material and adverse effect on our company. A sustained drop in commodity 
 35

 prices, such as was generally experienced from 2014 to 2020, could reduce our revenues, profits and cash flow, cause us to record significant non-cash asset impairments and lead us to reduce both our level of capital investing and our workforce. 
 Significant capital investment is required to develop and replace our reserves and conduct our business. 
 Our activities require substantial capital investment, not only to expand revenues but also because production from existing wells and thus revenues decline each year. We intend to fund our future capital investing through net cash flows from operations, net of changes in working capital. Our ability to generate operating cash flow is subject to many of the risks and uncertainties that exist in our industry, some of which we may not be able to anticipate at this time. Future cash flows from operations are subject to a number of risks and variables, such as the level of production from existing wells, prices of natural gas, oil and NGLs, our success in developing and producing new reserves and the other risk factors discussed herein. If we are unable to fund capital investing, we could experience a further reduction in drilling new wells, acquiring new acreage and a loss of existing leased acreage, resulting in a decline in our cash flow from operations and natural gas, oil and NGL production and reserves. 
 If we are not able to develop and replace reserves, our production levels and thus our revenues and profits may decline. 
 Production levels from existing wells decline over time, and drilling new wells requires an inventory of leases and other rights with reserves that have not yet been drilled. Our future success depends largely upon our ability to find, develop or acquire additional natural gas, oil and NGL reserves that are economically recoverable. Unless we replace the reserves we produce through successful development, acquisition or exploration activities, our proved reserves and production will decline over time. Identifying and exploiting new reserves requires significant capital investment and successful drilling operations. Thus, our future natural gas, oil and NGL reserves and production, and therefore our revenues and profits, are highly dependent on our level of capital investments, our success in efficiently developing our current reserves and economically finding or acquiring additional recoverable reserves. 
 Our business depends on access to natural gas, oil and NGL gathering, processing and transportation systems and facilities. Changes to access and cost of these systems and facilities could adversely impact our business and financial condition. Our commitments to assure availability of transportation could lead to substantial payments for capacity we do not use if production falls below projected levels. 
 The marketability of our natural gas, oil and NGL production depends in large part on the operation, availability, proximity, capacity and expansion of transportation systems and facilities owned by third parties. For example, we can provide no assurance that sufficient transportation capacity will exist for expected production from Appalachia or Haynesville, or that we will be able to obtain sufficient transportation capacity on economic terms. During the past few years, several planned pipelines intended to service production in the Northeast United States have experienced delays in their in-service dates due to regulatory delays and litigation. 
 Producers compete by lowering their sales prices, resulting in the locational differences from NYMEX pricing. Further, a lack of available capacity on transportation systems and facilities or delays in their planned expansions could result in the shut-in of producing wells or the delay or discontinuance of drilling plans for properties. A lack of availability of these systems and facilities for an extended period of time could negatively affect our revenues. In addition, we have entered into contracts for firm transportation and any failure to renew those contracts on the same or better commercial terms could increase our costs and our exposure to the risks described above. 
 We have entered into gathering agreements in producing areas and multiple long-term firm transportation agreements relating to natural gas volumes from all our producing areas. As of December 31, 2022, our aggregate demand charge commitments under these firm transportation agreements and gathering agreements were approximately 10.4 billion. If our development programs fail to produce sufficient quantities of natural gas and ethane to fill the contracted capacity within expected timeframes, we would be required to pay demand or other charges for transportation on pipelines and gathering systems for capacity that we would not be fully utilizing. In those situations, which have occurred on a small scale at various times, we endeavor to sell or transfer that capacity to others or fill the excess capacity with production purchased from third parties. There can be no assurance that these measures will recoup the full cost of the unused transportation. 
 Strategic determinations, including the allocation of capital and other resources to strategic opportunities, are challenging in the face of shifting market conditions, and our failure to appropriately allocate capital and resources among our strategic opportunities may adversely affect our financial condition and reduce our future growth rate. 
 We necessarily must consider future price and cost environments when deciding how much capital we are likely to have available from net cash flow and how best to allocate it. Our current philosophy is to generally operate within cash flow from operations, net of changes in working capital, and to invest capital in a portfolio of projects that are projected to generate the 
 36 

Table of Contents

 highest combined Internal Rate of Return. Volatility in prices and potential errors in estimating costs, reserves or timing of production of the reserves can result in uneconomic projects or economic projects generating less than anticipated returns. 
 Certain of our undeveloped assets are subject to leases that will expire over the next several years unless production is established on units containing the acreage. 
 Approximately 52,861 and 8,823 net acres of our Appalachia and Haynesville acreage, respectively, will expire in the next three years if we do not drill successful wells to develop the acreage or otherwise take action to extend the leases. Our ability to drill wells depends on a number of factors, including certain factors that are beyond our control, such as the ability to obtain permits on a timely basis or to compel landowners or lease holders on adjacent properties to cooperate. Further, we may not have sufficient capital to drill all the wells necessary to hold the acreage without increasing our debt levels, or given price projections at the time, drilling may not be projected to achieve a sufficient return or be judged to be the best use of our capital. To the extent we do not drill the wells, our rights to acreage can be lost. 
 Our proved natural gas, oil and NGL reserves are estimates that include uncertainties. Any material changes to these uncertainties or underlying assumptions could cause the quantities and net present value of our reserves to be overstated or understated. 
 As described in more detail under Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates Natural Gas and Oil Properties in Item 7 of Part II of this Annual Report, our reserve data represents the estimates of our reservoir engineers made under the supervision of our management, and our reserve estimates are audited each year by Netherland, Sewell Associates, Inc., or NSAI, an independent petroleum engineering firm. Reserve engineering is a subjective process of estimating underground accumulations of natural gas, oil and NGLs that cannot be measured in an exact manner. The process of estimating quantities of proved reserves is complex and inherently imprecise, and the reserve data included in this document are only estimates. The process relies on interpretations of available geologic, geophysical, engineering and production data. The extent, quality and reliability of this technical data can vary. The process also requires certain economic assumptions, some of which are mandated by the SEC, such as using historic natural gas, oil and NGL prices rather than future projections. Additional assumptions include drilling and operating expenses, capital investing, taxes and availability of funds. Furthermore, different reserve engineers may make different estimates of reserves and cash flows based on the same data. 
 Results of drilling, testing and production subsequent to the date of an estimate may justify revising the original estimate. Accordingly, initial reserve estimates often vary from the quantities of natural gas, oil and NGLs that are ultimately recovered, and such variances may be material. Any significant variance could reduce the estimated quantities and present value of our reserves. 
 You should not assume that the present value of future net cash flows from our proved reserves is the current market value of our estimated natural gas, oil and NGL reserves. In accordance with SEC requirements, we base the estimated discounted future net cash flows from our proved reserves on the preceding 12-month average natural gas, oil and NGL index prices, calculated as the unweighted arithmetic average for the first day of the month price for each month and costs in effect on the date of the estimate, holding the prices and costs constant throughout the life of the properties. Actual future prices and costs may differ materially from those used in the net present value estimate, and future net present value estimates using then current prices and costs may be significantly less than the current estimate. In addition, the 10 discount factor we use when calculating discounted future net cash flows for reporting requirements in compliance with the applicable accounting standards may not be the most appropriate discount factor based on interest rates in effect from time to time and risks associated with us or the oil and gas industry in general. 
 Natural gas and oil drilling and producing and transportation operations are complex and can be hazardous and may expose us to liabilities. Incidents related to HSE performance and our asset and operating integrity could adversely impact our business and financial condition. 
 Drilling and production operations are subject to many risks, including well blowouts, cratering and explosions, pipe failures, fires, formations with abnormal pressures, uncontrollable flows of oil, natural gas, brine or well fluids, severe weather, natural disasters, groundwater contamination and other environmental hazards and risks. Some of these risks or hazards could materially and adversely affect our revenues and expenses by reducing or shutting in production from wells, loss of equipment or otherwise negatively impacting the projected economic performance of our prospects. If any of these risks occurs, we could sustain substantial losses as a result of: 
 injury or loss of life; 
 severe damage to or destruction of property, natural resources or equipment; 
 pollution or other environmental damage; 
 37

 clean-up responsibilities; 
 regulatory investigations and administrative, civil and criminal penalties; and 
 injunctions resulting in limitation or suspension of operations. 
 For our properties that we do not operate, we depend on the operator for operational and regulatory compliance. 
 We rely on third parties to transport our production to markets. Their operations, and thus our ability to reach markets, are subject to all of the risks and operational hazards inherent in transporting natural gas and ethane and natural gas compression, including: 
 damages to pipelines, facilities and surrounding properties caused by third parties, severe weather, natural disasters, including hurricanes, and acts of terrorism; 
 maintenance, repairs, mechanical or structural failures; 
 damages to, loss of availability of and delays in gaining access to interconnecting third-party pipelines; 
 disruption or failure of information technology systems and network infrastructure due to various causes, including unauthorized access or attack; and 
 leaks of natural gas or ethane as a result of the malfunction of equipment or facilities. 
 A material event such as those described above could expose us to liabilities, monetary penalties or interruptions in our business operations. Although we may maintain insurance against some, but not all, of the risks described above, our insurance may not be adequate to cover casualty losses or liabilities, and our insurance does not cover penalties or fines that may be assessed by a governmental authority. Also, in the future we may not be able to obtain insurance at premium levels that justify its purchase. 
 We have made significant investments in oilfield service businesses, including our drilling rigs, water infrastructure and pressure pumping equipment, to lower costs and secure inputs for our operations and transportation for our production. If our development and production activities are curtailed or disrupted, we may not recover our investment in these activities, which could adversely impact our results of operations. In addition, our continued expansion of these operations may adversely impact our relationships with third-party providers. 
 We also have made investments to meet certain of our field services needs, including establishing our own drilling rig operation, water transportation system in Appalachia and pressure pumping capability. If our level of operations is reduced for a long period, we may not be able to recover these investments. Further, our presence in these service and supply sectors, including competing with them for qualified personnel and supplies, may have an adverse effect on our relationships with our existing third-party service and resource providers or our ability to secure these services and resources from other providers. 
 Our business depends on the availability of water and the ability to dispose of water. Limitations or restrictions on our ability to obtain or dispose of water may have an adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. 
 Water is an essential component of drilling and hydraulic fracturing processes. Limitations or restrictions on our ability to secure sufficient amounts of water, or to dispose of or recycle water after use, could adversely impact our operations. In some cases, water may need to be obtained from new sources and transported to drilling sites, resulting in increased costs. Moreover, the introduction of new environmental initiatives and regulations related to water acquisition or waste water disposal, including produced water, drilling fluids and other wastes associated with the exploration, development or production of hydrocarbons, could limit or prohibit our ability to utilize hydraulic fracturing or waste water injection control wells. 
 In addition, concerns have been raised about the potential for seismic activity to occur from the use of underground injection control wells, a predominant method for disposing of waste water from oil and gas activities. New rules and regulations may be developed to address these concerns, possibly limiting or eliminating the ability to use disposal wells in certain locations and increasing the cost of disposal in others. We utilize third parties to dispose of waste water associated with our operations. These third parties may operate injection wells and may be subject to regulatory restrictions relating to seismicity. 
 Compliance with environmental regulations and permit requirements governing the withdrawal, storage and use of water necessary for hydraulic fracturing of wells or the disposal of water may increase our operating costs or may cause us to delay, curtail or discontinue our exploration and development plans, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.

 A large portion of our producing properties remain concentrated in the Appalachian basin, making us vulnerable to risks associated with operating in limited geographic areas. 
 A large portion of our producing properties currently are geographically concentrated in the Appalachian basin in Pennsylvania, West Virginia and Ohio. At December 31, 2022, approximately 72 of our total estimated proved reserves were attributable to properties located in the Appalachian basin. As a result, we may be disproportionately exposed to the impact of regional supply and demand factors, delays or interruptions of production from wells in this area caused by governmental regulation, state and local politics, processing or transportation capacity constraints, market limitations, availability of equipment and personnel, water shortages or interruption of the processing or transportation of natural gas, oil or NGLs. 
 Many of our business operations depend on activities performed by third parties. Changes to availability, costs and performance of personnel, products and services provided by third parties could adversely impact our business and financial condition. 
 We rely on third-party service providers to provide compression related services and to perform necessary drilling and completion, and other related operations. The ability of third-party service providers to perform such operations will depend on those service providers' ability to compete for, train, and retain qualified personnel as well as their financial condition, economic performance and ability to access capital, which in turn will depend upon the supply and demand for natural gas, oil and NGLs, prevailing economic conditions, and financial, business and other factors. These third-party service providers are also subject to various laws and regulations that could impose regulatory action that limits or suspends their ability to operate. The failure of a third-party service provider to adequately perform operations or comply with applicable laws and regulations could delay drilling or completion or reduce production from the property and adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations. 
 Changes to the ability of our customers to receive our products or meet their financial, performance and other obligations to us could adversely impact our business and financial condition. 
 In addition to credit risk related to receivables from commodity derivative contracts, our principal exposures to credit risk are through receivables resulting from the sale of our natural gas, oil and NGL production that we market to energy companies, end users and refineries 1,231 million as of December 31, 2022). We are also subject to credit risk due to concentration of receivables with several significant customers. The largest purchaser of our products during the year ended December 31, 2022 accounted for approximately 17 of our product revenues. We do not require all of our customers to post collateral. The inability or failure of our significant customers to meet their obligations to us or their insolvency or liquidation may adversely affect our financial condition. 
 Competition in the oil and natural gas industry is intense, making it more difficult for us to market natural gas, oil and NGLs, to secure trained personnel and appropriate services, to obtain additional properties and to raise capital. 
 Our cost of operations is highly dependent on third-party services, and competition for these services can be significant, especially in times when commodity prices are rising. Similarly, we compete for trained, qualified personnel, and in times of lower prices for the commodities we produce, we and other companies with similar production profiles may not be able to attract and retain this talent. Our ability to acquire and develop reserves in the future will depend on our ability to evaluate and select suitable properties and to consummate transactions in a highly competitive environment for acquiring properties, marketing natural gas, oil and NGLs and securing trained personnel. Also, there is substantial competition for capital available for investment in the oil and gas industry. Certain of our competitors may possess and employ financial, technical and personnel resources greater than ours. Those companies may be able to pay more for personnel, property and services and to attract capital at lower rates. This may become more likely if prices for oil and NGLs increase faster than prices for natural gas, as natural gas comprises a greater percentage of our overall production than it does for most of the companies with whom we compete for talent. 
 We may be unable to dispose of assets on attractive terms, and may be required to retain liabilities for certain matters. 
 Various factors could materially affect our ability to dispose of assets if and when we decide to do so, including the availability of purchasers willing to purchase the assets at prices acceptable to us, particularly in times of reduced and volatile commodity prices. Sellers typically retain liabilities for certain matters. The magnitude of any such retained liability or indemnification obligation may be difficult to quantify at the time of the transaction and ultimately may be material. Also, as is typical in divestiture transactions, third parties may be unwilling to release us from guarantees or other credit support provided prior to the sale of the divested assets. As a result, after a sale, we may remain secondarily liable for the obligations guaranteed or supported to the extent that the buyer of the assets fails to perform these obligations.

 Changes to applicable U.S. tax laws and regulations could affect our business and future profitability. 
 The elimination of certain key U.S. federal income tax deductions currently available to oil and natural gas exploration and production companies may be proposed in the future. These changes may include, among other proposals: 
 repeal of the percentage depletion allowance for natural gas and oil properties; 
 elimination of current deductions for intangible drilling and development costs; 
 elimination of the deduction for certain domestic production activities; and 
 extension of the amortization period for certain geological and geophysical expenditures. 
 The passage of any such proposals, or any similar legislation, could have an adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations and cash flows. 
 Our ability to use our net operating loss carryforwards and certain other tax attributes will be limited. 
 At December 31, 2022, we had substantial amounts of net operating loss carryforwards NOLs and other attributes for U.S. federal and state income tax purposes. Due to the issuance of common stock in 2021 associated with the Indigo Merger, we incurred a cumulative ownership change under Sections 382 and 383 of the Internal Revenue Code Code ), and as such, our NOLs and other attributes prior to the acquisition are subject to an annual limitation under Section 382 of the Code of approximately 48 million. The ownership change and resulting annual limitation will result in the expiration of NOLs or other tax attributes otherwise available. At December 31, 2022, we had approximately 4 billion of federal NOL, of which approximately 3 billion have an expiration date between 2035 and 2037 and 1 billion have an indefinite carryforward life. We currently estimate that approximately 2 billion of these federal NOLs will expire before they are able to be used. If a subsequent ownership change were to occur as a result of future transactions in our common stock, our use of remaining U.S. tax attributes may be further limited. 
 We may experience adverse or unforeseen tax consequences due to further developments affecting our deferred tax assets which could significantly affect our results of operations. 
 Deferred tax assets, including NOLs, represent future savings of taxes that would otherwise be paid in cash. As discussed above, at December 31, 2022, we had substantial amounts of NOLs for U.S. federal and state income tax purposes. Our ability to utilize our deferred tax assets is dependent on the amount of future pre-tax income that we are able to generate through our operations or sale of assets and the applicable U.S. federal income tax and foreign tax laws. If management concludes that it is more likely than not that some or all of the benefit from the deferred tax assets will not be realized, a valuation allowance will be recognized in the period that this conclusion is reached. 
 A cyber incident could result in information theft, data corruption, operational disruption and/or financial loss. 
 Our business has become increasingly dependent on digital technologies to conduct day-to-day operations, including certain development, exploration and production activities as well as processing of revenues and payments. We depend on digital technology, including information systems and related infrastructure as well as cloud applications and services, to process and record financial and operating data, analyze seismic and drilling information, conduct reservoir modeling and reserves estimation, communicate with employees and business associates, perform compliance reporting and in many other activities related to our business. Our vendors, service providers, purchasers of our production and financial institutions are also dependent on digital technology. 
 As dependence on digital technologies has increased, cyber incidents, including deliberate attacks or unintentional events, have also increased. Our technologies, systems, networks, and those of our business associates may become the target of cyber-attacks or information security breaches, which could lead to disruptions in critical systems, unauthorized release of confidential or protected information, corruption of data or other disruptions of our business operations. In addition, certain cyber incidents, such as surveillance, may remain undetected for an extended period. 
 A cyber-attack involving our information systems and related infrastructure, or that of companies with which we deal, could disrupt our business and negatively impact our operations in a variety of ways, including: 
 unauthorized access to seismic data, reserves information, strategic information or other sensitive or proprietary information could have a negative impact on our ability to compete for natural gas and oil resources; 
 unauthorized access to personal identifying information of property lessors, working interest partners, employees and vendors, which could expose us to allegations that we did not sufficiently protect that information; 
 40 

Table of Contents 
 I ndex to Financial Statements 

 data corruption or operational disruption of production infrastructure could result in loss of production, or accidental discharge; 
 a cyber-attack on a vendor or service provider could result in supply chain disruptions, which could delay or halt our major development projects; and 
 a cyber-attack on a third party gathering, pipeline or rail service provider could delay or prevent us from marketing our production, resulting in a loss of revenues. 
 These events could damage our reputation and lead to financial losses from remedial actions, loss of business or potential liability, which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations or cash flows. 
 To date we have not experienced any material losses or interruptions relating to cyber-attacks; however, there can be no assurance that we will not suffer such losses in the future. As cyber threats continue to evolve, we may be required to expend significant additional resources to continue to modify or enhance our protective measures or to investigate and remediate any information security vulnerabilities. 
 Terrorist activities could materially and adversely affect our business and results of operations. 
 Terrorist attacks and the threat of terrorist attacks, whether domestic or foreign attacks, as well as military or other actions taken in response to these acts, could cause instability in the global financial and energy markets. Continued hostilities in the Middle East and the occurrence or threat of terrorist attacks in the United States or other countries could adversely affect the global economy in unpredictable ways, including the disruption of energy supplies and markets, increased volatility in commodity prices or the possibility that the infrastructure on which we rely could be a direct target or an indirect casualty of an act of terrorism, and, in turn, could materially and adversely affect our business and results of operations. 
 The physical impacts of adverse weather may have a negative impact on our business and results of operations. 
 The physical effects of adverse weather conditions, such as increased frequency and severity of droughts, storms, floods and other climatic events, could adversely affect or delay demand for our products or cause us to incur significant costs in preparing for, or responding to, the effects of climatic events themselves. Potential adverse effects could include disruption of our production activities, including, for example, damages to our facilities from winds or floods, increases in our costs of operation or reductions in the efficiency of our operations, reducing the availability of electrical power, road accessibility, and transportation facilities, impacts on our personnel, supply chain, distribution chain or customers, as well as potentially increased costs for insurance coverages in the aftermath of such effects. Energy demand could increase or decrease as a result of extreme weather conditions depending on the duration and magnitude of the climatic event. Increased energy demand due to weather changes may require us to invest in additional equipment to serve increased demand. A decrease in energy use due to weather changes may affect our financial condition through decreased revenues. Such impacts may be proportionately more severe given the geographical concentration of our operations. Any one of these factors has the potential to have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, and cash flow. Our ability to mitigate the physical impacts of adverse weather conditions depends in part upon our disaster preparedness and response along with our business continuity planning. 
 Negative public perception regarding us and/or our industry and increasing scrutiny of ESG matters could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations and damage our reputation. 
 Negative public perception regarding us and/or our industry resulting from, among other things, concerns raised by advocacy groups about climate change, emissions, hydraulic fracturing, seismicity, oil spills and explosions of transmission lines, may lead to increased litigation risk and regulatory, legislative and judicial scrutiny, which may, in turn, lead to new state and federal safety and environmental laws, regulations, guidelines and enforcement interpretations. These actions may cause operational delays or restrictions, increased operating costs, additional regulatory burdens and increased risk of litigation. Moreover, governmental authorities exercise considerable discretion in the timing and scope of permit issuance and the public may engage in the permitting process, including through intervention in the courts. Negative public perception could cause the permits we need to conduct our operations to be withheld, delayed, or burdened by requirements that restrict our ability to profitably conduct our business. In addition, various officials and candidates at the federal, state and local levels, including some presidential candidates, have proposed banning hydraulic fracturing altogether. 
 Further, increasing attention to climate change, societal expectations on companies to address climate change, investor and societal expectations regarding voluntary ESG disclosures, generally, and fuel conservation measures, alternative fuel requirements, and increasing consumer demand for alternative forms of energy or energy efficiency initiatives or products may result in increased costs, reduced demand for our products, reduced profits, and negative impacts on our stock price and access to capital markets.

 Further, our operations, projects and growth opportunities require us to have strong relationships with various key stakeholders, including our shareholders, employees, suppliers, customers, local communities and others. We may face pressures from stakeholders, many of whom are increasingly focused on climate change, to prioritize sustainable energy practices, reduce our carbon footprint and promote sustainability while at the same time remaining a successfully operating public company. If we do not successfully manage expectations across these varied stakeholder interests, it could erode our stakeholder trust and thereby affect our brand and reputation. Such erosion of confidence could negatively impact our business through decreased demand and growth opportunities, delays in projects, increased legal action and regulatory oversight, adverse press coverage and other adverse public statements, difficulty hiring and retaining top talent, difficulty obtaining necessary approvals and permits from governments and regulatory agencies on a timely basis and on acceptable terms and difficulty securing investors and access to capital. 
 Moreover, while we create and publish voluntary disclosures regarding ESG matters from time to time, some of the statements in those voluntary disclosures may be based on hypothetical expectations and assumptions that may or may not be representative of current or actual risks or events or forecasts of expected risks or events, including the costs associated therewith. Such expectations and assumptions are necessarily uncertain and may be prone to error or subject to misinterpretation given the long timelines involved and the lack of an established single approach to identifying, measuring and reporting on many ESG matters. In addition, organizations that provide information to investors on corporate governance and related matters have developed ratings processes for evaluating companies on their approach to ESG matters. Such ratings are used by some investors to inform their investment and voting decisions. Unfavorable ESG ratings could lead to increased negative investor sentiment toward us and our industry and to the diversion of investment to other industries, which could have a negative impact on our stock price and our access to and costs of capital. In addition, failure or a perception (whether or not valid) of failure to implement our ESG strategy or achieve sustainability goals, and targets we have to set, could damage our reputation, causing our investors or consumers to lose confidence in our Company and brands, and negatively impact our operations. Our continuing efforts to research, establish, accomplish and accurately report on the implementation of our ESG strategy, including any ESG goals, may also create additional operational risks and expenses and expose us to reputational, legal and other risks. 
 Developments related to climate change may have a material and adverse effect on us. 
 Governmental and regulatory bodies, investors, consumers, industry and other stakeholders have been increasingly focused on combatting the effects of climate change. This focus, together with changes in consumer and industrial/commercial behavior, preferences and attitudes with respect to the generation and consumption of energy, petroleum products and the use of products manufactured with, or powered by, petroleum products, may in the long-term result in (i) the enactment of climate change-related regulations, policies and initiatives (at the government, regulator, corporate and/or investor community levels), including alternative energy requirements, new fuel consumption standards, energy conservation and emissions reductions measures and responsible energy development, (ii) technological advances with respect to the generation, transmission, storage and consumption of energy (e.g., wind, solar and hydrogen power, smart grid technology and battery technology, increasing efficiency) and (iii) increased availability of, and increased consumer and industrial/commercial demand for, alternative energy sources and products manufactured with, or powered by, alternative energy sources (e.g., electric vehicles and renewable residential and commercial power supplies). These developments may in the future adversely affect the demand for products manufactured with, or powered by, petroleum products and the demand for, and in turn the prices of, the natural gas, crude oil, and NGLs that we sell. Such developments may also adversely impact, among other things, the availability to us of necessary third-party services and facilities that we rely on, which may increase our operational costs and adversely affect our ability to successfully carry out our business strategy. Climate change-related developments may impact the market prices of or our access to raw materials such as energy and water and therefore result in increased costs to our business. For further discussion regarding the impact of commodity prices (including fluctuations in commodity prices) on our financial condition, cash flows and results of operations, see the risk factor entitled Natural gas, oil and NGL prices and basis differentials greatly affect our revenues and thus profits, liquidity, growth, ability to repay our debt and the value of our assets. 
 Further, climate change-related developments may result in negative perceptions of the traditional oil and gas industry and, in turn, reputational risks, including perceptions regarding the sufficiency of our ESG program associated with exploration and production activities. Such negative perceptions and reputational risks may in the future adversely affect our ability to successfully carry out our business strategy, for example, by adversely affecting the availability and cost to us of capital. There have been efforts in recent years, for example, to influence the investment community, including investment advisors, insurance companies, and certain sovereign wealth, pension and endowment funds and other groups, by promoting divestment of fossil fuel equities and pressuring lenders to limit funding and insurance underwriters to limit coverages to companies engaged in the extraction of fossil fuel reserves. Financial institutions may elect in the future to shift some or all of their investment into non-fossil fuel related sectors. There is also a risk that financial institutions may be required to adopt policies that have the effect of reducing the funding provided to the fossil fuel sector. Certain investment banks and asset managers based both domestically and internationally have announced that they are adopting climate change guidelines for their banking and investing activities.

 Institutional lenders who provide financing to energy companies have also become more attentive to sustainable lending practices, and some may elect not to provide traditional energy producers or companies that support such producers with funding. Ultimately, the foregoing factors could make it more difficult to secure funding for exploration and production activities or adversely impact the cost of capital for both us and our customers, and could thereby adversely affect the demand and price of our securities. Limitation of investments in and financings for energy companies could also result in the restriction, delay or cancellation of infrastructure projects and energy production activities. For further discussion of the potential impact of such risks on our financial condition, cash flows and results of operations, see the discussion below in this section and in the section below entitled Risks Related to our Business . 
 In addition, the enactment of climate change-related regulations, policies and initiatives (at the government, corporate and/or investor community levels) may in the future result in increases in our compliance costs and other operating costs and have other adverse effects (e.g., greater potential for governmental investigations or litigation). For further discussion regarding the risks to us of climate change-related regulations, policies and initiatives, see the discussion below in the section entitled Risks Related to Governmental Regulation . 
 Furthermore, claims have been made against certain energy companies alleging that greenhouse gas emissions from oil and natural gas operations constitute a public nuisance under federal and/or state common law, or alleging that the companies have been aware of the adverse effects of climate change for some time but failed to adequately disclose such impacts to their investors or customers. As a result, private individuals or public entities may seek to enforce environmental laws and regulations against us and could allege personal injury, property damages or other liabilities. While our business is not a party to any such litigation, we could be named in actions making similar allegations. An unfavorable ruling in any such case could significantly impact our operations and could have an adverse impact on our financial condition. 
 Judicial decisions can affect our rights and obligations. 
 Our ability to develop gas, oil and NGLs depends on the leases and other mineral rights we acquire and the rights of owners of nearby properties. We operate in areas where judicial decisions have not yet definitively interpreted various contractual provisions or addressed relevant aspects of property rights, nuisance and other matters that could be the source of claims against us as a developer or operator of properties. Although we plan our activities according to our expectations of these unresolved areas, based on decisions on similar issues in these jurisdictions and decisions from courts in other states that have addressed them, courts could resolve issues in ways that increase our liabilities or otherwise restrict or add costs to our operations. 
 Common stockholders will be diluted if additional shares are issued. 
 We endeavor to create value for our stockholders on a per share basis. From time to time we have issued stock to raise capital for our business or as consideration for acquisitions. We also issue restricted stock, options and performance share units to our employees and directors as part of their compensation. In addition, we may issue additional shares of common stock, additional notes or other securities or debt convertible into common stock, to extend maturities or fund capital expenditures. If we issue additional shares of our common stock in the future, it may have a dilutive effect on our current outstanding stockholders. 
 Anti-takeover provisions in our organizational documents and under Delaware law may impede or discourage a takeover, which could cause the market price of our common stock to decline. 
 We are a Delaware corporation, and the anti-takeover provisions of Delaware law impose various impediments to the ability of a third party to acquire control of us, even if a change in control would be beneficial to our existing stockholders, which, under certain circumstances, could reduce the market price of our common stock. In addition, protective provisions in our Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation and Amended and Restated Bylaws or the implementation by our Board of Directors of a stockholder rights plan that could deter a takeover. 
 Loss of our key executive officers or other personnel, or an inability to attract and retain such officers and personnel, could negatively affect our business. 
 Our future success depends on the skills, experience and efforts of our key executive officers. The sudden loss of any of these executives services or our failure to appropriately plan for any expected key executive succession could materially and adversely affect our business and prospects, as we may not be able to find suitable individuals to replace them on a timely basis, if at all. Additionally, we also depend on our ability to attract and retain qualified personnel to operate and expand our business. Workers may choose to pursue employment with our competitors or in other fields; this competition has become exacerbated by the increase in employee resignations currently taking place throughout the United States. If we fail to attract or retain talented new employees, our business and results of operations could be negatively affected.

 A pandemic, such as COVID-19, may negatively affect our business, operating results and financial condition. 
 As a result of a pandemic, such as COVID-19, we may experience in the future, among other things, a reduction in demand for natural gas, oil, NGLs and other products derived therefrom, and may experience in the future reduced availability of personnel, equipment and services critical to our ability to operate our properties, which could in the future adversely impact, our business, results of operations and overall financial performance. 
 Risks Related to our Indebtedness and Financing Abilities 
 A downgrade in our credit rating could negatively impact our cost of and ability to access capital and our liquidity. 
 Actual or anticipated changes or downgrades in our credit ratings, including any announcement that our ratings are under review for a downgrade, could impact our ability to access debt markets in the future to refinance existing debt or obtain additional funds, affect the market value of our senior notes and increase our borrowing costs. Such ratings are limited in scope, and do not address all material risks relating to us, but rather reflect only the view of each rating agency of the likelihood we will be able to repay our debt at the time the rating is issued. An explanation of the significance of each rating may be obtained from the applicable rating agency. As of February 21, 2023, our long-term issuer ratings were Ba1 by Moody s, BB+ by Standard and Poor s and BB+ by Fitch Investor Services. There can be no assurance that such credit ratings will remain in effect for any given period of time or that such ratings will not be lowered, suspended or withdrawn entirely by the rating agencies, if, in each rating agency s judgment, circumstances so warrant. 
 Actual downgrades in our credit ratings may also impact our interest costs and liquidity. The interest rates under certain of our senior notes increases as credit ratings fall. Many of our existing commercial contracts contain, and future commercial contracts may contain, provisions permitting the counterparty to require increased security upon the occurrence of a downgrade in our credit rating. Providing additional security, such as posting letters of credit, could reduce our available cash or our liquidity under our 2022 credit facility for other purposes. We had 110 million of letters of credit outstanding at December 31, 2022. The amount of additional financial assurance would depend on the severity of the downgrade from the credit rating agencies, and a downgrade could result in a decrease in our liquidity. 
 Our current and future levels of indebtedness may adversely affect our results and limit our growth. 
 At December 31, 2022, we had total indebtedness of 4.4 billion. The terms of the indentures governing our outstanding senior notes, our credit facilities, and the lease agreements relating to our drilling rigs, other equipment and headquarters building, which we collectively refer to as our financing agreements, impose restrictions on our ability and, in some cases, the ability of our subsidiaries to take a number of actions that we may otherwise desire to take, which may include, without limitation, one or more of the following: 
 incurring additional debt; 
 redeeming stock or redeeming certain debt; 
 making certain investments; 
 creating liens on our assets; and 
 selling assets. 
 The revolving credit facility we entered into in April 2022, as amended (our 2022 credit facility ), contains customary representations, warranties and covenants including, among others, the following covenants: 
 a prohibition against incurring debt, subject to permitted exceptions; 
 a restriction on creating liens on assets, subject to permitted exceptions; 
 restrictions on mergers and asset dispositions; 
 restrictions on use of proceeds, investments, declaring dividends, repurchasing junior debt, transactions with affiliates, or change of principal business; and 
 maintenance of the following financial covenants, commencing with the fiscal quarter ended March 31, 2022: 
 1. Minimum current ratio of no less than 1.00 to 1.00, whereby current ratio is defined as the Company s consolidated current assets (including unused commitments under the credit agreement, but excluding non-cash derivative assets) to consolidated current liabilities (excluding non-cash derivative obligations and current maturities of long-term debt). 
 44

 2. Maximum total net leverage ratio of not greater than, with respect to the prior four fiscal quarters ending on or after March 31, 2022, 4.00 to 1.00. Total net leverage ratio is defined as total debt less cash on hand (up to the lesser of 10 of credit limit or 150 million) divided by consolidated EBITDAX for the last four consecutive quarters. EBITDAX, as defined in the credit agreement governing the Company s 2022 credit facility, excludes the effects of interest expense, depreciation, depletion and amortization, income tax, any non-cash impacts from impairments, certain non-cash hedging activities, stock-based compensation expense, non-cash gains or losses on asset sales, unamortized issuance cost, unamortized debt discount and certain restructuring costs. 
 As of December 31, 2022, we were in compliance with all of the covenants of our 2022 credit facility. Our ability to comply with these financial covenants depends in part on the success of our development program and upon factors beyond our control, such as the market prices for natural gas, oil and NGLs. 
 Our level of indebtedness and off-balance sheet obligations, and the covenants contained in our financing agreements, could have important consequences for our operations, including: 
 requiring us to dedicate a substantial portion of our cash flow from operations to required payments, thereby reducing the availability of cash flow for working capital, capital investing and other general business activities; 
 limiting our ability to obtain additional financing in the future for working capital, capital investing, acquisitions and general corporate and other activities; 
 limiting our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our business and the industry in which we operate; and 
 detracting from our ability to successfully withstand a downturn in our business or the economy generally. 
 Any significant reduction in the borrowing base under our 2022 credit facility may negatively impact our ability to fund our operations, and we may not have sufficient funds to repay borrowings under our 2022 credit facility if required as a result of a borrowing base redetermination. 
 The amount we may borrow under our 2022 credit facility is capped at the lower of the total of our bank commitments and a borrowing base determined from time to time by the lenders based on our reserves, market conditions and other factors. As of December 31, 2022, the borrowing base was reaffirmed at 3.5 billion in September 2022, and total aggregate commitments were comprised of elected five-year revolving commitments of 2.0 billion (the Five-Year Tranche and elected short-term commitments of 500 million (the Short-Term Tranche ). The borrowing base is subject to scheduled semiannual and other elective collateral borrowing base redeterminations based on our natural gas, oil and NGL reserves and other factors. As of December 31, 2022, we had 250 million of outstanding borrowings under the Five-Year Tranche and no borrowings under the Short-Term Tranche. We do not anticipate borrowing under the Short-Term Tranche. As of December 31, 2022, we had 110 million of letters of credit issued under the 2022 credit facility and unused borrowing capacity was approximately 2.1 billion which exceeds our currently modeled needs. Any significant reduction in our borrowing base as a result of borrowing base redeterminations or otherwise may negatively impact our liquidity and our ability to fund our operations and, as a result, may have a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operation and cash flow. Further, if the outstanding borrowings under our 2022 credit facility were to exceed the borrowing base as a result of any such redetermination or other reasons, we would be required to repay the excess within a brief period. We may not have sufficient funds to make such repayments. If we do not have sufficient funds and we are otherwise unable to negotiate renewals of our borrowings or arrange new financing, we may have to sell significant assets. Any such sale could have a material adverse effect on our business and financial results. 
 Our ability to comply with the covenants and other restrictions in our financing agreements may be affected by events beyond our control, including prevailing economic and financial conditions. 
 Failure to comply with the covenants and other restrictions could lead to an event of default and the acceleration of our obligations under our senior notes, credit facilities or other financing agreements, and in the case of the lease agreements for drilling rigs, compressors and pressure pumping equipment, loss of use of the equipment. In particular, the occurrence of risks identified elsewhere in this section, such as declines in commodity prices, increases in basis differentials and inability to access markets, could reduce our profits and thus the cash we have to fulfill our financial obligations. If we are unable to satisfy our obligations with cash on hand, we could attempt to refinance such debt, sell assets or repay such debt with the proceeds from an equity offering. We cannot assure that we will be able to generate sufficient cash flow to pay the interest on our debt, to meet our lease obligations, or that future borrowings, equity financings or proceeds from the sale of assets will be available to pay or refinance such debt or obligations. The terms of our financing agreements may also prohibit us from taking such actions. Factors that will affect our ability to raise cash through an offering of our capital stock, a refinancing of our debt or a sale of assets include financial market conditions and our market value and operating performance at the time of such offering or other financing. We cannot assure that any such proposed offering, refinancing or sale of assets can be successfully completed or, if completed, that the terms will be favorable to us.

 Risks Related to Governmental Regulation 
 Climate change legislation or regulations governing the emissions of greenhouse gases could result in increased operating costs and reduce demand for the natural gas, oil and NGLs we produce, and concern in financial and investment markets over greenhouse gasses and fossil fuel production could adversely affect our access to capital and the price of our common stock. 
 In response to findings regarding the potential impact of emissions of carbon dioxide, methane and other greenhouse gases on human health and the environment, the EPA has adopted regulations under existing provisions of the federal Clean Air Act that, among other things, establish Prevention of Significant Deterioration, or PSD, construction and Title V operating permit reviews for certain large stationary sources. Facilities required to obtain PSD permits for their greenhouse gas emissions also will be required to meet best available control technology standards that will be established on a case-by-case basis. EPA rulemakings related to greenhouse gas emissions could adversely affect our operations and restrict or delay our ability to obtain air permits for new or modified sources. 
 The EPA also has adopted rules requiring the monitoring and reporting of greenhouse gas emissions from specified onshore and offshore natural gas and oil production sources in the United States on an annual basis, which include certain of our operations. In June 2016, the EPA finalized regulations establishing NSPS, known as Subpart OOOOa, for methane and volatile organic compounds from new and modified oil and natural gas production and natural gas processing and transmission facilities. In September 2020, the EPA finalized two sets of amendments to the 2016 Subpart OOOOa standards. The first, known as the 2020 Technical Rule, reduced the 2016 rule's fugitive emissions monitoring requirements and expanded exceptions to pneumatic pump requirements, among other changes. The second, known as the 2020 Policy Rule, rescinded the methane-specific requirements for certain oil and natural gas sources in the production and processing segments. On January 20, 2021, the current administration issued an Executive Order directing the EPA to rescind the 2020 Technical Rule by September 2021 and consider revising the 2020 Policy Rule. On June 30, 2021, the current administration signed a Congressional Review Act CRA resolution passed by Congress that revoked the 2020 Policy Rule. The CRA resolution did not address the 2020 Technical Rule. 
 Further, on November 15, 2021, the EPA issued a proposed rule intended to reduce methane emissions from new and existing oil and gas sources. The proposed rule would make the existing regulations in Subpart OOOOa more stringent and create a Subpart OOOOb to expand reduction requirements for new, modified, and reconstructed oil and gas sources, including standards focusing on certain source types that have never been regulated under the Clean Air Act (including intermittent vent pneumatic controllers, associated gas, and liquids unloading facilities). In addition, the proposed rule would establish Emissions Guidelines, creating a Subpart OOOOc that would require states to develop plans to reduce methane emissions from existing sources that must be at least as effective as presumptive standards set by the EPA. Under the proposed rule, states would have three years to develop their compliance plan for existing sources and the regulations for new sources would take effect immediately upon issuance of a final rule. On November 11, 2022, the EPA issued a proposed rule supplementing the November 2021 proposed rule. Among other things, the November 2022 supplemental rule removes an emissions monitoring exemption for small wellhead-only sites and creates a new third-party monitoring program to flag large emissions events, referred to in the proposed rule as super emitters . The EPA is expected to issue a final rule by May 2023. As a result of these regulatory changes, the scope of any final methane regulations or the costs for complying with federal methane regulations are uncertain. 
 In recent years, the U.S. Congress has considered legislation to reduce emissions of greenhouse gases, including methane, a primary component of natural gas, and carbon dioxide, a byproduct of the burning of natural gas. It presently appears unlikely that comprehensive climate legislation will be passed by either house of Congress in the near future, although energy legislation and other regulatory initiatives have been proposed that are relevant to greenhouse gas emissions issues. For example, the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022, which appropriates significant funding for renewable energy initiatives and, for the first time ever, imposes a fee on greenhouse gas emissions from certain facilities, was signed into law in August 2022. Moreover, the current administration has highlighted addressing climate change as a priority of his administration and has issued several Executive Orders addressing climate change. In addition, a number of states, including states in which we operate, have enacted or passed measures to track and reduce emissions of greenhouse gases, primarily through the planned development of greenhouse gas emission inventories and regional greenhouse gas cap-and-trade programs. Most of these cap-and-trade programs require major sources of emissions or major producers of fuels to acquire and surrender emission allowances, with the number of allowances available for purchase reduced each year until the overall greenhouse gas emission reduction goal is achieved. These reductions may cause the cost of allowances to escalate significantly over time. 
 The adoption and implementation of regulations that require reporting of greenhouse gases or other climate-related information (such as the SEC s Proposed Rules to Enhance and Standardize Climate-Related Disclosures for Investors, discussed below), or otherwise seek to limit emissions of greenhouse gases from our equipment and operations could require us to incur increased operating costs, including costs to monitor and report on greenhouse gas emissions, install new equipment to reduce emissions of greenhouse gases associated with our operations, acquire emissions allowances or comply with new 
 46

 regulatory requirements. In addition, these regulatory initiatives could drive down demand for our products, stimulating demand for alternative forms of energy that do not rely on combustion of fossil fuels that serve as a major source of greenhouse gas emissions, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. While some new laws and regulations are prompting power producers to shift from coal to natural gas, which has a positive effect on demand, regulatory incentives or requirements to conserve energy, use alternative sources or reduce greenhouse gas emissions in product supply chains could reduce demand for the products we produce. 
 Additionally, the SEC issued a proposed rule in March 2022 that would mandate extensive disclosure of climate-related data, risks, and opportunities, including financial impacts, physical and transition risks, related governance and strategy, and GHG emissions, for certain public companies. We cannot predict the costs of implementation or any potential adverse impacts resulting from the rulemaking. To the extent this rulemaking is finalized as proposed, we could incur increased costs relating to the assessment and disclosure of climate-related risks. We may also face increased litigation risks related to disclosures made pursuant to the rule if finalized as proposed. In addition, enhanced climate disclosure requirements could accelerate the trend of certain stakeholders and lenders restricting or seeking more stringent conditions with respect to their investments in certain carbon-intensive sectors. 
 In December 2015, over 190 countries, including the United States, reached an agreement to reduce global greenhouse gas emissions. The Paris Agreement was entered into in November 2016 after more than 70 nations, including the United States, ratified or otherwise indicated their intent to be bound by the agreement. In 2021, the United States rejoined the Paris Agreement and announced that it was setting an economy-wide target of reducing U.S. greenhouse gas emissions by 50-52 percent below 2005 levels by 2030. The United States also publicly announced the Global Methane Pledge, a pact that aims to reduce global methane emissions at least 30 below 2020 levels by 2030. Since its formal launch at the United Nations Climate Change Conference (COP26), over 150 countries have joined the pledge. Furthermore, many state and local leaders have intensified or stated their intent to intensify efforts to support the international climate commitments. Most recently, at the 27th conference of parties, the current administration announced the EPA s supplemental proposed rule to reduce methane emissions from existing oil and gas sources, and agreed, in conjunction with the European Union and a number of other partner countries, to develop standards for monitoring and reporting methane emissions to help create a market for low methane-intensity natural gas. Various state and local governments have also publicly committed to furthering the goals of the Paris Agreement. To the extent that governmental entities in the United States or other countries implement or impose climate change regulations on the oil and natural gas industry, or that investors insist on compliance regardless of legal requirements, it could have an adverse effect on our business. 
 We, our service providers and our customers are subject to complex federal, state and local laws and regulations that could adversely affect the cost, manner or feasibility of conducting our operations or expose us to significant liabilities. 
 Our development and production operations and the transportation of our products to market are subject to complex and stringent federal, state and local laws and regulations, including those governing protection of the environment and natural resources, the occupational health and safety aspects of our operations, the discharge of materials into the environment, and the protection of certain plant and animal species. See Other Environmental Regulation in Item 1 of Part I of this Annual Report for a description of the laws and regulations that affect us. These laws and regulations require us, our service providers and our customers to obtain and maintain numerous permits, approvals and certificates from various federal, state and local governmental authorities. Environmental regulations may restrict the types, quantities and concentration of materials that may be released into the environment in connection with drilling and production activities, limit or prohibit drilling or transportation activities on certain lands lying within wilderness, wetlands, archeological sites and other protected areas, and impose substantial liabilities for pollution resulting from our operations and those of our service providers and customers. Moreover, we or they may experience delays in obtaining or be unable to obtain required permits, including as a result of government shutdowns, which may delay or interrupt our or their operations and limit our growth and revenues. 
 Failure to comply with laws and regulations can trigger a variety of administrative, civil and criminal enforcement measures, including investigatory actions, the assessment of monetary penalties, the imposition of remedial requirements, or the issuance of orders or judgments limiting or enjoining future operations. Strict liability or joint and several liability may be imposed under certain laws, which could cause us to become liable for the conduct of others or for consequences of our own actions. Moreover, our costs of compliance with existing laws could be substantial and may increase or unforeseen liabilities could be imposed if existing laws and regulations are revised or reinterpreted, or if new laws and regulations become applicable to our operations. If we are not able to recover the increased costs through insurance or increased revenues, our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows could be adversely affected.

 Risks Related to Financial Markets and Uncertainties 
 The trading price and volume of our common stock may be volatile, and you could lose a significant portion of your investment. 
 The market price of the common stock could be volatile, and holders of common stock may not be able to resell their common stock at or above the price at which they acquired such securities due to fluctuations in the market price of common stock. The stock markets in general have experienced extreme volatility that has often been unrelated to the operating performance of particular companies. These broad market fluctuations may adversely affect the trading price of the common stock. Specific factors that may have a significant effect on the market price for our common stock include: 
 general economic conditions within the U.S. and internationally, including inflationary pressures and changes in interest rates; 
 general market conditions, including fluctuations in commodity prices; 
 domestic and international economic, legal and regulatory factors unrelated to our performance; 
 changes in oil and natural gas prices; 
 volatility in the financial markets or other global economic factors, including the impact of COVID-19; 
 actual or anticipated fluctuations in our and our competitors quarterly and annual results; 
 quarterly variations in the rate of growth of our financial indicators; 
 our business, operations, results and prospects; 
 our operating and financial performance; 
 future mergers and acquisitions, divestitures, joint ventures or similar strategic alliances; 
 market conditions in the energy industry; 
 changes in government regulation, taxes, legal proceedings or other developments; 
 shortfalls in our operating results from levels forecasted by securities analysts; 
 investor sentiment toward the stock of oil and gas companies; 
 changes in revenue or earnings estimates, or changes in recommendations by equity research analysts; 
 failure to achieve the perceived benefits of the acquisitions, including financial results and anticipated synergies, as rapidly as or to the extent anticipated by financial or industry analysts; 
 speculation in the press or investment community; 
 the failure of research analysts to cover our stock; 
 sales of common stock by us, large shareholders or management, or the perception that such sales may occur; 
 changes in accounting principles, policies, guidance, interpretations or standards; 
 announcements concerning us or our competitors; 
 public reaction to our press releases, other public announcements and filings with the SEC; 
 strategic actions taken by competitors; 
 actions taken by our shareholders; 
 additions or departures of key management personnel; 
 maintenance of acceptable credit ratings or credit quality; and 
 the general state of the securities markets. 
 These and other factors may impair the market for the common stock and the ability of investors to sell shares at an attractive price. These factors also could cause the market price and demand for the common stock to fluctuate substantially, which may negatively affect the price and liquidity of the common stock. Many of these factors and conditions are beyond our control. 
 Securities class action litigation has often been instituted against companies following periods of volatility in the overall market and in the market price of a company s securities. Such litigation, if instituted against us, could result in very substantial costs, divert management s attention and resources and harm our business, operating results and financial condition.

 Market views of our industry generally can affect our stock price, liquidity and ability to obtain financing. 
 Factors described elsewhere, including views regarding future commodity prices, regulation and climate change, can affect the amount investors choose to invest in our industry generally. Recent years have seen a significant reduction in overall investment in exploration and production companies, resulting in a drop in individual companies stock prices. Separate from actual and possible governmental action, certain financial institutions have announced policies to cease investing or to divest investments in companies, such as ours, that produce fossil fuels, and some banks have announced they no longer will lend to companies in this sector. To date these represent small fractions of overall sources of equity and debt, but that fraction could grow and thus affect our access to capital. Moreover, some equity investors are expressing concern over these matters and may prompt companies in our industry to adopt more costly practices even absent governmental action. Although we believe our practices result in low emission rates for methane and other greenhouse gases as compared to others in our industry, complying with investor sentiment may require modifications to our practices, which could increase our capital and operating expenses. 
 Volatility in the financial markets or in global economic factors could adversely impact our business and financial condition. 
 Our business may be negatively impacted by adverse economic conditions or future disruptions in global financial markets. Included among these potential negative impacts are reduced energy demand and lower commodity prices, including due to the impact of pandemics like COVID-19, increased difficulty in collecting amounts owed to us by our customers and reduced access to credit markets. Our ability to access the capital markets may be restricted at a time when we would like, or need, to raise financing. If financing is not available when needed, or is available only on unfavorable terms, we may be unable to implement our business plans or otherwise take advantage of business opportunities or respond to competitive pressures. Historically, the United States and global economies and financial systems have experienced extreme volatility in prices of equity and debt securities, periods of diminished liquidity and credit availability, inability to access capital markets, the bankruptcy, failure, collapse, or sale of financial institutions, inflation, and an unprecedented level of intervention by the United States federal government and other governments. Weakness or uncertainty in the United States economy or other large economies could materially adversely affect our business and financial condition. 
 Any changes in U.S. trade policy could trigger retaliatory actions by affected countries, resulting in trade wars, in increased costs for materials necessary for our industry along with other goods imported into the United States, which may reduce customer demand for these products if the parties having to pay those tariffs increase their prices, or in trading partners limiting their trade with the United States. If these consequences are realized, the volume of economic activity in the United States, including growth in sectors that utilize our products, may be materially reduced along with a reduction in the potential export of our products. Such a reduction may materially and adversely affect commodity prices, our sales and our business. 
 Risks Related to the Ability of our Hedging Activities to Adequately Manage our Exposure to Commodity and Financial Risk 
 Our commodity price risk management and measurement systems and economic hedging activities might not be effective and could increase the volatility of our results. 
 We currently seek to hedge the price of a significant portion of our estimated production through swaps, collars, floors and other derivative instruments. The systems we use to quantify commodity price risk associated with our businesses might not always be effective. Further, such systems do not in themselves manage risk, particularly risks outside of our control, and adverse changes in energy commodity market prices, volatility, adverse correlation of commodity prices, the liquidity of markets, changes in interest rates and other risks discussed in this report might still adversely affect our earnings, cash flows and balance sheet under applicable accounting rules, even if risks have been identified. Furthermore, no single hedging arrangement can adequately address all risks present in a given contract. For example, a forward contract that would be effective in hedging commodity price volatility risks would not hedge the contract s counterparty credit or performance risk. Therefore, unhedged risks will always continue to exist. 
 Our use of derivatives, through which we attempt to reduce the economic risk of our participation in commodity markets could result in increased volatility of our reported results. Changes in the fair values (gains and losses) of derivatives that qualify as hedges under GAAP to the extent that such hedges are not fully effective in offsetting changes to the value of the hedged commodity, as well as changes in the fair value of derivatives that do not qualify or have not been designated as hedges under GAAP, must be recorded in our income. This creates the risk of volatility in earnings even if no economic impact to us has occurred during the applicable period. To the extent we cap or lock prices at specific levels, we would also forgo the ability to realize the higher revenues that would be realized should prices increase. 
 The impact of changes in market prices for natural gas, oil and NGLs on the average prices paid or received by us may be reduced based on the level of our hedging activities. These hedging arrangements may limit or enhance our margins if the market

 prices for oil, natural gas or NGLs were to change substantially from the price established by the hedges. In addition, our hedging arrangements expose us to the risk of financial loss if our production volumes are less than expected. 
 The implementation of derivatives legislation could have an adverse effect on our ability to use derivative instruments to reduce the effect of commodity price, interest rate and other risks associated with our business. 
 The Dodd-Frank Act established federal oversight and regulation of the over-the-counter derivatives market and entities, including us, which participate in that market. The Dodd-Frank Act requires the CFTC, the SEC, and other regulatory authorities to promulgate rules and regulations implementing the Dodd-Frank Act. Although the CFTC has finalized most of its regulations under the Dodd-Frank Act, it continues to review and refine its initial rulemakings through additional interpretations and supplemental rulemakings. As a result, it is not possible at this time to predict the ultimate effect of the rules and regulations on our business and while most of the regulations have been adopted, any new regulations or modifications to existing regulations may increase the cost of derivative contracts, limit the availability of derivatives to protect against risks that we encounter, reduce our ability to monetize or restructure our existing derivative contracts, and increase our exposure to less creditworthy counterparties. If we reduce our use of derivatives as a result of the Dodd-Frank Act and the regulations thereunder, our results of operations may become more volatile and our cash flows may be less predictable, which could adversely affect our ability to plan for and fund capital investing. 
 In January 2020, the CFTC proposed new amended regulations that would place federal limits on positions in certain core futures and equivalent swaps contracts for or linked to certain physical commodities, subject to exceptions for certain bona fide hedging transactions. These rules were finalized in January of 2021 with compliance dates as early as January 1, 2022 for certain positions. In 2016, the CFTC finalized a companion rule on aggregation of positions among entities under common ownership or control. It is too early to determine the precise effect of these rules on our business, but they may have an impact on our ability to hedge our exposure to certain enumerated commodities (whether using futures contracts, over-the-counter derivatives contracts or otherwise). 
 The CFTC has designated certain interest rate swaps and credit default swaps for mandatory clearing and mandatory trading on designated contract markets or swap execution facilities. The CFTC may designate additional classes of swaps as subject to the mandatory clearing requirement in the future, but has not yet proposed rules designating any other classes of swaps, including physical commodity swaps, for mandatory clearing. The CFTC and prudential banking regulators also adopted mandatory margin requirements on uncleared swaps between swap dealers and certain other counterparties. The margin requirements are currently effective with respect to certain market participants and will be phased in over time with respect to other market participants, based on the level of an entity s swaps activity. We expect to qualify for and rely upon an end-user exception from the mandatory clearing and trade execution requirements for swaps entered to hedge our commercial risks. We also should qualify for an exception from the uncleared swaps margin requirements. However, the application of the mandatory clearing and trade execution requirements and the uncleared swaps margin requirement to other market participants, such as swap dealers, may adversely affect the cost and availability of the swaps that we use for hedging.

 During 2022, we were required to file Form 23, Annual Survey of Domestic Oil and Gas Reserves, with the U.S. Department of Energy. The basis for reporting reserves on Form 23 is not comparable to the reserve data included in Supplemental Oil and Gas Disclosures in Item 8 of Part II of this Annual Report. The primary differences are that Form 23 reports gross reserves, including the royalty owners share, and includes reserves for only those properties of which we are the operator. 
 Title to Properties 
 We believe that we have satisfactory title to substantially all of our active properties in accordance with standards generally accepted in the oil and natural gas industry. Our properties are subject to customary royalty and overriding royalty interests, certain contracts relating to the exploration, development, operation and marketing of production from such properties, consents to assignment and preferential purchase rights, liens for current taxes, applicable laws and other burdens, encumbrances and irregularities in title, which we believe do not materially interfere with the use of or affect the value of such properties. Prior to acquiring undeveloped properties, we endeavor to perform a title investigation that is thorough but less vigorous than that we endeavor to conduct prior to drilling, which is consistent with standard practice in the oil and natural gas industry. Generally, before we commence drilling operations on properties that we operate, we conduct a title examination and perform curative work with respect to significant defects that we identify. We believe that we have performed title review with respect to substantially all of our active properties that we operate. 
 
 ITEM 3. LEGAL PROCEEDINGS 
 We are subject to various litigation, claims and proceedings that arise in the ordinary course of business, such as for alleged breaches of contract, miscalculation of royalties, employment matters, traffic incidents, pollution, contamination, encroachment on others property or nuisance. We accrue for such items when a liability is both probable and the amount can be reasonably estimated. It is not possible at this time to estimate the amount of any additional loss, or range of loss that is reasonably possible, but based on the nature of the claims, management believes that current litigation, claims and proceedings, individually or in aggregate and after taking into account insurance, are not likely to have a material adverse impact on our financial position, results of operations or cash flows, for the period in which the effect of that outcome becomes reasonably estimable. Many of these matters are in early stages, so the allegations and the damage theories have not been fully developed, and are all subject to inherent uncertainties; therefore, management s view may change in the future. If an unfavorable final outcome were to occur, there exists the possibility of a material impact on our financial position, results of operations or cash flows for the period in which the effect becomes reasonably estimable. 
 We are also subject to laws and regulations relating to the protection of the environment. Environmental and cleanup related costs of a non-capital nature are accrued when it is both probable that a liability has been incurred and when the amount can be reasonably estimated. Management believes any future remediation or other compliance related costs will not have a material effect on our financial position or results of operations.

 OVERVIEW 
 Background 
 We are an independent energy company engaged in natural gas, oil and NGLs development, exploration and production, which we refer to as E P. We are also focused on creating and capturing additional value through our marketing business, which we call Marketing . We conduct most of our businesses through subsidiaries, and we currently operate exclusively in the Appalachian and Haynesville natural gas basins in the lower 48 United States. 
 E P. Our primary business is the development and production of natural gas as well as associated NGLs and oil, with our ongoing operations focused on the development of unconventional natural gas reservoirs located in Pennsylvania, West Virginia, Ohio and Louisiana. Our operations in Pennsylvania, West Virginia and Ohio, which we refer to as Appalachia, are focused on the Marcellus Shale, the Utica and the Upper Devonian unconventional natural gas and liquids reservoirs. Our operations in Louisiana, which we refer to as Haynesville, are primarily focused on the Haynesville and Bossier natural gas reservoirs. We also have drilling rigs located in Appalachia and Haynesville, and we provide certain oilfield products and services, principally serving our E P operations through vertical integration. Over the past three years, we have completed three strategic acquisitions which have added scale to our operations: 
 On November 13, 2020, we closed on the Montage Merger, which increased our footprint in West Virginia and Pennsylvania and expanded our operations into Ohio. 
 On September 1, 2021, we closed on the Indigo Merger, which established our natural gas operations in the Haynesville and Bossier Shales in Louisiana. 
 On December 31, 2021, we closed on the GEPH Merger, which expanded our operations in the Haynesville. 
 The Indigo Merger and GEPH Merger extended our E P asset portfolio beyond Appalachia into the Haynesville and Bossier formations, giving us additional exposure to the LNG corridor and other markets on the U.S. Gulf Coast. These mergers progressed our ability to lower our enterprise business risk, expand our economic inventory, opportunity set and business optionality and capture operating synergies and cost structure savings. See Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements of this Annual Report for more information on the Mergers. 
 Marketing. Our marketing activities capture opportunities that arise through the marketing and transportation of natural gas, oil, and NGLs primarily produced in our E P operations. 
 Focus in 2022. We took several steps throughout 2022 to progress our strategic objectives by generating free cash flow, reducing our debt, and integrating our Mergers. Strong commodity prices during 2022 along with the increase in production volumes primarily associated with the Mergers, combined with our continued capital discipline, drove our free cash flow during the year. We used our free cash flow to pay down debt, strengthen our balance sheet and improve our debt leverage metrics while initiating a return of capital program to our shareholders. The Mergers are expected to continue to have a positive impact on our business and financial results by improving our capacity to generate free cash flow through the cycle. 
 During 2022, we reduced our debt by 1,015 million and authorized the repurchase of up to 1 billion of our common stock through December 31, 2023. Through 2022, we repurchased 17,261,469 shares at an average price of 7.24 per share for a total cost of approximately 125 million. The reduction of debt and share repurchases generated more than 1,140 million in additional value for shareholders. 
 57

 Improving our ability to generate free cash flow through the cycle is an important part of our strategy to strengthen our balance sheet. Our long-term goal is to incorporate a sustainable cash return component into our overall economic return for shareholders. Our near-term strategic goal is to prioritize the use of any free cash flow to improve our financial strength by reducing our debt and, secondarily, repurchasing common stock up to our 1 billion authorization (subject to market and business conditions). 
 Free cash flow is a non-GAAP financial measure. We define free cash flow as net cash provided by operating activities, adjusted for (i) changes in assets and liabilities and (ii) cash transaction costs associated with mergers and restructuring, less capital investments. Free cash flow is used by management and external users of our financial statements, such as industry analysts, investors, lenders and rating agencies. We believe free cash flow can provide an indicator of excess cash flow available to a company for the repayment of debt or for other general corporate purposes, as it disregards the timing of settlements of operating assets and liabilities. 
 For a discussion of climate change matters and related regulatory matters, including potential developments related to climate change and the potential impacts and risks of such developments on us, see Risk Factors in Item 1A of this Annual Report, and the related discussion in Business Other Environmental Regulation in Item 1 of this Annual Report. We will continue to monitor and assess any climate change-related developments that could impact us and the oil and gas industry, to determine the impact on our business and operations, and take appropriate actions where necessary. 
 Natural gas, oil and NGL price fluctuations present challenges to our industry and our Company, as do changes in laws, regulations and investor sentiment and other key factors described under Risk Factors in Item 1A of this Annual Report. Although we currently expect to maintain a rolling three-year derivative portfolio, there can be no assurance that we will be able to add derivative positions to cover our expected production at favorable prices. See Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk in Item 7A and Note 6 - Derivatives and Risk Management , in the consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report for further details. 
 Recent Financial and Operating Results 
 Significant operating and financial highlights for 2022 include: 
 Total Company 
 Net income of 1,849 million, or 1.66 per diluted share, improved from a net loss of 25 million, or (0.03) per diluted share, in 2021. Net income improved as a 4,719 million increase in operating income was partially offset by a 2,823 million increased loss from the impact of improved forward pricing on our derivatives position. Excluding the change in derivatives position, net income increased 4,697 million for 2022, as compared to 2021, primarily as a 4,719 million improvement in operating income coupled with a 79 million improvement to losses recognized on early extinguishment of debt was only partially offset by a 48 million increase in interest expense and a 51 million increase in current tax expense. 
 Operating income increased from 2,635 million for the year ended December 31, 2021 to 7,354 million for the year ended December 31, 2022. Operating income increased by 4,719 million, as the impact of increased commodity pricing and natural gas and liquids production on operating revenues was only partially offset by increased operating costs associated with increased pricing and production. 
 Net cash provided by operating activities of 3,154 million increased 131 from 1,363 million in 2021, primarily due to a 4,382 million increase resulting from higher commodity prices, a 1,563 million increase related to increased production, a 333 million increased impact of working capital, and a 51 million increase in our marketing margin. The increases were partially offset by a 3,791 million increase in settled derivative losses, a 641 million increase in operating costs and expenses, a 51 million increase in current taxes, a 48 million increase in interest expense, and a 3 million decrease in other marketing revenue. 
 Net cash provided by operating activities, net of changes in working capital, was 3,030 million, a 1,458 million increase compared to the same period in 2021. 
 Total capital invested of 2,209 million increased 99 from 1,108 million in 2021, as our 2022 capital program included a full-year of the Haynesville properties acquired in late 2021. 
 E P 
 E P segment operating income was 7,253 million in 2022, compared to operating income of 2,583 million in 2021. E P segment operating income increased 4,670 million from 2021, as improved commodity pricing and higher production volumes more than offset increased operating costs.

 Year-end reserves of 21,625 Bcfe increased 477 Bcfe, or 2 , from 21,148 Bcfe at the end of 2021, as 2,428 Bcfe of additions were only partially offset by 1,733 Bcfe of production, 175 Bcfe of revisions and 43 Bcfe associated with properties that were sold. 
 Total net production of 1,733 Bcfe, which was comprised of 88 natural gas, 10 NGLs and 2 oil, increased 40 from 1,240 Bcfe in 2021 mostly attributable to the Indigo Merger and the GEPH Merger which closed during 2021. 
 Excluding the effect of derivatives, our realized natural gas price of 5.98 per Mcf, realized oil price of 86.95 per barrel and realized NGL price of 34.35 per barrel increased 81 , 48 and 20 , respectively, from 2021. Our weighted average realized price excluding the effect of derivatives of 6.10 per Mcfe increased 63 from the same period in 2021. 
 The E P segment invested 2,196 million in capital; drilling 138 wells, completing 139 wells and placing 133 wells to sales. 
 Outlook 
 Our primary focus in 2023 is to maintain our production capacity and improve the safety and efficiency of our operations to optimize our ability to generate free cash flow, further reduce debt and return capital to shareholders (subject to market and business conditions). 
 As we continue to develop our core positions in the Appalachian and Haynesville natural gas basins in the U.S., we will concentrate on: 
 Creating Sustainable Value. We seek to create value for our stakeholders by allocating capital that is focused on earning economic returns and optimizing the value of our assets; delivering sustainable free cash flow through the cycle; upgrading the quality, depth and capital efficiency of our drilling inventory; and converting resources to proved reserves. 
 Protecting Financial Strength. We intend to protect our financial strength by lowering our leverage ratio and total debt; maintaining a strong liquidity position and attractive debt maturity profile; lowering our weighted average cost of debt; and deploying hedges to balance revenue protection with commodity upside exposure. 
 Progressing Execution. We are focused on operating effectively and efficiently with HSE and ESG as core values; leveraging our data analytics, operating execution, strategic sourcing, vertical integration and large-scale asset development expertise; further enhancing well performance, optimizing well costs and reducing base production declines; and growing margins and securing flow assurance through commercial and marketing arrangements. 
 Capturing the Tangible Benefits of Scale. We strive to enhance our enterprise returns by leveraging the scale gained from our past strategic transactions to deliver operating synergies, drive cost savings, expand our economic inventory, lower our enterprise risk profile, and expand our opportunity set and optionality. 
 We remain committed to achieving these objectives while maintaining our commitment to being environmentally conscious and proactive while maintaining best practices in social stewardship and corporate governance. We believe that we and our industry will continue to face challenges due to evolving environmental standards by both regulators and investors, the uncertainty of natural gas, oil and NGL prices in the United States, changes in laws, regulations and investor sentiment, and other key factors described above under Risk Factors. As such, we intend to protect our financial strength by reducing our debt while continuing to extend the weighted average years to maturity of our debt, and by maintaining a derivative program designed to reduce our exposure to commodity price volatility. 
 
 RESULTS OF OPERATIONS 
 The following discussion of our results of operations for our segments is presented before intersegment eliminations. We evaluate our segments as if they were stand-alone operations and accordingly discuss their results prior to any intersegment eliminations. Interest expense, gain (loss) on derivatives, gain (loss) on early extinguishment of debt and income taxes are discussed on a consolidated basis. 
 We have applied the Securities and Exchange Commission s FAST Act Modernization and Simplification of Regulation S-K, which limits the discussion to the two most recent fiscal years. This discussion and analysis deals with comparisons of material changes in the consolidated financial statements for fiscal year 2022 and fiscal year 2021. For the comparison of fiscal year 2021 and fiscal year 2020, see Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations in Part II, Item 7 of our 2021 Annual Report on Form 10-K, filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission on March 1, 2022.

 (1) The Haynesville E P assets were acquired through the Indigo Merger and the GEPH Merger in September 2021 and December 2021, respectively. 
 Production volumes for our E P segment increased 493 Bcfe for the year ended December 31, 2022, compared to the same period in 2021, primarily due the acquisitions of producing natural gas and oil properties in Haynesville from Indigo and GEPH in September 2021 and December 2021, respectively. 
 Oil and NGL production decreased 24 and 2 , respectively, for the year ended December 31, 2022, compared to 2021, primarily due to a higher capital allocation to our Haynesville assets which is mostly comprised of natural gas. 
 Commodity Prices 
 The price we expect to receive for our production is a critical factor in determining the capital investments we make to develop our properties. Commodity prices fluctuate due to a variety of factors we can neither control nor predict, including increased supplies of natural gas, oil or NGLs due to greater exploration and development activities, weather conditions, political and economic events such as the response to the COVID-19 pandemic, and competition from other energy sources. These factors impact supply and demand, which in turn determine the sales prices for our production. In addition to these factors, the prices we realize for our production are affected by our derivative activities as well as locational differences in market prices, including basis differentials. We will continue to evaluate the commodity price environments and adjust the pace of our activity in order to maintain appropriate liquidity and financial flexibility.

 Lease Operating Expenses 
 Lease operating expenses per Mcfe increased 0.03 for the year ended December 31, 2022, compared to 2021, primarily due to increased costs associated with gathering fees and the impact of increased commodity pricing on fuel and electricity costs. 
 General and Administrative Expenses 
 General and administrative expenses increased 30 million for the year ended December 31, 2022, compared to 2021, primarily due to increased personnel costs associated with our expanded operations in Haynesville. 
 On a per Mcfe basis, excluding merger-related expenses, restructuring charges and legal settlement charges, general and administrative expenses per Mcfe decreased by 0.01 for the year ended December 31, 2022, compared to 2021, as a 40 increase in production volumes more than offset a 21 increase in expenses. 
 Merger-Related Expenses 
 Beginning with the Montage Merger in November 2020, and continuing with the Indigo and GEPH Mergers in September 2021 and December 2021, respectively, we have focused on building scale and geographic diversification.

 We refer you to Note 2 of the consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report for additional details about the Mergers. 
 Restructuring Charges 
 In February 2021, employees were notified of a workforce reduction plan as part of an ongoing strategic effort to reposition our portfolio, optimize operational performance and improve margins. Affected employees were offered a severance package, which included a one-time payment depending on length of service and, if applicable, the current value of unvested long-term incentive awards that were forfeited. These costs were recognized as restructuring charges for the year ended December 31, 2021, and were substantially complete by the end of the first quarter of 2021. For the year ended December 31, 2021, we recognized a total restructuring expense of 7 million primarily related to cash severance, including payroll taxes. 
 See Note 3 of the consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report for additional details about our restructuring charges.

 Taxes, Other than Income Taxes 
 Taxes other than income taxes per Mcfe may vary from period to period due to changes in ad valorem and severance taxes that result from the mix of our production volumes and fluctuations in commodity prices. Taxes, other than income taxes, per Mcfe increased 0.04 per Mcfe for the year ended December 31, 2022, compared to the same period in 2021, primarily due to the impact of higher commodity pricing on our severance taxes in West Virginia, which are calculated as a fixed percentage of revenue net of allowable production expenses, and the impact of incremental severance and ad valorem taxes associated with our acquired assets in Louisiana. 
 Full Cost Pool Amortization 
 Our full cost pool amortization rate increased 0.25 per Mcfe for the year ended December 31, 2022, as compared to 2021. The amortization rate increased primarily as a result of our acquisitions of natural gas and oil properties in Haynesville and increases in development costs as a result of inflation. 
 The amortization rate is impacted by the timing and amount of reserve additions and the future development costs associated with those additions, revisions of previous reserve estimates due to both price and well performance, write-downs that result from non-cash full cost ceiling impairments, proceeds from the sale of properties that reduce the full cost pool, and the levels of costs subject to amortization. We cannot predict our future full cost pool amortization rate with accuracy due to the variability of each of the factors discussed above, as well as other factors, including but not limited to the uncertainty of the amount of future reserve changes. 
 Unevaluated costs excluded from amortization were 2,217 million at December 31, 2022 compared to 2,231 million at December 31, 2021. The unevaluated costs excluded from amortization decreased by 14 million, as compared to 2021, as the impact of 1,203 million of unevaluated capital invested during the period was more than offset by the evaluation of previously unevaluated properties totaling 1,217 million. 
 See Supplemental Oil and Gas Disclosures in Item 8 of Part II of this Annual Report for additional information regarding our unevaluated costs excluded from amortization. 
 Impairments 
 We recognized a 6 million impairment to non-core E P assets for the year ended December 31, 2021.

 Operating Income (Loss) 
 Marketing operating income increased 49 million for the year ended December 31, 2022, compared to 2021, primarily due to a 51 million increase in the marketing margin (discussed below), as well as a 1 million reduction in operating expenses which was partially offset by a 1 million reduction in gas storage gains and a 2 million reduction in non-performance damages received, both recorded in other operating revenues. 
 The margin generated from marketing activities increased 51 million for the year ended December 31, 2022, as compared to the prior year, primarily due to a 47 increase in volumes marketed largely associated with the Haynesville acquisitions. 
 Marketing margins are driven primarily by volumes marketed and may fluctuate depending on the prices paid for commodities, related cost of transportation and the ultimate disposition of those commodities. Increases and decreases in revenues

 due to changes in commodity prices and volumes marketed are largely offset by corresponding changes in purchase expenses. Efforts to optimize the cost of our transportation can result in greater expenses and therefore lower marketing margins. 
 Revenues 
 Revenues from our marketing activities increased 8,335 million for the year ended December 31, 2022, compared to 2021, primarily due to a 60 increase in the price received for volumes marketed and a 724 Bcfe increase in the volumes marketed. 
 Operating Costs and Expenses 
 Marketing operating costs and expenses decreased by 1 million for the year ended December 31, 2022, compared to the year ended December 31, 2021, primarily due a 4 million decrease in DD A, partially offset by a 2 million increase in personnel-related costs attributable to the 2021 Haynesville acquisitions and 1 million of increased taxes other than income taxes.

 Interest expense related to our senior notes increased for the year ended December 31, 2022, as compared to 2021, as a result of the assumption of Indigo Notes, which were exchanged for 700 million aggregate principal amount of our 5.375 Senior Notes due 2029, the September 2021 public offering of 1,200 million aggregate principal amount of our 5.375 Senior Notes due 2030, and the December 2021 public offering of 1,150 million aggregate principal amount of our 4.75 Senior Notes due 2032. 
 We capitalize interest associated with the cost of acquiring and assessing our unevaluated natural gas and oil properties. Capitalized interest increased 24 million for the year ended December 31, 2022, compared to 2021, primarily due to the incremental capitalized interest associated with our Haynesville unevaluated properties. 
 Capitalized interest decreased as a percentage of gross interest expense for the year ended December 31, 2022, as compared to 2021, primarily as a result of a 1 decrease in the change in unevaluated natural gas and oil properties balance as compared to a 31 increase in gross interest expense over the same period.

 Gain (Loss) on Early Extinguishment of Debt 
 For the year ended December 31, 2022, we retired 816 million of long term debt at a cost of 822 million and recorded a loss on early extinguishment of debt of 14 million, which included 6 million of premiums and fees and the write off of 8 million in related unamortized debt discounts and issuance costs. The debt retirements included the repurchase of 46 million of our 8.375 Senior Notes due 2028, 19 million of our 7.75 Senior Notes due 2027 and the full redemption of 201 million of our 4.10 Senior Notes due 2022 and 550 million of our Term Loan. 
 For the year ended December 31, 2021, we recorded a loss on early extinguishment of debt of 93 million as a result of our repurchase of 1,091 million in aggregate principal amount of our outstanding senior notes for 1,177 million in cash, including premiums and fees, and the write-off of 7 million in related unamortized debt discounts and issuance costs. 
 Income Taxes 
 For the years ended December 31, (in millions except percentages) 2022 2021 Income tax expense 51 Effective tax rate 3 0 
 In 2020, due to significant pricing declines and the material write-down of the carrying value of our natural gas and oil properties in addition to other negative evidence, management concluded that it was more likely than not that a portion of our deferred tax assets would not be realized and recorded a valuation allowance. As of December 31, 2022, we still maintain a full valuation allowance. We also retained a valuation allowance of 29 million related to net operating losses in jurisdictions in which we no longer operate. Management will continue to assess available positive and negative evidence to estimate whether sufficient future taxable income will be generated to permit the use of deferred tax assets. The amount of the deferred tax asset considered realizable, however, could be adjusted based on changes in subjective estimates of future taxable income or if objective negative evidence is no longer present. 
 Due to the issuance of common stock associated with the Indigo Merger, as discussed in Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements to this Annual Report, we incurred a cumulative ownership change and as such, our net operating losses NOLs prior to the acquisition are subject to an annual limitation under Internal Revenue Code Section 382 of approximately 48 million. The ownership changes and resulting annual limitation will result in the expiration of NOLs or other tax attributes otherwise available, with a corresponding decrease in our valuation allowance. At December 31, 2022, we had approximately 4 billion of federal NOL carryovers, of which approximately 3 billion have an expiration date between 2035 and 2037 and 1 billion have an indefinite carryforward life. We currently estimate that approximately 2 billion of these federal NOLs will expire before they are able to be used. The non-expiring NOLs remain subject to a full valuation allowance. If a subsequent ownership change were to occur as a result of future transactions in our common stock, our use of remaining U.S. tax attributes may be further limited. 
 The Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 (the IRA was enacted on August 16, 2022 and may impact how the U.S. taxes certain large corporations. The IRA imposes a 15 alternative minimum tax on the adjusted financial statement income of certain large corporations (generally, corporations reporting at least 1 billion average adjusted pre-tax net income on their consolidated financial statements) for tax years beginning after December 31, 2022. This alternative minimum tax requires complex computations to be performed that were not previously required in U.S. tax law, significant judgments to be made in interpretation of the provisions of the IRA, significant estimates in calculations, and the preparation and analysis of information not previously relevant or regularly produced. The U.S. Treasury Department, the Internal Revenue Service, and other standard-setting bodies are expected to issue guidance on how the alternative minimum tax provisions of the IRA will be applied or otherwise administered that may differ from our interpretations. As we complete our analysis of the IRA, collect and prepare necessary data, and interpret any additional guidance, we may make adjustments to provisional amounts that we have recorded that may materially impact our provision for income taxes in the period in which adjustments are made. We will continue to monitor updates to the IRA and the impact it will have on our consolidated financial statements. 
 We refer you to Note 11 to the consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report for additional discussion about our income taxes. 
 
 LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES 
 We depend primarily on funds generated from our operations, our 2022 credit facility, our cash and cash equivalents balance and our access to capital markets as our primary sources of liquidity. On April 8, 2022, we restated our 2018 credit facility and extended the maturity through April 2027 (the 2022 credit facility ). In connection with entering into our 2022 credit facility, the banks participating in our 2022 credit facility increased our borrowing base to 3.5 billion and agreed to provide five-year 
 67 

Table of Contents

 revolving commitments of 2.0 billion (the Five-Year Tranche and agreed to updated terms that provide the ability to convert our secured credit facility to an unsecured credit facility if we are able to achieve investment grade status, as deemed by the relevant rating agencies. 
 Effective August 4, 2022, we elected to temporarily increase by 500 million our commitments under the 2022 credit facility in the form of an additional tranche of short-term revolving commitments (the Short-Term Tranche ). The Short-Term Tranche is effective through April 30, 2023 and provides incremental liquidity to help us manage potential temporary working capital draws related to our hedge position. Due to our level of hedged natural gas production and the timing difference between monthly hedge settlements and the corresponding physical sales receipts, a sharp month-over-month increase in natural gas prices can cause temporary working capital draws. The capital outlays are usually temporary because the physical sales receipts typically more than offset the hedge settlements. The Short-Term Tranche represents a proactive measure consistent with our established risk management procedures. At current forward strip prices, we do not expect to draw upon the Short-Term Tranche, with our pre-existing 2 billion in commitments under the Five-Year Tranche expected to be sufficient for our liquidity needs. Through December 31, 2022, we have had no borrowings under the Short-Term Tranche. 
 On September 29, 2022, our borrowing base was reaffirmed at 3.5 billion and the commitments under our Five-Year Tranche and Short-Term Tranche were kept at 2.0 billion and 500 million, respectively. At December 31, 2022, we had approximately 2.2 billion of total available liquidity, which exceeds our currently modeled needs as we remain committed to our strategy of capital discipline. 
 In conjunction with the GEPH Merger, we amended our credit facility agreement to permit access to additional secured debt capacity in the form of a term loan for incremental capital up to 900 million, ranking equally with our credit facility. In December 2021, we raised 550 million in term loan financing (the Term Loan to partially fund the GEPH Merger, with no impact to our liquidity. The undrawn 350 million of incremental term loan capacity expired in November 2022. 
 On December 30, 2022, the Company repaid in full all outstanding indebtedness under the Term Loan. The payoff amount included term loans in the principal amount of approximately 546 million, plus accrued but unpaid interest, fees, and expenses, which satisfied all of the Company s indebtedness obligations thereunder. In connection with the repayment of such outstanding indebtedness obligations, all security interests, mortgages, liens and encumbrances securing the obligations under the Term Loan, the Term Loan, related loan documents, and all guarantees of such indebtedness obligations were terminated. The Company funded the repayment of the obligations under the Term Loan with approximately 305 million in cash on hand and approximately 250 million of borrowings under the Company s revolving credit facility. 
 Our flexibility to access incremental secured debt capital is derived from our excess asset collateral value above the elected 3.5 billion maximum revolving credit amount and borrowing base of our 2022 credit facility and the elected 2.0 billion of aggregate commitments and the additional tranche of elected 500 million short-term revolving commitments from our bank group. Our ability to issue secured debt is governed by the limitations of our 2022 credit facility as well as our secured debt capacity (as defined by our senior note indentures) which was 6.6 billion as of December 31, 2022, based on 25 of adjusted consolidated net tangible assets. If we were to realize a return to investment grade ratings and the subsequent conversion of our secured credit facility to an unsecured credit facility, we would expect to have access to additional liquidity capital beyond our 2.5 billion elected aggregate revolving commitments (including our additional short-term tranche), either by increasing commitments to the 2022 credit facility up to the 3.5 billion aggregate size or otherwise on a similarly unsecured basis, given our current asset collateral value and credit quality. We refer you to Note 9 to the consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report and the section below under Credit Arrangements and Financing Activities for additional discussion of our 2022 credit facility and related covenant requirements. 
 In June 2022, we announced a share repurchase program, under which we have been authorized to repurchase up to 1 billion of our outstanding common stock beginning June 21, 2022 and continuing through and including December 31, 2023. The timing, as well as the number and value of shares repurchased under the program, will be determined at our discretion and includes a variety of factors, including our progress in reducing debt to our target debt range, our free cash flow generation capabilities, our assessment of the intrinsic value of our common stock, the market price of our common stock, general market and economic conditions, available liquidity, compliance with our debt and other agreements, and applicable legal requirements among other considerations. The exact number of shares to be repurchased is not guaranteed, and the program may be suspended, modified, or discontinued at any time without prior notice. 
 During 2022, we repurchased approximately 17.3 million shares of our outstanding common stock at an average price of 7.24 per share for a total cost of approximately 125 million. 
 Looking forward, we intend to prioritize the use of any free cash flow to pay down our debt in order to progress toward our debt and leverage targets.

 Our cash flow from operating activities is highly dependent upon our ability to sell and the sales prices that we receive for our natural gas and liquids production. Natural gas, oil and NGL prices are subject to wide fluctuations and are driven by market supply and demand, which is impacted by many factors. See "Market Conditions and Commodity Prices" in the Overview section of Item 7 in Part II for additional discussion about current and potential future market conditions. The sales price we receive for our production is also influenced by our commodity derivative program. Our derivative contracts allow us to ensure a certain level of cash flow to fund our operations. Although we are continually adding additional derivative positions for portions of our expected 2023, 2024 and 2025 production, there can be no assurance that we will be able to add derivative positions to cover the remainder of our expected production at favorable prices. See Risk Factors in Item 1A, Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk in Item 7A and Note 6 in the consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report for further details. 
 Our commodity hedging activities are subject to the credit risk of our counterparties being financially unable to settle the transaction. We actively monitor the credit status of our counterparties, performing both quantitative and qualitative assessments based on their credit ratings and credit default swap rates where applicable, and to date have not had any credit defaults associated with our transactions. However, any future failures by one or more counterparties could negatively impact our cash flow from operating activities. 
 Our short-term cash flows are also dependent on the timely collection of receivables from our customers and joint interest owners. We actively manage this risk through credit management activities and, through the date of this filing, have not experienced any significant write-offs for non-collectable amounts. However, any sustained inaccessibility of credit by our customers and joint interest owners could adversely impact our cash flows. 
 Due to these factors, we are unable to forecast with certainty our future level of cash flow from operations. Accordingly, we expect to adjust our discretionary uses of cash depending upon available cash flow. Further, we may from time to time seek to retire, rearrange or amend some or all of our outstanding debt or debt agreements through cash purchases, and/or exchanges, open market purchases, privately negotiated transactions, tender offers or otherwise. Such transactions, if any, will depend on prevailing market conditions, our liquidity requirements, contractual restrictions and other factors. The amounts involved may be material. 
 Credit Arrangements and Financing Activities 
 In April 2022, we entered into an amended and restated credit agreement that replaced the 2018 credit facility (the "2022 credit facility") with a group of banks that, as amended, has a maturity date of April 2027. The 2022 credit facility has an aggregate maximum revolving credit amount and borrowing base of 3.5 billion and, as of December 31, 2022, the elected commitment comprised of the Five-Year Tranche and Short-Term Tranche of 2.0 billion and 500 million, respectively, which were all reaffirmed on September 29, 2022. 
 Effective August 4, 2022, we elected to temporarily increase by 500 million our commitments under the 2022 credit facility in the form of an additional tranche of short-term revolving commitments (the Short-Term Tranche ). The Short-Term Tranche is effective through April 30, 2023 and provides incremental liquidity to help us manage potential temporary working capital draws related to our hedge position. Due to our level of hedged natural gas production and the inherent timing difference between monthly hedge settlements and the corresponding physical sales receipts, a sharp month-over-month increase in natural gas prices can cause temporary working capital draws. The capital outlays are temporary because the physical sales receipts typically more than offset the hedge settlements. The Short-Term Tranche represents a proactive measure consistent with our established risk management procedures. At current forward strip prices, we do not expect to draw upon the Short-Term Tranche, with our pre-existing 2.0 billion in commitments under the Five-Year Tranche expected to be sufficient for our liquidity needs. Through December 31, 2022, we have had no borrowings under the Short-Term Tranche. 
 The borrowing base is subject to redetermination at least twice a year, which typically occurs in April and October, and is subject to change based primarily on drilling results, commodity prices, our future derivative position, the level of capital investment and operating costs. The 2022 credit facility is secured by substantially all of our assets and our subsidiaries assets (taken as a whole). The permitted lien provisions in the senior note indentures currently limit liens securing indebtedness to the greater of 2.0 billion or 25 of adjusted consolidated net tangible assets, which was 6.6 billion as of December 31, 2022. The 2022 credit facility contains the ability to utilize SOFR index rates for purposes of calculating interest expense. 
 The 2022 credit facility has certain financial covenant requirements but provides certain fall away features should we receive an Investment Grade Rating (defined as an index debt rating of BBB- or higher with S P, Baa3 or higher with Moody s, or BBB- or higher with Fitch) and meet other criteria in the future. We refer you to Note 9 to the consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report for additional discussion of our 2022 credit facility.

 As of December 31, 2022, we were in compliance with all of the applicable covenants contained in the credit agreement governing our 2022 credit facility. Our ability to comply with financial covenants in future periods depends, among other things, on the success of our development program and upon other factors beyond our control, such as the market demand and prices for natural gas and liquids. We refer you to Note 9 of the consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report for additional discussion of the covenant requirements of our 2022 credit facility. 
 As of December 31, 2022, we had 250 million of borrowings on our 2022 credit facility and 110 million in outstanding letters of credit. We currently do not anticipate being required to supply a materially greater amount of letters of credit under our existing contracts. We refer you to Note 9 to the consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report for additional discussion of our 2022 credit facility. 
 The credit status of the financial institutions participating in our 2022 credit facility could adversely impact our ability to borrow funds under the 2022 credit facility. Although we believe all of the lenders under the facility have the ability to provide funds, we cannot predict whether each will be able to meet their obligation to us. We refer you to Note 9 to the consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report for additional discussion of our 2022 credit facility. 
 In contemplation of the GEPH Merger, on December 22, 2021, we entered into a term loan credit agreement with a group of lenders that provided for a 550 million secured term loan facility. On December 30, 2022, we repaid in full the remaining principal balance of 546 million and all other outstanding indebtedness under the Term Loan using approximately 305 million of cash on hand and approximately 250 million of borrowings under our 2022 credit facility. 
 Key financing activities for the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021 are as follows: 
 Debt and Common Stock Issuance 
 On December 22, 2021, we completed a public offering of 1,150 million aggregate principal amount of our 4.75 Senior Notes due 2032 (the 2032 Notes ), with net proceeds from the offering totaling 1,133 million after underwriting discounts and offering expenses. The net proceeds were used to fund a portion of the GEPH Merger, which closed on December 31, 2021, and to fund tender offers for 300 million of our 2025 Notes. The remaining proceeds were used for general corporate purposes. 
 In contemplation of the GEPH Merger, on December 22, 2021, we entered into a term loan credit agreement with a group of lenders that provided for a 550 million secured term loan facility with a maturity date of June 22, 2027 (the Term Loan ). The net proceeds from the initial loans of 542 million were used to fund a portion of the GEPH Merger on December 31, 2021. As of December 31, 2022, the Term Loan was repaid in full. 
 On December 31, 2021, we issued 99,337,748 shares of our common stock in conjunction with the GEPH Merger. These shares of our common stock had an aggregate dollar value equal to approximately 463 million, based on the closing price of 4.66 per share of our common stock on the NYSE on December 31, 2021. See Note 2 for additional details on the GEPH Merger. 
 In August 2021, we completed a public offering of 1,200 million aggregate principal amount of our 5.375 Senior Notes due 2030 (the 2030 Notes ), with net proceeds from the offering totaling 1,183 million after underwriting discounts and offering expenses. The proceeds were used to repurchase the 791 million principal amount of certain of our outstanding senior notes. The remaining proceeds were used to pay borrowings under our credit facility and for general corporate purposes, including consideration for the Indigo Merger. 
 In September 2021, we issued 337,827,171 shares of our common stock in conjunction with the Indigo Merger. These shares of our common stock had an aggregate dollar value equal to approximately 1,588 million, based on the closing price of 4.70 per share of our common stock on the NYSE on September 1, 2021. See Note 2 for additional details on the Indigo Merger. 
 In conjunction with the Indigo Merger and pursuant to the terms of the merger agreement, in September 2021, we assumed 700 million in aggregate principal amount of Indigo s 5.375 Senior Notes due 2029 (the Indigo Notes ). Subsequent to the Indigo Merger, we exchanged the Indigo Notes for approximately 700 million of newly issued 5.375 Senior Notes due 2029. 
 Debt Repurchase 
 In December 2022, we repaid the remaining outstanding principal balance of our Term Loan of 546 million using approximately 305 million in cash on hand and approximately 250 million of borrowings under our credit facility, and we wrote off the related unamortized debt discounts and issuance costs resulting in a loss on early debt extinguishment of 8

 million. As a result of the focused work on refinancing and repayment of our debt in recent years, coupled with the amendment and restatement of our credit facility on April 8, 2022, we have no debt balances scheduled to become due prior to 2025. 
 In May 2022, we repurchased 18 million of our 8.375 Senior Notes due 2028, resulting in a 1 million loss on debt extinguishment. 
 In April 2022, we repurchased 4 million of our 7.75 Senior Notes due 2027 and 23 million of our 8.375 Senior Notes due 2028, resulting in a 3 million loss on debt extinguishment. 
 In March 2022, we repurchased 15 million of our 7.75 Senior Notes due 2027 and 5 million of our 8.375 Senior Notes due 2028, resulting in a 2 million loss on debt extinguishment. 
 In January 2022, we repurchased the remaining outstanding principal balance of 201 million on our 2022 Senior Notes using our credit facility. 
 In 2021, we repurchased 6 million of our 4.10 Senior Notes due 2022, 467 million of our 4.95 Senior Notes due 2025 and 618 million of our 7.50 Senior Notes due 2026 for 1,177 million in cash, including premiums and fees, and we recognized an additional 7 million in unamortized debt expenses, resulting in a loss on early extinguishment of debt of 93 million. 
 On January 27, 2023, we delivered a notice to holders of our 7.75 Senior Notes due October 2027 (the 2027 Notes to redeem all of the outstanding 2027 Notes on February 26, 2023 (the Redemption Date at a redemption price equal to 103.875 of the principal amount thereof plus accrued and unpaid interest to the Redemption Date. We expect to use a combination of available cash on hand and our 2022 credit facility to complete the retirement of our 2027 Notes. 
 At February 21, 2023, we had long-term debt issuer ratings of Ba1 by Moody s (rating upgraded and stable outlook affirmed on May 31, 2022), BB+ by S P (rating affirmed BB+ and outlook upgraded to positive on January 18, 2023) and BB+ by Fitch Ratings (rating upgraded to BB+ with positive outlook on August 10, 2022). Effective in January 2022, the interest rate for our 4.95 2025 Senior Notes 2025 Notes was 5.95 , reflecting a net downgrade in our bond ratings since their issuance. On May 31, 2022, Moody s upgraded our bond rating to Ba1, which decreased the interest rate on the 2025 Notes from 5.95 to 5.70 for coupon payments paid after July 2022. Any further upgrades or downgrades in our public debt ratings by Moody s or S P could decrease or increase our cost of funds, respectively, as our 2025 Notes are subject to ratings driven changes.

 Net cash provided by operating activities increased 131 or 1,791 million for the year ended December 31, 2022, compared to the same period in 2021, primarily due to a 4,382 million increase resulting from higher commodity prices, a 1,563 million increase related to increased production, a 333 million increased impact of working capital, and a 51 million increase in our marketing margin. The increases were partially offset by a 3,791 million decrease in settled derivatives, a 641 million increase in operating costs and expenses, a 51 million increase in current taxes, a 48 million increase in interest expense, and a 3 million decrease in other marketing revenue. 
 Net cash generated from operating activities, net of changes in working capital, exceeded our capital investments by 821 million and 464 million for the years ended December 31, 2022 and December 31, 2021 , respectively.

 Actual capital expenditure levels may vary significantly from period to period due to many factors, including drilling results, natural gas, oil and NGL prices, industry conditions, the prices and availability of goods and services, and the extent to which properties are acquired or non-strategic assets are sold. 
 Cash Flow from Financing Activities 
 Net cash used in financing activities for the year ended December 31, 2022 was 1,089 million, compared to net cash provided by financing activities of 1,256 million for the same period in 2021. 
 In 2022, we fully redeemed our 4.10 Senior Notes for 201 million and paid down additional aggregate principal balances on our senior notes of 65 million in principal and 6 million in premiums, fully retired our Term Loan B due 2027 balance with 550 million in combined payments and paid down 210 million on our 2022 credit facility. 
 In 2022, we repurchased approximately 17.3 million shares at an average price of 7.24 per share for a total cost of approximately 125 million. 
 In December 2021, we completed a public offering of 1,150 million aggregate principal amount of our 2032 Notes, with net proceeds from the offering totaling 1,133 million after underwriting discounts and offering expenses. The net proceeds were used to fund a portion of the GEPH Merger, which closed on December 31, 2021, and to repurchase 300 million of our 2025 Notes. The remaining proceeds were used for general corporate purposes. 
 In December 2021, we entered into our secured Term Loan facility and, as of December 31, 2021, had borrowings of 550 million outstanding. The net proceeds from the initial loans of 542 million were used to fund a portion of the GEPH Merger on December 31, 2021. 
 In December 2021, we repaid the outstanding balance of 81 million related to GEPH s revolving credit facility. 
 In September 2021, we repaid the outstanding balance of 95 million related to Indigo s revolving credit facility. 
 In August 2021, we completed a public offering of 1,200 million aggregate principal amount of our 2030 Notes, with net proceeds from the offering totaling 1,183 million after underwriting discounts and offering expenses. The net proceeds were used to repurchase the 791 million principal amount of certain of our outstanding senior notes. The remaining proceeds were used to pay borrowings under our 2018 credit facility and for general corporate purposes, including consideration for the Indigo Merger. 
 We refer you to Note 9 to the consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report for additional discussion of our outstanding debt and credit facility and to Note 1 for additional discussion of our equity offering. 
 Working Capital 
 We had negative working capital of 1,817 million at December 31, 2022, a 178 million decrease from December 31, 2021, as a 241 million increase in accounts receivable, a 206 million reduction in the current portion of long-term debt, a 26 million increase in other current assets, a 22 million increase in cash, and a 10 million decrease in other current liabilities were more than offset by a 607 million increase in various payables and a 76 million increase in the current portion of our net liability hedge positions. We believe that our existing cash and cash equivalents, our anticipated cash flow from operations and our available credit facility will be sufficient to meet our working capital and operational spending requirements. 
 Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements 
 We may enter into off-balance sheet arrangements and transactions that can give rise to material off-balance sheet obligations. As of December 31, 2022, our material off-balance sheet arrangements and transactions include operating service arrangements and 110 million in letters of credit outstanding against our 2022 credit facility. There are no other transactions, arrangements or other relationships with unconsolidated entities or other persons that are reasonably likely to materially affect our liquidity or availability of our capital resources. For more information regarding off-balance sheet arrangements, we refer you to Contractual Obligations and Contingent Liabilities and Commitments below for more information on our operating leases.

 Contractual Obligations and Contingent Liabilities and Commitments 
 We have various contractual obligations in the normal course of our operations and financing activities. Significant contractual obligations as of December 31, 2022, were as follows: 
 Contractual Obligations: 
 Payments Due by Period (in millions) Total Less than 1 Year 1 to 3 Years 3 to 5 Years 5 to 8 Years More than 8 Years Transportation charges (1) 
 10,414 1,110 2,098 1,950 2,395 2,861 Debt 4,414 389 671 2,204 1,150 Interest on debt (2)

 27 15 9 3 17,033 1,664 3,099 3,152 5,024 4,094 
 (1) As of December 31, 2022, we had commitments for demand and similar charges under firm transportation and gathering agreements to guarantee access capacity on natural gas and liquids pipelines and gathering systems. Of the total 10.4 billion, 1,326 million related to access capacity on future pipeline and gathering infrastructure projects that still require the granting of regulatory approvals and/or additional construction efforts. For further information, we refer you to Operational Commitments and Contingencies in Note 10 to the consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report. This amount also included guarantee obligations of up to 929 million. 
 Prior to the Indigo Merger, in May 2021, Indigo closed on an agreement to divest its Cotton Valley natural gas and oil properties. Indigo retained certain contractual commitments related to volume commitments associated with natural gas gathering, for which Southwestern will assume the obligation to pay the gathering provider for any unused portion of the volume commitment under the agreement through 2027, depending on the buyer s actual use. As of December 31, 2022, up to approximately 30 million of these contractual commitments remain (included in the table above), and the Company has recorded a 16 million liability for its portion of the estimated future payments. 
 (2) Interest payments on our senior notes were calculated utilizing the fixed rates associated with our fixed rate notes outstanding at December 31, 2022. Senior note interest rates were based on our credit ratings as of December 31, 2022. 
 (3) Operating leases include costs for compressors, drilling rigs, pressure pumping equipment, office space and other equipment under non-cancelable operating leases expiring through 2036. 
 (4) As of December 31, 2022, our E P segment had commitments of approximately 32 million for compression services associated primarily with our Appalachia division. 
 (5) Our other significant contractual obligations include approximately 27 million for various information technology support and data subscription agreements. 
 Future contributions to the pension and postretirement benefit plans are excluded from the table above. For further information regarding our pension and other postretirement benefit plans, we refer you to Note 13 to the consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report and Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates below for additional information. 
 We refer you to Note 9 to the consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report for a discussion of the terms of our debt. 
 We are subject to various litigation, claims and proceedings that arise in the ordinary course of business, such as for alleged breaches of contract, miscalculation of royalties, employment matters, traffic incidents, pollution, contamination, encroachment on others property or nuisance. We accrue for such items when a liability is both probable and the amount can be reasonably estimated. Management believes that current litigation, claims and proceedings, individually or in aggregate and after taking into account insurance, are not likely to have a material adverse impact on our financial position, results of operations or cash flows, although it is possible that adverse outcomes could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations or cash flows for the period in which the effect of that outcome becomes reasonably estimable. Many of these matters are in early stages, so the allegations and the damage theories have not been fully developed, and are all subject to inherent uncertainties; therefore, management s view may change in the future. 
 We are also subject to laws and regulations relating to the protection of the environment. Environmental and cleanup related costs of a non-capital nature are accrued when it is both probable that a liability has been incurred and when the amount can be reasonably estimated. Management believes any future remediation or other compliance related costs will not have a material effect on our financial position, results of operations or cash flows. 
 For further information, we refer you to Litigation and Environmental Risk in Note 10 to the consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report.

 Supplemental Guarantor Financial Information 
 As discussed in Note 9 , in April 2022 the Company entered into the 2022 credit facility. Pursuant to requirements under the indentures governing our senior notes, each 100 owned subsidiary that became a guarantor of the 2022 credit facility is also required to become a guarantor of each of our senior notes (the Guarantor Subsidiaries ). The Guarantor Subsidiaries also granted liens and security interests to support their guarantees under the 2022 credit facility but not of the senior notes. These guarantees are full and unconditional and joint and several among the Guarantor Subsidiaries. Certain of our operating units which are accounted for on a consolidated basis do not guarantee the 2022 credit facility and senior notes. 
 Upon the closing of the Mergers, discussed further in Note 2 to the consolidated financials included in this Annual Report, certain acquired entities owning oil and gas properties became guarantors to the 2022 credit facility. 
 The Company and the Guarantor Subsidiaries jointly and severally, and fully and unconditionally, guarantee the payment of the principal and premium, if any, and interest on the senior notes when due, whether at stated maturity of the senior notes, by acceleration, by call for redemption or otherwise, together with interest on the overdue principal, if any, and interest on any overdue interest, to the extent lawful, and all other obligations of the Company to the holders of the senior notes. 
 
 SEC Regulation S-X Rule 13-01 requires the presentation of Summarized Financial Information to replace the Condensed Consolidating Financial Information required under Rule 3-10. Rule 13-01 allows the omission of Summarized Financial Information if assets, liabilities and results of operations of the Guarantors are not materially different than the corresponding amounts presented in the consolidated financial statements of the Company. The Parent and Guarantor Subsidiaries comprise the material operations of the Company. Therefore, the Company concluded that the presentation of the Summarized Financial Information is not required as the Summarized Financial Information of the Company s Guarantors is not materially different from our consolidated financial statements.

 The discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. The preparation of these financial statements requires management to make estimates and judgments that affect the amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. We evaluate our estimates on an on-going basis, based on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions. We believe the following describes significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements. 
 Natural Gas and Oil Properties 
 We utilize the full cost method of accounting for costs related to the exploration, development and acquisition of natural gas and oil properties. Under this method, all such costs (productive and nonproductive), including salaries, benefits and other internal costs directly attributable to these activities, are capitalized on a country-by-country basis and amortized over the estimated lives of the properties using the units-of-production method. These capitalized costs are subject to a quarterly ceiling test that limits such pooled costs, net of applicable deferred taxes, to the aggregate of the present value of future net revenues attributable to proved natural gas, oil and NGL reserves discounted at 10 (standardized measure) plus the lower of cost or market value of unproved properties. Any costs in excess of the ceiling are written off as a non-cash expense. The expense may not be reversed in future periods, even though higher natural gas, oil and NGL prices may subsequently increase the ceiling. Companies using the full cost method are required to use the average quoted price from the first day of each month from the previous 12 months, including the impact of derivatives designated for hedge accounting, to calculate the ceiling value of their reserves. Prices used to calculate the ceiling value of reserves were as follows: 
 December 31, 2022 December 31, 2021 Natural gas (per MMBtu) 
 6.36 3.60 Oil (per Bbl) 
 93.67 66.56 NGLs (per Bbl) 
 34.35 28.65 
 Using the average quoted prices above, adjusted for market differentials, our net book value of our United States natural gas and oil properties did not exceed the ceiling amount at December 31, 2022 or December 31, 2021. We had no derivative positions that were designated for hedge accounting as of December 31, 2022 or December 31 2021. Future decreases in market prices, as well as changes in production rates, levels of reserves, evaluation of costs excluded from amortization, future development costs and production costs may result in future non-cash impairments to our natural gas and oil properties. 
 75

 Changes in natural gas, oil and NGL prices used to calculate the discounted future net revenues of our reserves affects both the present value of cash flows and the quantity of reserves. Our reserve base as of December 31, 2022 was approximately 80 natural gas, 17 NGLs and 3 oil, and our standardized measure and reserve quantities as of December 31, 2022, were 37.6 billion and 21.6 Tcfe, respectively. 
 Costs associated with unevaluated properties are excluded from our amortization base until we have evaluated the properties or impairment is indicated. The costs associated with unevaluated leasehold acreage and related seismic data, wells currently drilling and related capitalized interest are initially excluded from our amortization base. Leasehold costs are either transferred to our amortization base with the costs of drilling a well on the lease or are assessed at least annually for possible impairment or reduction in value. Our decision to withhold costs from amortization and the timing of the transfer of those costs into the amortization base involves judgment and may be subject to changes over time based on several factors, including our drilling plans, availability of capital, project economics and drilling results from adjacent acreage. At December 31, 2022, we had approximately 2,217 million of costs excluded from our amortization base, all of which related to our properties in the United States. Inclusion of some or all of these costs in our properties in the United States in the future, without adding any associated reserves, could result in non-cash ceiling test impairments. 
 Proved natural gas, oil and NGL reserves are a major component of the full cost ceiling test. Natural gas, oil and NGL reserves cannot be measured exactly. Our estimate of natural gas, oil and NGL reserves requires extensive judgments of reservoir engineering data and projections of costs that will be incurred in developing and producing reserves and is generally less precise than other estimates made in connection with financial disclosures. Our reservoir engineers prepare our reserve estimates under the supervision of our management. Reserve estimates are prepared for each of our properties annually by the reservoir engineers assigned to the asset management team for that property. The reservoir engineering and financial data included in these estimates are reviewed by senior engineers, who are not part of the asset management teams, and by our Director of Reserves, who is the technical person primarily responsible for overseeing the preparation of our reserves estimates. Our Director of Reserves has more than 28 years of experience in petroleum engineering, including the estimation of natural gas and oil reserves, and holds a Bachelor of Science in Petroleum Engineering. Prior to joining us in 2018, our Director of Reserves served in various reservoir engineering roles for EP Energy Company, El Paso Corporation, Cabot Oil Gas Corporation, Schlumberger and H.J. Gruy Associates, and is a member of the Society of Petroleum Engineers. He reports to our Executive Vice President and Chief Operating Officer, who has more than 34 years of experience in petroleum engineering including the estimation of natural gas, oil and NGL reserves in multiple basins in the United States, and holds a Bachelor of Science in Petroleum Engineering. Prior to joining Southwestern in 2017, our Chief Operating Officer served in various engineering and leadership roles for EP Energy Corporation, El Paso Corporation, ARCO Oil and Gas Company, Burlington Resources and Peoples Energy Production, and is a member of the Society of Petroleum Engineers. 
 We engage NSAI, a worldwide leader of petroleum property analysis for industry and financial organizations and government agencies, to independently audit our proved reserves estimates as discussed in more detail below. NSAI was founded in 1961 and performs consulting petroleum engineering services under Texas Board of Professional Engineers Registration No. F-002699. Within NSAI, the two technical persons primarily responsible for auditing our proved reserves estimates (1) have over 26 years and over 21 years of practical experience in petroleum geosciences and petroleum engineering, respectively; (2) have over 15 years and over 21 years of experience in the estimation and evaluation of reserves, respectively; (3) each has a college degree; (4) each is a Licensed Professional Geoscientist in the State of Texas or a Licensed Professional Engineer in the State of Texas; (5) each meets or exceeds the education, training, and experience requirements set forth in the Standards Pertaining to the Estimating and Auditing of Oil and Gas Reserves Information promulgated by the Society of Petroleum Engineers; and (6) each is proficient in judiciously applying industry standard practices to engineering and geoscience evaluations as well as applying SEC and other industry reserves definitions and guidelines. The financial data included in the reserve estimates is also separately reviewed by our accounting staff. Our proved reserves estimates, as internally reviewed and audited by NSAI, are submitted for review and approval to our President and Chief Executive Officer. Finally, upon his approval, NSAI reports the results of its reserve audit to the Board of Directors, with whom final authority over the estimates of our proved reserves rests. A copy of NSAI s report has been filed as Exhibit 99.1 to this Annual Report. 
 Proved developed reserves generally have a higher degree of accuracy in this estimation process, when compared to proved undeveloped and proved non-producing reserves, as production history and pressure data over time is available for the majority of our proved developed properties. Proved developed reserves accounted for 56 of our total reserve base as of December 31, 2022. Assigning monetary values to such estimates does not reduce the subjectivity and changing nature of such reserve estimates. The uncertainties inherent in the reserve estimates are compounded by applying additional estimates of the rates and timing of future production volumes and the costs that will be incurred in developing and producing the reserves. We cannot assure you that our internal controls sufficiently address the numerous uncertainties and risks that are inherent in estimating quantities of natural gas, oil and NGL reserves and projecting future rates of production and timing of development expenditures as many factors are beyond our control. We refer you to Our proved natural gas, oil and NGL reserves are estimates that include 
 76

 uncertainties. Any material changes to these uncertainties or underlying assumptions could cause the quantities and net present value of our reserves to be overstated or understated in Item 1A , Risk Factors, of Part I of this Annual Report for a more detailed discussion of these uncertainties, risks and other factors. 
 In conducting its audit, the engineers and geologists of NSAI study our major properties in detail and independently develop reserve estimates. NSAI's audit consists primarily of substantive testing, which includes a detailed review of all operated proved developed properties plus all proved undeveloped locations. The proved developed properties included in the NSAI audit account for approximately 98 of the proved developed reserve volume and 98 of the proved developed present worth as of December 31, 2022. The proved undeveloped properties included in the NSAI audit account for 100 of the proved undeveloped reserve volume and 100 of the proved undeveloped present worth as of December 31, 2022. In the conduct of its audit, NSAI did not independently verify the data we provided to them with respect to ownership interests, natural gas, oil and NGL production, well test data, historical costs of operation and development, product prices, or any agreements relating to current and future operations of the properties and sales of production. NSAI has advised us that if, in the course of its audit, something came to its attention that brought into question the validity or sufficiency of any such information or data, NSAI did not rely on such information or data until it had satisfactorily resolved any questions relating thereto or had independently verified such information or data. On January 31, 2023, NSAI issued its audit opinion as to the reasonableness of our reserve estimates for the year-ended December 31, 2022 stating that our estimated proved natural gas, oil and NGL reserves are, in the aggregate, reasonable and have been prepared in accordance with Standards Pertaining to the Estimating and Auditing of Oil and Gas Reserves Information promulgated by the Society of Petroleum Engineers. 
 Business Combinations 
 We account for business combinations under the acquisition method of accounting. Accordingly, we recognize amounts for identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed equal to their estimated acquisition date fair values. We make various assumptions in estimating the fair values of assets acquired and liabilities assumed. As fair value is a market-based measurement, it is determined based on the assumptions that market participants would use. The most significant assumptions relate to the estimated fair values of proved and unproved oil and natural gas properties. Fair value of proved natural gas and oil properties as of the acquisition date was based on estimated proved natural gas, oil and NGL reserves and related discounted net cash flows. Significant inputs to the valuation include estimates of future production volumes, future operating and development costs, future commodity prices and a weighted average cost of capital rate. The market-based weighted average cost of capital rate is subjected to additional project-specific risking factors. In addition, when appropriate, we review comparable purchases and sales of natural gas and oil properties within the same regions, and use that data as a proxy for fair market value as this is an indication of the amount that a willing buyer and seller would enter into in exchange for such properties. Any excess of the acquisition price over the estimated fair value of net assets acquired is recorded as goodwill. Any excess of the estimated fair value of net assets acquired over the acquisition price is recorded in current earnings as a gain on bargain purchase. Deferred taxes are recorded for any differences between the assigned values and the tax basis of assets and liabilities. 
 
 The Mergers qualified as business combinations, and as such, we estimated the fair values of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed as of respective acquisition dates. The fair value is the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date (exit price). Fair value measurements also utilize assumptions of market participants. We used discounted cash flow models and we made market assumptions as to future commodity prices, projections of estimated quantities of natural gas and oil reserves, expectations for timing and amount of future development and operating costs, projections of future rates of production, expected recovery rates and risk adjusted discount rates. These assumptions represent Level 3 inputs, as defined in Note 8 Fair Value Measurements. 
 We recorded the net assets acquired and liabilities assumed in the Indigo Merger at their estimated fair value on September 1, 2021 of approximately 1,961 million. 
 We recorded the net assets acquired and liabilities assumed in the GEPH Merger at their estimated fair value on December 31, 2021 of approximately 1,726 million (as adjusted). 
 We consider the estimated fair values above to be representative of the prices paid by typical market participants. These measurements resulted in no goodwill or bargain purchases being recognized. 
 Derivatives and Risk Management 
 We use fixed price swap agreements and options to reduce the volatility of earnings and cash flow due to fluctuations in the prices of certain commodities and interest rates. Our policies prohibit speculation with derivatives and limit agreements to counterparties with appropriate credit standings to minimize the risk of uncollectability. We actively monitor the credit status of our counterparties based on their credit ratings and credit default swap rates where applicable, and to date have not had any credit 
 77 

Table of Contents 
 I ndex to Financial Statements 

 defaults associated with our transactions. In 2022 we financially protected 82 of our total production with derivatives, compared to 83 in 2021. The primary risks related to our derivative contracts are the volatility in market prices and basis differentials for our production. However, the market price risk is generally offset by the gain or loss recognized upon the related transaction that is financially protected. 
 All derivatives are recognized in the balance sheet as either an asset or a liability as measured at fair value other than transactions for which the normal purchase/normal sale exception is applied. Certain criteria must be satisfied for derivative financial instruments to be designated for hedge accounting. Accounting guidance for qualifying hedges allows an unsettled derivative s unrealized gains and losses to be recorded in either earnings or as a component of other comprehensive income until settled. In the period of settlement, we recognize the gains and losses from these qualifying hedges in gas sales revenues. The ineffective portion of those fixed price swaps are recognized in earnings. Gains and losses on derivatives that are not designated for hedge accounting treatment, or that do not meet hedge accounting requirements, are recorded as a component of gain (loss) on derivatives on the consolidated statements of operations. Accordingly, the gain (loss) on derivatives component of the statement of operations reflects the gains and losses on both settled and unsettled derivatives. We calculate gains and losses on settled derivatives as the summation of gains and losses on positions which have settled within the reporting period. 
 As of December 31, 2022, none of our derivative contracts were designated for hedge accounting treatment. Changes in the fair value of unsettled derivatives that were not designated for hedge accounting treatment are recorded in gain (loss) on derivatives. See Note 6 to the consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report for more information on our derivative position at December 31, 2022. 
 Future market price volatility could create significant changes to the derivative positions recorded in our consolidated financial statements. We refer you to Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk in Item 7A of Part II of this Annual Report for additional information regarding our hedging activities. 
 Pension and Other Postretirement Benefits 
 As part of ongoing effort to reduce costs, we elected to freeze our pension plan effective January 1, 2021. Employees that were participants in the pension plan prior to January 1, 2021 will no longer receive the service component but will continue to receive the interest component of the plan until such time as they receive a lump sum distribution payment or their balance is converted into an annuity payment agreement as elected by the plan participant. We have commenced the pension plan termination process with the distribution of the plan s assets to participants in the form of lump sum payments in connection with a limited distribution window provided to all active and former employee participants. For those plan participants who did not elect the lump sum payment option, we expect to transfer the remaining pension obligation from the plan to a qualified insurance company by June 2023. We did not make any contributions to our pension plan during 2022 and do not currently anticipate additional funding is needed as part of the termination process. 
 We record our prepaid or accrued benefit cost, as well as our periodic benefit cost, for our pension and other postretirement benefit plans using measurement assumptions that we consider reasonable at the time of calculation (see Note 13 to the consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report for further discussion and disclosures regarding these benefit plans). Two of the assumptions that affect the amounts recorded are the discount rate, which estimates the rate at which benefits could be effectively settled, and the expected return on plan assets, which reflects the average rate of earnings expected on the funds invested. For the December 31, 2022 benefit obligation, the initial discount rate assumed is 5.60 . This compares to an initial discount rate of 3.20 for the benefit obligation and periodic benefit cost recorded in 2022. For the 2023 periodic benefit cost, the expected return was increased from 0.10 at December 31, 2021 to 4.20 at December 31, 2022. Using the assumed rates discussed above, we recorded total benefit cost of 3 million in 2022 related to our pension and other postretirement benefit plans, which included a 1 million settlement gain adjustment. 
 As of December 31, 2022, we recognized a net asset of 6 million, compared to a net liability of 25 million at December 31, 2021, related to our pension and other postretirement benefit plans. During 2022, we made no cash contributions to fund our pension and less than 1 million to fund our other postretirement benefit plans. 
 Long-term Incentive Compensation 
 Our long-term incentive compensation plans consist of a combination of stock-based awards that derive their value directly or indirectly from our common stock price, and cash-based awards that are fixed in amount, but subject to meeting annual performance thresholds. 
 We account for long-term incentive compensation transactions using a fair value method and recognize an amount equal to the fair value of the stock-based awards and cash-based awards cost in either the consolidated statement of operations or capitalize the cost into natural gas and oil properties included in property and equipment. Costs are capitalized when they are directly related 
 78 

Table of Contents 
 I ndex to Financial Statements 

 to the acquisition, exploration and development activities of our natural gas and oil properties. We use models to determine fair value of stock-based compensation, which requires significant judgment with respect to forfeitures, volatility and other factors. The performance cash awards granted in 2022 and 2021 include a performance condition determined annually by the Company. If we, in our sole discretion, determine that the threshold was not met, the amount for that vesting period will not vest and will be cancelled. 
 Our stock-based compensation is classified as either an equity award or a liability award in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. The fair value of an equity-classified award is determined at the grant date and is amortized on a straight-line basis over the vesting life of the award. The fair-value of a liability-classified award is determined on a quarterly basis through the final vesting date and is amortized based on the current fair value of the award and the percentage of vesting period incurred to date. See Note 14 to the consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report for further discussion and disclosures regarding our long-term incentive compensation. 
 New Accounting Standards 
 Refer to Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report for further discussion of our significant accounting policies and for discussion of accounting standards that have been implemented in this report, along with a discussion of relevant accounting standards that are pending adoption. 
 
 ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK 
 Market risks relating to our operations result primarily from the volatility in commodity prices, basis differentials and interest rates, as well as service costs and credit risk concentrations. We use fixed price swap agreements, options, swaptions, basis swaps and interest rate swaps to reduce the volatility of earnings and cash flow due to fluctuations in the prices of natural gas, oil and certain NGLs along with interest rates. Our Board of Directors has approved risk management policies and procedures to utilize financial products for the reduction of defined commodity price risk. Utilization of financial products for the reduction of interest rate risks is also overseen by our Board of Directors. These policies prohibit speculation with derivatives and limit swap agreements to counterparties with appropriate credit standings. 
 Credit Risk 
 Our exposure to concentrations of credit risk consists primarily of trade receivables and derivative contracts associated with commodities trading. Concentrations of credit risk with respect to receivables are limited due to the large number of our purchasers and their dispersion across geographic areas. For the year ended December 31, 2022, one purchaser accounted for 17 of our revenues. A default on this account could have a material impact on the Company. For the year ended December 31, 2021, one purchaser accounted for 12 of our revenues. See Commodities Risk below for discussion of credit risk associated with commodities trading. 
 Interest Rate Risk 
 As of December 31, 2022, we had approximately 4.2 billion of outstanding senior notes with a weighted average interest rate of 5.69 , and 250 million of borrowings under our 2022 credit facility. At December 31, 2022, we had long-term debt issuer ratings of Ba1 by Moody s, BB+ by S P and BB+ by Fitch Ratings. On September 1, 2021, S P upgraded our bond rating to BB, and on January 6, 2022, S P further upgraded our bond rating to BB+, which will have the effect of decreasing the interest rate on the 2025 notes to 5.95 , beginning with coupon payments paid after January 2022. On May 31, 2022, Moody s upgraded the Company s bond rating to Ba1, which decreased the interest rate on the 2025 Notes from 5.95 to 5.70 for coupon payments paid after July 2022. Any further upgrades or downgrades in our public debt ratings by Moody s or S P could decrease or increase our cost of funds, respectively, as our 2025 Notes are subject to ratings driven changes.

 Commodities Risk 
 We use fixed price swap agreements and options to protect sales of our production against the inherent risks of adverse price fluctuations or locational pricing differences between a published index and the NYMEX futures market. These swaps and options include transactions in which one party will pay a fixed price (or variable price) for a notional quantity in exchange for receiving a variable price (or fixed price) based on a published index (referred to as price swaps) and transactions in which parties agree to pay a price based on two different indices (referred to as basis swaps). 
 The primary market risks relating to our derivative contracts are the volatility in market prices and basis differentials for our production. However, the market price risk is offset by the gain or loss recognized upon the related sale or purchase of the production that is financially protected. Credit risk relates to the risk of loss as a result of non-performance by our counterparties. The counterparties are primarily major banks and integrated energy companies that management believes present minimal credit risks. The credit quality of each counterparty and the level of financial exposure we have to each counterparty are closely monitored to limit our credit risk exposure. Additionally, we perform both quantitative and qualitative assessments of these counterparties based on their credit ratings and credit default swap rates where applicable. We have not incurred any counterparty losses related to non-performance and do not anticipate any losses given the information we have currently. However, we cannot be certain that we will not experience such losses in the future. The fair value of our derivative assets and liabilities includes a non-performance risk factor. We refer you to Note 6 and Note 8 of the consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report for additional details about our derivative instruments and their fair value.

 Management s Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting 
 It is the responsibility of the management of Southwestern Energy Company to establish and maintain adequate internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rule 13a-15(f) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934). Management has assessed the effectiveness of the Company s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2022, utilizing the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission s Internal Control Integrated Framework (2013). 
 Based on this evaluation, management has concluded the Company s internal control over financial reporting was effective as of December 31, 2022. 
 The effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2022 has been audited by PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP, an independent registered public accounting firm, as stated in its report which appears herein. 
 
 Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm 
 To the Board of Directors and Shareholders of Southwestern Energy Company 
 Opinions on the Financial Statements and Internal Control over Financial Reporting 
 We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Southwestern Energy Company and its subsidiaries (the Company as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, and the related consolidated statements of operations, of comprehensive income (loss), of changes in equity and of cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2022, including the related notes (collectively referred to as the consolidated financial statements ). We also have audited the Company's internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2022, based on criteria established in Internal Control Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO). 
 In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2022 in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. Also in our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2022, based on criteria established in Internal Control Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the COSO. 
 Basis for Opinions 
 The Company's management is responsible for these consolidated financial statements, for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting, and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in the accompanying Management s Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express opinions on the Company s consolidated financial statements and on the Company's internal control over financial reporting based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB) and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. 
 We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audits to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud, and whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. 
 Our audits of the consolidated financial statements included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the consolidated financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the consolidated financial statements. Our audit of internal control over financial reporting included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk. Our audits also included performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinions. 
 Definition and Limitations of Internal Control over Financial Reporting 
 A company s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that 
 82 

Table of Contents 
 I ndex to Financial Statements 

 (i) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (ii) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (iii) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements. 
 Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. 
 Critical Audit Matters 
 The critical audit matter communicated below is a matter arising from the current period audit of the consolidated financial statements that was communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that (i) relates to accounts or disclosures that are material to the consolidated financial statements and (ii) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion on the consolidated financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matter below, providing a separate opinion on the critical audit matter or on the accounts or disclosures to which it relates. 
 The Impact of Proved Natural Gas, Oil and NGL Reserves on Natural Gas and Oil Properties 
 As described in Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company s consolidated natural gas and oil properties balance was 35,763 million as of December 31, 2022, and depreciation, depletion, and amortization expense for the year ended December 31, 2022 was 1,174 million. The Company utilizes the full cost method of accounting for its natural gas and oil properties. Under this method, all capitalized costs are amortized over the estimated lives of the properties using the unit-of-production method based on proved natural gas, oil and natural gas liquids (NGL) reserves. These capitalized costs are subject to a ceiling test that limits such pooled costs, net of applicable deferred taxes, to the aggregate of the present value of future net revenues attributable to proved natural gas, oil and NGL reserves discounted at 10 . As disclosed by management, proved natural gas, oil and NGL reserves are a major component of the full cost ceiling test. Estimates of reserves require extensive judgments of reservoir engineering data and projections of costs that will be incurred in developing and producing reserves. The uncertainties inherent in the reserve estimates are compounded by applying additional estimates of the rates and timing of future production volumes and the costs that will be incurred in developing and producing the reserves. The estimates of natural gas, oil and NGL reserves have been developed by specialists, specifically reservoir engineers, and audited by independent petroleum engineers (together referred to as specialists ). 
 The principal considerations for our determination that performing procedures relating to the impact of proved natural gas, oil and NGL reserves on natural gas and oil properties is a critical audit matter are (i) the significant judgment by management, including the use of management s specialists, when developing the estimate of proved natural gas, oil and NGL reserves, which in turn led to (ii) a high degree of auditor judgment, subjectivity, and effort in performing procedures and evaluating audit evidence related to the data, methods, and assumptions used by management and its specialists in developing the estimates of proved natural gas, oil and NGL reserves and the assumption applied to the full cost ceiling test related to future production volumes. 
 Addressing the matter involved performing procedures and evaluating audit evidence in connection with forming our overall opinion on the consolidated financial statements. These procedures included testing the effectiveness of controls relating to management s estimates of proved natural gas, oil and NGL reserves and the full cost ceiling test calculation. The work of management s specialists was used in performing the procedures to evaluate the reasonableness of the estimates of proved natural gas, oil and NGL reserves and the reasonableness of future production volumes applied in the full cost ceiling test. As a basis for using this work, specialists qualifications were understood and the Company s relationship with the specialists was assessed. These procedures also included evaluation of the methods and assumptions used by specialists, tests of the completeness and accuracy of the data used by the specialists, and an evaluation of specialists findings.

 segments: E P and Marketing. 
 E P. Southwestern s primary business is the development and production of natural gas as well as associated NGLs and oil, with ongoing operations focused on the development of unconventional natural gas and oil reservoirs located in Pennsylvania, West Virginia, Ohio and Louisiana. The Company s operations in Pennsylvania, West Virginia and Ohio, herein referred to as Appalachia, are primarily focused on the Marcellus Shale, the Utica and the Upper Devonian unconventional natural gas and liquids reservoirs. The Company s operations in Louisiana, herein referred to as Haynesville, are primarily focused on the Haynesville and Bossier natural gas reservoirs Haynesville and Bossier Shales ). The Company also operates drilling rigs and provides certain oilfield products and services, principally serving the Company's E P operations through vertical integration. 
 Marketing. Southwestern s marketing activities capture opportunities that arise through the marketing and transportation of natural gas, oil and NGLs primarily produced in its E P operations. 
 ownership in a limited partnership that owns and operates a gathering system in Appalachia. Because the Company owns a controlling interest in the partnership, the operating and financial results are consolidated with the Company s E P segment results. The minority partner s share of the partnership activity is reported in retained earnings in the consolidated financial statements. Net income attributable to noncontrolling interest for the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020 was insignificant. 
 purchaser accounted for of annual revenues. A default on this account could have a material impact on the Company, but the Company does not believe that there is a material risk of a default. For the year ended December 31, 2021, purchaser accounted for of annual revenues. No other purchasers accounted for more than 10 of consolidated revenues. The Company believes that the loss of any one customer would not have an adverse effect on its ability to sell its natural gas, oil and NGL production.

 million and million in cash and cash equivalents as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. 
 Certain of the Company s cash accounts are zero-balance controlled disbursement accounts. The Company presents the outstanding checks written against these zero-balance accounts as a component of accounts payable in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets. Outstanding checks included as a component of accounts payable totaled million and million as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. 
 
 Unproved properties Total capitalized costs Less: Accumulated depreciation, depletion and amortization ) ) Net capitalized costs 
 Under the full cost method of accounting, all such costs (productive and nonproductive), including salaries, benefits and other internal costs directly attributable to these activities, are capitalized on a country-by-country basis and amortized over the estimated lives of the properties using the units-of-production method. These capitalized costs are subject to a ceiling test that limits such pooled costs, net of applicable deferred taxes, to the aggregate of the present value of future net revenues attributable to proved natural gas, oil and NGL reserves discounted at (standardized measure). Any costs in excess of the ceiling are written off as a non-cash expense. The expense may not be reversed in future periods, even though higher natural gas, oil and NGL prices may subsequently increase the ceiling. Companies using the full cost method are required to use the average quoted price from the first day of each month from the previous 12 months, including the impact of derivatives designated for hedge accounting, to calculate the ceiling value of their reserves. 
 Oil (per Bbl) 
 NGLs (per Bbl) 
 
 Using the average quoted prices above, adjusted for market differentials, the net book value of the Company s United States natural gas and oil properties did not exceed the ceiling amount at December 31, 2022 or 2021. The net book value of its natural gas and oil properties exceeded the ceiling amount in each quarter of 2020 resulting in a total non-cash full cost ceiling test impairment of million. The Company had no derivative positions that were designated for hedge accounting as of December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020. Future decreases in market prices, as well as changes in production rates, levels of reserves, evaluation costs excluded from amortization, future development costs and production costs may result in future non-cash impairments to the Company s natural gas and oil properties. 
 impairment expense was recorded in 2022, 2021 or 2020 in relation to the Company s natural gas and oil properties acquired from Montage. These properties were recorded at fair value as of November 13, 2020, in accordance with Accounting Standards Codification ASC Topic 820 Fair Value Measurement . In the fourth quarter of 2020, pursuant to SEC guidance, the Company determined that the fair value of the properties acquired at the closing of the Montage Merger clearly exceeded the related full-cost ceiling limitation beyond a reasonable doubt and received a waiver from the SEC to exclude the properties acquired in the Montage Merger from the ceiling test calculation. This waiver was granted for all reporting periods through and including the quarter ending September 30, 2021, as long as the Company could continue to demonstrate that the fair value of properties acquired clearly exceeded the full cost ceiling limitation beyond a reasonable doubt in each reporting period. As part of the waiver received from the SEC, the Company was required to disclose what the full cost ceiling test impairment amounts for all periods presented in each applicable quarterly and annual filing would have been if the waiver had not been granted. The fair value of the properties acquired in the Montage Merger was based on future commodity market pricing for natural gas and oil pricing existing at the date of the Montage Merger, and management affirmed that there has not been a material decline to the fair value of these acquired assets since the Montage Merger. The properties acquired in the Montage Merger had an unamortized cost

 million. Had management not received the waiver from the SEC, the impairment charge recorded would have been an additional million for the year ended December 31, 2020. Due to the improvement in commodity prices during 2021, no impairment charge would have been recorded in 2021 even when including the Montage natural gas and oil properties in the full cost ceiling test. 
 Costs associated with unevaluated properties are excluded from the amortization base until the properties are evaluated or impairment is indicated. The costs associated with unevaluated leasehold acreage and related seismic data, wells currently drilling and related capitalized interest are initially excluded from the amortization base. Leasehold costs are either transferred to the amortization base with the costs of drilling a well on the lease or are assessed at least annually for possible impairment or reduction in value. The Company s decision to withhold costs from amortization and the timing of the transfer of those costs into the amortization base involves judgment and may be subject to changes over time based on several factors, including drilling plans, availability of capital, project economics and drilling results from adjacent acreage. At December 31, 2022, the Company had a total of million of costs excluded from the amortization base, all of which related to its properties in the United States. 
 Natural gas and oil properties not subject to amortization represent investments in unproved properties and major development projects in which the Company owns an interest. These unproved property costs include unevaluated costs associated with leasehold or drilling interests and unevaluated costs associated with wells in progress. 
 Exploration and development costs Capitalized interest 
 Of the total net unevaluated costs excluded from amortization as of December 31, 2022, approximately billion is related to undeveloped properties in Appalachia which were acquired in 2014 and 2015, million is related to Montage properties acquired in November 2020 and approximately million is related to the acquisition of undeveloped properties in Haynesville which were acquired in September 2021 and December 2021. Additionally, the Company has approximately million of unevaluated capitalized interest. The Company has million of unevaluated costs related to wells in progress (included within the Appalachia, Montage and Haynesville amounts above). The remaining costs excluded from amortization are related to properties which are not individually significant and on which the evaluation process has not been completed. The timing and amount of property acquisition and seismic costs included in the amortization computation will depend on the location and timing of drilling wells, results of drilling and other assessments. The Company is, therefore, unable to estimate when these costs will be included in the amortization computation. 
 Capitalized Interest . Interest is capitalized on the cost of unevaluated natural gas and oil properties that are excluded from amortization. 
 Asset Retirement Obligations . Natural gas and oil properties require expenditures to plug and abandon the wells and reclaim the associated pads and other supporting infrastructure when the wells are no longer producing. An asset retirement obligation associated with the retirement of a tangible long-lived asset such as oil and gas properties is recognized as a liability in the period incurred or when it becomes determinable, with an associated increase in the carrying amount of the related long-lived asset. The cost of the tangible asset, including the asset retirement cost, is depreciated over the useful life of the asset. The asset retirement obligation is recorded at its estimated fair value, and accretion expense is recognized over time as the discounted liability is accreted to its expected settlement value. 
 Other Property and Equipment. The Company s non-full cost pool assets include water facilities, gathering systems, technology infrastructure, land, buildings and other equipment with useful lives that range from to years.

 Impairment of Long-Lived Assets . The carrying value of non-full cost pool long-lived assets is evaluated for recoverability whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that it may not be recoverable. Should an impairment exist, the impairment loss would be measured as the amount that the asset s carrying value exceeds its fair value. The company did not recognize an impairment during the year ended December 31, 2022 and recognized impairments of million and million related to non-core assets for the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively. 
 Intangible Assets . The carrying value of intangible assets are evaluated for recoverability whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that it may not be recoverable. Intangible assets are amortized over their useful life. At December 31, 2022 and 2021, the Company had million and million, respectively, in marketing-related intangible assets, of which million and million were included in Other long-term assets on the respective consolidated balance sheets. The Company amortized million of its marketing-related intangible asset in 2022, million in 2021 and million in 2020. The Company expects to amortize million in 2023 and in each of the four years thereafter.

 The fair value hierarchy prioritizes the inputs to valuation techniques used to measure fair value. As presented in the tables below, this hierarchy consists of three broad levels: 
 Level 1 valuations Consist of unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets and liabilities and have the highest priority. Level 2 valuations Consist of quoted market information for the calculation of fair market value. Level 3 valuations Consist of internal estimates and have the lowest priority. 
 The carrying values of cash and cash equivalents, including marketable securities, accounts receivable, other current assets, accounts payable and other current liabilities on the consolidated balance sheets approximate fair value because of their short-term nature. For debt and derivative instruments, the following methods and assumptions were used to estimate fair value:

 Senior Notes due March 2022 was considered to be a Level 2 measurement on the fair value hierarchy as of December 31, 2021. The fair values of the Company's more actively traded remaining senior notes are considered to be a Level 1 measurement. The carrying values of the borrowings under both the Company's 2022 credit facility (to the extent utilized) and Term Loan approximates fair value because the interest rates are variable and reflective of market rates. The Company considers the fair values of its 2022 credit facility and Term Loan to be a Level 1 measurement on the fair value hierarchy. 
 Derivative Instruments: The Company measures the fair value of its derivative instruments based upon a pricing model that utilizes market-based inputs, including, but not limited to, the contractual price of the underlying position, current market prices, natural gas and liquids forward curves, discount rates for a similar duration of each outstanding position, volatility factors and non-performance risk. Non-performance risk considers the effect of the Company s credit standing on the fair value of derivative liabilities and the effect of counterparty credit standing on the fair value of derivative assets. Both inputs to the model are based on published credit default swap rates and the duration of each outstanding derivative position. As of December 31, 2022, the impact of non-performance risk on the fair value of the Company s net derivative liability position was a reduction of the liability of million. 
 The Company has classified its derivative instruments into levels depending upon the data utilized to determine their fair values. The Company s fixed price swaps (Level 2) are estimated using third-party discounted cash flow calculations using the New York Mercantile Exchange NYMEX futures index for natural gas and oil derivatives and Oil Price Information Service OPIS for ethane and propane derivatives. The Company utilizes discounted cash flow models for valuing its interest rate derivatives (Level 2). The net derivative values attributable to the Company s interest rate derivative contracts are based on (i) the contracted notional amounts, (ii) active market-quoted yield curves and (iii) the applicable credit-adjusted risk-free rate yield curve. The Company had no interest rate swaps as of December 31, 2022. 
 The Company s call and put options, two-way costless collars, and three-way costless collars (Level 2) are valued using the Black-Scholes model, an industry standard option valuation model that takes into account inputs such as contract terms, including maturity, and market parameters, including assumptions of the NYMEX and OPIS futures index, interest rates, volatility and credit worthiness. Inputs to the Black-Scholes model, including the volatility input are obtained from a third-party pricing source, with independent verification of the most significant inputs on a monthly basis. An increase (decrease) in volatility would result in an increase (decrease) in fair value measurement, respectively. 
 The Company s basis swaps (Level 2) are estimated using third-party calculations based upon forward commodity price curves.

 Effective August 4, 2022, the Company elected to temporarily increase commitments under the 2022 credit facility by million under the Short-Term Tranche as a temporary working capital liquidity resource. Any loans under the Short-Term Tranche bear interest at either (i) term SOFR plus an applicable rate of plus a credit spread adjustment or (ii) the base rate described below plus an applicable rate of , and unused commitments thereunder incur commitment fees at a rate of per annum. Through December 31, 2022, the Company has had no borrowings under the Short-Term Tranche. 
 The Company may utilize the 2022 credit facility in the form of loans and letters of credit. Loans under the Five-Year Tranche of the 2022 credit facility are subject to varying rates of interest based on whether the loan is a SOFR loan or an alternate base rate loan.

 a restriction on creating liens on assets, subject to permitted exceptions; 
 restrictions on mergers and asset dispositions; 
 restrictions on use of proceeds, investments, declaring dividends, repurchasing junior debt, transactions with affiliates, or change of principal business; and

 (1) Minimum current ratio of no less than to 1.00, whereby current ratio is defined as the Company s consolidated current assets (including unused commitments under the credit agreement, but excluding non-cash derivative assets) to consolidated current liabilities (excluding non-cash derivative obligations and current maturities of long-term debt). 
 (2) Maximum total net leverage ratio of no greater than, with respect to the prior four fiscal quarters ending on or after March 31, 2022, to 1.00. Total net leverage ratio is defined as total debt less cash on hand (up to the lesser of of credit limit or million) divided by consolidated EBITDAX for the last four consecutive quarters. EBITDAX, as defined in the credit agreement governing the Company s 2022 credit facility, excludes the effects of interest expense, depreciation, depletion and amortization, income tax, any non-cash impacts from impairments, certain non-cash hedging activities, stock-based compensation expense, non-cash gains or losses on asset sales, unamortized issuance cost, unamortized debt discount and certain restructuring costs.

On September 1, 2021, S P upgraded the Company s bond rating to BB, and on January 6, 2022, S P further upgraded the Company s bond rating to BB+, which decreased the interest rate on the 2025 Notes to beginning with coupon payments paid after January 2022. On May 31, 2022, Moody s upgraded the Company s bond rating to Ba1, which decreased the interest rate on the 2025 Notes from to for coupon payments paid after July 2022.

 Prior to the Indigo Merger, in May 2021, Indigo closed on an agreement to divest its Cotton Valley natural gas and oil properties. Indigo retained certain contractual commitments related to volume commitments associated with natural gas gathering, for which Southwestern assumed the obligation to pay the gathering provider for any unused portion of the volume commitment under the agreement through 2027, depending on the buyer s actual use. As of December 31, 2022, up to approximately million of these contractual commitments remain (included in the table above), and the Company has recorded a million liability for its portion of the estimated future payments. 
 Excluding the Cotton Valley gathering agreement (discussed above), the Company has recorded additional liabilities totaling million as of December 31, 2022, primarily related to purchase or volume commitments associated with gathering and fresh water. These amounts are reflected above and will be recognized as payments are made over a month period. 
 The Company leases pressure pumping equipment for its E P operations under three leases that expire in 2027 and 2028. The current aggregate annual payment under these leases is approximately million. The Company has leases for drilling rigs for its E P operations that expire through 2028 with a current aggregate annual payment of approximately million. The lease payments for the pressure pumping equipment, as well as other operating expenses for the Company s drilling operations, are capitalized to natural gas and oil properties and are partially offset by billings to third-party working interest owners. 
 The Company leases office space, vehicles and equipment under non-cancelable operating leases expiring through 2036. As of December 31, 2022, future minimum payments under these non-cancelable leases accounted for as operating leases (including short-term) are approximately million in 2023, million in 2024, million in 2025, million in 2026, million in 2027 and million thereafter. 
 The Company also has commitments for compression services and compression rentals related to its E P segment. As of December 31, 2022, future minimum payments under these non-cancelable agreements (including short-term obligations) are approximately million in 2023, million in 2024, million in 2025 and less than million in 2026. 
 Environmental Risk 
 The Company is subject to laws and regulations relating to the protection of the environment. Environmental and cleanup related costs of a non-capital nature are accrued when it is both probable that a liability has been incurred and when the amount can be reasonably estimated. Management believes any future remediation or other compliance related costs will not have a material effect on the financial position, results of operations or cash flows of the Company. 
 Litigation 
 The Company is subject to various litigation, claims and proceedings, most of which have arisen in the ordinary course of business such as for alleged breaches of contract, miscalculation of royalties, employment matters, traffic accidents, pollution, contamination, encroachment on others property or nuisance. The Company accrues for litigation, claims and proceedings when a liability is both probable and the amount can be reasonably estimated. As of December 31, 2022, the Company does not currently have any material amounts accrued related to litigation matters, including the case discussed below. For any matters not accrued for, it is not possible at this time to estimate the amount of any additional loss, or range of loss, that is reasonably possible, but, based on the nature of the claims, management believes that current litigation, claims and proceedings, individually or in aggregate and after taking into account insurance, are not likely to have a material adverse impact on the Company s financial position, results of operations or cash flows, for the period in which the effect of that outcome becomes reasonably estimable. Many of these matters are in early stages, so the allegations and the damage theories have not been fully developed, and are all subject to inherent uncertainties; therefore, management s view may change in the future.

 individuals and entities filed a lawsuit against oil and gas company defendants, including Indigo, in Louisiana state court claiming damages arising out of current and historical exploration and production activity on certain acreage located in DeSoto Parish, Louisiana. The plaintiffs, who claim to own the properties at issue, assert that Indigo s actions and the actions of other current operators conducting exploration and production activity, combined with the improper plugging and abandoning of legacy wells by former operators, have caused environmental contamination to their properties. Among other things, the plaintiffs contend that the defendants conduct resulted in the migration of natural gas, along with oilfield contaminants, into the Carrizo-Wilcox aquifer system underlying certain portions of DeSoto Parish. The plaintiffs assert claims based in tort, breach of contract and for violations of the Louisiana Civil and Mineral Codes, and they seek injunctive relief and monetary damages in an unspecified amount, including punitive damages. 
 On September 13, 2018, Indigo and other defendants filed a variety of exceptions in response to the plaintiffs petition in this matter. Since the initial filing, supplemental petitions have been filed joining additional individuals and entities as plaintiffs in the matter. On September 29, 2020, plaintiffs filed their fourth supplemental and amending petition in response to the court s order ruling that plaintiffs claims were improperly vague and failed to identify with reasonable specificity the defendants allegedly wrongful conduct. Indigo and the majority of the other defendants filed several exceptions to plaintiffs fourth amended petition challenging the sufficiency of plaintiffs allegations and seeking dismissal of certain claims. On February 18, 2021, plaintiffs filed a fifth supplemental and amending petition, which seeks to augment the claims of select plaintiffs. On October 11, 2021, a sixth supplemental petition was filed which seeks to add the Company as a party to the litigation which the Company has opposed. Plaintiffs later filed seventh and eighth supplemental petitions naming additional defendants. Fact discovery for the case is ongoing. 
 The presence of natural gas in a localized area of the Carrizo-Wilcox aquifer system in DeSoto Parish is currently the subject of a regulatory investigation by the Louisiana Office of Conservation Conservation ), and the Company is cooperating and coordinating with Conservation in that investigation. The Conservation matter number is EMER18-003. 
 The Company does not currently expect this matter to have a material impact on its financial position, results of operations, cash flows or liquidity. 
 Indemnifications 
 The Company has provided certain indemnifications to various third parties, including in relation to asset and entity dispositions, securities offerings and other financings. In the case of asset dispositions, these indemnifications typically relate to disputes, litigation or tax matters existing at the date of disposition. The Company likewise obtains indemnification for future matters when it sells assets, although there is no assurance the buyer will be capable of performing those obligations. In the case of equity offerings, these indemnifications typically relate to claims asserted against underwriters in connection with an offering. material liabilities have been recognized in connection with these indemnifications.

 Due to the issuance of common stock associated with the Indigo Merger, as discussed in Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements to this Annual Report, the Company incurred a cumulative ownership change and as such, the Company s net operating losses NOLs prior to the acquisition are subject to an annual limitation under Internal Revenue Code Section 382 of approximately million. The ownership changes and resulting annual limitation will result in the expiration of NOLs or other tax attributes otherwise available, with a corresponding decrease in the Company s valuation allowance. At December 31, 2022, the Company had approximately billion of federal NOL carryovers, of which approximately billion have an expiration date between 2035 and 2037 and billion have an indefinite carryforward life. The Company currently estimates that approximately billion of these federal NOLs will expire before they are able to be used. The non-expiring NOLs remain subject to a full valuation allowance. If a subsequent ownership change were to occur as a result of future transactions in the Company s common stock, the Company s use of remaining U.S. tax attributes may be further limited. Included in the Company s net operating loss carryforward are the net operating loss carryforwards acquired in the Montage acquisition of million. A portion of the Montage-related net operating loss carryovers is subject to an annual section 382 limitation of million, and the Company has appropriately accounted for this limitation in purchase accounting in 2020. Additionally, the Company has an income tax net operating loss carryforward related to its Canadian operations of million, with expiration dates of 2030 through 2040. The Company also had a statutory depletion carryforward of million and million related to interest deduction carryforward as of December 31, 2022. 
 A valuation allowance for deferred tax assets, including net operating losses, is recognized when it is more likely than not that some or all of the benefit from the deferred tax assets will not be realized. To assess that likelihood, the Company uses

 million related to net operating losses in jurisdictions in which it no longer operates. Management will continue to assess available positive and negative evidence to estimate whether sufficient future taxable income will be generated to permit the use of deferred tax assets. The Company intends to continue a full valuation allowance on its deferred tax assets until there is sufficient evidence to support the reversal of all or some portion of the allowance. However, if current commodity prices are sustained and absent any additional objective negative evidence, the Company anticipates adjusting the current valuation allowance position in 2023.

 Defined Benefit Pension and Other Postretirement Plans 
 Prior to January 1, 2021, substantially all of the Company s employees were covered by the defined benefit pension plan, a cash balance plan that provided benefits based upon a fixed percentage of an employee s annual compensation. As part of an ongoing effort to reduce costs, the Company elected to freeze its pension plan effective January 1, 2021. Employees that were participants in the pension plan prior to January 1, 2021 will no longer receive an increased benefit based on service after December 31, 2020 but will continue to receive an increased benefit based on the interest component of the plan until such time as they receive a lump sum distribution payment or their balance is converted into an annuity payment agreement as elected by the plan participant. On September 13, 2021, the Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors approved terminating the Company s pension plan, effective December 31, 2021. This decision, among other benefits, will provide plan participants quicker access to, and greater flexibility in, the management of participants respective benefits due under the plan. 
 The Company has commenced the pension plan termination process, and, on April 6, 2022, the Internal Revenue Service issued a favorable determination letter, concurring that the plan has met all of the qualification requirements under the Internal Revenue Code. In December 2022, the Company distributed approximately of the plan s assets to participants in the form of lump sum payments in connection with a limited distribution window provided to all active and former employee participants as part of the plan termination process. For those plan participants who did not elect the lump sum payment option, the Company expects to transfer the remaining pension obligation from the plan to a qualified insurance company by June 2023. As of December 31, 2022, the assets held by the pension plan exceeded the plan s benefit payment obligation by million, as determined after the lump sum distributions were made. 
 The postretirement benefit plan provides contributory health care and life insurance benefits. Employees become eligible for these benefits if they meet age and service requirements. Generally, the benefits paid are a stated percentage of medical expenses reduced by deductibles and other coverages. 
 Substantially all of the Company s employees continue to be covered by the postretirement benefit plans. The Company accounts for its defined benefit pension and other postretirement plans by recognizing the funded status of each defined pension benefit plan and other postretirement benefit plan on the Company s balance sheet. In the event a plan is overfunded, the Company recognizes an asset. Conversely, if a plan is underfunded, the Company recognizes a liability.

The Benefits Administration Committee BAC of the Company, appointed by the Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors, currently administers the Company s pension plan assets. In anticipation of the pension plan termination, the BAC has adjusted the asset-class mix to more investment grade fixed income assets to mitigate equity market risk, while also preserving cash to satisfy potential interim plan termination-related expenditures. 
 The table below presents the allocation ranges targeted by the BAC and the actual weighted-average asset allocation of the Company s pension plan as of December 31, 2022, by asset category.

 The Company s current long-term incentive compensation plans consist of a combination of stock-based awards that derive their value directly or indirectly from the Company s common stock price, and cash-based awards that are fixed in amount but are subject to meeting annual performance thresholds. 
 Long-term incentive compensation capitalized 
 Stock-Based Compensation 
 The Company s stock-based compensation is classified as either equity or liability awards in accordance with GAAP. The fair value of an equity-classified award is determined at the grant date and is amortized to general and administrative expense and capitalized expense on a straight-line basis over the vesting period of the award. The fair value of a liability-classified award is determined on a quarterly basis beginning at the grant date until final vesting. Changes in the fair value of liability-classified awards are recorded to general and administrative expense over the vesting period of the award. A portion of this general and administrative expense is capitalized into natural gas and oil properties, included in property and equipment. Generally, stock options granted to employees and directors vest ratably over from the grant date and expire years from the date of grant. The Company issues shares of restricted stock or restricted stock units to employees and directors which generally vest over .

To the extent no provision is made in connection with a change in control (as defined in the 2022 Plan) for the assumption of awards previously granted under the 2022 Plan substitution of such awards for new awards, then (i) outstanding time-based awards will become fully vested, and (ii) each outstanding performance-based award will vest with respect to the number of shares of common stock underlying such award or the amount of cash underlying the award eligible to vest based on performance during the performance period that includes the date of the change in control, prorated for the number of days which have elapsed during the performance period prior to the change in control. To the extent an award is assumed or substituted in connection with the change in control, if a participant is terminated by the Company without cause or the participant resigns for good reason (each as defined in the 2022 Plan) within 12 months following a change in control, then (i) each time-based award will become fully vested, and (ii) each outstanding performance-based award will vest based on performance during the performance period that includes the date of the change in control, prorated for the number of days which have elapsed during the performance period prior to such termination.

The performance units granted from 2019 through 2021 were accounted for as liability-classified awards as further described below. In 2022, two types of performance units were granted. The first type was liability-classified given the awards are payable in cash as prescribed under the compensation agreements. The second type of awards granted during 2022 have been accounted for as equity-classified awards given the intention to settle in stock and accordingly are recognized at their fair value as of the grant date and amortized throughout the vesting period. The 2022 performance units include a market condition based on relative TSR (as defined below). The fair values of the market conditions were calculated by Monte Carlo models as of the grant date. As of December 31, 2022, there was million of total unrecognized compensation costs related to the Company s unvested equity-classified performance units. This cost is expected to be recognized over a weighted-average of years. There were no costs recognized for the year ended December 31, 2021 associated with equity-classified performance units, and the amounts recognized in 2020 were immaterial.

 Natural Gas and Oil Reserve Quantities 
 The Company engaged the services of Netherland, Sewell Associates, Inc., or NSAI, an independent petroleum engineering firm, to audit the reserves estimated by the Company s reservoir engineers. In conducting its audit, the engineers and geologists of NSAI studied the Company s major properties in detail and independently developed reserve estimates. NSAI s audit consists primarily of substantive testing, which includes a detailed review of the Company s major properties, and accounted for approximately of the present worth of the Company s total proved reserves as of December 31, 2022. For 2021 and 2020, NSAI s audit accounted for and , respectively, of the then-present worth of the Company s total proved properties. A reserve audit is not the same as a financial audit, and a reserve audit is less rigorous in nature than a reserve report prepared by an independent petroleum engineering firm containing its own estimate of reserves. Reserve estimates are inherently imprecise, and the Company s reserve estimates are generally based upon extrapolation of historical production trends, historical prices of natural gas and crude oil and analogy to similar properties and volumetric calculations. Accordingly, the Company s estimates are expected to change, and such changes could be material and occur in the near term as future information becomes available.

 In accordance with your request, we have audited the estimates prepared by Southwestern Energy Company (Southwestern), as of December 31, 2022, of the proved reserves and future revenue to the Southwestern interest in certain oil and gas properties located in the United States. It is our understanding that the proved reserves estimates shown herein constitute all of the proved reserves owned by Southwestern. We have examined the estimates with respect to reserves quantities, reserves categorization, future producing rates, future net revenue, and the present value of such future net revenue, using the definitions set forth in U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) Regulation S-X Rule 4-10(a). The estimates of reserves and future revenue have been prepared in accordance with the definitions and regulations of the SEC and, with the exception of the exclusion of future income taxes, conform to the FASB Accounting Standards Codification Topic 932, Extractive Activities Oil and Gas. We completed our audit on or about the date of this letter. This report has been prepared for Southwestern s use in filing with the SEC in our opinion the assumptions, data, methods, and procedures used in the preparation of this report are appropriate for such purpose. 
 
 The following table sets forth Southwestern s estimates of the net reserves and future net revenue, as of December 31, 2022, for the audited properties 
 Net Reserves Future Net Revenue (MM Oil NGL Gas Present Worth Category (MBBL) (MBBL) (BCF) Total at 10 Proved Developed Producing 37,994.7 331,355.1 9,426.3 53,187.5 26,132.6 Proved Developed Non-Producing 3,143.3 19,465.7 367.2 2,383.8 1,357.1 Proved Undeveloped 42,247.8 276,314.7 7,568.7 39,370.6 18,936.0 Total Proved 83,385.8 627,135.5 17,362.2 94,941.9 46,425.7 
 
 The oil volumes shown include crude oil and condensate. Oil and natural gas liquids (NGL) volumes are expressed in thousands of barrels (MBBL) a barrel is equivalent to 42 United States gallons. Gas volumes are expressed in billions of cubic feet (BCF) at standard temperature and pressure bases. 
 
 When compared on a well-by-well basis, some of the estimates of Southwestern are greater and some are less than the estimates of Netherland, Sewell & Associates, Inc. (NSAI). However, in our opinion the estimates shown herein of Southwestern s reserves and future revenue are reasonable when aggregated at the proved level and have been prepared in accordance with the Standards Pertaining to the Estimating and Auditing of Oil and Gas Reserves Information promulgated by the Society of Petroleum Engineers (SPE Standards). Additionally, these estimates are within the recommended 10 percent tolerance threshold set forth in the SPE Standards. We are satisfied with the methods and procedures used by Southwestern in preparing the December 31, 2022, estimates of reserves and future revenue, and we saw nothing of an unusual nature that would cause us to take exception with the estimates, in the aggregate, as prepared by Southwestern. 
 
 Reserves categorization conveys the relative degree of certainty reserves subcategorization is based on development and production status. The estimates of reserves and future revenue included herein have not been adjusted for risk. 

Southwestern s estimates do not include probable or possible reserves that may exist for these properties, nor do they include any value for undeveloped acreage beyond those tracts for which undeveloped reserves have been estimated. 
 
 Prices used by Southwestern are based on the 12-month unweighted arithmetic average of the first-day-of-the-month price for each month in the period January through December 2022. For oil and NGL volumes, the average West Texas Intermediate spot price of 93.67 per barrel is adjusted for quality, transportation fees, and market differentials. For gas volumes, the average Henry Hub spot price of 6.357 per MMBTU is adjusted for energy content, transportation fees, and market differentials. All prices are held constant throughout the lives of the properties. The average adjusted product prices weighted by production over the remaining lives of the properties are 86.77 per barrel of oil, 34.67 per barrel of NGL, and 5.94 per MCF of gas. 
 
 Operating costs used by Southwestern are based on historical operating expense records. For the nonoperated properties, these costs include the per-well overhead expenses allowed under joint operating agreements along with estimates of costs to be incurred at and below the district and field levels. Operating costs for the operated properties are limited to direct lease- and field-level costs and Southwestern s estimate of the portion of its headquarters general and administrative overhead expenses necessary to operate the properties. Operating costs have been divided into per-well costs and per-unit-of-production costs. Capital costs used by Southwestern are based on authorizations for expenditure and actual costs from recent activity. Capital costs are included as required for workovers, new development wells, and production equipment. Abandonment costs used are Southwestern s estimates of the costs to abandon the wells and production facilities these estimates do not include any salvage value for the lease and well equipment. Operating, capital, and abandonment costs are not escalated for inflation. 
 
 The reserves shown in this report are estimates only and should not be construed as exact quantities. Proved reserves are those quantities of oil and gas which, by analysis of engineering and geoscience data, can be estimated with reasonable certainty to be economically producible probable and possible reserves are those additional reserves which are sequentially less certain to be recovered than proved reserves. Estimates of reserves may increase or decrease as a result of market conditions, future operations, changes in regulations, or actual reservoir performance. In addition to the primary economic assumptions discussed herein, estimates of Southwestern and NSAI are based on certain assumptions including, but not limited to, that the properties will be developed consistent with current development plans as provided to us by Southwestern, that the properties will be operated in a prudent manner, that no governmental regulations or controls will be put in place that would impact the ability of the interest owner to recover the reserves, and that projections of future production will prove consistent with actual performance. If the reserves are recovered, the revenues therefrom and the costs related thereto could be more or less than the estimated amounts. Because of governmental policies and uncertainties of supply and demand, the sales rates, prices received for the reserves, and costs incurred in recovering such reserves may vary from assumptions made while preparing these estimates. 
 
 It should be understood that our audit does not constitute a complete reserves study of the audited oil and gas properties. Our audit consisted primarily of substantive testing, wherein we conducted a detailed review of major properties making up approximately 99 percent of the total proved reserves and accounting for approximately 99 percent of the present worth for those reserves. In the conduct of our audit, we have not independently verified the accuracy and completeness of information and data furnished by Southwestern with respect to ownership interests, oil and gas production, well test data, historical costs of operation and development, product prices, or any agreements relating to current and future operations of the properties and sales of production. However, if in the course of our examination something came to our attention that brought into question the validity or sufficiency of any such information or data, we did not rely on such information or data until we had satisfactorily resolved our questions relating thereto or had independently verified such information or data. Our audit did not include a review of Southwestern s overall reserves management processes and practices. 
 
 We used standard engineering and geoscience methods, or a combination of methods, including performance analysis and analogy, that we considered to be appropriate and necessary to establish the conclusions set forth herein. As in all aspects of oil and gas evaluation, there are uncertainties inherent in the interpretation of engineering and geoscience data therefore, our conclusions necessarily represent only informed professional judgment.
