PART I. 

ITEM 1. BUSINESS 
 
 OVERVIEW 
 We are a California-based holding company with energy infrastructure investments in North America. Our businesses invest in, develop and operate energy infrastructure, and provide electric and gas services to customers. 
 Sempra was formed in 1998 through a business combination of Enova and PE, the holding companies of our regulated public utilities in California: SDG E, which began operations in 1881, and SoCalGas, which began operations in 1867. We have since expanded our regulated public utility presence into Texas through our 80.25 interest in Oncor and 50 interest in Sharyland Utilities. Sempra Infrastructure s assets include investments in the U.S. and Mexico with a focus on LNG and net zero solutions, energy networks and clean power. 
 Business Strategy 
 Our mission is to be North America s premier energy infrastructure company.

SDG E s assets at December 31, 2022 covered the following territory: 

Electric Utility Operations 
 Electric Transmission and Distribution System. Service to SDG E s customers is supported by its electric transmission and distribution system, which includes substations and overhead and underground lines. These electric facilities are primarily in the San Diego, Imperial and Orange counties of California, and in Arizona and Nevada and consisted of 1,928 miles of transmission lines, 23,928 miles of distribution lines and 157 substations at December 31, 2022. Occasionally, various areas of the service territory require expansion to accommodate customer growth and maintain reliability and safety. 
 SDG E s 500-kV Southwest Powerlink transmission line, which is shared with Arizona Public Service Company and Imperial Irrigation District, extends from Palo Verde, Arizona to San Diego, California. SDG E s share of the line is 1,163 MW, although it can be less under certain system conditions. SDG E s Sunrise Powerlink is a 500-kV transmission line constructed by SDG E and operated by the California ISO. Both of these lines together provide SDG E with import capability of 3,900 MW of power. 
 Mexico s Baja California transmission system is connected to SDG E s system via two 230-kV interconnections with combined capacity of up to 600 MW in the north-to-south direction and 800 MW in the south-to-north direction. However, it can be less under certain system conditions. 
 Edison s transmission system is connected to SDG E s system via five 230-kV transmission lines.

Electric Resources. To meet customer demand, SDG E supplies power from its own electric generation facilities and procures power on a long-term basis from other suppliers for resale through CPUC-approved purchased-power contracts or purchases on the spot market. SDG E does not earn any return on commodity sales volumes. SDG E s electric resources at December 31, 2022 were as follows:

 (1) Excludes approximately 321 MW of energy storage owned and approximately 164 MW of energy storage contracted. 
 (2) SDG E owns and operates four natural gas-fired power plants, three of which are in California and one is in Nevada. 
 
 Charges under contracts with suppliers are based on the amount of energy received or are tolls based on available capacity. Tolling contracts are purchased-power contracts under which SDG E provides natural gas to the energy supplier. 
 SDG E procures natural gas under short-term contracts for its owned generation facilities and for certain tolling contracts associated with purchased-power arrangements. Purchases from various southwestern U.S. suppliers are primarily priced based on published monthly bid-week indices, which can be subject to volatility. 
 SDG E participates in the Western Systems Power Pool, which includes an electric-power and transmission-rate agreement that allows access to power trading with more than 300 member utilities, power agencies, energy brokers and power marketers throughout the U.S. and Canada. Participants can make power transactions on standardized terms, including market-based rates, preapproved by the FERC. Participation in the Western Systems Power Pool is intended to assist members in managing power delivery and price risk. 
 Customers and Demand. SDG E provides electric services through the generation, transmission and distribution of electricity to the following customer classes:

 (1) Includes intercompany sales. 
 
 SDG E currently provides procurement service for a portion of its customer load. Most customers receive procurement service from a load-serving entity other than SDG E through programs such as CCA and DA. In such cases, SDG E no longer procures energy for this departing load. Accordingly, SDG E s CCA and DA customers receive primarily transportation and distribution services from SDG E. 
 CCA is only available if the customer s local jurisdiction (city or county) offers such a program and DA is currently limited by a cap based on gigawatt hours. Several jurisdictions in SDG E's territory have implemented CCA, including the City of San Diego in 2022. Additional jurisdictions are in the process of implementing or considering CCA. 
 2022 Form 10-K | 15 

Table of Contents 

SDG E s historical energy procurement for future deliveries exceeds the needs of its remaining bundled customers as customers have elected CCA and DA services. To help achieve the goal of ratepayer indifference (as to whether or not customers energy is procured by SDG E or by CCA or DA), the CPUC revised the Power Charge Indifference Adjustment framework. The purpose of the framework is to help ensure SDG E s procurement cost obligations are more equitably shared among customers served by SDG E and customers now served by CCA or DA. SDG E implemented the framework on January 1, 2019. 
 San Diego s mild climate and SDG E s robust energy efficiency programs contribute to lower consumption by our customers. Rooftop solar installations continue to reduce residential and commercial volumes sold by SDG E. At December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020, the residential and commercial rooftop solar capacity in SDG E s territory totaled 1,864 MW, 1,620 MW and 1,423 MW, respectively. 
 Electricity demand is dependent on the health and expansion of the Southern California economy, prices of alternative energy products, consumer preference, environmental regulations, legislation, renewable power generation, the effectiveness of energy efficiency programs, demand-side management impact and distributed generation resources. California s energy policy supports increased electrification, particularly electrification of vehicles, which could significantly increase sales volumes in the coming years. Other external factors, such as the price of purchased power, the use of hydroelectric power, the use of and further development of renewable energy resources and energy storage, the development of or requirements for new natural gas supply sources, demand for and supply of natural gas and general economic conditions, can also result in significant shifts in the market price of electricity, which may in turn impact demand. Electricity demand is also impacted by seasonal weather patterns (or seasonality ), tending to increase in the summer months to meet the cooling load and in the winter months to meet the heating load. 
 Competition. SDG E faces competition to serve its customer load from distributed and local power generation growth, including solar installations. In addition, the electric industry is undergoing rapid technological change, and third-party energy storage alternatives and other technologies may increasingly compete with SDG E s traditional transmission and distribution infrastructure in delivering electricity to consumers. 
 Natural Gas Utility Operations 
 We describe SDG E s natural gas utility operations below in Sempra California s Natural Gas Utility Operations. 
 
 SoCalGas 
 SoCalGas is a regulated public utility that owns and operates a natural gas distribution, transmission and storage system that delivers natural gas to a population of, at December 31, 2022, approximately 21.1 million, covering a 24,000 square mile service territory that encompasses Southern California and portions of central California (excluding San Diego County, the City of Long Beach and the desert area of San Bernardino County).

 Sempra California s Natural Gas Utility Operations 
 Natural Gas Procurement and Transportation 
 At December 31, 2022, SoCalGas natural gas facilities included 3,046 miles of transmission and storage pipelines, 52,020 miles of distribution pipelines, 48,918 miles of service pipelines and nine transmission compressor stations, and SDG E s natural gas facilities consisted of 168 miles of transmission pipelines, 9,112 miles of distribution pipelines, 6,718 miles of service pipelines and one compressor station. 
 SoCalGas and SDG E s gas transmission pipelines interconnect with four major interstate pipeline systems: El Paso Natural Gas, Transwestern Pipeline, Kern River Pipeline Company, and Mojave Pipeline Company, allowing customers to bring gas supplies into the SoCalGas gas transmission pipeline system from the various out-of-state gas producing basins. Additionally, an interconnection with PG E s intrastate gas transmission pipeline system allows gas to flow into SoCalGas gas transmission pipeline system. SoCalGas gas transmission pipeline system also has an interconnect with a Mexican gas pipeline company at Otay Mesa on the California/Mexico border that allows gas to not only flow south from the gas producing basins in the southwestern U.S., but to also flow north into SoCalGas gas transmission pipeline system from LNG-sourced supplies in Mexico. There are also several in-state gas interconnections allowing for delivery of California-produced gas, including a number of direct connections from renewable natural gas producers. 
 SoCalGas purchases natural gas under short-term and long-term contracts and on the spot market for SDG E s and SoCalGas core customers. SoCalGas purchases natural gas from various sources, including from Canada, the U.S. Rockies and the southwestern regions of the U.S. Purchases of natural gas are primarily priced based on published monthly bid week indices, 
 2022 Form 10-K | 17 

Table of Contents 

which can be subject to volatility. The cost of purchases of natural gas for SDG E s and SoCalGas core customers is billed to those customers without markup. 
 To support the delivery of natural gas supplies to its distribution system and to meet the needs of customers, SoCalGas has firm and variable interstate pipeline capacity contracts that require the payment of fixed and variable tariffed and negotiated reservation charges to reserve firm transportation rights. Energy companies, primarily El Paso Natural Gas Company, Transwestern Pipeline Company and Kern River Gas Transmission Company, provide transportation services into SoCalGas intrastate transmission system for supplies purchased by SoCalGas. 
 Natural Gas Storage 
 SoCalGas owns four natural gas storage facilities with a combined working gas capacity of 137 Bcf and 126 injection, withdrawal and observation wells that provide natural gas storage service. SoCalGas and SDG E s core customers, along with certain third-party market participants, are allocated a portion of SoCalGas storage capacity. SoCalGas uses the remaining storage capacity for load balancing services for all customers. Natural gas withdrawn from storage is important to help maintain service reliability during peak demand periods, including consumer heating needs in the winter, as well as peak electric generation needs in the summer. The Aliso Canyon natural gas storage facility has a storage capacity of 86 Bcf and, subject to the CPUC limitations described below, represents 63 of SoCalGas natural gas storage capacity. SoCalGas discovered a natural gas leak at one of its wells at the Aliso Canyon natural gas storage facility in October 2015 and permanently sealed the well in February 2016. SoCalGas was subsequently authorized to make limited withdrawals and injections of natural gas at the Aliso Canyon natural gas storage facility and, on an interim basis, has been directed by the CPUC to maintain up to 41.16 Bcf of working gas at the facility to help achieve reliability for the region as determined by the CPUC. To help maintain system reliability, the CPUC issued a protocol authorizing withdrawals of natural gas from the facility if available gas supply reaches defined thresholds for SoCalGas system, or public health and safety is at risk, as determined by the protocol. We discuss the Leak in Note 16 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, in Part I Item 1A. Risk Factors and in Part II Item 7. MD A Capital Resources and Liquidity SoCalGas. 
 Customers and Demand 
 SoCalGas and SDG E sell, distribute and transport natural gas. SoCalGas purchases and stores natural gas for its core customers in its territory and SDG E s territory on a combined portfolio basis. SoCalGas also offers natural gas transportation and storage services for others.

 For regulatory purposes, end-use customers are classified as either core or noncore customers. Core customers are primarily residential and small commercial and industrial customers. 
 2022 Form 10-K | 18 

Table of Contents 

Most core customers purchase natural gas directly from SoCalGas or SDG E. While core customers are permitted to purchase their natural gas supplies from producers, marketers or brokers, SoCalGas and SDG E are obligated to maintain adequate delivery capacity to serve the requirements of all their core customers. 
 Noncore customers at SoCalGas consist primarily of electric generation, wholesale, and large commercial and industrial customers. A portion of SoCalGas noncore customers are non-end-users, which include wholesale customers consisting primarily of other utilities, including SDG E, or municipally owned natural gas distribution systems. Noncore customers at SDG E consist primarily of electric generation and large commercial customers. 
 Noncore customers are responsible for procuring their natural gas requirements, as the regulatory framework does not allow SoCalGas and SDG E to recover the cost of natural gas procured and delivered to noncore customers. 
 Natural gas demand largely depends on the health and expansion of the Southern California economy, prices of alternative energy products, consumer preference, environmental regulations, legislation, California s energy policy supporting increased electrification and renewable power generation, and the effectiveness of energy efficiency programs. Other external factors such as weather, the price of, demand for, and supply sources of electricity, the use of and further development of renewable energy resources and energy storage, development of or requirements for new natural gas supply sources, demand for natural gas outside California, storage levels, transport capacity and availability of supply into California and general economic conditions can also result in significant shifts in the market price of natural gas, which may in turn impact demand. 
 One of the larger sources for natural gas demand is electric generation. Natural gas-fired electric generation within Southern California (and demand for natural gas supplied to such plants) competes with electric power generated throughout the western U.S. Natural gas transported for electric generating plant customers may be affected by the overall demand for electricity, growth in self-generation from rooftop solar, the addition of more efficient gas technologies, new energy efficiency initiatives, and the degree to which regulatory changes in electric transmission infrastructure investment divert electric generation from SoCalGas and SDG E s service areas. The demand for natural gas may also fluctuate due to volatility in the demand for electricity due to seasonality, weather conditions and other impacts, and the availability of competing supplies of electricity, such as hydroelectric generation and other renewable energy sources. Given the significant quantity of natural gas-fired generation, we believe natural gas is a dispatchable fuel that can continue to help provide electric reliability in our California service territories. 
 The natural gas distribution business is subject to seasonality, and cash provided by operating activities generally is greater during and immediately following the winter heating months. As is prevalent in the industry, but subject to current regulatory limitations, SoCalGas typically injects natural gas into storage during the months of April through October, and usually withdraws natural gas from storage during the months of November through March. 
 
 Sempra Texas Utilities 
 Sempra Texas Utilities is comprised of our equity method investments in Oncor Holdings and Sharyland Holdings. Oncor Holdings is an indirect, wholly owned entity of Sempra that owns an 80.25 interest in Oncor. TTI owns the remaining 19.75 interest in Oncor. Sempra owns an indirect, 50 interest in Sharyland Holdings, which owns a 100 interest in Sharyland Utilities.

Sempra Texas Utilities assets at December 31, 2022 covered the following territory: 
 
 Oncor 
 Oncor is a regulated electricity transmission and distribution utility that operates in the north-central, eastern, western and panhandle regions of Texas. Oncor delivers electricity to end-use consumers through its electrical systems, and also provides transmission grid connections to merchant generation facilities and interconnections to other transmission grids in Texas. Oncor s transmission and distribution assets are located in over 120 counties and more than 400 incorporated municipalities, including the cities of Dallas and Fort Worth and surrounding suburbs, as well as Waco, Wichita Falls, Odessa, Midland, Tyler, Temple, Killeen and Round Rock, among others. Most of Oncor s power lines have been constructed over lands of others pursuant to easements or along public highways, streets and rights-of-way pursuant to permits, public utility easements, franchise or other agreements or as otherwise permitted by law. 
 At December 31, 2022, Oncor had 4,561 employees, including 764 employees covered under a collective bargaining agreement. 
 Certain ring-fencing measures, governance mechanisms and commitments, which we describe in Part I Item 1A. Risk Factors, are in effect and are intended to enhance Oncor Holdings and Oncor s separateness from their owners and to mitigate the risk that these entities would be negatively impacted by the bankruptcy of, or other adverse financial developments affecting, their owners. Sempra does not control Oncor Holdings or Oncor, and the ring-fencing measures, governance mechanisms and commitments limit our ability to direct the management, policies and operations of Oncor Holdings and Oncor, including the deployment or disposition of their assets, declarations of dividends, strategic planning and other important corporate issues and actions, including limited representation on the Oncor Holdings and Oncor boards of directors. Because Oncor Holdings and Oncor are managed independently (i.e., ring-fenced), we account for our 100 ownership interest in Oncor Holdings as an equity method investment. 
 Electricity Transmission. Oncor s electricity transmission business is responsible for the safe and reliable operations of its transmission network and substations. These responsibilities consist of the construction, maintenance and security of transmission 
 2022 Form 10-K | 20 

Table of Contents 

facilities and substations and the monitoring, controlling and dispatching of high-voltage electricity over its transmission facilities in coordination with ERCOT, which we discuss below in Regulation Utility Regulation ERCOT Market. 
 At December 31, 2022, Oncor s transmission system included approximately 18,268 circuit miles of transmission lines, a total of 1,207 transmission and distribution substations, and interconnection to 146 third-party generation facilities totaling 48,430 MW. 
 Transmission revenues are provided under tariffs approved by either the PUCT or, to a small degree related to limited interconnection to other markets, the FERC. Network transmission revenues compensate Oncor for delivery of electricity over transmission facilities operating at 60 kV and above. Other services offered by Oncor through its transmission business include system impact studies, facilities studies, transformation service and maintenance of transformer equipment, substations and transmission lines owned by other parties. 
 Electricity Distribution. Oncor s electricity distribution business is responsible for the overall safe and reliable operation of distribution facilities, including electricity delivery, power quality, security and system reliability. These responsibilities consist of the ownership, management, construction, maintenance and operation of the electricity distribution system within its certificated service area. Oncor s distribution system receives electricity from the transmission system through substations and distributes electricity to end-users and wholesale customers through 3,681 distribution feeders. 
 Oncor s distribution system included nearly 3.9 million points of delivery at December 31, 2022 and consisted of 123,500 miles of overhead and underground lines. 
 Distribution revenues from residential and small business users are based on actual monthly consumption (kWh) and distribution revenues from large commercial and industrial users are based on, depending on size and annual load factor, either actual monthly demand (kW) or the greater of actual monthly demand (kW) or 80 of peak monthly demand during the prior eleven months. 
 Customers and Demand. Oncor operates the largest transmission and distribution system in Texas based on the number of end-use customers and miles of transmission and distribution lines, delivering electricity to nearly 3.9 million homes and businesses, operating more than 141,000 miles of transmission and distribution lines as of December 31, 2022 in a territory with an estimated population of approximately 13 million. The consumers of the electricity Oncor delivers (other than ultimate end-use customers served by an electric cooperative or a municipally owned utility) are free to choose their electricity supplier from retail electric providers who compete for their business. Oncor is not a seller of electricity, nor does it purchase electricity for resale. Rather, Oncor provides transmission services to its electricity distribution business as well as non-affiliated electricity distribution companies, cooperatives and municipally owned utilities. Oncor also provides distribution services, consisting of retail delivery services to retail electric providers that sell electricity to end-use customers, as well as wholesale delivery services to cooperatives and municipally owned utilities. At December 31, 2022, Oncor s distribution business customers primarily consisted of over 100 retail electric providers that sell the electricity it distributes to consumers in its certificated service areas. 
 Oncor s revenues and results of operations are subject to seasonality, weather conditions and other electricity usage drivers, with revenues being highest in the summer. 
 Competition. Oncor operates in certificated areas designated by the PUCT. The majority of Oncor s service territory is single certificated, with Oncor as the only certificated electric transmission and distribution provider. However, in multi-certificated areas of Texas, Oncor competes with certain other utilities and rural electric cooperatives for the right to serve end-use customers. In addition, the electric industry is undergoing rapid technological change, and third-party distributed energy resources and other technologies may increasingly compete with Oncor s traditional transmission and distribution infrastructure in delivering electricity to consumers. 
 Sharyland Utilities 
 Sharyland Utilities is a regulated electric transmission utility that owns and operates, at December 31, 2022, approximately 64 miles of electric transmission lines in south Texas, including a direct current line connecting Mexico and assets in McAllen, Texas. Sharyland Utilities is responsible for providing safe, reliable and efficient transmission and substation services and investing to support infrastructure needs in its service territory, which we discuss below in Regulation Utility Regulation ERCOT Market. Transmission revenues are provided under tariffs approved by the PUCT. 
 
 Sempra Infrastructure 
 Our Sempra Infrastructure segment includes the operating companies of our subsidiary, SI Partners, as well as a holding company and certain services companies. SI Partners is included within our Sempra Infrastructure reportable segment, but is not the same in its entirety as the reportable segment. Sempra Infrastructure develops, builds, operates and invests in energy infrastructure to help enable the energy transition in North American markets and globally.

Table of Contents 

Sempra Infrastructure owned a 70 interest in SI Partners at December 31, 2022, following its sale of a 20 NCI in SI Partners to KKR in October 2021 and sale of a 10 NCI in SI Partners to ADIA in June 2022. SI Partners has two authorized classes of limited partnership interests designated as Class A Units (which are common voting units) and Sole Risk Interests (which are only owned by Sempra, are non-voting and are not considered in the calculation of each limited partner s respective ownership interests, subject to certain restrictions). We discuss KKR s and ADIA s purchases of NCI in SI Partners, as well as SI Partners limited partnership agreement that governs the partners respective rights and obligations in respect of their ownership interests in SI Partners in Note 1 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. 
 SI Partners held a 100 ownership interest in Sempra LNG Holding, LP and a 99.9 ownership interest in IEnova at December 31, 2022, which consolidates Sempra s ownership and management of its non-utility, energy infrastructure assets in North America under a single platform. These assets include LNG and natural gas infrastructure in the U.S. and Mexico and renewable energy, LPG and refined products infrastructure in Mexico, which are managed through three business lines: LNG and Net-Zero Solutions, Energy Networks and Clean Power. 
 At December 31, 2022, Sempra Infrastructure owned or held interests in the following assets: 
 
 LNG and Net-Zero Solutions 
 Sempra Infrastructure s LNG and Net-Zero Solutions business line is comprised of a natural gas liquefaction portfolio in operation, construction or development, and is focused on energy diversification and the clean energy transition in markets that our customers serve. 
 Cameron LNG Phase 1 Facility. SI Partners owns 50.2 of Cameron LNG JV, while an affiliate of TotalEnergies SE, an affiliate of Mitsui Co., Ltd., and Japan LNG Investment, LLC (a company jointly owned by Mitsubishi Corporation and Nippon Yusen Kabushiki Kaisha) each own 16.6 of Cameron LNG JV. We account for our ownership interest in Cameron LNG JV under the equity method. No single owner controls or can unilaterally direct significant activities of Cameron LNG JV. 
 Cameron LNG JV owns and operates the Cameron LNG Phase 1 facility, a natural gas liquefaction, export, regasification and import facility with three natural gas pre-treatment, processing and liquefaction trains. The Cameron LNG Phase 1 facility is located in Hackberry, Louisiana, along the Calcasieu Ship Channel, which handles significant industrial shipping, including large 
 2022 Form 10-K | 22 

Table of Contents 

oil and LNG tankers, and is well positioned to supply the Atlantic and Pacific markets. The three liquefaction trains have a combined nameplate capacity of 13.9 Mtpa of LNG with an export capacity of 12 Mtpa of LNG, or approximately 1.7 Bcf of natural gas per day. The Cameron LNG Phase 1 facility has 20-year liquefaction and regasification tolling capacity agreements in place with affiliates of TotalEnergies SE, Mitsubishi Corporation and Mitsui Co., Ltd., which collectively subscribe for the full nameplate capacity of the three trains at the facility. 
 ECA Regas Facility. Sempra Infrastructure owns and operates the ECA Regas Facility in Baja California, Mexico, which is capable of processing one Bcf of natural gas per day and has a storage capacity of 320,000 cubic meters in two tanks of 160,000 cubic meters each. 
 The ECA Regas Facility generates revenues from firm storage service fees under firm storage service agreements and nitrogen injection service agreements with Shell Mexico and Gazprom that expire in 2028, which permit them to collectively use 50 of the terminal s capacity, with the remaining 50 of the capacity available for Sempra Infrastructure s use. The land on which the ECA Regas Facility and the ECA LNG liquefaction projects under construction and in development are expected to be situated, as well as land adjacent to those properties, are the subject of litigation. We discuss the ECA Regas Facility arbitration and land litigation in Note 16 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements and Part I Item 1A. Risk Factors. 
 Sempra Infrastructure uses its 50 capacity at the ECA Regas Facility to satisfy its obligation under an LNG SPA with Tangguh PSC through 2029, which we discuss below, and ECA LNG Phase 1 will be the sole user of this capacity thereafter. 
 Asset and Supply Optimization. Sempra Infrastructure has an LNG SPA through 2029 with Tangguh PSC for the supply of the equivalent of 500 MMcf of natural gas per day at a price based on the SoCal Border index for natural gas. The LNG SPA allows Tangguh PSC to divert certain LNG volumes to other global markets in exchange for payments of diversion fees. Sempra Infrastructure may also enter into short-term supply agreements to purchase LNG to be received, stored and regasified at the ECA Regas Facility for sale to other parties. Sempra Infrastructure uses the natural gas produced from this LNG to supply a contract for the sale of natural gas to the CFE at prices that are based on the SoCal Border index. If LNG volumes received from Tangguh PSC are not sufficient to satisfy the commitment to the CFE, Sempra Infrastructure may purchase natural gas in the market to satisfy such commitment. 
 Sempra Infrastructure purchases, transports and sells natural gas, and has customers in both the U.S. and Mexico, including the CFE. Sempra Infrastructure may also purchase natural gas from other Sempra affiliates. Natural gas purchases and transportation arrangements are substantially backed by long-term, U.S. dollar-based contracts for the sale of natural gas to third parties (both U.S. sourced and derived from imported LNG), LNG offtake and natural gas storage and pipeline capacity. 
 ECA LNG Phase 1 Project. SI Partners owns an 83.4 interest in ECA LNG Phase 1, and an affiliate of TotalEnergies SE owns the remaining 16.6 interest. ECA LNG Phase 1 is constructing a one-train natural gas liquefaction facility at the site of Sempra Infrastructure s existing ECA Regas Facility with a nameplate capacity of 3.25 Mtpa and an initial offtake capacity of 2.5 Mtpa. We expect the ECA LNG Phase 1 project to commence commercial operations in the summer of 2025. 
 ECA LNG Phase 1 has definitive 20-year SPAs with an affiliate of TotalEnergies SE for approximately 1.7 Mtpa of LNG and Mitsui Co., Ltd. for approximately 0.8 Mtpa of LNG. 
 The construction of the ECA LNG Phase 1 project is subject to numerous risks and uncertainties. For a discussion of these risks and uncertainties, see Part I Item 1A. Risk Factors and Part II Item 7. MD A Capital Resources and Liquidity Sempra Infrastructure. 
 Additional Potential LNG and Net-Zero Solutions Projects. Sempra Infrastructure is evaluating the following development opportunities: 
 Cameron LNG Phase 2 project, an expansion of the Cameron LNG Phase 1 facility 
 ECA LNG Phase 2 project, a large-scale natural gas liquefaction project to be located at the site of Sempra Infrastructure s existing ECA Regas Facility in Baja California, Mexico 
 PA LNG projects, a large-scale natural gas liquefaction project, to be developed in two phases, and associated infrastructure on a greenfield site in the vicinity of Port Arthur, Texas located along the Sabine-Neches waterway 
 Vista Pacifico LNG project, a mid-scale natural gas liquefaction project and associated infrastructure in the vicinity of Topolobampo in Sinaloa, Mexico 
 Hackberry Carbon Sequestration project, a carbon capture and sequestration project that is intended to reduce emissions at the Cameron LNG Phase 1 facility and proposed Cameron LNG Phase 2 project

No final investment decision has been reached for any of these potential projects. The development of these projects is subject to numerous risks and uncertainties. For a discussion of these proposed projects and their risks, see Part I Item 1A. Risk Factors and Part II Item 7. MD A Capital Resources and Liquidity Sempra Infrastructure. 
 Demand and Competition. North America benefits from numerous competitive advantages as a potential supplier of LNG to world markets, including the following: 
 high levels of developed and undeveloped natural gas resources, including unconventional natural gas and tight oil relative to domestic consumption levels 
 flexible and elastic markets in gas and oil drilling and production resulting in efficient unit costs of gas production 
 availability of extensive pre-existing natural gas pipeline transmission systems and natural gas storage capacity with proximity to production locations 
 Brownfield liquefaction projects also benefit from the particular competitive advantage of the proximity of pre-existing infrastructure, such as LNG tankage and berths. 
 Global LNG competition may limit North American LNG exports, as international liquefaction projects attempt to match North American LNG production costs and customer contractual rights such as volume and destination flexibility. It is expected that North American LNG exports will increase competition for current and future global natural gas demand, and thereby facilitate additional growth of a global commodity market for natural gas and LNG. 
 Cameron LNG JV co-owners and customers compete globally to market and sell LNG to end users, including gas and electric utilities located in LNG-importing countries around the world. By providing liquefaction services, Cameron LNG JV and future LNG export development projects compete indirectly with liquefaction projects currently operating and those under development in the global LNG market. In addition to the U.S., these competitors are located in the Middle East, Southeast Asia, Africa, South America, Australia and Europe. The competitive environment shifted in favor of North American LNG development projects in 2022 in the wake of the war in Ukraine and the resulting focus by European markets on alternative supplies. This shift in demand underscores the attractiveness of long-term contracts from North American LNG projects. 
 The LNG regasification business is impacted by global LNG market prices. High LNG prices in markets outside the market in which Sempra Infrastructure s ECA Regas Facility operates have resulted and could continue to result in lower-than-expected deliveries of LNG cargoes to the ECA Regas Facility, which could increase costs if Sempra Infrastructure is instead required to obtain LNG in the open market at prevailing prices. Any inability to obtain expected LNG cargoes could also impact Sempra Infrastructure s ability to maintain the minimum level of LNG required to keep the ECA Regas Facility in operation at the proper temperature. Prices in international LNG markets through which Sempra Infrastructure must purchase natural gas to meet its contractual obligations to deliver natural gas to customers may also affect how Sempra Infrastructure optimizes its assets and supply, which could have an adverse impact on its earnings. 
 Energy Networks 
 Sempra Infrastructure s Energy Networks business line is comprised of a natural gas transportation and distribution network. 
 Cross-Border Interconnections and In-Country Pipelines. Sempra Infrastructure develops, builds, operates and invests in systems for the receipt, transportation, compression and delivery of natural gas and ethane. At December 31, 2022, these systems consisted of 1,850 miles of natural gas transmission pipelines plus 124 miles under construction, 16 natural gas compression stations plus one under construction, and 139 miles of ethane pipelines in Mexico. The design capacity of these pipeline assets is over 16,400 MMcf per day of natural gas, 204 MMcf per day of ethane gas and 106,000 barrels per day of ethane liquid. Capacity on Sempra Infrastructure s pipelines and related assets is substantially contracted under long-term, U.S. dollar-based agreements with major industry participants such as the CFE, Centro Nacional de Control de Gas, PEMEX, Gazprom and other similar counterparties. Some of these pipeline assets are affected by disputes related to the property on which the pipelines are located, which we discuss in Note 16 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements and Part I Item 1A. Risk Factors. 
 Sempra Infrastructure owns a 40-mile natural gas pipeline in south Louisiana, the Cameron Interstate Pipeline, which links the Cameron LNG Phase 1 facility in Cameron Parish in Louisiana, to five interstate pipelines that offer access to major feed gas supply basins in Texas and the northeast, midcontinent and southeast regions of the U.S. The majority of transportation capacity on the Cameron Interstate Pipeline is under long-term transportation service agreements with shippers for delivery to the Cameron LNG Phase 1 facility. 
 Natural Gas Distribution. Sempra Infrastructure s natural gas distribution regulated utility, Ecogas, operates in three separate distribution zones in Mexicali, Chihuahua and La Laguna-Durango, Mexico. At December 31, 2022, Ecogas had approximately 2,952 miles of distribution pipeline, and approximately 150,000 customer meters serving more than 525,000 residential, 
 2022 Form 10-K | 24 

Table of Contents 

commercial and industrial consumers with sales volume of approximately 10 MMcf per day in 2022. Ecogas relies on supply and transportation services from Sempra Infrastructure, SoCalGas and PEMEX for the natural gas it distributes to its customers. 
 LPG Storage and Associated Systems. Sempra Infrastructure owns and operates the TDF, S. de R. L. de C. V. (TDF) pipeline system and the Guadalajara LPG terminal. At December 31, 2022, the TDF pipeline system consisted of approximately 118 miles of 12-inch diameter LPG pipeline with a design capacity of 34,000 barrels per day and associated storage and dispatch facilities. The TDF pipeline system runs from PEMEX s Burgos facility in the Mexican State of Tamaulipas, Mexico to Sempra Infrastructure s delivery facility near the city of Monterrey, Mexico and is fully contracted to PEMEX on a firm basis through 2027. Sempra Infrastructure s Guadalajara LPG terminal is an 80,000-barrel LPG storage facility near Guadalajara, Mexico, with associated loading and dispatch facilities, and serves the LPG needs of Guadalajara. The Guadalajara LPG terminal is fully contracted to PEMEX on a firm basis through 2028. Both contracts are U.S. dollar-denominated or referenced and are periodically adjusted for inflation. 
 Refined Products Storage. Sempra Infrastructure s refined products storage business develops, constructs and operates systems for the receipt, storage and delivery of refined products, principally gasoline, diesel and jet fuel, throughout the Mexican states of Baja California, Colima, Puebla, Sinaloa, Veracruz and Valle de M xico for private companies, with a combined storage capacity of 4.6 million barrels fully operating or under construction/commissioning as of December 31, 2022. The inland terminal in the vicinity of Puebla reached commercial operations in October 2022. Construction of the Topolobampo marine terminal was substantially completed in May 2022, at which time commissioning activities commenced. Subject to the receipt of pending permits, we expect the Topolobampo terminal will commence commercial operations in the first half of 2023. Our customer contracts for our refined products storage business are structured as long-term, U.S. dollar-denominated, firm capacity storage agreements with counterparties including Chevron Corporation, Marathon Petroleum Corporation and Valero Energy Corporation. The contracted rate under these contracts is independent from each terminal s regulated rate as determined by the CRE. 
 Demand and Competition. Ecogas faces competition from other distributors of natural gas in each of its three distribution zones in Mexicali, Chihuahua and La Laguna-Durango, Mexico as other distributors of natural gas build or consider building natural gas distribution systems. Sempra Infrastructure s pipeline and storage facilities businesses compete with other regulated and unregulated pipeline and storage facilities. They compete primarily on the basis of price (in terms of storage and transportation fees), available capacity and interconnections to downstream markets. The overall demand for natural gas distribution services increases during the winter months, while the overall demand for power increases during the summer months. 
 Clean Power 
 Sempra Infrastructure s Clean Power business line consists of a renewable energy infrastructure portfolio and a natural gas-fired power plant in Mexico. 
 Renewable Power Generation. Sempra Infrastructure develops, builds, invests in and operates renewable energy generation facilities that have long-term PPAs to sell the electricity they generate to their customers, which are generally load serving entities, as well as industrial and other customers. Load serving entities sell electric service to their end-users and wholesale customers upon receipt of power delivery from these energy generation facilities, while industrial and other customers consume the electricity to run their facilities. At December 31, 2022, Sempra Infrastructure had a fully contracted, total nameplate capacity of 1,044 MW related to its fully operating wind and solar power generation facilities. Some of these facilities are impacted by regulatory actions by the Mexican government and related litigation, which we discuss in Note 16 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, Part I Item 1A. Risk Factors and Part II Item 7. MD A Capital Resources and Liquidity Sempra Infrastructure.

 Natural Gas-Fired Generation. Sempra Infrastructure owns and operates the TdM power plant in the vicinity of Mexicali, Baja California, adjacent to the Mexico-U.S. border. TdM is a 625-MW natural gas-fired, combined-cycle power plant that is connected to our Gasoducto Rosarito pipeline system, which enables it to receive regasified LNG from the ECA Regas Facility as well as continental gas supplied from the U.S. on the North Baja pipeline. TdM generates revenue from selling electricity and resource adequacy to the California ISO and to governmental, public utility and wholesale power marketing entities. 
 Demand and Competition. Sempra Infrastructure competes with Mexican and foreign companies for new energy infrastructure projects in Mexico. Some of its competitors (including public or state-operated companies and their affiliates) may have better access to capital and greater financial and other resources, which could give them a competitive advantage for such projects. 
 Generation from Sempra Infrastructure s renewable energy assets is susceptible to fluctuations in naturally occurring conditions such as wind, inclement weather and hours of sunlight. Because Sempra Infrastructure sells power that it generates at its ESJ wind power generation facility into California, Sempra Infrastructure s future performance and the demand for renewable energy may be impacted by U.S. state mandated requirements to deliver a portion of total energy load from renewable energy sources. The rules governing these requirements in California are generally known as the RPS Program. In California, certification of a generation project by the CEC as an ERR allows the purchase of output from such generation facility to be counted towards fulfillment of the RPS Program requirements, if such purchase meets the provisions of SB X1-2, the California Renewable Energy Resources Act. The RPS Program may affect the demand for output from renewable energy projects developed by Sempra Infrastructure, particularly the demand from California s utilities. The first phase of ESJ, a wind power generation facility that delivers energy into California, has been certified by the CEC and is in compliance with the RPS Program as of December 31, 2022. Sempra Infrastructure is pursuing ERR certification for the second phase of ESJ. 
 TdM competes daily with other generating plants that supply power into the California electricity market. Sempra Infrastructure manages commodity price risk at TdM by using a mix of day ahead sales of energy, energy spreads hedging, ancillary services, and short-term to medium-term capacity sales.

Utility Regulation 
 California 
 SDG E and SoCalGas are principally regulated at the state level by the CPUC, CEC and CARB. 
 The CPUC: 
 consists of five commissioners appointed by the Governor of California for staggered, six-year terms; 
 regulates, among other things, SDG E s and SoCalGas customer rates and conditions of service, sales of securities, rates of return, capital structure, rates of depreciation, and long-term resource procurement, except as described below in U.S. Federal; 
 has jurisdiction over the proposed construction of major new electric generation, transmission and distribution, and natural gas storage, transmission and distribution facilities in California; 
 conducts reviews and audits of utility performance and compliance with regulatory guidelines and conducts investigations related to various matters, such as safety, reliability and planning, deregulation, competition and the environment; and 
 regulates the interactions and transactions of SDG E and SoCalGas with Sempra and its other affiliates. 
 The CPUC also oversees and regulates other energy-related products and services, including solar and wind energy, bioenergy, alternative energy storage and other forms of renewable energy. In addition, the CPUC s safety and enforcement role includes inspections, investigations and penalty and citation processes for safety and other violations. 
 The CEC publishes electric demand forecasts for the state and specific service territories. Based on these forecasts, the CEC: 
 determines the need for additional energy sources and conservation programs; 
 sponsors alternative-energy research and development projects; 
 promotes energy conservation programs to reduce demand for natural gas and electricity within California; 
 maintains a statewide plan of action in case of energy shortages; and 
 certifies power-plant sites and related facilities within California. 
 The CEC conducts a 20-year forecast of available supplies and prices for every market sector that consumes natural gas in California. This forecast includes resource evaluation, pipeline capacity needs, natural gas demand and wellhead prices, and transportation and distribution costs. This analysis is one of many resource materials used to support SDG E s and SoCalGas long-term investment decisions. 
 California requires certain electric retail sellers, including SDG E, to deliver a significant percentage of their retail energy sales from renewable energy sources. The rules governing this requirement, administered by the CPUC and the CEC, are generally known as the RPS Program. California has implemented a program whereby IOUs providing gas service in California will procure a portion of the natural gas they deliver from biomethane. The proportion of biomethane procured will be phased-in with a state-wide, short-term target in 2025 of 17.6 Bcf per year and a medium-term target in 2030 of 72.8 Bcf per year. SDG E and SoCalGas are allocated 6.77 and 49.26 , respectively, of the 2025 target, and 7.60 and 52.02 , respectively, of the 2030 target. The rules governing this program are administered by the CPUC under SB 1440. 
 AB 32, the California Global Warming Solutions Act of 2006, assigns responsibility to CARB for monitoring and establishing policies for reducing GHG emissions. The law requires CARB to develop and adopt a comprehensive plan for achieving real, quantifiable and cost-effective GHG emissions reductions, including a statewide GHG emissions cap, mandatory reporting rules, and regulatory and market mechanisms to achieve reductions of GHG emissions. CARB is a department within the California Environmental Protection Agency, an organization that reports directly to the Governor s Office. Sempra Infrastructure is also subject to the rules and regulations of CARB. 
 The California Geologic Energy Management Division, the CPUC, and various other state and local agencies regulate the operation and maintenance of SoCalGas natural gas storage facilities. 
 Texas 
 Oncor s and Sharyland Utilities rates are regulated at the state level by the PUCT and, in the case of Oncor, at the city level by certain cities. The PUCT has original jurisdiction over wholesale transmission rates and services and retail rates and services in unincorporated areas and in those municipalities that have ceded original jurisdiction to the PUCT, and has exclusive appellate jurisdiction to review the retail rate and service orders and ordinances of municipalities. Generally, the Texas PURA prohibits the collection of any rates or charges by a public utility (as defined by PURA) that do not have the prior approval of the appropriate regulatory authority (i.e., the PUCT or the municipality with original jurisdiction). 
 2022 Form 10-K | 27 

Table of Contents 

At the state level, PURA requires utility owners or operators of electric transmission facilities to provide open-access wholesale transmission services to third parties at rates and terms that are nondiscriminatory and comparable to the rates and terms of the utility s own use of its system. The PUCT has adopted rules implementing the state open-access requirements for all utilities that are subject to the PUCT s jurisdiction over electric transmission services, including Oncor. 
 U.S. Federal 
 SDG E and SoCalGas are also regulated at the federal level by the FERC, the EPA, the DOE and the DOT, and for SDG E the NRC. 
 The FERC regulates SDG E s and SoCalGas interstate sale and transportation of natural gas. The FERC also regulates SDG E s transmission and wholesale sales of electricity in interstate commerce, transmission access, rates of return on transmission investment, rates of depreciation, electric rates involving sales for resale and the application of the uniform system of accounts. The U.S. Energy Policy Act governs procedures for requests for electric transmission service. The California IOUs electric transmission facilities are under the operational control of the California ISO. As member utilities, Oncor and Sharyland Utilities operate within the ERCOT market, which we discuss below. To a small degree related to limited interconnections to other markets, Oncor s electric transmission revenues are provided under tariffs approved by the FERC. 
 The NRC oversees the licensing, construction, operation and decommissioning of nuclear facilities in the U.S., including SONGS, in which SDG E owns a 20 interest and which was permanently retired in 2013. The NRC and various state regulations require extensive review of these facilities safety, radiological and environmental aspects. We provide further discussion of SONGS matters, including the closure and decommissioning of the facility, in Note 15 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. 
 The EPA implements federal laws to protect human health and the environment, including federal laws on air quality, water quality, wastewater discharge, solid waste management, and hazardous waste disposal and remediation. The EPA also sets national environmental standards that state and tribal governments implement through their regulations. As a result, SDG E, SoCalGas, Oncor and Sharyland Utilities are subject to an interrelated framework of environmental laws and regulations. 
 The DOT, through PHMSA, has established regulations regarding engineering standards and operating procedures, including procedures intended to manage cybersecurity risks, applicable to SDG E s and SoCalGas natural gas transmission and distribution pipelines, as well as natural gas storage facilities. The DOT has certified the CPUC to administer oversight and compliance with these regulations for the entities they regulate in California. 
 ERCOT Market 
 As member utilities, Oncor and Sharyland Utilities operate within the ERCOT market, which represents approximately 90 of the electricity consumption in Texas. ERCOT is the regional reliability coordinating organization for member electricity systems in Texas and the ISO of the interconnected transmission grid for those systems. ERCOT is subject to oversight by the PUCT and the Texas Legislature. ERCOT is responsible for ensuring reliability, adequacy and security of the electric systems, as well as nondiscriminatory access to transmission service by all wholesale market participants, in the ERCOT region. ERCOT s membership consists of corporate and associate members, including electric cooperatives, municipal power agencies, independent generators, independent power marketers, transmission service providers, distribution service providers, independent retail electric providers and consumers. 
 The PUCT has primary jurisdiction over the ERCOT market to ensure the adequacy and reliability of power supply across Texas main interconnected electric transmission grid. Oncor and Sharyland Utilities, along with other owners of electric transmission and distribution facilities in Texas, participate with the ERCOT ISO and other member utilities in its operations. Each of these Texas utilities has planning, design, construction, operation, maintenance and security responsibility for the portion of the transmission grid and the load-serving substations it owns, primarily within its certificated distribution service area. Each participates with the ERCOT ISO and other ERCOT utilities in obtaining regulatory approvals and planning, designing, constructing and upgrading transmission lines in order to remove any existing constraints and interconnect energy generation on the ERCOT transmission grid. These transmission line projects are necessary to meet reliability needs, support energy production and increase bulk power transfer capability. 
 Oncor and Sharyland Utilities are subject to reliability standards adopted and enforced by the Texas Reliability Entity, Inc., an independent organization that develops reliability standards for the ERCOT region and monitors and enforces compliance with the standards of the North American Electric Reliability Corporation, including critical infrastructure protection, and ERCOT protocols.

Other U.S. State and Local Territories Regulation 
 The South Coast Air Quality Management District is the air pollution control agency responsible for regulating stationary sources of air pollution in the South Coast Air Basin in Southern California. The district s territory covers all of Orange County and the urban portions of Los Angeles, San Bernardino and Riverside counties. 
 SDG E has electric franchise agreements with the two counties and the 27 cities in its electric service territory, and natural gas franchise agreements with the one county and the 18 cities in its natural gas service territory. These franchise agreements allow SDG E to locate, operate and maintain facilities for the transmission and distribution of electricity or natural gas. Most of the franchise agreements have no expiration dates, while some have expiration dates that range from 2028 to 2041. In June 2021, the City of San Diego approved ordinances granting SDG E the electric and natural gas franchises for the City of San Diego. These franchise agreements provide SDG E the opportunity to serve the City of San Diego for the next 20 years, consisting of 10-year agreements that will automatically renew for an additional 10 years unless the City Council voids the automatic renewal with a supermajority vote. These franchise agreements went into effect in July 2021. 
 SoCalGas has natural gas franchise agreements with the 12 counties and the 232 cities in its service territory. These franchise agreements allow SoCalGas to locate, operate and maintain facilities for the transmission and distribution of natural gas. Most of the franchise agreements have no expiration dates, while some have expiration dates that range from 2023 to 2069, including the Los Angeles County franchise, which is scheduled to expire in June 2023. 
 Other U.S. Regulation 
 The FERC regulates certain Sempra Infrastructure assets pursuant to the U.S. Federal Power Act and Natural Gas Act, which provide for FERC jurisdiction over, among other things, sales of wholesale power in interstate commerce, transportation of natural gas in interstate commerce, and siting and permitting of LNG facilities. 
 The FERC may regulate rates and terms of service based on a cost-of-service approach or, in geographic and product markets determined by the FERC to be sufficiently competitive, rates may be market-based. FERC-regulated rates at Sempra Infrastructure are market-based for wholesale electricity sales, cost-based for the transportation of natural gas, and market-based for the purchase and sale of LNG and natural gas. 
 Sempra Infrastructure s investment in Cameron LNG JV is subject to regulations of the DOE regarding the export of LNG. Sempra Infrastructure s other potential natural gas liquefaction projects would, if completed, be subject to similar regulations. 
 SDG E, SoCalGas and businesses in which Sempra Infrastructure invests are subject to the DOT rules and regulations regarding pipeline safety. PHMSA, acting through the Office of Pipeline Safety, is responsible for administering the DOT s national regulatory program to help ensure the safe transportation of natural gas, petroleum and other hazardous materials by pipelines, including pipelines associated with natural gas storage, and develops regulations and other approaches to risk management to help ensure safety in design, construction, testing, operation, maintenance and emergency response of pipeline facilities. SDG E, SoCalGas and Sempra Infrastructure are also subject to regulation by the U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission. 
 Foreign Regulation 
 Operations and projects in our Sempra Infrastructure segment are subject to regulation by the CRE, ASEA, SENER, the Mexican Ministry of Environment and Natural Resources of Mexico (Secretar a del Medio Ambiente y Recursos Naturales), and other labor and environmental agencies of city, state and federal governments in Mexico. New energy infrastructure projects may also require a favorable opinion from Comisi n Federal de Competencia Econ mica (Mexico s Competition Commission) in order to be constructed and operated. 
 Licenses and Permits 
 Our utilities in California and Texas obtain numerous permits, authorizations and licenses for, as applicable, the transmission and distribution of natural gas and electricity and the operation and construction of related assets, including electric generation and natural gas storage facilities, some of which may require periodic renewal. 
 Sempra Infrastructure obtains numerous permits, authorizations and licenses for its electric and natural gas distribution, generation and transmission systems from the local governments where these services are provided. The permits for generation, transportation, storage and distribution operations at Sempra Infrastructure are generally for 30-year terms, with options for renewal under certain regulatory conditions. 
 Sempra Infrastructure obtains licenses and permits for the construction, operation and expansion of LNG facilities and for the import and export of LNG and natural gas. Sempra Infrastructure also obtains licenses and permits for the construction and operation of facilities for the receipt, storage and delivery of refined products. 
 2022 Form 10-K | 29 

Table of Contents 

Sempra Infrastructure obtains permits, authorizations and licenses for the construction and operation of natural gas storage facilities and pipelines, and in connection with participation in the wholesale electricity market. 
 Most of the permits and licenses associated with Sempra Infrastructure s construction and operations are for periods generally in alignment with the construction cycle or expected useful life of the asset and in many cases are greater than 20 years. 
 RATEMAKING MECHANISMS 
 Sempra California 
 General Rate Case Proceedings 
 A CPUC GRC proceeding is designed to set sufficient base rates to allow SDG E and SoCalGas to recover their reasonable forecasted operating costs and to provide the opportunity to realize their authorized rates of return on their investments. The proceeding generally establishes the test year revenue requirements, which authorizes how much SDG E and SoCalGas can collect from their customers, and provides for attrition, or annual increases in revenue requirements, for each year following the test year. 
 We discuss the GRC in Note 4 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. 
 Cost of Capital Proceedings 
 A CPUC cost of capital proceeding every three years determines a utility s authorized capital structure and authorized return on rate base, which is a weighted-average of the authorized returns on debt, preferred equity and common equity (referred to as return on equity or ROE), weighted on a basis consistent with the authorized capital structure. The authorized return on rate base approved by the CPUC is the rate that SDG E and SoCalGas use to establish customer rates to finance investments in CPUC-regulated electric distribution and generation, natural gas distribution, transmission and storage assets, as well as general plant and information technology systems investments to support operations. 
 A cost of capital proceeding also addresses the CCM, which applies in the interim years between required cost of capital applications and considers changes in the cost of capital based on changes in interest rates based on the applicable utility bond index published by Moody s (the CCM benchmark rate) for each 12-month period ending September 30 (the measurement period). The index applicable to SDG E and SoCalGas is based on each utility s credit rating. The CCM benchmark rate is the basis of comparison to determine if the CCM is triggered in each measurement period, which occurs if the change in the applicable Moody s utility bond index relative to the CCM benchmark rate is larger than plus or minus 1.000 at the end of the measurement period. The CCM, if triggered, would automatically update the authorized cost of debt based on actual costs and update the authorized ROE upward or downward by one-half of the difference between the CCM benchmark rate and the applicable Moody s utility bond index. Alternatively, each of SDG E and SoCalGas are permitted to file a cost of capital application in an interim year in which an extraordinary or catastrophic event materially impacts its cost of capital and affects utilities differently than the market as a whole to have its cost of capital determined in lieu of the CCM. 
 We discuss the cost of capital and CCM in Note 4 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements and in Part I Item 1A. Risk Factors. 
 Transmission Rate Cases 
 SDG E files separately with the FERC for its authorized ROE on FERC-regulated electric transmission operations and assets. The proceeding establishes a ROE and a formulaic rate whereby rates are determined using (i) a base period of historical costs and a forecast of capital investments, and (ii) a true-up period, similar to balancing account treatment, that is designed to provide earnings equal to SDG E s actual cost of service including its authorized return on investment. SDG E makes annual information filings with the FERC in December to update rates for the following calendar year. SDG E may also file for ROE incentives that might apply under FERC rules. SDG E s debt-to-equity ratio is set annually based on the actual ratio at the end of each year. 
 Incentive Mechanisms 
 The CPUC applies certain performance-based measures and incentive mechanisms to all California IOUs, under which SDG E and SoCalGas have earnings potential above the authorized CPUC base operating margin if they achieve or exceed specific performance and operating goals. Generally, for performance-based measures, if performance is above or below specific benchmarks, the utility is eligible for financial awards or subject to financial penalties. 
 2022 Form 10-K | 30 

Table of Contents 

Other Cost-Based Recovery 
 The CPUC, and the FERC as it relates to SDG E, authorize SDG E and SoCalGas to collect revenue requirements from customers for operating and capital-related costs (depreciation, taxes and return on rate base), including: 
 costs to purchase natural gas and electricity; 
 costs associated with administering public purpose, demand response, and customer energy efficiency programs; 
 other programmatic activities, such as gas distribution, gas transmission, gas storage integrity management and wildfire mitigation; and 
 costs associated with third-party liability insurance premiums. 
 Authorized costs are recovered as the commodity or service is delivered. To the extent authorized amounts collected vary from actual costs, the differences are generally recovered or refunded in a subsequent period based on the nature of the balancing account mechanism. Generally, the revenue recognition criteria for balanced costs billed to customers are met when the costs are incurred. Because these costs are substantially recovered in rates through a balancing account mechanism, changes in these costs are reflected as changes in revenues. The CPUC and the FERC may impose various review procedures before authorizing recovery or refund of amounts accumulated for authorized programs, including limitations on the program s total cost, revenue requirement limits or reviews of costs for reasonableness. These procedures could result in delays or disallowances of recovery from ratepayers. 
 Sempra Texas Utilities 
 Rates and Cost Recovery 
 Oncor s and Sharyland Utilities rates are each regulated at the state level by the PUCT and, in the case of Oncor, at the city level by certain cities, and are subject to regulatory rate-setting processes and earnings oversight. This regulatory treatment does not provide assurance as to achievement of earnings levels or recovery of actual costs. Instead, their rates are based on an analysis of each utility s costs and capital structure in a designated test year, as reviewed and approved in regulatory proceedings. Rate regulation is premised on the full recovery of prudently incurred costs and a reasonable rate of return on invested capital. However, there is no assurance that the PUCT will judge all of the Texas utilities costs to have been prudently incurred and therefore fully recoverable. The approved levels of recovery could be significantly less than requested levels. There can also be no assurance that the PUCT will approve other items proposed in any rate proceeding or that the regulatory process in which rates are determined will necessarily result in rates that produce full recovery of the Texas utilities actual post-test year costs and/or the return on invested capital allowed by the PUCT. 
 PUCT rules allow Texas electric utilities providing wholesale or retail distribution service to file applications, under certain circumstances, once per year to recover distribution-related investments placed into service between base rate review proceedings. PUCT rules also allow the Texas utilities to update their transmission rates twice a year between base rate review proceedings to reflect changes in transmission-related invested capital. These applications for interim rate adjustments between base rate reviews, known as capital tracker provisions, are intended to encourage investment in the electric system to help ensure reliability and efficiency by helping to shorten the time period between a utility s investment in transmission and distribution infrastructure and its ability to start recovering and earning a return on such investments. However, all investments included in a capital tracker are ultimately subject to prudence review by the PUCT in the next base rate review, after such assets are put into service. 
 Capital Structure and Return on Equity 
 Oncor currently has a PUCT-authorized ROE of 9.8 and an authorized regulatory capital structure of 57.5 debt to 42.5 equity. Oncor filed its base rate review request with the PUCT in May 2022. Resolution of the base rate review requires issuance of a final order by the PUCT, which Oncor expects to receive around the end of the first quarter of 2023. Once the final order is issued, the approved rates will be in effect until the next base rate review is finalized. In accordance with PUCT rules, Oncor must file a comprehensive base rate review within four years of the order setting rates in Oncor s most recent comprehensive base rate proceeding, unless an extension is otherwise approved by the PUCT. However, the PUCT or any city retaining original jurisdiction over rates may direct Oncor to file a base rate review, or Oncor may voluntarily file a base rate review, any time prior to that filing deadline. 
 Sharyland Utilities 2020 rate case became effective in July 2021 and remains effective until the next rate case is finalized, which we expect could be in late 2025. Sharyland Utilities PUCT-authorized ROE is 9.38 and its authorized regulatory capital structure is 60 debt to 40 equity.

 Ecogas revenues are derived from service and distribution fees charged to its customers in Mexican pesos. The price Ecogas pays to purchase natural gas, which is based on international price indices, is passed through directly to its customers. The service and distribution fees charged by Ecogas are regulated by the CRE, which performs a review of rates every five years and monitors prices charged to end-users. In the fourth quarter of 2020, Ecogas filed its rate case for 2021 through 2025 and is awaiting CRE approval. The tariffs operate under a return-on-asset-base model. In the annual tariff adjustment, rates are adjusted to account for inflation or fluctuations in exchange rates, and inflation indexing includes separate U.S. and Mexican cost components so that U.S. costs can be included in the final distribution rates.

 We discuss environmental issues affecting us in Note 16 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements and Part I Item 1A. Risk Factors. You should read the following additional information in conjunction with those discussions. 
 Hazardous Substances 
 The CPUC s Hazardous Waste Collaborative mechanism allows California s IOUs to recover hazardous waste cleanup costs for certain sites, including those related to certain Superfund sites. For sites that are covered by this mechanism, SDG E and SoCalGas are permitted to recover in rates 90 of hazardous waste cleanup costs and related third-party litigation costs, and 70 of related insurance-litigation expenses. In addition, SDG E and SoCalGas can retain a percentage of any recoveries from insurance carriers and other third parties to offset the cleanup and associated litigation costs not recovered in rates. 
 We record estimated liabilities for environmental remediation when amounts are probable and estimable. In addition, we record amounts authorized to be recovered in rates under the Hazardous Waste Collaborative mechanism as regulatory assets. 
 Air and Water Quality 
 The natural gas and electric industries are subject to increasingly stringent air quality and GHG emissions standards, such as those established by CARB and the South Coast Air Quality Management District. SDG E and SoCalGas generally recover the costs to comply with these standards in rates. We discuss GHG emissions standards and credits further in Note 1 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.

Human Capital 
 Our ability to advance our mission to be North America s premier energy infrastructure company largely depends on the safety, engagement, and responsible actions of our employees. 
 Safety is foundational at Sempra and its subsidiaries. We strive to foster a strong safety culture and reinforce this culture through training programs, benchmarking, review and analysis of safety trends, and sharing lessons learned from safety incidents across our businesses. Our businesses also engage in safety-related scenario planning and simulation, develop and implement operational contingency plans, and review safety plans and procedures with work crews regularly. We also participate in emergency planning and preparedness in the communities we serve and train critical employees in emergency management and response each year. The Safety, Sustainability and Technology committee of the Sempra board of directors assists the board in overseeing the corporation s oversight programs and performance related to safety, and our executives annual incentive compensation is based in part on safety metrics established by the Compensation and Talent Development Committee of the Sempra board of directors. 
 Our overall culture is another important aspect of our ability to advance our mission. We embrace diversity in our workforce and strive to create a high-performing, inclusive and supportive workplace where employees of all backgrounds and experiences feel valued and respected. We invest in recruiting, developing and retaining high-potential employees who represent the communities we serve, and we provide a range of programs to advance those objectives, including internal and external mentoring and leadership training and workshops, employee resource groups, and a benefits package including wellness benefits and a tuition reimbursement program. We also invest in internal communications programs, including in-person and virtual learning and networking opportunities as well as regular executive communications to employees on topics of interest. In addition, we offer a variety of employee community service opportunities and, at our U.S. operations, we support employees personal volunteering and charitable giving through Sempra s charitable matching program. Employees participate in annual ethics and compliance training, which includes a review of Sempra s Code of Business Conduct as well as information about resources such as Sempra s ethics and compliance helpline. We measure culture and employee engagement through a variety of channels including pulse surveys, suggestion boxes and a biannual engagement survey administered by a third party. 
 The table below shows the number of employees for each of our registrants at December 31, 2022, as well as the percentage of those employees represented by labor unions under various collective bargaining agreements that generally cover wages, benefits, working conditions and other terms and conditions of employment. We did not experience any major work stoppages in 2022 and we maintain constructive relations with our labor unions.

ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS 
 
 When evaluating our company and its subsidiaries and any investment in our or their securities, you should carefully consider the following risk factors and all other information contained in this report and the other documents we file with the SEC (including those filed subsequent to this report). We also may be materially harmed by risks and uncertainties not currently known to us or that we currently consider immaterial. If any of these risks occurs, our results of operations, financial condition, cash flows and/or prospects could be materially adversely affected, our actual results could differ materially from those expressed in any forward-looking statements made by us or on our behalf, and the trading price of our securities and those of our subsidiaries could decline. These risk factors are not prioritized in order of importance or materiality, and they should be read in conjunction with the other information in this report, including the information set forth in the Consolidated Financial Statements and in Part II Item 7. MD A. 
 
 RISKS RELATED TO SEMPRA 
 Operational and Structural Risks 
 Sempra s cash flows, ability to pay dividends and ability to meet its debt obligations largely depend on the performance of its subsidiaries and entities accounted for as equity method investments. 
 We are a holding company and substantially all our assets are owned by our subsidiaries or entities we do not control, including equity method investments. Our ability to pay dividends and meet our debt and other obligations largely depends on cash flows from our subsidiaries and equity method investments, which in turn depend on their ability to execute their business strategies and generate cash flows in excess of their own expenditures, dividend payments to third-party owners (if any) and debt and other obligations. In addition, entities accounted for as equity method investments, which we do not control, and our subsidiaries are all separate and distinct legal entities that are not obligated to pay dividends or make loans or distributions to us and could be precluded from doing so by legislation, regulation, court order or contractual restrictions, in times of financial distress or in other circumstances. The inability to access capital from our subsidiaries and entities accounted for as equity method investments could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition, cash flows and/or prospects. 
 Sempra s rights to the assets of its subsidiaries and equity method investments are structurally subordinated to the claims of each entity s trade and other creditors. If Sempra is a creditor of any such entity, its rights as a creditor would be effectively subordinated to any security interest in the entity s assets and any indebtedness of the entity senior to that held by Sempra. In addition, Sempra may elect to make capital contributions to its subsidiaries, which are not required to be repaid and generally are structurally subordinated to claims by creditors of the applicable subsidiary. 
 Sempra has substantial investments in and obligations arising from businesses it does not control or manage or in which it shares control. 
 We have investments in businesses we do not control or manage or in which we share control. In some cases, we engage in arrangements with or for these businesses that could expose us to risks in addition to our investment, including guarantees, indemnities and loans. For businesses we do not control, we are subject to the decisions of others, which may not always be in our interest and could negatively affect us. When we share control of a business with other owners, any disagreements among the owners about strategy, financial, operational, transactional or other important matters could hinder the business from moving forward with key initiatives or taking other actions and could negatively affect the relationships among the owners and the efficient functioning of the business. In addition, irrespective of whether or not we control these businesses, we could be responsible for liabilities or losses related to these businesses or elect to make capital contributions to these businesses. Any such circumstance could materially adversely affect our results of operations, financial condition, cash flows and/or prospects. We discuss these investments in Note 6 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. 
 Our business could be negatively affected by activist shareholders. 
 Activist shareholders may engage in proxy solicitations, advance shareholder proposals or otherwise attempt to effect changes in or assert influence on our board of directors and management. In taking these steps, activist shareholders could seek to acquire our capital stock, which at certain ownership levels could threaten our ability to use some or all our NOL carryforwards if our corporation experiences an ownership change under applicable tax rules. Responding to activist shareholders could require us to 
 2022 Form 10-K | 36 

Table of Contents 

incur legal and advisory fees, proxy solicitation expenses and administrative and associated costs and require time and attention by our board of directors and management, diverting their attention from the pursuit of our business strategies. 
 Any perceived uncertainties about our future direction or control, our ability to execute our strategies, or the composition of our board of directors or management team arising from activist shareholder attention or other action could lead to a perception of instability or a change in the direction of our business, which could be exploited by our competitors and/or other activist shareholders, result in the loss of business opportunities, and make it more difficult to pursue our strategic initiatives or attract and retain qualified personnel and business partners, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition, cash flows and/or prospects. Further, any such actions could cause fluctuations in the trading prices of our securities based on temporary or speculative market perceptions or other factors. 
 Financial and Capital Stock-Related Risks 
 Any impairment of our assets or investments could negatively impact us. 
 We could experience a reduction in the fair value of our assets, including our long-lived assets, intangible assets or goodwill, and/or our investments that we account for under the equity method upon the occurrence of many of the risks discussed in these risk factors and elsewhere in this report, including any closure of the Aliso Canyon natural gas storage facility without adequate cost recovery, any inability to operate our existing facilities or develop new projects in Mexico due to proposed changes to existing laws or regulations or other circumstances affecting the energy sector or our assets in that country, and more generally any loss of permits or approvals that requires us to adjust or cease certain operations and any investment in capital projects that do not receive required approvals or are changed, abandoned or otherwise not completed. Any such reduction in the fair value of our assets or investments could result in an impairment loss that could materially adversely affect our results of operations for the period in which the charge is recorded. We discuss our impairment testing of long-lived assets and goodwill and the factors considered in such testing in Part II Item 7. MD A Critical Accounting Estimates and in Note 1 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. 
 The economic interest, voting rights and market value of our outstanding common and preferred stock may be adversely affected by any additional equity securities we may issue. 
 At February 21, 2023, we had 314,569,519 shares of our common stock and 900,000 shares of our non-convertible series C preferred stock outstanding. We may seek to raise capital by issuing additional equity or convertible debt securities, which may materially dilute the voting rights and economic interests of holders of our outstanding common and preferred stock and materially adversely affect the trading price of our common and preferred stock. 
 Dividend requirements associated with our preferred stock subject us to risks. 
 Any failure to pay scheduled dividends on our series C preferred stock when due would have a material adverse impact on the market price of our securities and would prohibit us, under the terms of the series C preferred stock, from paying cash dividends on or repurchasing shares of our common stock (subject to limited exceptions) until we have paid all accumulated and unpaid dividends on the series C preferred stock. Additionally, the terms of the series C preferred stock generally provide that if dividends on any shares of the preferred stock have not been declared and paid or have been declared but not paid for three or more semi-annual dividend periods, whether or not consecutive, the holders of the preferred stock would be entitled to elect two additional members to our board of directors, subject to certain terms and limitations. 
 Our common stock is listed on the Mexican Stock Exchange and registered with the CNBV, which subjects us to additional regulation and liability in Mexico. 
 In addition to being listed for trading on the NYSE, our common stock is listed for trading on the Mexican Stock Exchange and registered with the CNBV. Such listing and registration subjects us to filing and other requirements in Mexico that could increase costs and increase performance risk of personnel given additional responsibilities. In addition, the CNBV, as the Mexican securities market regulator, has the authority to make inspections of Sempra s business, primarily in the form of requests for information and documents; impose fines or other penalties on Sempra and its directors and officers for violations of Mexican securities laws and regulations; and seek criminal liability for certain actions conducted or with effects in Mexico. The occurrence of any of these risks could materially adversely affect our results of operations, financial condition, cash flows and/or prospects.

RISKS RELATED TO ALL SEMPRA BUSINESSES 
 Operational Risks 
 Our businesses are subject to risks arising from their infrastructure and information systems. 
 Our businesses facilities and the information systems that interconnect and/or manage them are subject to risks of, among other things, potential breakdown or failure of equipment or processes due to aging infrastructure and systems; human error; shortages of or delays in obtaining equipment, materials, commodities or labor, which may be exacerbated by current or future supply chain constraints and tight labor market conditions, and increases to the costs of these items due to inflationary pressures or otherwise, which may not be recoverable in a timely manner or at all; operational restrictions resulting from environmental requirements or governmental interventions; inability to enter into, maintain, extend or replace long-term supply or transportation contracts; and performance below expected levels. Even though our businesses undertake capital investment projects to construct, replace, maintain, improve and upgrade facilities and systems, such projects may not be effective at managing the aforementioned risks, and may involve significant costs that may not be recoverable and challenges in achieving completion. We often rely on third parties, including contractors, to perform work related to these projects and other maintenance activities, which may subject us to increased risks because we manage the safety and quality of work performed by third parties and may retain liability for their work. Because our facilities are interconnected with those of third parties, including receiving natural gas supply from third party pipelines and power generation facilities that produce most of the power that we distribute to customers, the operation of our facilities could also be adversely affected by these or similar risks to the systems of such third parties, many of which may be unanticipated or uncontrollable by us. 
 Additional risks associated with our businesses ability to safely and reliably construct, replace, operate, maintain, improve and upgrade their respective facilities and systems, many of which are beyond our control, include: 
 failure to meet customer demand for electricity and/or natural gas, including electrical blackouts or curtailments or gas outages 
 natural gas surges into homes or other properties 
 the release of hazardous or toxic substances, including gas leaks 
 inadequate emergency preparedness plans and the failure to respond effectively to catastrophic events 
 The occurrence of any of these events could affect supply and demand for electricity, natural gas or other forms of energy, cause unplanned outages, damage our businesses assets and/or operations, damage the assets and/or operations of third parties on which our businesses rely, damage property owned by customers or others, and cause personal injury or death. In addition, if we are unable to defend and retain title to the properties we own or if we are unable to obtain or retain rights to construct and operate on the properties we do not own in a timely manner, on reasonable terms or at all, we could lose our rights to occupy and use these properties and the related facilities, which could result in modification, delay or curtailment of existing or proposed operations or projects, increase our costs, and result in breaches of one or more permits or contracts related to the affected facilities that could lead to legal costs, impairments or fines or penalties. Any such outcome could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition, cash flows and/or prospects. 
 Severe weather, natural disasters and other similar events could materially adversely affect us. 
 Our facilities and infrastructure, including projects in development and under construction, may be damaged by severe weather, natural disasters, accidents, explosions or acts of terrorism, war or criminality. Because we are in the business of using, storing, transporting and disposing of highly flammable, explosive and radioactive materials and operating highly energized equipment, the risks such incidents may pose to our facilities and infrastructure, as well as the risks to the surrounding communities for which we could be held responsible, are substantially greater than the risks such incidents pose to a typical business. 
 Such incidents could result in business and project development disruptions, power or gas outages, property damage, injuries and loss of life for which we could be liable and could cause secondary incidents that also may have these or other negative effects, such as fires; leaks of natural gas, natural gas odorant, propane, ethane, other GHG emissions or radioactive material; spills or other damage to natural resources; or other nuisances to affected communities. Any of these occurrences could decrease revenues and earnings and/or increase costs, including maintenance costs or restoration expenses, amounts associated with claims against us, and regulatory fines, penalties and disallowances. In some cases, we may be liable for damages even though we are not at fault, such as when the doctrine of inverse condemnation applies, which we discuss below under Risks Related to Sempra California Operational Risks. For our regulated utilities, these costs may not be recoverable in rates. Insurance coverage for these costs may increase or become prohibitively expensive, be disputed by insurers, or become unavailable for certain of these risks or at sufficient levels, and any insurance proceeds may be insufficient to cover our losses or liabilities due to limitations, exclusions, high deductibles, failure to comply with procedural requirements or other factors. Such incidents that do not directly 
 2022 Form 10-K | 38 

Table of Contents 

affect our facilities may impact our business partners, supply chains and transportation channels, which could negatively impact construction projects and our ability to provide electricity and natural gas to customers. Moreover, weather-related incidents have become more prevalent, unpredictable and severe as a result of climate change or other factors, which could have a greater impact on our businesses than currently anticipated and, for our regulated utilities, rates may not be adequately or timely adjusted to reflect any such increased impact. Any such outcome could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition, cash flows and/or prospects. 
 In addition to general information and cyber risks that all large corporations face, we face evolving cybersecurity risks associated with the energy grid, natural gas pipelines, storage and other infrastructure and protecting sensitive and confidential customer and employee information. 
 Our use of complex technologies and systems in our operations, including deployment of any new technologies, and our collection and retention of sensitive information, represent large-scale opportunities for attacks on or other failures to protect our information systems, confidential information and energy grid and natural gas infrastructure. In particular, cyber-attacks targeting utility systems and other energy infrastructure, as well as the impacts of these attacks on companies and their communities, are increasing in sophistication, magnitude and frequency and may further increase in connection with certain geopolitical events, such as the war in Ukraine. Additionally, SDG E and SoCalGas are increasingly required to disclose large amounts of data (including customer personal information and energy use data) to support changes to California s electricity and gas markets related to grid modernization and customer choice as well as energy efficiency, demand response and conservation, increasing the risks of inadvertent disclosure or other unauthorized access of sensitive information. Further, the virtualization of many business activities increases cyber risk, and generally there has been an associated increase in targeted cyber-attacks. Moreover, all our businesses operating in California (and any other states and countries where we do business that adopt similar laws) are subject to enhanced state privacy laws, which require companies that collect information about California residents to, among other things, make disclosures to consumers about their data collection, use and sharing practices; allow consumers to opt out of certain data sharing with third parties; and assume liability under a new cause of action for unauthorized disclosure of certain highly sensitive personal information. 
 Although we invest in risk management and information security measures for the protection of our systems and information, these measures could be insufficient or otherwise fail. The costs and operational consequences of implementing, maintaining and enhancing these protection measures are significant, and they could materially increase to address increasingly intense and complex cyber risks. We often rely on third-party vendors to deploy new business technologies and maintain, modify and update our systems, and these third parties may not have adequate risk management and information security measures with respect to their systems. Any cyber-attack, including ransomware attacks, on our or our vendors information systems or the integrity of the energy grid, our pipelines or our distribution, storage and other infrastructure, or unauthorized access, damage or improper disclosure of confidential information, could result in disruptions to our business operations, regulatory compliance failures, inabilities to produce accurate and timely financial statements, energy delivery failures, financial and reputational loss, customer dissatisfaction, litigation, violation of privacy laws and fines or penalties, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition, cash flows and/or prospects. Although Sempra currently maintains cyber liability insurance, this insurance is limited in scope and subject to exceptions, conditions and coverage limitations and may not cover any or even a substantial portion of the costs associated with any compromise of our information systems or confidential information, and there is no guarantee that the insurance we currently maintain will continue to be available at rates we believe are commercially reasonable. 
 We seek growth opportunities in the market organically and inorganically, including through the acquisition of, or partnerships in, operating companies. 
 We diligently analyze the financial viability of each acquisition, partnership and JV we pursue. However, our diligence may prove to be insufficient and there could be latent, unforeseen defects. In addition, we may not realize all the anticipated benefits from future acquisitions, partnerships or JVs for various reasons, including difficulties integrating operations and personnel to our standards or in a timely manner, higher and unexpected acquisition and operating costs, unknown liabilities, and fluctuations in markets. Any of these outcomes could materially adversely affect our results of operations, financial condition, cash flows and/or prospects. 
 Increasing activities and projects intended to advance new energy technologies could introduce new risks to our businesses. 
 We regularly undertake or become involved in research and development projects and other activities designed to develop new technologies in the energy space, including those related to hydrogen, energy storage, carbon sequestration, grid modernization and others. These activities and projects can involve significant employee time, as well as substantial capital resources that may 
 2022 Form 10-K | 39 

Table of Contents 

not be recoverable in rates or, with respect to our non-regulated utility businesses, may not be able to be passed through to customers. We may also seek a variety of federal and state funding opportunities for these activities and projects (such as loans and grants, including in conjunction with third-party commercial or governmental entities), which may involve significant employee time and effort and increased compliance requirements with no guarantee that any such funding would be received. In addition, the timing to complete these activities and projects is inherently uncertain and may require significantly more time and funding than we initially anticipate. Moreover, many of these technologies are in the early stage of development, and the applicable activities and projects may not be completed or the applicable technologies may not prove economically and technically feasible. If any of these circumstances occurs, we may not receive an adequate or any return on our investment and other resources invested in these activities and our results of operations, financial condition, cash flows and/or prospects could be materially adversely affected. 
 The operation of our facilities depends on good labor relations with our employees. 
 Several of our businesses have in place collective bargaining agreements with different labor unions, which are generally negotiated on a company-by-company basis. Any failure to negotiate and reach an agreement on these labor contracts as they are up for renewal could result in strikes, boycotts or other labor disruptions. Any such labor disruption or negotiated wage or benefit increases, whether due to union activities, employee turnover or otherwise, could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition, cash flows and/or prospects. 
 Our businesses depend on the performance of counterparties, and any performance failures by these counterparties could materially adversely affect us. 
 Our businesses depend on the performance of business partners, customers, suppliers and other counterparties who owe money or commodities as a result of market transactions or other long-term arrangements. If they fail to perform their obligations in accordance with these arrangements, we may need to enter into alternative arrangements or honor our underlying commitments at then-current market prices, which may result in additional losses to us to the extent of amounts already paid to such counterparties. Any efforts to enforce the terms of these arrangements through legal or other means could involve significant time and costs and would be unpredictable and may not be successful. In addition, many of these arrangements, including our relationships with the applicable counterparties, are important for the conduct and growth of our businesses. We also may not be able to secure replacement agreements with other counterparties on favorable terms, in a timely manner or at all if any of these arrangements terminate. Further, we often extend credit to customers and other counterparties and, although we perform credit analyses prior to extending credit, we may not be able to collect the amounts owed to us, which presents an increased risk for our long-term supply, sales and capacity contracts. The failure of any of our counterparties to perform in accordance with their arrangements with us could materially adversely affect our results of operations, financial condition, cash flows and/or prospects. 
 Sempra Infrastructure s obligations and those of its LNG suppliers are contractually subject to suspension or termination for force majeure events, which generally are beyond the control of the parties, and limitations of remedies for other failures to perform, including limitations on damages that may prohibit recovery of costs incurred for any breach of an agreement. Any such occurrence could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition, cash flows and/or prospects. 
 Sempra Infrastructure engages in JVs and invests in companies in which other equity partners may have or share with us control over the applicable project or investment. Sempra Texas Utilities also invests in companies that it does not control or manage. We discuss the risks related to these arrangements above under Risks Related to Sempra Operational and Structural Risks. 
 Our businesses face risks related to the COVID-19 pandemic. 
 The COVID-19 pandemic has materially impacted communities, supply chains, economies and markets around the world since March 2020. To date, the COVID-19 pandemic has not had a material impact on our results of operations. However, Sempra and some or all its businesses have been and could continue to be impacted by this pandemic or any future pandemic in a number of ways, including: 
 Disruption in supply chains and the capital markets, which has affected and could further affect liquidity, strategic initiatives and prospects, including in some cases a slowdown of planned capital spending 
 Customer-protection measures implemented by SDG E and SoCalGas, including suspending service disconnections due to nonpayment for all customers early in the pandemic (except for SoCalGas noncore customers and, since the second half of 2022, SDG E s and SoCalGas commercial and industrial customers), waiving late payment fees, offering flexible payment plans and automatically enrolling residential and small business customers with past-due balances in long-term repayment plans, which have collectively resulted in a reduction in payments from SDG E and SoCalGas customers and an increase in uncollectible accounts that could become material and may not be fully recoverable 
 2022 Form 10-K | 40 

Table of Contents 

Precautionary, preemptive and responsive actions taken by our current and prospective counterparties, customers and partners, as well as regulators and other governing bodies that affect our businesses, which have affected and could further affect our operations, results, liquidity and ability to pursue capital projects and strategic initiatives 
 Any of these impacts could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition, cash flows and/or prospects. We will continue to actively monitor the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic and may take further actions that alter our business operations as may be required by federal, state or local authorities, or that we determine are necessary for the safety of our employees, customers, partners and suppliers and, generally, the communities we serve. However, we cannot at this time predict the extent to which the COVID-19 pandemic may further impact our businesses. 
 Financial Risks 
 Our debt service obligations expose us to risks and could require additional equity securities issuances by Sempra and sales of equity interests in various subsidiaries or projects under development. 
 Our businesses have debt service obligations, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition, cash flows and/or prospects by, among other things: 
 making it more difficult and costly for each of these businesses to service, pay or refinance their debts as they come due, particularly during adverse economic or industry conditions or in periods of significant increases in interest rates 
 limiting flexibility to pursue strategic opportunities or react to business developments or changes in the industry sectors in which they operate 
 requiring cash to be used for debt service payments, thereby reducing the cash available for other purposes 
 causing lenders to require materially adverse terms in the instruments for new debt, such as restrictions on uses of proceeds or other assets or limitations on incurring additional debt, creating liens, paying dividends, repurchasing stock, making investments or receiving distributions from subsidiaries or equity method investments 
 Sempra s goal is to maintain or improve its credit ratings, but it may not be able to do so. To maintain these credit ratings, we may seek to reduce our outstanding indebtedness or our need for additional indebtedness with the proceeds from issuances of equity securities by Sempra or the sale of equity interests in our subsidiaries or development projects. We may not be able to complete any such equity sales on terms we consider acceptable or at all, and any new equity issued by Sempra may dilute the voting rights and economic interests of existing holders of Sempra s common and preferred stock. Any such outcome could have a material adverse effect on Sempra s results of operations, financial condition, cash flows and/or prospects. 
 The availability and cost of debt or equity financing could be negatively affected by market and economic conditions and other factors, and any such effects could materially adversely affect us . 
 Our businesses are capital-intensive, with significant capital spending expected in future periods. In general, we rely on long-term debt to fund a significant portion of our capital expenditures and repay outstanding debt and we rely on short-term borrowings to fund a significant portion of day-to-day business operations. Sempra may also seek to raise capital by issuing equity or selling equity interests in our subsidiaries or investments. 
 Limitations on the availability of credit, increases in interest rates or credit spreads due to inflationary pressures or otherwise or other negative effects on the terms of any financing we pursue could cause us to fund operations and capital expenditures at a higher cost or fail to raise our targeted amount of funding, which could negatively impact our ability to meet contractual and other commitments, progress development projects, make non-safety related capital expenditures and effectively sustain operations. Any of these outcomes could materially adversely affect our results of operations, financial condition, cash flows and/or prospects. 
 In addition to market and economic conditions, factors that can affect the availability and cost of capital include: 
 adverse changes to laws and regulations, including recent and proposed changes to the regulation of the energy market in Mexico 
 the overall health of the energy industry 
 volatility in electricity or natural gas prices 
 for Sempra, SDG E and SoCalGas, risks related to California wildfires 
 for Sempra, SDG E and SoCalGas, any deterioration of or uncertainty in the political or regulatory environment for local natural gas distribution companies operating in California

We are subject to risks due to uncertainty relating to the calculation of LIBOR and its scheduled discontinuance. 
 Certain of our financial and commercial agreements, including those for variable rate indebtedness, as well as interest rate derivatives, incorporate LIBOR as a benchmark for establishing certain rates. As directed by the U.S. Federal Reserve, banks ceased making new LIBOR-based issuances at the end of 2021, and publication of certain key U.S. dollar LIBOR tenors for existing loans is expected to cease in mid-2023. These events could cause LIBOR to perform differently than it has performed historically. Use of the SOFR, which has been identified as the replacement benchmark rate for LIBOR, may result in interest payments that are higher than expected or that do not otherwise correlate over time with the payments that would have been made using LIBOR. Changes to or the discontinuance of LIBOR, any uncertainty regarding such changes or discontinuance, and the performance and characteristics of alternative benchmark rates, could negatively affect our existing and future variable rate indebtedness and interest rate hedges and the cost of doing business under our commercial agreements that incorporate LIBOR, SOFR or other alternative benchmark rates, and could require us to seek to amend the terms of the relevant indebtedness or agreements, which may not be possible and/or may require us to accept terms that are materially worse than existing terms. The occurrence of any of these risks could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition, cash flows and/or prospects. 
 Credit rating agencies may downgrade our credit ratings or place those ratings on negative outlook. 
 Credit rating agencies routinely evaluate Sempra, SDG E, SoCalGas and SI Partners and certain of our other businesses, and their ratings are based on a number of factors, including the factors described below and the ability to generate cash flows; level of indebtedness; overall financial strength; specific transactions or events, such as share repurchases and significant litigation; the status of certain capital projects; and the state of the economy and our industry generally. These credit ratings could be downgraded or other negative credit rating actions could occur at any time. We discuss these credit ratings in Part II Item 7. MD A Capital Resources and Liquidity. 
 For Sempra, the Rating Agencies have noted that the following events, among others, could lead to negative ratings actions: 
 expansion of natural gas liquefaction projects or other unregulated businesses in a manner inconsistent with its present level of credit quality 
 Sempra s consolidated financial measures do not improve, or it fails to meet certain financial credit metrics 
 catastrophic wildfires caused by SDG E or by any California electric IOUs that participate in the Wildfire Fund, which could exhaust the fund considerably earlier than expected 
 For SDG E, the Rating Agencies have noted that the following events, among others, could lead to negative ratings actions: 
 catastrophic wildfires caused by SDG E or by any California electric IOUs that participate in the Wildfire Fund, which could exhaust the fund considerably earlier than expected 
 a consistent weakening of SDG E s financial metrics or a deterioration in the regulatory environment 
 a ratings downgrade at Sempra 
 For SoCalGas, the Rating Agencies have noted that the following events, among others, could lead to negative ratings actions: 
 SoCalGas financial measures consistently weaken, or it fails to meet certain financial credit metrics 
 SoCalGas experiences increased business risk, including a deterioration in the regulatory environment, leading to weakening of its stand-alone business risk profile 
 a ratings downgrade at Sempra 
 For SI Partners, the Rating Agencies have noted that the following events, among others, could lead to negative ratings actions: 
 SI Partners failure to meet certain financial credit metrics 
 a deterioration in SI Partners business risk profile, including incremental construction risk or adverse changes in the operating environment in Mexico 
 a ratings downgrade at Sempra, IEnova and/or Cameron LNG, LLC 
 A downgrade of any of our businesses credit ratings or ratings outlooks, as well as the reasons for such downgrades, may materially adversely affect the market prices of our securities, the interest rates at which borrowings can be made and debt securities issued, and the various fees on our credit facilities. This could make it more costly for the affected businesses to borrow money, issue securities and/or raise other types of capital, any of which could materially adversely affect our ability to meet our debt obligations and contractual commitments, and our results of operations, financial condition, cash flows and/or prospects.

We do not fully hedge our assets or contract positions against changes in commodity prices or interest rates, and for those positions that are hedged, our hedging procedures may not mitigate our risk as expected or prevent us from experiencing losses. 
 We have used and may continue to use forward contracts, futures, financial swaps and/or options, among other mechanisms, to hedge our known or anticipated purchase and sale commitments, inventories of natural gas and LNG, natural gas storage and pipeline capacity and electric generation capacity in an effort to reduce our financial exposure related to commodity price fluctuations. We do not hedge the entire exposure to market price volatility of our assets or our contract positions, and the extent of the coverage to these exposures varies over time. In addition, we have used and may continue to use similar financial instruments to hedge against changes in interest rates. Certain derivative securities we use to hedge are recorded at fair value through earnings to reflect movements in the price of the security, which has in the past and could in the future create volatility in our earnings (such as the significantly higher unrealized losses on commodity derivatives that we recognized in 2022 compared to 2021 as we discuss in Part II Item 7. MD A Results of Operations ). To the extent we have unhedged positions, or if our hedging strategies do not work as expected, fluctuating commodity prices could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition, cash flows and/or prospects. Certain of the contracts we may use for hedging purposes are subject to fair value accounting, which may result in gains or losses in earnings for those contracts that may not reflect the associated gains or losses of the underlying position being hedged and could result in fluctuations of our results from period to period. 
 Risk management procedures may not prevent or mitigate losses. 
 Although we have in place risk management and control systems designed to quantify and manage risk, these systems may not prevent material losses. Risk management procedures may not always be followed as intended or function as expected. In addition, daily VaR and loss limits, which are primarily based on historic price movements and which we discuss in Part II Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk, may not protect us from losses if prices significantly or persistently deviate from historic prices. As a result of these and other factors, our risk management procedures and systems may not prevent or mitigate losses that could materially adversely affect our results of operations, financial condition, cash flows and/or prospects. 
 Market performance or changes in other assumptions could require unplanned contributions to pension and PBOP plans. 
 Sempra, SDG E and SoCalGas provide defined benefit pension and PBOP plans to eligible employees and retirees. The cost of providing these benefits is affected by many factors, including the market value of plan assets and the other factors described in Note 9 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. A decline in the market value of plan assets or an adverse change in any of these other factors could cause a material increase in our funding obligations for these plans, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition, cash flows and/or prospects. 
 Legal and Regulatory Risks 
 Our businesses require numerous permits, licenses, franchises and other approvals from various governmental agencies, and the failure to obtain or maintain any of them, or lengthy delays in obtaining them, could materially adversely affect us. 
 Our businesses require numerous permits, licenses, rights-of-way, franchises, certificates and other approvals from federal, state, local and foreign governmental agencies. These approvals may not be granted in a timely manner or at all or may be modified, rescinded or fail to be extended for a variety of reasons. Obtaining or maintaining these approvals could result in higher costs or the imposition of conditions or restrictions on our operations. For example, SoCalGas franchise agreement with Los Angeles County is scheduled to expire in June 2023. Further, these approvals require compliance by us and may require compliance by our customers, which could result in modification, suspension or rescission and subject us to fines and penalties in the event of noncompliance. If one or more of these approvals were to be suspended, rescinded or otherwise terminated, including due to expiration or legal or regulatory changes, or modified in a manner that makes our continued operation of the applicable business prohibitively expensive or otherwise undesirable or impossible, we may be required to adjust or temporarily or permanently cease certain of our operations, sell the associated assets or remove them from service and/or construct new assets intended to bypass the impacted area, in which case we may lose some of our rate base or revenue-generating assets, our development projects may be negatively affected and we may incur impairment charges or other costs that may not be recoverable. The occurrence of any of these events could materially adversely affect our results of operations, financial condition, cash flows and/or prospects. 
 We may invest funds in capital projects prior to receiving all regulatory approvals. If there is a delay in obtaining these approvals; if any approval is conditioned on changes or other requirements that increase costs or impose restrictions on our existing or 
 2022 Form 10-K | 43 

Table of Contents 

planned operations; if we fail to obtain or maintain these approvals or comply with them or other applicable laws or regulations; if we are involved in litigation that adversely impacts any approval or rights to the applicable property or assets; or if management decides not to proceed with a project, we may be unable to recover any or all amounts invested in that project. Any such occurrence could cause our costs to materially increase, result in material impairments, and otherwise materially adversely affect our results of operations, financial condition, cash flows and/or prospects. 
 Our businesses face climate change concerns and have environmental compliance and clean energy transition costs, which could have a material adverse effect on us. 
 Climate change and the costs associated with its impacts and mitigation may have the potential to adversely affect our businesses, including by increasing the costs we incur to transmit energy and provide other services, impacting the demand for and consumption of the natural gas we distribute and the energy we transmit (due to changes in costs, weather patterns, the type of energy transmitted as a result of increasing customer preference for carbon-neutral and renewable sources of energy, and other factors), and affecting the economic health of the regions in which we operate. 
 Our businesses are subject to extensive federal, state, local and foreign statutes, orders, rules and regulations relating to climate change and environmental protection. To comply with these requirements, we must expend significant capital and employee resources on (i) environmental monitoring, surveillance and other measures to track performance; (ii) acquisitions of pollution control equipment; (iii) mitigation efforts; and (iv) emissions fees, which could increase as a result of various factors we may not control, including changing laws and regulations, increased enforcement activities, delays in the renewal and issuance of permits, and changes to the mix of energy we are required to supply. In addition, we are generally responsible for hazardous substances and other contamination on and the conditions of our projects and properties, regardless of when these conditions arose and whether they are known or unknown. In addition, we could be liable for contamination at our former facilities and off-site waste disposal sites that have been used in our operations. For our regulated utilities, some of these costs may not be recoverable in rates. Failure to comply with environmental laws and regulations may subject our businesses to fines and penalties, including criminal penalties in some cases, and/or curtailment of our operations. Any of these outcomes could materially adversely affect our results of operations, financial condition, cash flows and/or prospects. 
 Increasing international, national, regional, state and local-level environmental concerns and related new or proposed legislation and regulation or changes to existing legislation or regulation, such as increased requirements for monitoring and surveillance, disclosures on environmental performance and targets, pollution monitoring and control equipment, safety practices, emissions fees, taxes, penalties or other obligations or restrictions, may have material negative effects on our operations, operating costs, corporate planning, and the scope and economics of proposed expansions, infrastructure projects or other capital expenditures. 
 In addition, existing and potential new or amended legislation and regulation relating to the control and reduction of GHG emissions and mitigating climate change may materially restrict our operations, negatively impact demand for our services, the natural gas we distribute and/or the energy we transmit, limit development opportunities, force costly or otherwise burdensome changes to our operations or otherwise materially adversely affect us. For example, SB 100 (enacted in 2018) and SB 1020 (enacted in 2022) requires each California electric utility, including SDG E, to procure at least 50 of its annual electric energy requirements from renewable energy sources by 2026, 60 by 2030, 90 by 2035, and 95 by 2040. State law also creates the policy of meeting all of California s retail electricity supply with a mix of RPS Program-eligible and zero-carbon resources by 2045. The law also includes stipulations that this policy not increase carbon emissions elsewhere in the western grid and not allow resource shuffling, and requires that the CPUC, CEC, CARB and other state agencies incorporate this policy into all relevant planning. In addition, the Governor of California signed an executive order establishing a new statewide goal to achieve carbon neutrality as soon as possible, and no later than 2045, and achieve and maintain net negative emissions thereafter. The executive order calls on CARB to address this goal in future scoping plans, which affect several major sectors of California s economy, including transportation, agriculture, development, industrial and others. California has issued new climate initiatives in line with this statewide goal, including two executive orders requiring sales of all passenger vehicles to be zero-emission by 2035. 
 Moreover, the energy transition in California and elsewhere, including decarbonization goals, has introduced uncertainty in investor support over the long term, leading some to reduce investment in or divest from the energy sector. Maintaining investor confidence and attracting capital at a competitive cost will depend in part on successfully demonstrating our ability to reduce emissions associated with our operations and the energy we transmit, consistent with Sempra s aim to have net-zero emissions by 2050 and SDG E s and SoCalGas aim to have net-zero emissions by 2045. Our ability to achieve this aim depends on many factors, some of which we do not control, including supportive energy laws and policies, development, availability and adoption of alternative fuels, successful research and development efforts focused on low-carbon technologies that are economically and technically feasible, cooperation from our partners, financing sources and commercial counterparties, customer participation in conservation and energy efficiency programs, and our ability to execute our planned investments in and advancement of our

infrastructure. Although we have developed interim targets and various plans designed to support California in reaching its GHG emissions and renewable energy mandates and our own energy goals, we may not be successful. 
 We will need to continue to expend capital and employee resources to develop and deploy new technologies and modernize grid systems in our efforts to support the clean energy transition in California and elsewhere and achieve our climate targets and those mandated by applicable authorities, which may not be recoverable in rates or, with respect to our non-regulated utility businesses, may not be able to be passed through to customers. Even if such costs are recoverable, the costs of these efforts and complying with these mandates, coupled with the necessary costs of investing for safety and reliability, may negatively impact the affordability of SDG E s and SoCalGas customer rates and, for our non-regulated utility businesses, may cause costs to increase to levels that reduce customer demand and growth. SDG E and SoCalGas, as well as any of our other businesses affected by GHG emissions mandates, may also be subject to fines and penalties if mandated renewable energy goals are not met, and all our businesses could suffer difficulties attracting investors and business partners, reputational harm and other negative effects if we do not meet or if we scale back our GHG emissions goals or there are negative views about our environmental disclosures or practices generally. Any of these outcomes could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition, cash flows and/or prospects. 
 Our businesses are subject to numerous governmental regulations and complex tax and accounting requirements and may be materially adversely affected by them or any changes to them. 
 The electric power and natural gas industries are subject to numerous governmental regulations, and our businesses are also subject to complex tax and accounting requirements. These regulations and requirements may undergo changes at the federal, state, local and foreign levels, including in response to economic or political conditions. Compliance with these regulations and requirements, including in the event of changes to them or how they are implemented, interpreted or enforced, could increase our operating costs and materially adversely affect how we conduct our business. New tax legislation, regulations or interpretations or changes in tax policies in the U.S. or other countries in which we operate or do business could negatively affect our tax expense and/or tax balances and our businesses generally. Any failure to comply with these regulations and requirements could subject us to fines and penalties, including criminal penalties in some cases, and result in the temporary or permanent shutdown of certain facilities or operations. The occurrence of any of these risks could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition, cash flows and/or prospects. 
 Our operations are subject to rules relating to transactions among SDG E, SoCalGas and other Sempra businesses. These rules are commonly referred to as affiliate rules, and they primarily impact transmission supply, capacity and marketing activities, including restricting our ability to sell natural gas or electricity to, or trade with, SDG E and SoCalGas and their ability to complete these transactions with each other. These rules, as well as any changes to these rules or their interpretations or additional more restrictive CPUC or FERC rules related to transactions with affiliates, could materially adversely affect our operations and, in turn, our results of operations, financial condition, cash flows and/or prospects. 
 We may be materially adversely affected by the outcome of litigation or other proceedings in which we are involved. 
 Our businesses are involved in a number of lawsuits, binding arbitrations, regulatory investigations and other proceedings. We discuss material pending proceedings in Note 16 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. We have spent, and continue to spend, substantial money, time and employee and management focus on these lawsuits and other proceedings. The uncertainties inherent in lawsuits and other proceedings make it difficult to estimate with any degree of certainty the timing, costs and ranges of costs or effects of resolving these matters. In addition, juries have demonstrated a willingness to grant large awards, including punitive damages, in response to personal injury, product liability, property damage and other claims. Accordingly, actual costs incurred have and may continue to differ materially from insured or reserved amounts and may not be recoverable, in whole or in part, from insurance or in customer rates. Any of the foregoing could cause reputational damage and materially adversely affect our results of operations, financial condition, cash flows and/or prospects.

RISKS RELATED TO SEMPRA CALIFORNIA 
 Operational Risks 
 Wildfires in California pose risks to Sempra California (particularly SDG E) and Sempra. 
 Potential for Increased and More Severe Wildfires 
 Over the past few years, California has been experiencing some of the largest wildfires (measured by acres burned) in its history. Frequent and severe drought conditions, inconsistent and extreme swings in precipitation, changes in vegetation, unseasonably warm temperatures, low humidity, strong winds and other factors have increased the duration of the wildfire season and the intensity, prevalence and difficulty of prevention and containment of wildfires in California, including in SDG E s and SoCalGas service territories. Changing weather patterns, including as a result of climate change, could cause these conditions to become even more extreme and unpredictable. These wildfires could jeopardize SDG E s and SoCalGas electric and natural gas infrastructure and third-party property and result in temporary power shortages in SDG E s and SoCalGas service territories. Certain of California s local land use policies and forestry management practices have been relaxed to allow for the construction and development of residential and commercial projects in high-risk fire areas, which could lead to increased third-party claims and greater losses in the event of fires in these areas for which SDG E or SoCalGas may be liable. Any such wildfires in SDG E s and SoCalGas territories (or outside of these territories in the event the Wildfire Fund described below is materially diminished) could materially adversely affect SDG E s, SoCalGas and Sempra s results of operations, financial condition, cash flows and/or prospects, which we discuss in this risk factor below and above under Risks Related to All Sempra Businesses Operational Risks. 
 The Wildfire Legislation 
 In July 2019, the Wildfire Legislation was signed into law, which we discuss in Note 1 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. The Wildfire Legislation s revised legal standard for the recovery of wildfire costs may not be implemented effectively or applied consistently, we may not be eligible for the Wildfire Legislation s cap on wildfire-related liability if SDG E fails to maintain a valid annual safety certification from the OEIS or meet other requirements of the legislation, and/or the Wildfire Fund could be exhausted due to claims against the fund by SDG E or other participating IOUs as a result of fires in their respective service territories, any of which could have a material adverse effect on Sempra s and SDG E s results of operations, financial condition, cash flows and/or prospects. PG E has indicated that it will seek reimbursement from the Wildfire Fund for losses associated with the Dixie fire, which burned from July 2021 through October 2021 and was reported to be the largest single wildfire (measured by acres burned) in California history. In addition, the Wildfire Legislation did not change the doctrine of inverse condemnation, which imposes strict liability (meaning that liability is imposed regardless of fault) on a utility whose equipment, such as its electric distribution and transmission lines, is determined to be a cause of a fire. In such an event, the utility would be responsible for the costs of damages, including potential business interruption losses, and interest and attorneys fees, even if the utility has not been found negligent. The doctrine of inverse condemnation also is not exclusive of other theories of liability, including if the utility were found negligent, in which case additional liabilities, such as fire suppression, clean-up and evacuation costs, medical expenses, and personal injury, punitive and other damages, could be imposed. We are unable to predict the impact of the Wildfire Legislation on SDG E s ability to recover costs and expenses in the event that SDG E s equipment is determined to be a cause of a fire, and specifically in the context of the application of inverse condemnation. 
 Cost Recovery Through Insurance or Rates 
 As a result of the strict liability standard applied to electric IOU-caused wildfires in California, substantial losses recently recorded by insurance companies, and the risk of an increase in the number and size of wildfires, obtaining insurance coverage for wildfires that could be caused by SDG E (or, to a lesser extent, SoCalGas) has become increasingly difficult and costly. If these conditions continue or worsen, insurance for wildfire liabilities may become unavailable or may become prohibitively expensive and we may be challenged or unsuccessful when we seek recovery of insurance cost increases through the regulatory process. In addition, insurance for wildfire liabilities may not be sufficient to cover all losses we may incur, or it may not be available in sufficient amounts to meet the 1.0 billion of primary insurance required by the Wildfire Legislation. We are unable to predict whether we would be able to recover in rates or from the Wildfire Fund the amount of any uninsured losses. A loss that is not fully insured, is not sufficiently covered by the Wildfire Fund and/or cannot be recovered in customer rates could materially adversely affect Sempra s and one or both of SDG E s and SoCalGas results of operations, financial condition, cash flows and/or prospects.

Wildfire Mitigation Efforts 
 Although we expend significant resources on measures designed to mitigate wildfire risks, these measures may not be effective in preventing wildfires or reducing our wildfire-related losses and their costs may not be fully recoverable in rates. SDG E is required by applicable California law to submit annual wildfire mitigation plans for approval by the OEIS and could be subject to increased risks if these plans are not approved in a timely manner or the measures set forth in the plans are not implemented effectively, as well as fines or penalties for any failure to comply with the approved plans. One of our wildfire mitigation and safety tools is to de-energize certain of our facilities when weather conditions become extreme and there is elevated wildfire ignition risk. These public safety power shutoffs have been subject to scrutiny by various stakeholders, including customers, regulators and lawmakers, which could increase the risk of liability for damages associated with these events. Such costs may not be recoverable in rates. Unrecoverable costs, adverse legislation or rulemaking, scrutiny by key stakeholders, ineffective wildfire mitigation measures or other negative effects associated with these efforts could materially adversely affect Sempra s and SDG E s results of operations, financial condition, cash flows and/or prospects. 
 The electricity industry is undergoing significant change, including increased deployment of DER, technological advancements, and political and regulatory developments . 
 Electric utilities in California are experiencing increasing deployment of DER, such as solar generation, energy storage and energy efficiency and demand management technologies, and California s environmental policy objectives are accelerating the pace and scope of these changes. This growth of DER and demand management will require further modernization of the electric distribution grid to, among other things, accommodate increasing two-way flows of electricity and increase the grid s capacity to interconnect these resources. In addition, enabling California s clean energy goals will require sustained investments in grid modernization, renewable integration projects, energy efficiency programs, energy storage options, operational and data management systems, and electric vehicle infrastructure. The growth of third-party energy storage alternatives and other technologies also may increasingly compete with SDG E s traditional transmission and distribution infrastructure in delivering electricity to consumers. The CPUC is conducting several proceedings regarding DER and demand management, including the evaluation of various projects and pilots; changes to the planning and operation of the electric distribution grid to prepare for higher penetration of DER; future grid modernization and grid investments; the deferral of traditional grid investments by DER; and the role of the electric distribution grid operator. These proceedings and the broader changes in California s electricity industry could result in new regulations, policies and/or operational changes that could materially adversely affect SDG E s and Sempra s results of operations, financial condition, cash flows and/or prospects. 
 SDG E provides bundled electric procurement service through various resources that are typically procured on a long-term basis. Although SDG E currently provides such procurement service for a portion of its customer load, most customers receive procurement service from a load-serving entity other than SDG E through programs such as CCA and DA, in which case SDG E no longer procures energy for this departing load. CCA is only available if a customer s local jurisdiction (city or county) offers such a program and DA is currently limited by a cap based on gigawatt hours. Several jurisdictions in SDG E s territory, including the City of San Diego, have implemented CCA, and additional jurisdictions are in the process of implementing or considering CCA. SDG E s historical energy procurement for future deliveries exceeds the needs of its remaining bundled customers as customers have elected CCA and DA services. To help achieve the goal of ratepayer indifference (as to whether or not customers energy is procured by SDG E or by CCA or DA), the CPUC revised the Power Charge Indifference Adjustment framework. The purpose of the framework is to help ensure SDG E s procurement cost obligations are more equitably shared among customers served by SDG E and customers now served by CCA and DA. SDG E implemented the framework on January 1, 2019. If the framework or other mechanisms designed to achieve ratepayer indifference do not perform as intended, if the law changes, or if the law is not interpreted or enforced as expected, SDG E s remaining bundled customers could experience large increases in rates for commodity costs under commitments made on behalf of CCA and DA customers prior to their departure or, if all such costs are not recoverable in rates, SDG E could experience material increases in its unrecoverable commodity costs. Any of these outcomes could have a material adverse effect on SDG E s and Sempra s results of operations, financial condition, cash flows and/or prospects. 
 Natural gas and natural gas storage have increasingly been the subject of political and public scrutiny, including a desire by some to reduce or eliminate reliance on natural gas as an energy source . 
 Certain California legislators, as well as stakeholder, advocacy and activist groups, have expressed a desire to limit or eliminate reliance on natural gas as an energy source by advocating increased use of renewable electricity and electrification in lieu of the use of natural gas. Reducing methane emissions also has become a major focus of certain local and state agencies and the U.S. Administration, as well as the CPUC, resulting in passed or proposed legislation, regulation, policies and ordinances to prohibit or restrict the use and consumption of natural gas in new buildings, appliances and other applications. These actions could have the effect of reducing natural gas use over time. 
 2022 Form 10-K | 47 

Table of Contents 

CARB, California s primary regulator for GHG emissions reduction programs, continues to pursue plans for reducing GHG emissions in line with California s climate goals that include proposals to reduce natural gas demand through proposed building decarbonization measures (for example, zero-emission standards for space and water heaters), or through promoting legislation for increased renewable electricity generation. Additionally, the CEC s Title 24 requirements mandate that new construction include electric-ready buildings and heat pump technologies beginning in 2023. 
 The CPUC has an ongoing proceeding that seeks to establish a state-wide process to help utilities plan appropriate gas infrastructure portfolios as natural gas usage in the state is expected to decline. This includes a new gas infrastructure General Order (GO 177) requiring site-specific approvals for certain gas infrastructure projects as well as issuance of a CPUC staff proposal to develop a gas distribution infrastructure decommissioning framework. The CPUC may similarly enact measures to reduce natural gas demand (such as more aggressive energy efficiency programs), promote fuel substitution (such as replacement of natural gas appliances with electric appliances), and order changes (such as its recent decision to eliminate gas line extension allowances for new applications submitted on or after July 1, 2023). 
 A substantial reduction in or the elimination of natural gas as an energy source in California without adequate and appropriate recovery of investments could result in impairment of some or all of SoCalGas and SDG E s natural gas infrastructure assets if they were not permitted to be repurposed for alternative fuels, were required to be depreciated on an accelerated basis or were to become stranded, which could have a material adverse effect on SoCalGas , SDG E s and Sempra s results of operations, financial conditions, cash flows and/or prospects. 
 SDG E may incur significant costs and liabilities from its partial ownership of a nuclear facility being decommissioned . 
 SDG E has a 20 ownership interest in SONGS, which we discuss in Note 15 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. SDG E and each of the other owners of SONGS is responsible for financing its share of the facility s expenses and capital expenditures, including those related to decommissioning activities. Although the facility is being decommissioned, SDG E s ownership interest in SONGS continues to subject it to risks, including: 
 the potential release of radioactive material 
 the potential harmful effects from the former operation of the facility 
 limitations on the insurance commercially available to cover losses associated with operating and decommissioning the facility 
 uncertainties with respect to the technological and financial aspects of decommissioning the facility 
 SDG E maintains the SONGS NDT to provide funds for nuclear decommissioning. Trust assets have been generally invested in equity and debt securities, which are subject to market fluctuations. A decline in the market value of trust assets, an adverse change in the law regarding funding requirements for decommissioning trusts, or changes in assumptions or forecasts related to decommissioning dates, technology and the cost of labor, materials and equipment due to inflationary pressures or otherwise could increase the funding requirements for these trusts, which costs may not be fully recoverable in rates. In addition, CPUC approval is required to make withdrawals from the NDT, and CPUC approval for certain expenditures may be denied if the CPUC determines the expenditures are unreasonable. In addition, decommissioning may be materially more expensive than we currently anticipate and therefore decommissioning costs may exceed the amounts in the NDT. Rate recovery for overruns would require CPUC approval, which may not occur. 
 The occurrence of any of these events could result in a reduction in our expected recovery and have a material adverse effect on SDG E s and Sempra s results of operations, financial condition, cash flows and/or prospects. 
 Legal and Regulatory Risks 
 SDG E and SoCalGas are subject to extensive regulation by federal, state and local legislative and regulatory authorities, which may materially adversely affect Sempra, SDG E and SoCalGas. 
 Rates and Other Financial Matters 
 The CPUC regulates SDG E s and SoCalGas customer rates, except for SDG E s electric transmission rates that are regulated by the FERC, and conditions of service. The CPUC also regulates SDG E s and SoCalGas sales of securities, rates of return, capital structure, rates of depreciation, long-term resource procurement and other financial matters in various ratemaking proceedings. The CPUC periodically approves SDG E s and SoCalGas customer rates based on authorized capital expenditures, operating costs, including income taxes, and an authorized rate of return on investments while incorporating a risk-based decision-making framework, as well as settlements with third parties. The outcome of ratemaking proceedings can be affected by various

factors, many of which are not in our control, including the level of opposition by intervening parties; any rejection by the CPUC of settlements with third parties; potential rate impacts; increasing levels of regulatory review; changes in the political, regulatory, or legislative environments; and the opinions of regulators, consumer and other stakeholder groups and customers. These ratemaking proceedings include decisions about major programs in which SDG E and SoCalGas make investments under an approved CPUC framework, such as wildfire mitigation and pipeline and storage integrity and safety enhancement programs, but which investments may remain subject to a CPUC filing or reasonableness review with potentially unclear standards or other factors as described above that may result in the disallowance of incurred costs. SDG E and SoCalGas also may be required to incur costs and make investments to comply with proposed legislative and regulatory requirements and initiatives, including those related to California s climate goals and policies, and their ability to recover these costs and investments may depend on the final form of the legislative or regulatory requirements and the ratemaking mechanisms associated with them. Recovery can also be affected by the timing and process of the ratemaking mechanism, in which there can be a significant time lag between when costs are incurred and when those costs are recovered in customers rates and material differences between the forecasted and authorized costs embedded in rates (which are set on a prospective basis) and the actual costs incurred. The CPUC may also experience delays in its decisions on recovery or may deny recovery altogether on the basis that costs were not reasonably or prudently incurred or for other reasons. Even if recoverable, the cost of investments to support the clean energy transition in California while also investing in necessary safety and reliability may negatively impact the affordability of SDG E s and SoCalGas customer rates and their and Sempra s results of operations, financial condition, cash flows and/or prospects. 
 In addition, a CPUC cost of capital proceeding every three years determines a utility s authorized capital structure and authorized return on rate base, and the CCM applies in the interim years and considers changes in the cost of capital based on changes in interest rates for each 12-month period ending September 30 (the measurement period). Alternatively, each of SDG E and SoCalGas are permitted to file a cost of capital application in an interim year in which an extraordinary or catastrophic event materially impacts its cost of capital and affects utilities differently than the market as a whole to have its cost of capital determined in lieu of the CCM. Any such rate change due to a downward trigger of the CCM could have a material adverse effect on Sempra s and the applicable utility s results of operations, financial condition, cash flows and/or prospects. We discuss the CCM in Part I Item 1. Business - Ratemaking Mechanisms Sempra California Cost of Capital Proceedings, and in Note 4 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. 
 The FERC regulates electric transmission rates, the transmission and wholesale sales of electricity in interstate commerce, transmission access, the rates of return on investments in electric transmission assets, and other similar matters involving SDG E. These ratemaking mechanisms are subject to many risks similar to those described above regarding the CPUC ratemaking proceedings. 
 CPUC Authority Over Operational Matters 
 The CPUC has regulatory authority related to safety standards and practices, competitive conditions, reliability and planning, affiliate relationships and a wide range of other operational matters, including citation programs concerning matters such as safety activity, disconnection and billing practices, resource adequacy and environmental compliance. Many of these standards and citation programs are becoming more stringent and could impose significant penalties, including enforcement programs under which the CPUC staff can issue citations that in some cases can impose substantial fines. The CPUC also continues to explore expansion of its programs to provide additional oversight. The CPUC conducts reviews and audits of the matters under its authority and could launch investigations or open proceedings at any time on any such matter it deems appropriate, the results of which could lead to citations, disallowances, fines and penalties, as well as corrective or mitigation actions required to address any noncompliance that may not be sufficiently funded by customer rates or at all. Any such occurrence could have a material adverse effect on Sempra s, SDG E s and SoCalGas results of operations, financial condition, cash flows and/or prospects. 
 We discuss various CPUC proceedings relating to SDG E and SoCalGas in Notes 4 and 16 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. 
 Potential Regulatory Changes and Influence of Other Organizations 
 SDG E, SoCalGas and Sempra may be materially adversely affected by revisions or reinterpretations of existing or new legislation, regulations, decisions, orders or interpretations of the CPUC, the FERC or other regulatory bodies, any of which could change how SDG E and SoCalGas operate, affect their ability to recover various costs through rates or adjustment mechanisms, require them to incur additional expenses or otherwise materially adversely affect their and Sempra s results of operations, financial condition, cash flows and/or prospects. 
 SDG E and SoCalGas are also affected by numerous advocacy groups, including California Public Advocates Office, The Utility Reform Network, Utility Consumers Action Network and the Sierra Club. Any success by any of these groups in directly or 
 2022 Form 10-K | 49

indirectly influencing regulatory bodies with authority over their operations could have a material adverse effect on SDG E s, SoCalGas and Sempra s results of operations, financial condition, cash flows and/or prospects. 
 SoCalGas has incurred and may continue to incur significant costs, expenses and other liabilities related to the Leak. 
 From October 23, 2015 through February 11, 2016, SoCalGas experienced the Leak, which we describe in Note 16 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. 
 Litigation 
 In September 2021, SoCalGas and Sempra entered into an agreement with counsel to resolve lawsuits filed by approximately 36,000 plaintiffs (the Individual Plaintiffs) against SoCalGas and Sempra related to the Leak resulting in a payment of approximately 1.8 billion. The Individual Plaintiffs who do not participate in that settlement (the Remaining Individual Plaintiffs) will be able to continue to pursue their claims. As of February 21, 2023, lawsuits filed by the Remaining Individual Plaintiffs and several shareholder derivative actions are pending against SoCalGas related to the Leak, some of which have also named Sempra and/or certain officers and directors of SoCalGas and Sempra. Additional litigation may be filed against us related to the Leak or our responses to it. The costs of defending against, settling or otherwise resolving the pending lawsuits or any new litigation could materially adversely affect SoCalGas and Sempra s results of operations, financial condition, cash flows and/or prospects. We discuss these risks above under Risks Related to All Sempra Businesses Legal and Regulatory Risks and in this risk factor below under Estimated Costs, Insurance and Accounting and Other Impacts. 
 Regulatory Proceedings 
 SoCalGas has been subject to an OII to investigate and consider, among other things, what damages, fines or other penalties, if any, should be imposed against SoCalGas in connection with the Leak (the Leak OII). In October 2022, SoCalGas executed a settlement agreement with SED and the Public Advocates Office at the CPUC to resolve all aspects of the Leak OII, which is subject to CPUC approval. The settlement agreement provides for financial penalties, certain costs that SoCalGas will reimburse, a violation of California Public Utilities Code section 451, and costs previously incurred by SoCalGas for which it will not seek recovery from ratepayers, among other provisions. Other investigations related to the Leak could result in additional findings of violations of laws, orders, rules or regulations as well as fines and penalties, any of which could involve substantial costs and cause reputational damage. In addition, SoCalGas may incur higher operating costs and additional capital expenditures as a result of new investigations or new laws, orders, rules and regulations arising out of this incident, or our responses thereto, which may not be recoverable through insurance or in customer rates. The occurrence of any of these risks could materially adversely affect SoCalGas and Sempra s results of operations, financial condition, cash flows and/or prospects. 
 Natural Gas Storage Operations and Reliability 
 In February 2017, the CPUC opened a proceeding pursuant to SB 380 OII to determine the feasibility of minimizing or eliminating the use of the Aliso Canyon natural gas storage facility while still maintaining energy and electric reliability for the region, including analyzing alternative means for meeting or avoiding the demand for the facility s services if it were eliminated. 
 If the Aliso Canyon natural gas storage facility were to be permanently closed or if future cash flows from its operation were otherwise insufficient to recover its carrying value, we may record an impairment of the facility, which could be material, incur materially higher than expected operating costs and/or be required to make material additional capital expenditures (any or all of which may not be recoverable in rates), and natural gas reliability and electric generation could be jeopardized. Any such outcome could have a material adverse effect on SoCalGas and Sempra s results of operations, financial condition, cash flows and/or prospects. 
 Cost Estimate, Insurance and Accounting and Other Impacts 
 At December 31, 2022, SoCalGas estimates certain costs related to the Leak are 3,486 million (the cost estimate), including 1,279 million of costs recovered from insurance. Other than insurance for directors and officers liability, we have exhausted all of our insurance for this matter. We continue to pursue other sources of insurance coverage for costs related to this matter, but we may not be successful in obtaining additional insurance recovery for any of these costs. At December 31, 2022, 129 million of the cost estimate is accrued in Reserve for Aliso Canyon Costs and 4 million of the cost estimate is accrued in Deferred Credits and Other on SoCalGas and Sempra s Consolidated Balance Sheets. 
 The civil litigation that remains pending against us related to the Leak seeks compensatory, statutory and punitive damages, restitution, and civil and administrative fines, penalties and other costs. We also could be subject to damages, fines or other penalties as a result of the pending regulatory investigation related to the Leak. Except for the amounts paid or estimated to settle 
 2022 Form 10-K | 50 

Table of Contents 

certain pending legal and regulatory matters as we describe in Note 16 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, the cost estimate does not include any amounts necessary to resolve pending litigation or regulatory proceedings, other potential litigation or other costs, in each case to the extent it is not possible to predict at this time the outcome of these actions or reasonably estimate the possible costs or a range of possible costs. Further, we are not able to reasonably estimate the possible loss or a range of possible losses in excess of the amounts accrued. The costs or losses not included in the cost estimate could be significant and could have a material adverse effect on SoCalGas and Sempra s results of operations, financial condition, cash flows and/or prospects. 
 Any failure by the CPUC to adequately reform SDG E s rate structure could have a material adverse effect on SDG E and Sempra. 
 The NEM program is an electric billing tariff mechanism designed to promote the installation of on-site renewable generation (primarily solar installations) for residential and business customers. Depending on when the on-site generation was installed, NEM customers receive a full retail rate or a reduced retail rate for energy they generate but do not use that is fed to the utility s power grid, which results in these customers not paying their proportionate share of the cost of maintaining and operating the electric transmission and distribution system, subject to certain exceptions, but still receiving electricity from the system when their self-generation is inadequate to meet their electricity needs. As more and higher electric-use customers switch to NEM and self-generate energy, the burden on remaining non-NEM customers, who effectively subsidize the unpaid NEM costs, increases, which in turn encourages more self-generation and further increases rate pressure on remaining non-NEM customers. 
 The current electric residential rate structure in California is primarily based on consumption volume, which places a higher rate burden on customers with higher electric use while subsidizing lower-use customers. In August 2020, the CPUC initiated a rulemaking to further develop a successor to the existing NEM tariff. In November 2022, a previous proposed decision was withdrawn and a new proposed decision was issued, recommending substantial reform of the NEM program through the establishment of a new Net Billing Tariff that would apply to new net metered customers. The new Net Billing Tariff revises the current NEM structure for new customers with a retail export compensation rate that is better aligned with the value provided to the grid by behind-the-meter energy generation systems and retail import rates that encourage electrification and adoption of solar systems paired with storage. The new Net Billing Tariff is designed to compensate customers for the value of their exports to the grid based on avoided cost. In December 2022, the CPUC approved the new Net Billing Tariff for customers who interconnect their qualifying on-site renewable generation after April 14, 2023. Additionally, in response to California legislation adopted in 2022, the CPUC has initiated a rulemaking to broadly restructure the way fixed costs are collected, moving from volumetric charges to an income-graduated fixed charge for default residential rates by July 1, 2024. The intent of such a fixed charge would be to further help reduce cost shifts through an equitable approach to the distribution of electric costs. Depending on the effectiveness of the new Net Billing Tariff and any new rules related to fixed charges, which are uncertain, the risks associated with the existing NEM tariff could continue or increase. 
 SDG E believes the establishment of a charge independent of consumption volume for residential customers is critical to help distribute rates among all customers that rely on the electric transmission and distribution system, including those participating in the NEM program. The absence of a charge independent of consumption volume coupled with the continuing increase of solar installation and other forms of self-generation, as well as the progression of DER and energy efficiency initiatives that could also reduce delivered volumes, could adversely impact electricity rates and the reliability of the electric transmission and distribution system. Any such impact could subject SDG E to increased customer dissatisfaction, increased likelihood of noncompliance with CPUC or other safety or operational standards and increased risks attendant to any such noncompliance, as we discuss above, as well as increased costs, including power procurement, operating and capital costs, and potential disallowance of recovery for these costs. 
 If the CPUC does not continue to adequately reform SDG E s residential rate structure for all customers to better achieve reasonable, cost-based electric rates that are competitive with alternative sources of power and adequate to maintain the reliability of the electric transmission and distribution system, such failure could have a material adverse effect on SDG E s and Sempra s results of operations, financial condition, cash flows and/or prospects.

RISKS RELATED TO SEMPRA TEXAS UTILITIES 
 Operational and Structural Risks 
 Certain ring-fencing measures, governance mechanisms and commitments limit our ability to influence the management, operations and policies of Oncor. 
 Various ring-fencing measures, governance mechanisms and commitments are in place that create legal and financial separation between Oncor Holdings, Oncor and their subsidiaries, on the one hand, and Sempra and its affiliates and subsidiaries, on the other hand. These measures are designed to enhance Oncor s separateness from its owners and mitigate the risk that Oncor would be negatively impacted by a bankruptcy or other adverse financial development affecting its owners. These measures subject us and Oncor to various restrictions, including: 
 seven members of Oncor s 13-person board of directors must be independent directors in all material respects under the rules of the NYSE in relation to Sempra and its affiliates and any other owners of Oncor, and also must have no material relationship with Sempra or its affiliates or any other owners of Oncor currently or within the previous 10 years; of the six remaining directors, two must be designated by Sempra, two must be designated by Oncor s minority owner, TTI, and two must be current or former Oncor officers 
 Oncor will not pay dividends or other distributions (except for contractual tax payments) if (i) a majority of Oncor s independent directors or any of the directors appointed by TTI determines that it is in the best interest of Oncor to retain such amounts to meet expected future requirements, (ii) the payment would cause Oncor s debt-to-equity ratio to exceed the debt-to-equity ratio approved by the PUCT, or (iii) unless otherwise allowed by the PUCT, Oncor s senior secured debt credit rating by any of the Rating Agencies falls below BBB (or Baa2 for Moody s) 
 there must be certain separateness measures maintained to reinforce the legal and financial separation of Oncor from Sempra, including a requirement that dealings between Oncor and Sempra or Sempra s affiliates (other than Oncor Holdings and its subsidiaries) must be on an arm s-length basis, limitations on affiliate transactions and a prohibition on pledging Oncor assets or membership interests for any entity other than Oncor 
 a majority of Oncor s independent directors and the directors designated by TTI that are present and voting (with at least one required to be present and voting) must approve any annual or multi-year budget if the aggregate amount of capital expenditures or O M in the budget differs by more than 10 from the corresponding amounts in the budget for the preceding fiscal year or multi-year period, as applicable 
 As a result of these measures, we do not control Oncor Holdings or Oncor, and we have limited ability to direct the management, policies and operations of Oncor Holdings and Oncor, including the deployment or disposition of their assets, declarations of dividends, strategic planning and other important matters. We have limited representation on the Oncor Holdings and Oncor boards of directors, which are each controlled by independent directors. Moreover, all directors of Oncor, including the directors we have appointed, have considerable autonomy and have a duty to act in the best interest of Oncor consistent with the approved ring-fence and Delaware law, which may in some cases be contrary to our interests. To the extent the directors approve or Oncor otherwise pursues actions that are not in our interest, our results of operations, financial condition, cash flows and/or prospects may be materially adversely affected. 
 Industry-Related Risks 
 Changes in the regulation or operation of the electric utility industry and/or the ERCOT market, as well as the outcome of regulatory proceedings, could materially adversely affect Oncor, which could materially adversely affect us. 
 Oncor operates in the electric utility industry and, as a result, it is subject to many of the same or similar risks as Sempra California as we describe above under Risks Related to Sempra California, particularly with respect to regulation by federal, state, and local legislative and regulatory authorities regarding rates and other financial matters as well as operational matters. Oncor operates in the ERCOT market. In ERCOT, rates are set by the PUCT based on a historical test year, and as a result, the rates Oncor is allowed to charge generally will not exactly match its costs at any given point in time and there is no assurance that it will be able to earn its full return on invested capital. Further, the PUCT may not approve all items requested by Oncor in any rate proceeding, such as Oncor s base rate review currently pending with the PUCT, including, among other things, recovery of all costs in rates, capital structure and authorized ROE. Failure to receive approval of its requests in any rate proceeding could adversely impact Oncor, which could adversely impact us, and those impacts could potentially be material. 
 The costs and burdens associated with complying with the various legislative and regulatory requirements to which Oncor is subject at the federal, state, and local levels and adjusting Oncor s business and operations in response to legislative and 
 2022 Form 10-K | 52 

Table of Contents 

regulatory developments, including changes in ERCOT, and any fines or penalties that could result from any noncompliance, may have a material adverse effect on Oncor. In addition, any economic weakness in the ERCOT market or slowing growth in Oncor s service territory could lead to reduced electricity demand, which could materially adversely affect Oncor. Moreover, legislative, regulatory, market or industry activities could adversely impact Oncor s collections and cash flows and jeopardize the predictability of utility earnings. For instance, the PUCT has instituted various projects reviewing the regulatory framework regarding DER and other non-traditional technologies. As DER usage continues to grow, regulatory decisions made with respect to DER, including with respect to ERCOT market rules and transmission and distribution utilities ability to invest in non-traditional electricity delivery solutions, could adversely impact Oncor s revenues and operations. If Oncor does not successfully respond to any legislative, regulatory, market or industry changes applicable to it, Oncor could suffer a deterioration in its results of operations, financial condition, cash flows and/or prospects, which could materially adversely affect our results of operations, financial condition, cash flows and/or prospects. 
 Financial Risks 
 Oncor could have liquidity needs that necessitate additional investments. 
 Oncor s business is capital-intensive, with significant capital spending expected in future periods, and it relies on external financing as a significant source of liquidity for its capital requirements. In the past, Oncor has financed much of its cash needs from operations and with proceeds from indebtedness, but these sources of capital may not be adequate or available on reasonable terms or at reasonable prices in the future. Because our commitments to the PUCT prohibit us from making loans to Oncor, we may elect to make capital contributions to Oncor if it fails to meet its capital requirements or is unable to access sufficient capital from other sources to finance its ongoing needs. Any such investments could be substantial, would reduce the cash available to us for other purposes, and could increase our indebtedness, any of which could materially adversely affect our results of operations, financial condition, cash flows and/or prospects. 
 Sempra could incur substantial tax liabilities if EFH s 2016 spin-off of Vistra is deemed to be taxable. 
 As part of its ongoing bankruptcy proceedings, in 2016, EFH distributed all the outstanding shares of common stock of its subsidiary Vistra Energy Corp. (formerly TCEH Corp. and referred to herein as Vistra) to certain creditors of TCEH LLC (the spin-off), and Vistra became an independent, publicly traded company. Vistra s spin-off from EFH was intended to qualify for partially tax-free treatment to EFH and its shareholders under Sections 368(a)(1)(G), 355 and 356 of the U.S. Internal Revenue Code of 1986 (as amended) (collectively referred to as the Intended Tax Treatment). In connection with and as a condition to the spin-off, EFH received a private letter ruling from the IRS regarding certain issues relating to the Intended Tax Treatment, as well as tax opinions from counsel to EFH and Vistra regarding certain aspects of the spin-off not covered by the private letter ruling. 
 In connection with the signing and closing of the merger of EFH (now Sempra Texas Holdings Corp. and a subsidiary of Sempra) with an indirect subsidiary of Sempra (the Merger), EFH sought and received a supplemental private letter ruling from the IRS and Sempra and EFH received tax opinions from their respective counsels that generally provide that the Merger will not affect the conclusions reached in, respectively, the IRS private letter ruling and tax opinions issued with respect to the spin-off described above. Similar to the IRS private letter ruling and opinions issued with respect to the spin-off, the supplemental private letter ruling is generally binding on the IRS and any opinions issued with respect to the Merger are based on factual representations and assumptions, as well as certain undertakings, made by Sempra and EFH. If such representations and assumptions are untrue or incomplete, any such undertakings are not complied with, or the facts upon which the IRS supplemental private letter ruling or tax opinions (which will not impact the IRS position on the transactions) are based are different from the actual facts relating to the Merger, the tax opinions and/or supplemental private letter ruling may not be valid and could be challenged by the IRS. Even though Sempra Texas Holdings Corp. would have administrative appeal rights if the IRS were to invalidate its private letter ruling and/or supplemental private letter ruling, including the right to challenge any adverse IRS position in court, any such appeal would be subject to uncertainties and could fail. If it is ultimately determined that the Merger caused the spin-off not to qualify for the Intended Tax Treatment, Sempra, through its ownership of Sempra Texas Holdings Corp., could incur substantial tax liabilities, which would materially reduce the value associated with our indirect investment in Oncor and could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition, cash flows and/or prospects.

RISKS RELATED TO SEMPRA INFRASTRUCTURE 
 Operational Risks 
 Project development activities may not be successful, projects under construction may not be completed on schedule or within budget, and completed projects may not operate at expected levels, any of which could materially adversely affect us. 
 All Energy Infrastructure Projects 
 We are involved in a number of energy infrastructure projects in various stages of development and construction, which subject us to numerous risks. Success in developing each project is contingent upon, among other things: 
 our financial condition and cash flows and other factors that impact our ability to invest sufficient funds in the project, including for preliminary activities that may need to be accomplished before we can determine whether the project is feasible or economically attractive 
 project assessment and design and our ability to foresee and incorporate new and developing trends and technologies in the energy industry, such as our pursuit of projects and design solutions to help enable our and our customers climate goals 
 our ability to reach a final investment decision or meet other milestones, which may be influenced by external factors outside our control, including the global economy and energy and financial markets, actions by regulators, achieving necessary internal and external approvals from project partners (if applicable) and others, and many of the other factors described in this risk factor 
 negotiation of satisfactory EPC agreements, including any renegotiation that may be required in the event of delays in final investment decisions or failures to meet other specified deadlines 
 progressing relationships from MOUs, HOAs or similar arrangements, which are non-binding and generally do not impose obligations on any of the parties, to execution of definitive agreements and participation in the project 
 identification of suitable partners, customers, suppliers and other necessary counterparties, negotiation of satisfactory equity, purchase, sale, supply, transportation and other appropriate commercial agreements, and satisfaction of any conditions to effectiveness of such agreements, including reaching a positive final investment decision within agreed timelines 
 timely receipt and maintenance of required governmental permits, licenses and other authorizations that do not impose material conditions and are otherwise granted under terms we find reasonable 
 our project partners , contractors and other counterparties willingness and financial or other ability to make their required investments or fulfill their contractual commitments on a timely basis 
 timely, satisfactory and on-budget completion of construction, which could be negatively affected by engineering problems, work stoppages, unavailability or increased costs of materials, equipment, labor and commodities due to inflation or supply chain or other issues, contractor nonperformance and a variety of other factors, many of which we discuss above under Risks Related to All Sempra Businesses Operational Risks and elsewhere in this risk factor 
 implementation of new or changes to existing laws or regulations that impact our infrastructure or the energy sector generally 
 obtaining adequate and reasonably priced financing for the project, particularly in light of rising inflation and interest rates 
 the absence of hidden defects or inherited environmental liabilities for the site of the project 
 fast and cost-effective resolution of any litigation or unsettled property rights affecting the project 
 geopolitical events and other uncertainties, such as the war in Ukraine 
 Any failures with respect to the above factors or other factors material to any particular project could involve additional costs, otherwise negatively affect our ability to successfully complete the project and force us to impair or write off amounts we have invested in the project. If we are unable to complete a development project, if we experience delays, or if construction, financing or other project costs exceed our estimated budgets and we are required to make additional capital contributions, we may never recover or receive an adequate or any return on our investment and other resources expended on the project and our results of operations, financial condition, cash flows and/or prospects could be materially adversely affected. 
 The operation of existing facilities and any future projects we are able to complete involves many risks, including the potential for unforeseen design flaws, engineering challenges, equipment failures or the breakdown for other reasons of facilities, equipment or processes; labor disputes; fuel interruption; environmental contamination; and the other operational risks that we discuss above under Risks Related to All Sempra Businesses Operational Risks. Any of these events could lead to our facilities being idle for an extended period of time or operating below expected levels, which may result in lost revenues or increased expenses, including higher maintenance costs and penalties. Any such occurrence could materially adversely affect our results of operations, financial condition, cash flows and/or prospects.

LNG Export Projects 
 In addition to the risks described above that are applicable to all our energy infrastructure projects, we are exposed to additional risks in connection with our LNG export projects, including the ECA LNG Phase 1 project under construction and our potential development of additional LNG export facilities. We discuss our LNG export projects in Part II Item 7. MD A Capital Resources and Liquidity Sempra Infrastructure. Each of these projects faces numerous risks. Our ability to reach a final investment decision for each project and, if a positive decision is made and a project is completed, the overall success of the project are dependent on global energy markets, including natural gas and oil supply, demand and pricing, the ability to reach advantageous agreements with our counterparties, including our partners, off-takers, and EPC contractors, risks inherent in construction, and the ability to obtain and maintain government approvals, among other things. In general, depressed natural gas and LNG prices in the markets we intend to serve due to shifts in supply or other factors could reduce the pricing and cost advantages of exporting domestically produced natural gas and LNG, which could lead to decreased demand. In addition, global oil prices and their associated current and forward projections could reduce demand for natural gas and LNG in some sectors. Although demand for natural gas is currently strong due to the geopolitical consequences of the war in Ukraine and increased recognition of the importance of energy security, a reduction in natural gas demand could also occur from higher penetration of alternative fuels in new power generation, or as a result of calls by some to limit or eliminate reliance on natural gas as an energy source globally. Oil prices could also make LNG projects in other parts of the world more feasible and competitive with LNG projects in North America, thus increasing supply and competition for any available LNG demand. Moreover, because LNG projects take a number of years to develop and construct, it is difficult to match current and expected demand with the projected supply from projects under development. Any of these occurrences could impact competition and prospects for developing LNG export projects and negatively affect the performance and prospects of any of our projects that are or become operational. 
 Our projects may face distinct disadvantages relative to some LNG projects being pursued by other project developers, including: 
 The proposed Cameron LNG Phase 2 project is subject to certain restrictions and conditions under the financing agreements for the Cameron LNG Phase 1 facility and requires unanimous consent of all JV members, including with respect to the equity investment obligations of each partner. We may not be able to satisfy these conditions and requirements, in which case our ability to develop the Cameron LNG Phase 2 project would be jeopardized. 
 The ECA LNG projects under construction and in development are subject to ongoing land and permit disputes that could obstruct efforts to find or maintain suitable partners, customers and financing arrangements and hinder or halt construction and, if the projects are completed, operations. We discuss these risks below and under Risks Related to Sempra Infrastructure Legal Risks. In addition, the Mexican regulatory process and overlay of U.S. regulation for natural gas exports to LNG facilities in Mexico are not well developed, which, among other factors, contributed to delays obtaining a necessary permit from the Mexican government for the ECA LNG Phase 1 project and could cause similar delays or other hurdles in the future and lead to difficulties finding or maintaining suitable partners, customers and financing arrangements. We have entered into contracts with affiliates and third parties, subject to certain conditions, to supply and transport gas across the U.S.-Mexico border to meet the requirements of the ECA LNG Phase 1 project if and when it becomes operational. If affiliates or third parties experience delays or fail to obtain and maintain necessary permits and arrangements to provide such supply or transportation services or if we fail to maintain adequate gas supply and transportation agreements to support the project fully, it could cause additional costs or delays to the ECA LNG Phase 1 project. Finally, although we have planned measures to not disrupt operations at the ECA Regas Facility with the construction or operation of the ECA LNG Phase 1 project, these measures may not be effective. Moreover, we expect construction of the proposed ECA LNG Phase 2 project to conflict with ECA Regas Facility operations, making the decisions on whether, when and how to pursue the ECA LNG Phase 2 project dependent in part on whether the investment in this project would, over the long term, be more beneficial than continuing to provide regasification services under existing contracts for 100 of the ECA Regas Facility s capacity through 2028. 
 The PA LNG projects in development are to be located at a greenfield site and therefore are subject to disadvantages relative to projects being developed at brownfield sites, including increased time and costs to develop and construct the project. 
 Development of these or any other LNG export projects will depend on the ability of our existing pipeline interconnections to be expanded or the ability to permit and construct new pipeline facilities, each of which may require us to enter into additional pipeline interconnection agreements with third-party pipelines. We and third parties may not be able to successfully develop and construct such new pipeline facilities, or we may not be able to secure such additional pipeline interconnections on commercially reasonable terms or at all. 
 The capital requirements for LNG export projects that we decide to pursue can be significant, even if we ultimately decide not to make a positive final investment decision. In addition, our proposed facilities may not be completed in accordance with estimated timelines or budgets or at all as a result of the above or other factors, and delays, cost overruns or our inability to complete one or more of these projects could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition, cash flows and/or prospects.

Table of Contents 

Financing Arrangements 
 We may become involved in various financing arrangements with respect to any of our energy infrastructure projects, such as guarantees, indemnities or loans. These arrangements could expose us to additional risks, including exposure to losses upon the occurrence of certain events related to the development, construction, operation or financing of the applicable projects that could have a material adverse effect on our future results of operations, financial condition, cash flows and/or prospects. 
 We are dependent on the equipment provided by third parties to operate the Cameron LNG Phase 1 facility and the failure of such equipment may adversely impact our business and performance. 
 Cameron LNG JV has experienced operating issues with equipment provided by third-party vendors, which have caused reductions in operating capacity and the declaration of force majeure events by Cameron LNG JV under its tolling agreements for its Cameron LNG Phase 1 facility. Certain of Cameron LNG JV s customers have raised objections regarding these force majeure declarations, and Cameron LNG JV s customers may raise objections in the future regarding these declarations or other force majeure declarations for similar operating issues. Cameron LNG JV s customers have obtained certain, and may in the future obtain additional, quantities of excess LNG production in connection with these and certain other force majeure events, and future force majeure events may also lead to the additional accrual of similar rights. The requirement to deliver excess LNG production to these customers in connection with these force majeure events has had, and in the future could have, an adverse impact on Sempra Infrastructure s and our business and cash flows because Cameron LNG JV loses fees related to the excess production. 
 These and other operational issues arising from equipment or facilities provided by third-party vendors may require us to undertake remediation, repair or equipment replacement activities that could result in reductions or cessations in production from our facilities. Although we are seeking to enforce warranty and other claims against our EPC contractors and other equipment vendors and suppliers, we may face challenges in successfully enforcing these claims against these third parties. Any such occurrence could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition, cash flows and/or prospects. 
 Fixed-price long-term contracts for services or commodities expose our businesses to inflationary pressures. 
 Sempra Infrastructure seeks to secure long-term contracts for services and commodities in an effort to optimize the use of its facilities, reduce volatility in earnings and support the construction of new infrastructure. If these contracts are at fixed prices, their profitability may be negatively affected by inflationary pressures, including increased labor, materials, equipment, commodities and other operational costs, rising interest rates that affect financing costs and changes in applicable exchange rates. We may try to mitigate these risks by, among other things, using variable pricing tied to market indices, anticipating and providing for cost escalation when bidding on projects, contracting for direct pass-through of operating costs and/or entering into hedges. However, these measures may not fully or substantially offset any increases in operating expenses or financing costs caused by inflationary pressures and their use could introduce additional risks, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition, cash flows and/or prospects. 
 Increased competition could materially adversely affect us. 
 The markets in which we operate are characterized by numerous strong and capable competitors, many of which have extensive and diversified development and/or operating experience domestically and internationally and financial resources similar to or greater than ours. In particular, the natural gas pipeline, storage and LNG market segments recently have been characterized by strong and increasing competition for winning new development projects and acquiring existing assets. In addition, our Mexican natural gas distribution business faces increased competition now that its former exclusivity period with respect to its distribution zones has expired and other distributors are legally permitted to build and operate natural gas distribution systems and compete to attract customers in the locations where it operates. These competitive factors could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition, cash flows and/or prospects. 
 We may not be able to enter into, maintain, extend or replace long-term supply, sales or capacity agreements. 
 The ECA Regas Facility has long-term capacity agreements with a limited number of counterparties, and also may enter into short-term and/or long-term supply agreements to purchase LNG to be received, stored and regasified for sale to other parties. In addition, Cameron LNG JV has long-term liquefaction and regasification tolling agreements with three counterparties that collectively subscribe for the full nameplate capacity of the Cameron LNG Phase 1 facility. The long-term nature of these agreements and the small number of customers at each of these facilities exposes us to risks, including increased risk if these counterparties fail to meet their contractual obligations on a timely basis, increased credit risks, and risks associated with the long-term nature of our relationships with these counterparties, including increased impacts of disputes or other similar issues which we have experienced in the past. Any such issues that arise in the future with respect to our long-term contracts, including any that may be caused by or related to the war in Ukraine, could lead to significant legal and other costs, result in cancelation of certain key contracts or otherwise adversely affect our relationships with long-term customers, suppliers or partners, and could negatively

Table of Contents 

impact the reliability of revenues from the applicable projects and the prospects for any implicated development projects. Any such event could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition, cash flows and/or prospects. 
 Sempra Infrastructure s ability to enter into new or replace existing long-term capacity agreements for its natural gas pipeline operations is dependent on, among other factors, demand for and supply of LNG and/or natural gas from its transportation customers, which may include our LNG export facilities. A decrease in demand for or supply of LNG or natural gas from such customers or the occurrence of other events that hinder Sempra Infrastructure from maintaining such agreements or establishing new ones could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition, cash flows and/or prospects. 
 The electric generation and wholesale power sales industries are highly competitive. As more plants are built, supplies of energy and related products may exceed demand, competitive pressures may increase and wholesale electricity prices may decline or become more volatile. Without long-term power sales agreements, our revenues may be subject to increased volatility, and we may be unable to sell the power that Sempra Infrastructure s facilities are capable of producing or sell it at favorable prices, any of which could materially adversely affect our results of operations, financial condition, cash flows and/or prospects. 
 We rely on transportation assets and services, much of which we do not own or control, to deliver natural gas and electricity. 
 We depend on electric transmission lines, natural gas pipelines and other transportation facilities and services owned and operated by third parties to, among other things: 
 deliver the natural gas, LNG, electricity and LPG we sell to customers or use for our LNG export facilities 
 supply natural gas to our gas storage and electric generation facilities 
 provide retail energy services to customers 
 If transportation is disrupted, if the construction of new or modified interconnecting infrastructure is not completed on schedule or if capacity is inadequate, we may not be able to move forward with our projects on schedule, we may be unable to sell and deliver our commodities, electricity and other services to our customers, we may be responsible for damages incurred by these customers, such as the cost of acquiring alternative supplies at then-current spot market rates, and we could lose customers that may be difficult to replace in competitive market conditions. Any such occurrence could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition, cash flows and/or prospects. 
 Financial Risks 
 Our international businesses and operations expose us to foreign currency and inflation risks. 
 Our operations in Mexico pose foreign currency and inflation risks. Exchange and inflation rates with respect to the Mexican peso and fluctuations in those rates may have an impact on the revenue, costs and cash flows from our international operations, which could materially adversely affect our results of operations, financial condition, cash flows and/or prospects. We may attempt to hedge cross-currency transactions and earnings exposure through various means, including financial instruments and short-term investments, but these hedges may not fully achieve our objectives of mitigating earnings volatility that would otherwise occur due to exchange rate fluctuations. Because we do not hedge our net investments in foreign countries, we are susceptible to volatility in OCI caused by exchange rate fluctuations for entities whose functional currencies are not the U.S. dollar. Moreover, Mexico has experienced periods of high inflation and exchange rate instability in the past, and severe devaluation of the Mexican peso could result in governmental intervention to institute restrictive exchange control policies, as has occurred before in Mexico and other Latin American countries. We discuss our foreign currency exposure at our Mexican subsidiaries in Part II Item 7. MD A and Part II Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk. 
 Our businesses are exposed to market risks, including fluctuations in commodity prices, that could materially adversely affect us. 
 We buy energy-related commodities from time to time for pipeline operations, LNG facilities or power plants to satisfy contractual obligations with customers. The regional and other markets in which we purchase these commodities are competitive and can be subject to significant pricing volatility as a result of many factors, including adverse weather conditions, supply and demand changes, availability of competitively priced alternative energy sources, commodity production levels and storage capacity, energy and environmental legislation and regulations, and economic and financial market conditions. Our results of operations, financial condition, cash flows and/or prospects could be materially adversely affected if the prevailing market prices for natural gas, LNG, electricity or other commodities we buy change in a direction or manner not anticipated and for which we have not provided adequately through purchase or sale commitments or other hedging transactions.

Legal and Regulatory Risks 
 Our international businesses and operations expose us to increased legal, regulatory, tax, economic, geopolitical and management oversight risks and challenges. 
 Overview 
 We own or have interests in a variety of energy infrastructure assets in Mexico, and we do business with companies based in foreign markets, including particularly our LNG export operations. Conducting these activities in foreign jurisdictions subjects us to complex management, security, political, legal, economic and financial risks that vary by country, many of which may differ from and potentially be greater than those associated with our wholly domestic businesses, and the occurrence of any of these risks could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition, cash flows and/or prospects. These risks include the following and the other risks discussed in this risk factor below: 
 compliance with tax, trade, environmental and other foreign laws and regulations, including legal limitations on ownership in some foreign countries and inadequate or inconsistent enforcement of regulations 
 actions by local regulatory bodies, including setting rates and tariffs that may be earned by or charged to our businesses 
 adverse changes in social, political, economic or market conditions or the stability of foreign governments 
 adverse rulings by foreign courts or tribunals; challenges to or difficulty obtaining, maintaining and complying with permits or approvals; difficulty enforcing contractual and property rights; differing legal standards for lawsuits or other proceedings; and unsettled property rights and titles in Mexico 
 expropriation or theft of assets 
 with respect to our non-utility international business activities, changes in the priorities and budgets of international customers, which may be driven by many of the factors listed above, among others 
 Mexican Government Influence on Economic and Energy Matters 
 The Mexican government exercises significant and increasing influence over the Mexican economy and energy sector and has adopted or proposed additional changes that, in each case, could fundamentally impact private investment in this sector. 
 Mexican governmental actions in the past several years in the electricity market include resolutions, orders, decrees, regulations and proposed and adopted amendments to Mexican law that could, among other things, threaten the prospects for private-party renewable energy generation in the country, limit the ability to dispatch renewable energy and receive or maintain operational permits, and increase costs of electricity for legacy renewables and cogeneration energy contract holders. The President of Mexico also proposed constitutional reform in September 2021 that would have eliminated the wholesale electricity market in Mexico and significantly limited the ability of private parties to participate in electricity generation. Although the proposed constitutional reform did not reach the two-third majority required for its approval and was therefore rejected by Mexico s Chamber of Deputies, other similar reforms to centralize and de-privatize the electricity market in Mexico could be proposed in the future. 
 
 With respect to midstream and downstream activities, amendments to Mexico s Hydrocarbons Law that give SENER and the CRE additional powers to suspend and revoke permits became effective in May 2021. The amendments provide that suspension of permits will be determined by SENER or the CRE when a danger to national security, energy security, or the national economy is foreseen, and also provide new grounds for the revocation of permits under certain other circumstances related to a permit holder s use of illegally imported products, failure to comply with provisions applicable to quantity, quality and measurement of products, or unauthorized modification of the technical condition of its infrastructure. Additionally, the amendments direct authorities to revoke permits that fail to comply with certain minimum storage and other requirements or violate provisions established by SENER or the amended Hydrocarbons Law, as applicable. 
 We discuss these Mexican governmental actions in Note 16 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. We cannot predict whether proposed governmental actions will ultimately be passed or otherwise become effective in their current forms, nor can we predict the nature or level of their impact on the various segments of the energy sector in which we participate. We also cannot predict whether pending actions to enjoin enforcement or suspend or overturn existing laws and other governmental actions will be successful. More generally, we cannot predict the impact that the political, social and judicial landscape in Mexico will have on that country s economy and energy sector and our business in Mexico. If any of the proposed governmental actions are passed or otherwise become effective, if efforts to enjoin enforcement or suspend or overturn adopted governmental actions fail, or if other similar moves by the Mexican government are taken to curb private-party participation in the energy sector, including through further amendments to Mexican laws, rules or the constitution or increased investigative and enforcement activities, it may impact our ability to operate our facilities at existing levels or at all, may result in increased costs for Sempra Infrastructure and its customers, may adversely affect our ability to develop new projects, may result in decreased revenues and cash flows, and may

negatively impact our ability to recover the carrying values of our investments in Mexico, any of which may have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition, cash flows and/or prospects. 
 U.S. and Mexican Laws and Foreign Policy, including Trade and Related Matters 
 Our international business activities are subject to U.S. and Mexican laws and regulations related to foreign operations or doing business internationally, including the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, the Mexican Federal Anticorruption Law in Public Contracting (Ley Federal Anticorrupci n en Contrataciones P blicas) and similar laws, and are sensitive to U.S. and Mexican foreign policy, trade policy and other geopolitical factors. The current and the last U.S. Administrations have taken different stances with respect to international trade agreements, tariffs, immigration policy and other matters of foreign policy that impact trade and foreign relations. Shifts in foreign policy could result in or increase adverse effects on our businesses and create uncertainty, making it difficult to predict the impact these policies could have on our businesses. Violations or alleged violations of the laws referred to above, as well as foreign policy positions that adversely affect imports and exports between the U.S., Mexican and other economies and foreign companies with whom we conduct business, could materially adversely affect our results of operations, financial condition, cash flows and/or prospects. 
 Our businesses are subject to various legal actions challenging our property rights and permits, and our properties in Mexico could be subject to expropriation by the Mexican government. 
 We are engaged in disputes regarding our title to the property in Mexico where our ECA Regas Facility is situated and our ECA LNG projects under construction and in development are expected to be situated, which we discuss in Note 16 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. In addition, we may have or seek to obtain long-term leases or rights-of-way from governmental agencies or other third parties to operate our energy infrastructure on land we do not own. In addition to the risks associated with such property ownership and use that we describe above under Risks Related to All Sempra Businesses Operational Risks, disputes regarding any of these properties could lead to difficulties finding or maintaining suitable partners, customers and project financing arrangements and could hinder or halt our ability to construct and, if completed, operate the affected facilities or proposed projects. Any of these outcomes could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition, cash flows and/or prospects. 
 Sempra Infrastructure s energy infrastructure assets may be considered by the Mexican government to be a public service or essential for the provision of a public service, in which case these assets and the related businesses could be subject to expropriation or nationalization, loss of concessions, renegotiation or annulment of existing contracts, and other similar risks. Any such occurrence could materially adversely affect our results of operations, financial condition, cash flows and/or prospects.

 Sempra Texas Utilities 
 The increase in earnings of 120 million (19 in 2022 compared to 2021 was primarily due to higher equity earnings from Oncor Holdings driven by: 
 higher revenues from rate updates to reflect increases in invested capital, higher customer consumption attributable primarily to weather, and customer growth; offset by 
 higher depreciation expense and interest expense attributable to invested capital; and 
 higher O M. 
 Sempra Infrastructure 
 The decrease in earnings of 372 million in 2022 compared to 2021 was primarily due to: 
 283 million losses in 2022 compared to 148 million earnings in 2021 from asset and supply optimization driven by higher unrealized losses on commodity derivatives due to changes in natural gas prices, offset by higher diversion revenues; 
 169 million unfavorable impact from foreign currency and inflation effects on our monetary positions in Mexico, net of foreign currency derivative effects, comprised of a 216 million unfavorable impact in 2022 compared to a 47 million unfavorable impact in 2021; and 
 13 million selling profit on a sales-type lease relating to the commencement of a rail facility lease at the Veracruz terminal in 2021; offset by

Table of Contents 

50 million higher net income tax benefit primarily from the remeasurement of certain deferred income taxes and outside basis differences in JV investments; 
 50 million lower net interest expense, including 37 million in charges associated with hedge termination costs and a write-off of unamortized debt issuance costs from the early redemptions of debt in October 2021 and 27 million net unrealized gains in 2022 on a contingent interest rate swap related to the proposed PA LNG Phase 1 project that we discuss in Note 11 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements; 
 42 million higher earnings from the transportation business in Mexico driven by higher rates and higher equity earnings at IMG excluding unfavorable impact from foreign currency and inflation; 
 14 million higher earnings due to the start of commercial operations of the Veracruz and Mexico City terminals in March and July of 2021, respectively, and remeasurement of operating leases; 
 12 million higher earnings from the renewables business due to Border Solar and the second phase of ESJ being placed in service in March 2021 and January 2022, respectively; and 
 10 million higher earnings from TdM driven by higher power prices offset by lower volumes. 
 Parent and Other 
 The increase in losses of 30 million (7 in 2022 compared to 2021 was primarily due to: 
 120 million deferred income tax expense associated with the change in our indefinite reinvestment assertion related to our foreign subsidiaries, which we discuss in Note 8 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements; 
 50 million net investment losses in 2022 compared to 29 million net investment gains in 2021 on dedicated assets in support of our employee nonqualified benefit plan and deferred compensation obligations;

 19 million lower preferred dividends due to the mandatory conversion of all series B preferred stock in July 2021. 
 
 SIGNIFICANT CHANGES IN REVENUES, COSTS AND EARNINGS 
 This section contains a discussion of the differences between periods in the specific line items of the Consolidated Statements of Operations for Sempra, SDG E and SoCalGas. 
 Utilities Revenues and Cost of Sales 
 Our utilities revenues include natural gas revenues at SoCalGas and SDG E and Sempra Infrastructure s Ecogas and electric revenues at SDG E. Intercompany revenues included in the separate revenues of each utility are eliminated in Sempra s Consolidated Statements of Operations. 
 SoCalGas and SDG E currently operate under a regulatory framework that permits: 
 The cost of natural gas purchased for core customers (primarily residential and small commercial and industrial customers) to be passed through to customers in rates substantially as incurred and without markup. The GCIM provides for SoCalGas to share in the savings and/or costs from buying natural gas for its core customers at prices below or above monthly market-based benchmarks. This mechanism permits full recovery of costs incurred when average purchase costs are within a price range around the benchmark price. Any higher costs incurred or savings realized outside this range are shared between core customers and SoCalGas. We provide further discussion in Note 3 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. 
 SDG E to recover the actual cost incurred to generate or procure electricity based on annual estimates of the cost of electricity supplied to customers. The differences in cost between estimates and actual are recovered or refunded in subsequent periods through rates. 
 SoCalGas and SDG E to recover certain program expenditures and other costs authorized by the CPUC, or refundable programs. 
 Because changes in SoCalGas and SDG E s cost of natural gas and/or electricity are recovered in rates, changes in these costs 
 2022 Form 10-K | 63 

Table of Contents 

are offset in the changes in revenues and therefore do not impact earnings, other than potential impacts related to the GCIM for SoCalGas that we describe above. In addition to the changes in cost or market prices, natural gas or electric revenues recorded during a period are impacted by the difference between customer billings and recorded or CPUC-authorized amounts. These differences are required to be balanced over time, resulting in over- and undercollected regulatory balancing accounts. We discuss balancing accounts and their effects further in Note 4 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. 

The table below summarizes utilities revenues and cost of sales.

 Natural Gas Revenues and Cost of Natural Gas 
 The table below summarizes the average cost of natural gas sold by Sempra California and included in cost of natural gas. The average cost of natural gas sold at each utility is impacted by market prices, as well as transportation, tariff and other charges. 
 SEMPRA CALIFORNIA AVERAGE COST OF NATURAL GAS (Dollars per thousand cubic feet) Years ended December 31, 2022 2021 2020 SoCalGas 7.48 4.53 2.59 SDG E 8.01 5.30 3.74 
 
 In 2022 compared to 2021, our natural gas revenues increased by 1.5 billion (24 to 7.9 billion primarily due to: 
 1.3 billion increase at SoCalGas, which included: 
 864 million increase in cost of natural gas sold, which we discuss below, 
 202 million higher recovery of costs associated with refundable programs, which revenues are offset in O M,

 2022 Form 10-K | 64 

Table of Contents 

69 million higher revenues from incremental and balanced capital projects, and 
 35 million higher revenues associated with impacts resulting from changes in tax laws tracked in the income tax expense memorandum account; and 
 205 million increase at SDG E, which included: 
 121 million increase in cost of natural gas sold, which we discuss below, 
 35 million higher recovery of costs associated with refundable programs, which revenues are offset in O M, 
 31 million higher revenues from balanced capital projects, and 
 10 million higher CPUC-authorized revenues. 
 Our cost of natural gas increased by 1.0 billion to 2.6 billion in 2022 compared to 2021 primarily due to: 
 864 million increase at SoCalGas primarily due to higher average natural gas prices; and 
 121 million increase at SDG E primarily due to higher average natural gas prices. 
 Electric Revenues and Cost of Electric Fuel and Purchased Power 
 In 2022 compared to 2021, our electric revenues, substantially all of which are at SDG E, increased by 125 million (3 to 4.8 billion primarily due to: 
 70 million higher CPUC-authorized revenues; 
 68 million higher revenues associated with SDG E s wildfire mitigation plan; 
 35 million higher recovery of costs associated with refundable programs, which revenues are offset in O 
 19 million higher revenues from transmission operations; and 
 14 million higher revenues associated with lower income tax benefits from flow-through items; offset by 
 75 million lower cost of electric fuel and purchased power, which we discuss below. 
 Our utility cost of electric fuel and purchased power includes utility-owned generation, power purchased from third parties, and net power purchases and sales to the California ISO. Our cost of electric fuel and purchased power decreased by 73 million (7 to 937 million in 2022 compared to 2021 primarily due to 75 million at SDG E from higher sales to the California ISO due to higher market prices offset by higher purchased power from the California ISO due to higher market prices, net of lower customer demand due to departing load now served by CCAs, and higher utility-owned generation costs.

In 2022 compared to 2021, revenues from our energy-related businesses decreased by 78 million (4 to 1.8 billion primarily due to: 
 344 million decrease in revenues from asset and supply optimization from contracts to sell natural gas and LNG to third parties, including: 
 498 million lower revenues primarily driven by 639 million from higher unrealized losses on commodity derivatives offset by 148 million from higher natural gas prices and volumes, offset by 
 83 million higher diversion fees due to higher natural gas prices, and

71 million higher LNG sales; offset by 
 143 million higher revenues from TdM mainly due to higher power prices offset by lower volumes from scheduled major maintenance completed in March 2022, which resulted in increased plant reliability; 
 53 million higher transportation revenues driven by higher rates; 
 46 million higher revenues from the renewables business due to Border Solar and the second phase of ESJ being placed in service in March 2021 and January 2022, respectively, the acquisition of ESJ in March 2021 and higher transmission rates; and 
 5 million higher revenues from the Veracruz and Mexico City terminals placed in service in March and July of 2021, respectively, offset by an 18 million selling profit on a sales-type lease relating to the commencement of a rail facility lease at the Veracruz terminal in the third quarter of 2021 and a remeasurement of an operating lease. 
 The cost of sales for our energy-related businesses increased by 331 million to 942 million in 2022 compared to 2021 primarily due to higher natural gas prices and higher LNG purchases related to asset and supply optimization and higher prices offset by lower volumes from scheduled major maintenance completed in March 2022 at TdM.

Gain (Loss) on Sale of Assets 
 In 2021, Parent and other recognized a 36 million gain on the sale of PXiSE, which we discuss in Note 5 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. 
 Other Income (Expense), Net 
 As part of our central risk management function, we may enter into foreign currency derivatives to hedge SI Partners exposure to movements in the Mexican peso from its controlling interest in IEnova. The gains/losses associated with these derivatives are included in other income (expense), net, as described below, and partially mitigate the transactional effects of foreign currency and inflation included in income tax expense for SI Partners consolidated entities and in equity earnings for SI Partners equity method investments. We discuss policies governing our risk management below in Part II Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk. 
 Other income (expense), net, decreased by 34 million to 24 million compared to the same period in 2021 primarily due to: 
 42 million investment losses in 2022 compared to 50 million investment gains in 2021 on dedicated assets in support of our executive retirement and deferred compensation plans; and 
 10 million in penalties at SoCalGas in 2022 related to the energy efficiency and advocacy OSCs; offset by 
 33 million lower net losses from impacts associated with interest rate and foreign exchange instruments and foreign currency transactions, including: 
 12 million gains in 2022 on cross-currency swaps compared to 28 million losses in 2021 on foreign currency derivatives and cross-currency swaps as a result of fluctuation of the Mexican peso, and 
 12 million lower foreign currency losses on a Mexican peso-denominated loan to IMG, which is offset in equity earnings, offset by 
 13 million losses in 2022 compared to 5 million net gains in 2021 on other foreign currency transactional effects; 
 20 million higher net interest income on regulatory balancing accounts at SDG E and SoCalGas; 
 10 million higher AFUDC equity, including 7 million at both SDG E and SoCalGas; 
 8 million lower non-service component of net periodic benefit cost; and 
 5 million reversal of penalties in 2021 related to an OII related to SoCalGas billing practices. 
 We provide further details of the components of other income (expense), net, in Note 1 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. 
 Interest Expense 
 Interest expense decreased by 144 million (12 to 1.1 billion in 2022 compared to 2021 primarily due to: 
 121 million decrease at Parent and other primarily due to 126 million in charges associated with make-whole premiums and a write-off of unamortized discount and debt issuance costs from the early redemptions of debt in December 2021, offset by higher debt balances from debt issuances; 
 101 million decrease at Sempra Infrastructure primarily due to: 
 54 million in charges associated with hedge termination costs and a write-off of unamortized debt issuance costs from the early redemptions of debt in October 2021, and 
 33 million net unrealized gains in 2022 on a contingent interest rate swap related to the proposed PA LNG Phase 1 project that we discuss in Note 11 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements; offset by 
 41 million increase at SoCalGas primarily from higher debt balances from debt issuances; and

Income Taxes 
 The table below shows the income tax expense (benefit) and ETRs for Sempra, SDG E and SoCalGas.

 (1) We discuss how we recognize equity earnings in Note 6 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. 
 
 Sempra 
 Sempra s income tax expense increased by 457 million in 2022 compared to 2021 primarily due to: 
 60 million income tax benefit in 2022 compared to 445 million income tax benefit in 2021 associated with charges relating to litigation and regulatory matters pertaining to the Leak; 
 169 million income tax expense in 2022 compared to 4 million income tax expense in 2021 from foreign currency and inflation effects on our monetary positions in Mexico and associated derivatives; 
 120 million deferred income tax expense associated with the change in our indefinite reinvestment assertion related to our foreign subsidiaries, which we discuss in Note 8 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements; and 
 lower income tax benefits from flow-through items; offset by 
 72 million net income tax expense related to the utilization of a deferred income tax asset upon completing the sale of a 20 NCI in SI Partners to KKR in October 2021; 
 49 million income tax benefit in 2022 compared to 9 million income tax expense in 2021 from changes to a valuation allowance against certain tax credit carryforwards; 
 28 million higher net income tax benefit in 2022 from the remeasurement of certain deferred income taxes; and 
 22 million higher income tax benefit in 2022 from the resolution of prior year income tax items. 
 We report as part of our pretax results the income or loss attributable to NCI. However, we do not record income taxes for a portion of this income or loss, as some of our entities with NCI are currently treated as partnerships for income tax purposes, and thus we are only liable for income taxes on the portion of the earnings that are allocated to us. Our pretax income, however, includes 100 of these entities. If our entities with NCI grow, and if we continue to invest in such entities, the impact on our ETR may become more significant. 
 We discuss the impact of foreign currency exchange rates and inflation on income taxes below in Impact of Foreign Currency and Inflation Rates on Results of Operations. See Notes 1 and 8 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further details about our accounting for income taxes and items subject to flow-through treatment. 
 SDG E 
 SDG E s income tax expense decreased by 19 million (9 in 2022 compared to 2021 primarily due to: 
 higher income tax benefits from flow-through items; and 
 14 million higher income tax benefit in 2022 from the resolution of prior year income tax items; offset by

Table of Contents 

higher income tax expense from higher pretax income. 
 SoCalGas 
 SoCalGas 138 million income tax expense in 2022 compared to a 310 million income tax benefit in 2021 was primarily due to: 
 60 million income tax benefit in 2022 compared to 445 million income tax benefit in 2021 associated with charges relating to litigation and regulatory matters pertaining to the Leak; and 
 lower income tax benefits from flow-through items. 
 
 Equity Earnings 
 Equity earnings increased by 155 million (12 to 1.5 billion in 2022 compared to 2021 primarily due to: 
 118 million higher equity earnings at Oncor Holdings due to higher revenues from rate updates to reflect increases in invested capital, higher customer consumption attributable primarily to weather, and customer growth, offset by higher depreciation expense and interest expense attributable to invested capital and higher O and 
 100 million higher equity earnings at Cameron LNG JV primarily due to excess LNG production and maintenance revenues; offset by 
 50 million equity earnings in 2021 related to our investment in RBS Sempra Commodities to settle pending VAT matters and related legal costs; and 
 15 million lower equity earnings at IMG due to higher income tax expense and foreign currency effects, including 12 million lower foreign currency gains on IMG s Mexican peso-denominated loans from its JV owners, which is fully offset in other income (expense), net, offset by lower interest expense. 
 Earnings Attributable to Noncontrolling Interests 
 Earnings attributable to NCI increased by 1 million (1 to 146 million in 2022 compared to 2021 primarily due to: 
 120 million increase as a result of a decrease in our ownership interest in SI Partners offset by an increase in our ownership interest in IEnova; offset by 
 121 million decrease due to a decrease in SI Partners subsidiaries net income. 
 Preferred Dividends 
 Preferred dividends decreased by 19 million to 44 million in 2022 compared to 2021 due to the conversion of all series B preferred stock in July 2021. 

IMPACT OF FOREIGN CURRENCY AND INFLATION RATES ON RESULTS OF OPERATIONS 
 Because our natural gas distribution utility in Mexico, Ecogas, uses its local currency as its functional currency, its revenues and expenses are translated into U.S. dollars at average exchange rates for the period for consolidation in Sempra s results of operations. Prior to the sales of our South American businesses in 2020, our operations in South America used their local currency as their functional currency. 
 Foreign Currency Translation 
 Any difference in average exchange rates used for the translation of income statement activity from year to year can cause a variance in Sempra s comparative results of operations. Changes in our earnings as a result of foreign currency translation rates between years were negligible in 2022 compared to 2021. 
 Transactional Impacts 
 Although the financial statements of most of our Mexican subsidiaries and JVs have the U.S. dollar as the functional currency, some transactions may be denominated in the local currency; such transactions are remeasured into U.S. dollars. This remeasurement creates transactional gains and losses that are included in other income (expense), net, for our consolidated entities and in equity earnings for our JVs. 
 We utilize cross-currency swaps that exchange our Mexican peso-denominated principal and interest payments into the U.S. dollar and swap Mexican fixed interest rates for U.S. fixed interest rates. The impacts of these cross-currency swaps are offset in OCI and are reclassified from AOCI into earnings through other income (expense), net and interest expense as settlements occur. 
 Certain of our Mexican pipelines (namely Los Ramones I at IEnova Pipelines and Los Ramones Norte at TAG) generate revenue based on tariffs that are set by government agencies in Mexico, with contracts denominated in Mexican pesos that are indexed to 
 2022 Form 10-K | 69 

Table of Contents 

the U.S. dollar, adjusted annually for inflation and fluctuation in the exchange rate. The resultant gains and losses from remeasuring the local currency amounts into U.S. dollars and the offsetting settlement of foreign currency forwards and swaps related to these contracts are included in revenues: energy-related businesses or equity earnings. 
 Income statement activities at our foreign operations and their JVs are also impacted by transactional gains and losses, a summary of which is shown in the table below: 
 TRANSACTIONAL (LOSSES) GAINS FROM FOREIGN CURRENCY AND INFLATION EFFECTS AND ASSOCIATED DERIVATIVES (Dollars in millions) Total reported amounts Transactional (losses) gains included in reported amounts Years ended December 31, 2022 2021 2020 2022 2021 2020 Other income (expense), net 24 58 (48) (13) (46) (92) Income tax expense (556) (99) (249) (169) (4) 59 Equity earnings 1,498 1,343 1,015 (36) 2 41 Income from continuing operations, net of income tax 2,285 1,463 2,255 (218) (48) 8 Income from discontinued operations, net of income tax 1,850 15 Earnings attributable to noncontrolling interests (146) (145) (172) 54 4 (24) Earnings attributable to common shares 2,094 1,254 3,764 (164) (44) (1) 
 Foreign Currency Exchange Rate and Inflation Impacts on Income Taxes and Related Hedging Activity 
 Our Mexican subsidiaries have U.S. dollar-denominated cash balances, receivables, payables and debt (monetary assets and liabilities) that are affected by Mexican currency exchange rate movements for Mexican income tax purposes. They also have deferred income tax assets and liabilities, which are significant, denominated in the Mexican peso that must be translated to U.S. dollars for financial reporting purposes. In addition, monetary assets and liabilities and certain nonmonetary assets and liabilities are adjusted for Mexican inflation for Mexican income tax purposes. As a result, fluctuations in both the currency exchange rate for the Mexican peso against the U.S. dollar and Mexican inflation may expose us to fluctuations in income tax expense, other income (expense), net, and equity earnings. We may use foreign currency derivatives as a means to help manage exposure to the currency exchange rate on our monetary assets and liabilities, and this derivative activity impacts other income (expense), net. However, we generally do not hedge our deferred income tax assets and liabilities, which makes us susceptible to volatility in income tax expense caused by exchange rate fluctuations and inflation. 
 We also utilized foreign currency derivatives in 2020 to hedge exposure to fluctuations in the Peruvian sol and Chilean peso related to the sales of our operations in Peru and Chile in discontinued operations. 

CAPITAL RESOURCES AND LIQUIDITY 
 
 OVERVIEW 
 Sempra 
 Liquidity 
 We expect to meet our cash requirements through cash flows from operations, unrestricted cash and cash equivalents, borrowings under or supported by our credit facilities, other incurrences of debt including issuing debt securities and obtaining term loans, distributions from our equity method investments, project financing and funding from minority interest owners. We believe that these cash flow sources, combined with available funds, will be adequate to fund our operations in both the short-term and long-term, including to: 
 finance capital expenditures 
 repay debt 
 fund dividends 
 2022 Form 10-K | 70 

Table of Contents 

fund contractual and other obligations and otherwise meet liquidity requirements 
 fund capital contribution requirements 
 fund new business or asset acquisitions or start-ups 
 Sempra, SDG E and SoCalGas currently have reasonable access to the money markets and capital markets and are not currently constrained in their ability to borrow money at market rates from commercial banks, under existing revolving credit facilities, through public offerings registered with the SEC, or through private placements of debt supported by our revolving credit facilities in the case of commercial paper. However, our ability to access the money markets and capital markets or obtain credit from commercial banks outside of our committed revolving credit facilities could become materially constrained if changing economic conditions or disruptions to or volatility in the money markets and capital markets worsen. These sources of funding have become less attractive due to the recent rise in both short-term and long-term interest rates. In addition, our financing activities and actions by credit rating agencies, as well as many other factors, could negatively affect the availability and cost of both short-term and long-term financing. Also, cash flows from operations may be impacted by the timing of commencement and completion, and potentially cost overruns, of large projects and other material events, such as the settlement of material litigation. If cash flows from operations were to be significantly reduced or we were unable to borrow under acceptable terms, we would likely first reduce or postpone discretionary capital expenditures (not related to safety/reliability) and investments in new businesses. We monitor our ability to finance the needs of our operating, investing and financing activities in a manner consistent with our goal to maintain our investment-grade credit ratings. 
 
 Available Funds 
 Our committed lines of credit provide liquidity and support commercial paper. Sempra, SDG E and SoCalGas each have five-year credit agreements expiring in 2027 and Sempra Infrastructure has a three-year credit agreement expiring in 2024, committed lines of credit expiring in 2023 and 2024, and an uncommitted revolving credit facility expiring in 2023.

 (2) Available unused credit is the total available on committed and uncommitted lines of credit that we discuss in Note 7 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Because our commercial paper programs are supported by these lines, we reflect the amount of commercial paper outstanding as a reduction to the available unused credit. 
 Short-Term Borrowings 
 We use short-term debt primarily to meet liquidity requirements, fund shareholder dividends, and temporarily finance capital expenditures, acquisitions or start-ups. SDG E and SoCalGas use short-term debt primarily to meet working capital needs or to help fund event-specific costs, such as payments made by SoCalGas relating to litigation and regulatory matters pertaining to the Leak. Commercial paper, lines of credit and term loans were our primary sources of short-term debt funding in 2022. 
 We discuss our short-term debt activities in Note 7 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements and below in Sources and Uses of Cash. 
 The following table shows selected statistics for our commercial paper borrowings.

Long-Term Debt Activities 
 Significant issuances of and payments on long-term debt in 2022 included the following:

 At December 31, 2022, Sempra expects to make interest payments on long-term debt totaling 17.3 billion, of which 1.0 billion is expected to be paid in 2023 and 16.3 billion is expected to be paid in subsequent years through 2079. At December 31, 2022, SDG E expects to make interest payments on long-term debt totaling 4.9 billion, of which 298 million is expected to be paid in 2023 and 4.6 billion is expected to be paid in subsequent years through 2052. At December 31, 2022, SoCalGas expects to make interest payments on long-term debt totaling 3.9 billion, of which 255 million is expected to be paid in 2023 and 3.6 billion is expected to be paid in subsequent years through 2052. We calculate expected interest payments using the stated interest rate for fixed-rate obligations, including floating-to-fixed interest rate swaps and cross-currency swaps. We calculated expected interest payments for variable-rate obligations based on forecasted rates in effect at December 31, 2022. 
 We discuss our long-term debt activities, including the use of proceeds on long-term debt issuances, and maturities in Note 7 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. 
 
 Credit Ratings 
 The credit ratings of Sempra, SDG E and SoCalGas remained at investment grade levels in 2022. 
 CREDIT RATINGS AT DECEMBER 31, 2022 
 Sempra SDG E SoCalGas Moody s Baa2 with a stable outlook A3 with a stable outlook A2 with a stable outlook S P BBB+ with a negative outlook BBB+ with a stable outlook A with a negative outlook Fitch BBB+ with a stable outlook BBB+ with a stable outlook A with a stable outlook 
 
 A downgrade of Sempra s or any of its subsidiaries credit ratings or rating outlooks may, depending on the severity, result in the imposition of financial or other burdensome covenants or a requirement for collateral to be posted in the case of certain financing arrangements, and may materially and adversely affect the market prices of their equity and debt securities, the rates at which borrowings are made and commercial paper is issued, and the various fees on their outstanding credit facilities. This could make it more costly for Sempra, SDG E, SoCalGas and Sempra s other subsidiaries to issue debt securities, to borrow under credit facilities and to raise certain other types of financing. We provide additional information about our credit ratings at Sempra, SDG E and SoCalGas in Part I Item 1A. Risk Factors. 
 Sempra has agreed that, if the credit rating of Oncor s senior secured debt by any of the Rating Agencies falls below BBB (or the equivalent), Oncor will suspend dividends and other distributions (except for contractual tax payments), unless otherwise allowed by the PUCT. Oncor s senior secured debt was rated A2, A+ and A at Moody s, S P and Fitch, respectively, at December 31, 2022.

Sempra, SDG E and SoCalGas have committed lines of credit to provide liquidity and to support commercial paper. Borrowings under these facilities bear interest at benchmark rates plus a margin that varies with market index rates and each borrower s credit rating. Each facility also requires a commitment fee on available unused credit that may be impacted by each borrower s credit rating. For example, assuming a one-notch downgrade: 
 If Sempra were to experience a ratings downgrade from its current level, the rate at which borrowings bear interest would increase by 25 bps. The commitment fee on available unused credit would also increase 5 bps. 
 If SDG E were to experience a ratings downgrade from its current level, the rate at which borrowings bear interest would increase by 12.5 bps. The commitment fee on available unused credit would also increase 5 bps. 
 If SoCalGas were to experience a ratings downgrade from its current level, the rate at which borrowings bear interest would increase by 12.5 bps. The commitment fee on available unused credit would also increase 2.5 bps. 
 Sempra s, SDG E s and SoCalGas credit ratings also may affect their respective credit limits related to derivative instruments, as we discuss in Note 11 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. 
 
 Loans to/from Affiliates 
 At December 31, 2022, Sempra had 301 million in loans due to unconsolidated affiliates. In July 2022, a 626 million loan due to Sempra from an unconsolidated affiliate was paid in full, prior to its March 2023 maturity date. 
 Postretirement Benefits 
 Sempra, SDG E and SoCalGas have significant investments in several trusts to provide for future payments of pensions and PBOP. The trusts ability to make ongoing required benefit payments has not been materially adversely affected by changes in asset values, which are dependent on market fluctuations, contributions and withdrawals. However, changes in asset values or other factors in future periods, such as changes to discount rates, assumed rates of return, mortality tables and regulations, may impact funding requirements for pension and PBOP plans. Additionally, contributions to our plans are based on our funding policy, which generally limits payments from exceeding plan assets of 110 of the projected benefit obligation, which are subject to maximum income tax deduction limitations. Sempra, SDG E and SoCalGas expect to contribute 238 million, 54 million and 154 million, respectively, to pension and PBOP plans in 2023 and 1.8 billion, 459 million and 1.1 billion, respectively, in the nine years thereafter. At SDG E and SoCalGas, funding requirements are generally recoverable in rates. We discuss our employee benefit plans and our expected contributions to those plans in Note 9 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. 
 Inflation Reduction Act 
 The IRA was signed into law in August 2022. The IRA includes tax credits and other incentives for energy and climate initiatives and introduces a 15 corporate alternative minimum tax on adjusted financial statement income for tax years beginning after December 31, 2022. We continue to assess the impacts of the IRA as the U.S. Department of the Treasury and the IRS issue guidance on tax implementation, and the EPA and DOE issue guidance on energy and climate initiatives. We do not expect the IRA to have a material adverse impact on Sempra s, SDG E s or SoCalGas results of operations, financial condition and/or cash flows. 
 
 Sempra California 
 SDG E s and SoCalGas operations have historically provided relatively stable earnings and liquidity. Their future performance and liquidity will depend primarily on the ratemaking and regulatory process, environmental regulations, economic conditions, actions by the California legislature, litigation and the changing energy marketplace, as well as other matters described in this report. SDG E and SoCalGas expect that the available unused funds from their credit facilities described above, which also supports their commercial paper programs, cash flows from operations, and other incurrences of debt including issuing debt securities and obtaining term loans will continue to be adequate to fund their respective current operations and planned capital expenditures. Additionally, as we discuss below, Sempra elected to make equity contributions to SoCalGas of 800 million in September 2021, 150 million in June 2022 and 500 million in August 2022. These voluntary equity contributions were intended to assist SoCalGas in maintaining its authorized capital structure. SDG E and SoCalGas manage their capital structures and pay dividends when appropriate and as approved by their respective boards of directors. 
 As we discuss in Note 4 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, changes in balancing accounts for significant costs at SDG E and SoCalGas, particularly a change between over- and undercollected status, may have a significant impact on cash flows. These changes generally represent the difference between when costs are incurred and when they are ultimately recovered or refunded in rates through billings to customers.

COVID-19 Pandemic Protections 
 SDG E and SoCalGas are continuing to monitor the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic on cash flows and results of operations. Some customers have experienced and continue to experience a diminished ability to pay their electric or gas bills, leading to slower payments and higher levels of nonpayment than has been the case historically. These impacts could become significant and could require modifications to our financing plans. 
 In connection with the COVID-19 pandemic and at the direction of the CPUC, SDG E and SoCalGas implemented certain measures to assist customers, including automatically enrolling residential and small business customers with past-due balances in long-term repayment plans. 
 In 2021, SDG E and SoCalGas applied, on behalf of their customers, for financial assistance from the California Department of Community Services and Development under the 2021 California Arrearage Payment Program, which provided funds of 63 million and 79 million for SDG E and SoCalGas, respectively. In the first quarter of 2022, SDG E and SoCalGas received and applied the amounts directly to eligible customer accounts to reduce past due balances. In June 2022, AB 205 was approved establishing, among other things, the 2022 California Arrearage Payment Program. In December 2022, SDG E and SoCalGas received funding of 51 million and 59 million, respectively, related to this program and, in January 2023, applied the amounts directly to eligible customer accounts to reduce past due balances. 
 
 SDG E 
 Wildfire Fund 
 The carrying value of SDG E s Wildfire Fund asset totaled 332 million at December 31, 2022. We describe the Wildfire Legislation and SDG E s commitment to make annual shareholder contributions to the Wildfire Fund through 2028 in Note 1 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. 
 SDG E is exposed to the risk that the participating California electric IOUs may incur third-party wildfire costs for which they will seek recovery from the Wildfire Fund with respect to wildfires that have occurred since enactment of the Wildfire Legislation in July 2019. In such a situation, SDG E may recognize a reduction of its Wildfire Fund asset and record an impairment charge against earnings when available coverage is reduced due to recoverable claims from any of the participating IOUs. PG E has indicated that it will seek reimbursement from the Wildfire Fund for losses associated with the Dixie Fire, which burned from July 2021 through October 2021 and was reported to be the largest single wildfire (measured by acres burned) in California history. If any California electric IOU s equipment is determined to be a cause of a fire, it could have a material adverse effect on SDG E s and Sempra s financial condition and results of operations up to the carrying value of our Wildfire Fund asset, with additional potential material exposure if SDG E s equipment is determined to be a cause of a fire. In addition, the Wildfire Fund could be completely exhausted due to fires in the other California electric IOUs service territories, by fires in SDG E s service territory or by a combination thereof. In the event that the Wildfire Fund is materially diminished, exhausted or terminated, SDG E will lose the protection afforded by the Wildfire Fund, and as a consequence, a fire in SDG E s service territory could have a material adverse effect on SDG E s and Sempra s results of operations, financial condition, cash flows and/or prospects. 
 Wildfire Mitigation Cost Recovery Mechanism 
 In July 2021, SDG E filed a request with the CPUC to establish an interim cost recovery mechanism that would recover 50 of its costs associated with implementation of its wildfire mitigation plan. The proposed recovery would be incremental to wildfire costs currently authorized in its GRC and subject to reasonableness review. In May 2022, the CPUC issued a final decision denying SDG E s request and directing SDG E to file for the review and recovery of its wildfire mitigation plan costs through its next GRC or a separate application. SDG E expects to submit separate requests in its GRC for review and recovery of its wildfire mitigation plan costs in mid-2023 for costs incurred from 2019 through 2022 and in mid-2024 for costs incurred in 2023. 
 SONGS Decommissioning 
 SDG E has significant investments in the SONGS NDT to provide for future payments of nuclear decommissioning. The NDT s ability to make ongoing required payments have not been materially or adversely affected by changes in asset values, which are dependent on market fluctuations, contributions and withdrawals. However, asset values could be materially and adversely affected by future activity in the equity and fixed income markets, and changes in the estimated decommissioning costs, or in the assumptions and judgments made by management underlying these estimates, could cause revisions to the estimated total cost associated with retiring the assets. Funding requirements are generally recoverable in rates. We discuss SDG E s NDT and its expected SONGS decommissioning payments in Note 15 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.

Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements 
 SDG E has entered into PPAs and tolling agreements that are variable interests in unconsolidated entities. We discuss variable interests in Note 1 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. 
 
 SoCalGas 
 SoCalGas future performance and liquidity may be impacted by the resolution of legal, regulatory and other matters pertaining to the Leak, which we discuss below, in Note 16 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements and in Part I Item 1A. Risk Factors. 
 Aliso Canyon Natural Gas Storage Facility Gas Leak 
 From October 23, 2015 through February 11, 2016, SoCalGas experienced the Leak. 
 Cost Estimate, Insurance and Accounting and Other Impacts. At December 31, 2022, SoCalGas estimates certain costs related to the Leak are 3,486 million (the cost estimate), including 1,279 million of costs recovered from insurance. Other than insurance for directors and officers liability, we have exhausted all of our insurance for this matter. We continue to pursue other sources of insurance coverage for costs related to this matter, but we may not be successful in obtaining additional insurance recovery for any of these costs. At December 31, 2022, 129 million of the cost estimate is accrued in Reserve for Aliso Canyon Costs and 4 million of the cost estimate is accrued in Deferred Credits and Other on SoCalGas and Sempra s Consolidated Balance Sheets. 
 Sempra elected to make equity contributions to SoCalGas of 800 million in September 2021, 150 million in June 2022 and 500 million in August 2022. These voluntary equity contributions were intended to assist SoCalGas in maintaining its authorized capital structure. SoCalGas paid 1.79 billion in 2022 related to the settlement of the Individual Plaintiff Litigation. SoCalGas funded the settlement payment using a combination of equity contributions from Sempra, short-term debt and cash on hand. 
 Except for the amounts paid or estimated to settle certain legal and regulatory matters, the cost estimate does not include any amounts necessary to resolve the matters that we describe in Litigation Unresolved and Regulatory Proceedings Unresolved in Note 16 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, threatened litigation, other potential litigation or other costs, in each case to the extent it is not possible to predict at this time the outcome of these actions or reasonably estimate the possible costs or a range of possible costs. Further, we are not able to reasonably estimate the possible loss or a range of possible losses in excess of the amounts accrued. The costs or losses not included in the cost estimate could be significant. 
 An adverse outcome with respect to (i) the litigation described in Note 16 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements under Litigation Unresolved, (ii) threatened or other potential litigation related to the Leak, (iii) the Leak OII that we discuss in Note 16 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, if approval of the negotiated settlement is not obtained, or (iv) the unresolved proceeding pursuant to the SB 380 OII that we discuss below, could have a material adverse effect on SoCalGas and Sempra s results of operations, financial condition, cash flows and/or prospects. 
 Natural Gas Storage Operations and Reliability. Natural gas withdrawn from storage is important for service reliability during peak demand periods, including peak electric generation needs in the summer and consumer heating needs in the winter. The Aliso Canyon natural gas storage facility is the largest SoCalGas storage facility and an important component of SoCalGas delivery system. As a result of the Leak, the CPUC has issued a series of directives to SoCalGas specifying the range of working gas to be maintained in the Aliso Canyon natural gas storage facility as well as protocols for the withdrawal of gas, to support safe and reliable natural gas service. In February 2017, the CPUC opened a proceeding pursuant to the SB 380 OII to determine the feasibility of minimizing or eliminating the use of the Aliso Canyon natural gas storage facility while still maintaining energy and electric reliability for the region, including considering alternative means for meeting or avoiding the demand for the facility s services if it were eliminated. 
 At December 31, 2022, the Aliso Canyon natural gas storage facility had a net book value of 958 million. If the Aliso Canyon natural gas storage facility were to be permanently closed or if future cash flows from its operation were otherwise insufficient to recover its carrying value, we may record an impairment of the facility, which could be material, or we could incur materially higher than expected operating costs and/or be required to make material additional capital expenditures (any or all of which may not be recoverable in rates), and natural gas reliability and electric generation could be jeopardized.

Sempra Texas Utilities 
 Oncor relies on external financing as a significant source of liquidity for its capital requirements. In the event that Oncor fails to meet its capital requirements, access sufficient capital, or raise capital on favorable terms to finance its ongoing needs, we may elect to make additional capital contributions to Oncor (as our commitments to the PUCT prohibit us from making loans to Oncor), which could be substantial and reduce the cash available to us for other purposes, increase our indebtedness and ultimately materially adversely affect our results of operations, financial condition, cash flows and/or prospects. Oncor s ability to make distributions may be limited by factors such as its credit ratings, regulatory capital requirements, increases in its capital plan, debt-to-equity ratio approved by the PUCT and other restrictions and considerations. In addition, Oncor will not make distributions if a majority of Oncor s independent directors or any minority member director determines it is in the best interests of Oncor to retain such amounts to meet expected future requirements. 
 Off-Balance Sheet Arrangement 
 Our investment in Oncor Holdings is a variable interest in an unconsolidated entity. We discuss variable interests in Note 1 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. 
 
 Sempra Infrastructure 
 Sempra Infrastructure expects to fund capital expenditures, investments and operations in part with available funds, including credit facilities, and cash flows from operations of the Sempra Infrastructure businesses. We expect Sempra Infrastructure will require additional funding for the development and expansion of its portfolio of projects, which may be financed through a combination of funding from the parent and minority interest owners, bank financing, issuances of debt, project financing and partnering in JVs. We describe Sempra Infrastructure s commitments related to construction and development projects in Note 16 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. 
 In June 2022, we completed the sale of a 10 NCI in SI Partners to ADIA for cash proceeds of 1.7 billion. We used a portion of the proceeds from the sale to ADIA to repay commercial paper borrowings used to repurchase 750 million in shares of our common stock 300 million of which was completed in the fourth quarter of 2021, 200 million of which was completed in the first quarter of 2022 and 250 million of which was completed in the second quarter of 2022), and we used the remaining proceeds to help fund capital expenditures at Sempra California and Sempra Texas Utilities and to further strengthen our balance sheet. 
 Following the closing of the ADIA transaction, Sempra, KKR and ADIA directly or indirectly own a 70 , 20 , and 10 interest, respectively, in SI Partners. The sale of NCI in SI Partners to ADIA has reduced our ownership interest in SI Partners and requires us to involve a new minority partner in making certain business decisions. Moreover, the decrease in our ownership of SI Partners also decreases our share of the cash flows, profits and other benefits these businesses currently or may in the future produce. 
 In 2022, SI Partners distributed 237 million to its minority shareholders. 
 LNG and Net-Zero Solutions 
 Cameron LNG Phase 2 Project. Cameron LNG JV is developing a proposed expansion project that would add one liquefaction train with an expected maximum production capacity of approximately 6.75 Mtpa and would increase the production capacity of the existing three trains at the Cameron LNG Phase 1 facility by up to approximately 1 Mtpa through debottlenecking activities. The Cameron LNG JV site can accommodate additional trains beyond the proposed Cameron LNG Phase 2 project. 
 Cameron LNG JV previously received major permits and FTA and non-FTA approvals associated with the potential expansion that included up to two additional liquefaction trains and up to two additional full containment LNG storage tanks. In January 2022, Cameron LNG JV filed an amendment, subject to approval by the FERC, to modify the permits to allow the use of electric drives, instead of gas turbine drives, which would reduce overall emissions. The amendment, if approved, would also change the design from a two-train gas turbine expansion to a one-train electric drive expansion along with other design enhancements that, together, are expected to result in a more cost-effective and efficient facility, while also reducing overall GHG emissions. 
 Sempra Infrastructure and the other Cameron LNG JV members, namely affiliates of TotalEnergies SE, Mitsui Co., Ltd. and Japan LNG Investment, LLC, a company jointly owned by Mitsubishi Corporation and Nippon Yusen Kabushiki Kaisha, have entered into an HOA for the potential development of the Cameron LNG Phase 2 project. The HOA provides a commercial framework for the proposed project, including the contemplated allocation to Sempra Infrastructure of 50.2 of the fourth train production capacity and 25 of the debottlenecking capacity from the project under tolling agreements. The HOA contemplates the remaining capacity to be allocated equally to the existing Cameron LNG Phase 1 facility customers. Sempra Infrastructure plans to sell the LNG corresponding to its allocated capacity from the proposed Cameron LNG Phase 2 project under long-term

SPAs prior to making a final investment decision. The HOA is a non-binding arrangement. The ultimate participation in and offtake by Sempra Infrastructure, TotalEnergies SE, Mitsui Co., Ltd. and Japan LNG Investment, LLC remain subject to negotiation and finalization of definitive agreements, among other factors, and the HOA does not commit any party to enter into definitive agreements with respect to the proposed Cameron LNG Phase 2 project. 
 Sempra Infrastructure, the other Cameron LNG JV members, and Cameron LNG JV have entered into a Phase 2 Project Development Agreement under which Sempra Infrastructure, subject to certain conditions and ongoing approvals by the Cameron LNG JV board, will manage and lead the Cameron LNG Phase 2 project development work until Cameron LNG JV makes a final investment decision. 
 Cameron LNG JV, upon the unanimous approval of the Cameron LNG JV board, awarded two FEED contracts, one to Bechtel and the other to a joint venture between JGC America Inc. and Zachry Industrial Inc. At the conclusion of the resulting competitive FEED process, we expect to select one contractor to be the EPC contractor for the proposed Cameron LNG Phase 2 project. 
 In connection with the execution of the Phase 2 Project Development Agreement and the award of the FEED contracts, the Cameron LNG JV board unanimously approved an expansion development budget to fund, subject to the terms of the Phase 2 Project Development Agreement, development work necessary to prepare for a potential final investment decision. 
 Cameron LNG JV has entered into an MOU with Entergy Louisiana, LLC, a subsidiary of Entergy Corporation, to negotiate the terms and conditions for a new electric service agreement intended to reduce Cameron LNG JV s scope 2 emissions from the electricity it purchases from Entergy Louisiana, LLC. The MOU sets forth a framework for Entergy Louisiana, LLC and Cameron LNG JV to finalize and sign a minimum 20-year agreement for the procurement of new renewable generation resources in Louisiana, subject to the ultimate approval of the Louisiana Public Service Commission and Cameron LNG JV. The MOU is a non-binding arrangement. The ultimate arrangement between Cameron LNG JV and Entergy Louisiana, LLC remains subject to negotiation and finalization of definitive agreements, among other factors, and the MOU does not commit any party to enter into definitive agreements with respect to the proposed electric services agreement. 
 Sempra Infrastructure has entered into a non-binding HOA for the negotiation and potential finalization of a definitive 20-year SPA with ORLEN for 2 Mtpa of LNG offtake from the proposed Cameron LNG Phase 2 project. Sempra Infrastructure also entered into a non-binding HOA for the negotiation and potential finalization of definitive SPAs with Williams for two 20-year terms for approximately 3 Mtpa of LNG offtake in the aggregate from the PA LNG Phase 2 project and Cameron LNG Phase 2 project that are under development, and a separate natural gas sales agreement for approximately 0.5 Bcf per day to be delivered as feed gas supply for the proposed PA LNG projects and Cameron LNG Phase 2 project. In addition, the parties anticipate forming a strategic JV to own, expand and operate the existing Cameron Interstate Pipeline that we expect will deliver natural gas to the proposed Cameron LNG Phase 2 project and the proposed Port Arthur Pipeline Louisiana Connector that we expect will deliver natural gas to the proposed PA LNG projects. The ultimate participation in and offtake from the proposed projects remain subject to negotiation and finalization of definitive agreements, among other factors, and the HOAs do not commit any party to enter into definitive agreements with respect to any of the applicable proposed projects. 
 Expansion of the Cameron LNG Phase 1 facility beyond the first three trains is subject to certain restrictions and conditions under the JV project financing agreements, including among others, scope restrictions on expansion of the project unless appropriate prior consent is obtained from the existing project lenders. Under the Cameron LNG JV equity agreements, the expansion of the project requires the unanimous consent of all the partners, including with respect to the equity investment obligation of each partner. Working under the framework established in the Phase 2 Project Development Agreement, Sempra Infrastructure is targeting completing the FEED work in the summer of 2023 and expects to be in a position to make a final investment decision shortly thereafter. The timing of when or if Cameron LNG JV will receive approval from the FERC to amend its permits and from the existing project lenders to conduct the expansion under its financing agreements is uncertain, and there is no assurance that Sempra Infrastructure will complete the necessary development work or that the Cameron LNG JV members will unanimously agree in a timely manner or at all on making a final investment decision, which, if not accomplished, would materially and adversely impact the development of the Cameron LNG Phase 2 project. 
 The development of the proposed Cameron LNG Phase 2 project is subject to numerous other risks and uncertainties, including securing binding customer commitments; reaching unanimous agreement with our partners to proceed; obtaining and maintaining a number of permits and regulatory approvals, including approval from the FERC for amendments to existing permits; securing certain consents under the existing financing agreements and securing sufficient new financing; negotiating and completing suitable commercial agreements for the project, including a definitive EPC contract and definitive tolling and governance agreements; reaching a positive final investment decision; and other factors associated with this potential investment. For a discussion of these risks, see Part I Item 1A. Risk Factors.

ECA LNG Phase 1 Project. SI Partners owns an 83.4 interest in ECA LNG Phase 1, and an affiliate of TotalEnergies SE owns the remaining 16.6 interest. ECA LNG Phase 1 is constructing a one-train natural gas liquefaction facility at the site of Sempra Infrastructure s existing ECA Regas Facility with a nameplate capacity of 3.25 Mtpa and an initial offtake capacity of 2.5 Mtpa. We do not expect the construction or operation of the ECA LNG Phase 1 project to disrupt operations at the ECA Regas Facility, and have planned measures to limit disruption of operations should any arise. We expect the ECA LNG Phase 1 project to commence commercial operations in the summer of 2025. 
 We received authorizations from the DOE to export U.S.-produced natural gas to Mexico and to re-export LNG to non-FTA countries from the ECA LNG Phase 1 project. ECA LNG Phase 1 has definitive 20-year SPAs with an affiliate of TotalEnergies SE for approximately 1.7 Mtpa of LNG and with Mitsui Co., Ltd. for approximately 0.8 Mtpa of LNG. 
 In February 2020, we entered into an EPC contract with Technip Energies for the ECA LNG Phase 1 project. Since reaching a positive final investment decision with respect to the project in November 2020, Technip Energies has been working to construct the ECA LNG Phase 1 project. We estimate the total price of the EPC contract to be approximately 1.5 billion, with capital expenditures approximating 2.0 billion including capitalized interest and project contingency. The actual cost of the EPC contract and the actual amount of these capital expenditures may differ substantially from our estimates. 
 ECA LNG Phase 1 has a five-year loan agreement with a syndicate of seven external lenders that matures in December 2025 for an aggregate principal amount of up to 1.3 billion, of which 575 million was outstanding at December 31, 2022. Proceeds from the loan are being used to finance the cost of construction of the ECA LNG Phase 1 project. We discuss the details of this loan in Note 7 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. 
 The construction of the ECA LNG Phase 1 project is subject to numerous risks and uncertainties, including maintaining permits and regulatory approvals; construction delays; securing and maintaining commercial arrangements, such as gas supply and transportation agreements; the impact of recent and proposed changes to the law in Mexico; and other factors associated with the project and its construction. In addition, as we discuss in Note 16 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, an unfavorable decision on certain property disputes or permit challenges could materially adversely affect construction of this project and Sempra s results of operations, financial condition, cash flows and/or prospects, including the impairment of all or a substantial portion of the capital costs invested in the project to date. For a discussion of these risks, see Part I Item 1A. Risk Factors. 
 ECA LNG Phase 2 Project. Sempra Infrastructure is developing a second, large-scale natural gas liquefaction project at the site of its existing ECA Regas Facility. We expect the proposed ECA LNG Phase 2 project to be comprised of two trains and one LNG storage tank and produce approximately 12 Mtpa of export capacity. We expect that construction of the proposed ECA LNG Phase 2 project would conflict with the current operations at the ECA Regas Facility, which currently has long-term regasification contracts for 100 of the regasification facility s capacity through 2028. This makes the decisions on whether, when and how to pursue the proposed ECA LNG Phase 2 project dependent in part on whether the investment in a large-scale liquefaction facility would, over the long term, be more beneficial financially than continuing to supply regasification services under our existing contracts. 
 We received authorizations from the DOE to export U.S.-produced natural gas to Mexico and to re-export LNG to non-FTA countries from the proposed ECA LNG Phase 2 project. 
 We have MOUs and/or HOAs with Mitsui Co., Ltd., TotalEnergies SE, and ConocoPhillips that provide a framework for their potential offtake of LNG from the proposed ECA LNG Phase 2 project and potential acquisition of an equity interest in ECA LNG Phase 2. These MOUs and HOAs are non-binding arrangements. The ultimate participation in and offtake by these parties remains subject to negotiation and finalization of definitive agreements, among other factors, and the MOUs and HOAs do not commit any party to enter into definitive agreements with respect to the proposed ECA LNG Phase 2 project. 
 Development of the ECA LNG Phase 2 project is subject to numerous risks and uncertainties, including obtaining binding customer commitments; the receipt of a number of permits and regulatory approvals; obtaining financing; negotiating and completing suitable commercial agreements, including a definitive EPC contract, equity acquisition and governance agreements, LNG sales agreements and gas supply and transportation agreements; reaching a positive final investment decision; the impact of recent and proposed changes to the law in Mexico; the property disputes and permit challenges that we reference in the ECA LNG Phase 1 project discussion above; and other factors associated with this potential investment. 
 PA LNG Phase 1 Project. Sempra Infrastructure is developing a proposed natural gas liquefaction project on a greenfield site that it owns in the vicinity of Port Arthur, Texas, located along the Sabine-Neches waterway. We are developing the PA LNG Phase 1 project, which we expect will consist of two liquefaction trains, two LNG storage tanks, a marine berth and associated loading facilities and related infrastructure necessary to provide liquefaction services with a nameplate capacity of approximately 13 Mtpa and an initial offtake capacity of approximately 10.5 Mtpa.

In April 2019, the FERC approved the siting, construction and operation of the proposed PA LNG Phase 1 project facilities, along with certain natural gas pipelines, including the Port Arthur Pipeline Louisiana Connector and Texas Connector, that could be used to supply feed gas to the liquefaction facility if and when the project is completed. Sempra Infrastructure received authorizations from the DOE in August 2015 and May 2019 that collectively permit the LNG to be produced from the proposed PA LNG Phase 1 project to be exported to all current and future FTA and non-FTA countries. 
 Sempra Infrastructure has entered into the following definitive SPAs, each of which is subject to making a positive final investment decision and customary closing conditions, for LNG offtake from the proposed PA LNG Phase 1 project with: 
 ConocoPhillips for a 20-year term for 5 Mtpa of LNG. In addition, the parties entered into an equity purchase and sale agreement whereby ConocoPhillips will acquire a 30 ownership interest in the proposed PA LNG Phase 1 project, and a natural gas supply management agreement whereby ConocoPhillips will manage the feed gas supply requirements for the proposed facility. 
 RWE Supply Trading GmbH, a subsidiary of RWE AG, for a 15-year term for 2.25 Mtpa of LNG. 
 INEOS for a 20-year term for approximately 1.4 Mtpa of LNG. 
 ORLEN for a 20-year term for approximately 1 Mtpa of LNG. 
 ENGIE S.A. for a 15-year term for approximately 0.875 Mtpa of LNG. 
 In February 2020, we entered into an EPC contract with Bechtel for the proposed PA LNG Phase 1 project. We have no obligation to move forward under the EPC contract, and we may release Bechtel to perform portions of the work pursuant to limited notices to proceed. In October 2022, we amended and restated the EPC contract to reflect an estimated price of approximately 10.5 billion, subject to adjustments. The contract price is valid until May 8, 2023, subject to certain conditions, including timely issuances of limited notices to proceed and price escalations of up to a maximum of 149 million. Sempra Infrastructure and Bechtel must mutually agree to an adjustment to the contract price if the full notice to proceed is issued after May 8, 2023. Any agreement on such an amendment to the EPC contract by both parties or on favorable terms to Sempra Infrastructure cannot be assured. Either party may terminate the EPC contract if the full notice to proceed is not issued by May 8, 2024. 
 We are progressing the development of the proposed PA LNG Phase 1 project, and are targeting a final investment decision in the first quarter of 2023 taking into account market demands given the current geopolitical environment, executing definitive agreements for LNG offtake and equity investments, and obtaining financing. 
 Development of the PA LNG Phase 1 project is subject to a number of risks and uncertainties, including obtaining binding customer commitments; identifying suitable project and equity partners; completing the required commercial agreements, such as equity acquisition and governance agreements and gas supply and transportation agreements; maintaining all necessary permits and approvals; obtaining financing and incentives; reaching a positive final investment decision; and other factors associated with the potential investment. An unfavorable outcome with respect to any of these factors could have a material adverse effect on Sempra s results of operations, financial condition, cash flows and/or prospects, including the impairment of all or a substantial portion of the capital costs invested in the project to date. For a discussion of these risks, see Part I Item 1A. Risk Factors. 
 PA LNG Phase 2 Project. Sempra Infrastructure is developing a second phase of the natural gas liquefaction project that we expect will be a similar size to the proposed PA LNG Phase 1 project. We are progressing the development of the proposed PA LNG Phase 2 project, while continuing to evaluate overall opportunities to develop the entirety of the Port Arthur site as well as potential design changes that could reduce overall emissions, including a facility design utilizing renewable power sourcing and other technological solutions. 
 In February 2020, Sempra Infrastructure filed an application, subject to approval by the FERC, for the siting, construction and operation of the proposed PA LNG Phase 2 project, including the potential addition of up to two liquefaction trains. Also in February 2020, Sempra Infrastructure filed an application with the DOE to permit LNG produced from the proposed PA LNG Phase 2 project to be exported to all current and future FTA and non-FTA countries. 
 Sempra Infrastructure has entered into non-binding HOAs for the negotiation and potential finalization of definitive SPAs with INEOS for approximately 0.2 Mtpa of LNG offtake and with Williams, as we discuss above, for LNG offtake, in each case from the proposed PA LNG Phase 2 project. The ultimate participation in and offtake from the proposed project remains subject to negotiation and finalization of definitive agreements, among other factors, and the HOAs do not commit any party to enter into a definitive agreement with respect to the proposed project. 
 Development of the PA LNG Phase 2 project is subject to a number of risks and uncertainties, including obtaining binding customer commitments; identifying suitable project and equity partners; completing the required commercial agreements, such as equity acquisition and governance agreements, LNG sales agreements and gas supply and transportation agreements; securing and

maintaining all necessary permits and approvals, including approval from the FERC; obtaining financing and incentives; reaching a positive final investment decision; and other factors associated with the potential investment. An unfavorable outcome with respect to any of these factors could have a material adverse effect on Sempra s results of operations, financial condition, cash flows and/or prospects, including the impairment of all or a substantial portion of the capital costs invested in the project to date. For a discussion of these risks, see Part I Item 1A. Risk Factors. 
 Vista Pacifico LNG Liquefaction Project. Sempra Infrastructure is developing Vista Pacifico LNG, a potential natural gas liquefaction, storage, and mid-scale export facility proposed to be located in the vicinity of Topolobampo in Sinaloa, Mexico, under an MOU with the CFE, which was subsequently updated in July 2022, that contemplates the negotiation of definitive agreements that would cover development of Vista Pacifico LNG and the re-routing of a portion of the Guaymas-El Oro segment of the Sonora pipeline and resumption of its operations. The proposed LNG export terminal would be supplied with U.S. natural gas and would use excess natural gas and pipeline capacity on existing pipelines in Mexico with the intent of helping to meet growing demand for natural gas and LNG in the Mexican and Pacific markets. 
 Sempra Infrastructure received authorization from the DOE to permit the export of U.S.-produced natural gas to Mexico and for LNG produced from the proposed Vista Pacifico LNG facility to be re-exported to all current and future FTA countries in April 2021 and non-FTA countries in December 2022. 
 In March 2022, TotalEnergies SE and Sempra Infrastructure entered into an MOU that contemplates TotalEnergies SE potentially contracting approximately one-third of the long-term export production of the proposed Vista Pacifico LNG project and potentially participating as a minority partner in the project. 
 The MOUs related to the proposed Vista Pacifico LNG project are non-binding arrangements. The ultimate participation in and offtake from the proposed project remain subject to negotiation and finalization of definitive agreements, among other factors, and the MOUs do not commit any party to enter into definitive agreements with respect to the project. 
 The development of the potential Vista Pacifico LNG project is subject to numerous risks and uncertainties, including securing binding customer commitments; obtaining and maintaining a number of permits and regulatory approvals; securing financing; identifying suitable project partners; negotiating and completing suitable commercial agreements, including definitive EPC contracts, equity acquisition and governance agreements, LNG sales agreements and gas supply and transportation agreements; reaching a positive final investment decision; the impact of recent and proposed changes to the law in Mexico; and other factors associated with this potential investment. For a discussion of these risks, see Part I Item 1A. Risk Factors. 
 Hackberry Carbon Sequestration Project. Sempra Infrastructure is developing the potential Hackberry Carbon Sequestration project near Hackberry, Louisiana. This proposed project under development is designed to permanently sequester carbon dioxide from the Cameron LNG Phase 1 facility and the proposed Cameron LNG Phase 2 project. In the third quarter of 2021, Sempra Infrastructure filed an application with the EPA for a Class VI carbon injection well to advance this project. 
 In May 2022, Sempra Infrastructure, TotalEnergies SE, Mitsui Co., Ltd. and Mitsubishi Corporation signed a Participation Agreement for the development of the proposed Hackberry Carbon Sequestration project. The Participation Agreement contemplates that the combined Cameron LNG Phase 1 facility and proposed Cameron LNG Phase 2 project would potentially serve as the anchor source for the capture and sequestration of carbon dioxide by the proposed project. It also provides the basis for the parties to enter into a JV with Sempra Infrastructure for the Hackberry Carbon Sequestration project. 
 The development of the potential Hackberry Carbon Sequestration project is subject to numerous risks and uncertainties, including obtaining required consents from the Cameron LNG JV members, securing binding customer commitments; identifying suitable project partners; obtaining and maintaining a number of permits and regulatory approvals; securing financing; negotiating and completing suitable commercial agreements, including a definitive EPC contract, and equity acquisition and governance agreements; reaching a positive final investment decision; and other factors associated with this potential investment. For a discussion of these risks, see Part I Item 1A. Risk Factors. 
 Asset and Supply Optimization. As we discuss in Part II Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk, Sempra Infrastructure enters into hedging transactions to help mitigate commodity price risk. Sempra Infrastructure posted net margin of approximately 1.4 billion in 2022 and anticipates that, once the natural gas is sold and derivatives are settled, the previously unrealized gains or losses associated with the economic hedge positions would be realized, with the cash collateral posted largely offset by collections from natural gas sales. 
 Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements. Our investment in Cameron LNG JV is a variable interest in an unconsolidated entity. We discuss variable interests in Note 1 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. 
 In June 2021, Sempra provided a promissory note, which constitutes a guarantee, for the benefit of Cameron LNG JV with a maximum exposure to loss of 165 million. The guarantee will terminate upon full repayment of Cameron LNG JV s debt,

scheduled to occur in 2039, or replenishment of the amount withdrawn by Sempra Infrastructure from the SDSRA. We discuss this guarantee in Note 6 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. 
 In July 2020, Sempra entered into a Support Agreement, which contains a guarantee and represents a variable interest, for the benefit of CFIN with a maximum exposure to loss of 979 million. The guarantee will terminate upon full repayment of the guaranteed debt by 2039, including repayment following an event in which the guaranteed debt is put to Sempra. We discuss this guarantee in Notes 1, 6 and 9 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. 
 Energy Networks 
 Construction Projects. In 2022, Sempra Infrastructure completed construction of a terminal for the receipt, storage, and delivery of refined products in the vicinity of Puebla. Sempra Infrastructure is also developing terminals for the receipt, storage, and delivery of refined products in the vicinity of Manzanillo and Ensenada. 
 As part of an industrywide audit and investigative process initiated by the CRE to enforce fuel procurement laws, federal prosecutors conducted inspections at several refined products terminals, including Sempra Infrastructure s refined products terminal in Puebla, to confirm that the gasoline and/or diesel in storage were legally imported. During the inspection of the Puebla terminal in September 2021, a federal prosecutor took samples from all the train and storage tanks in the terminal and ordered that the facility be temporarily shut down during the pendency of the analysis of the samples and investigation, while leaving the terminal in Sempra Infrastructure s custody. In November 2021, the CRE notified Sempra Infrastructure that it had started a process to revoke Sempra Infrastructure s storage permit at the Puebla terminal. In December 2021, Sempra Infrastructure filed its response to the CRE. In May 2022, the CRE provided a final resolution that stopped the permit revocation process. In August 2022, the federal prosecutor concluded the investigation and lifted the order that had temporarily shut down the facility. Commissioning activities were restarted, and commercial operations commenced in October 2022. 
 Construction of the Topolobampo terminal was substantially completed in May 2022, at which time commissioning activities commenced. Subject to the receipt of pending permits, we expect the Topolobampo terminal will commence commercial operations in the first half of 2023. 
 The ability to successfully complete major construction projects is subject to a number of risks and uncertainties. For a discussion of these risks and uncertainties, see Part I Item 1A. Risk Factors. 
 Clean Power 
 Construction Projects. ESJ completed construction and began commercial operations of a second, 108-MW wind power generation facility in January 2022. This second wind power generation facility is fully contracted by SDG E under a long-term PPA expiring in 2042. 
 Legal and Regulatory Matters 
 See Note 16 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements and Part I Item 1A. Risk Factors for discussions of the following legal and regulatory matters affecting our operations in Mexico: 
 Energ a Costa Azul 
 Land Disputes 
 Environmental and Social Impact Permits 
 One or more unfavorable final decisions on these land disputes or environmental and social impact permit challenges could materially adversely affect our existing natural gas regasification operations and proposed natural gas liquefaction projects at the site of the ECA Regas Facility and have a material adverse effect on Sempra s business, results of operations, financial condition, cash flows and/or prospects. 
 Sonora Pipeline 
 Guaymas-El Oro Segment 
 Our investment in the Guaymas-El Oro segment of the Sonora pipeline could be subject to impairment if Sempra Infrastructure and the CFE are unable to re-route a portion of the pipeline (which has not been agreed to by the parties, but is subject to negotiation pursuant to a non-binding MOU and a Shareholders Agreement with the CFE that remains subject to regulatory and corporate authorizations) and resume operations or if Sempra Infrastructure terminates the contract and is unable to obtain recovery. Any such occurrence could have a material adverse effect on Sempra s business, results of operations, financial condition, cash flows and/or prospects.

Regulatory and Other Actions by the Mexican Government 
 Amendments to Mexico s Hydrocarbons Law 
 Amendments to Mexico s Electricity Industry Law 
 Sempra Infrastructure and other parties affected by these amendments to Mexican law have challenged them by filing amparo and other claims, some of which remain pending. An unfavorable decision on one or more of these amparo or other challenges, the impact of the amendments that have become effective (due to unsuccessful amparo challenges or otherwise), or the possibility of future reforms to the energy industry through additional amendments to Mexican laws, regulations or rules (including through amendments to the constitution) may impact our ability to operate our facilities at existing levels or at all, may result in increased costs for Sempra Infrastructure and its customers, may adversely affect our ability to develop new projects, may result in decreased revenues and cash flows, and may negatively impact our ability to recover the carrying values of our investments in Mexico, any of which may have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition, cash flows and/or prospects.

Future Capital Expenditures and Investments 
 The amounts and timing of capital expenditures and certain investments are generally subject to approvals by various regulatory and other governmental and environmental bodies, including the CPUC, the FERC and the PUCT, and various other factors described in this MD A and in Part I Item 1A. Risk Factors. In 2023, we expect to make capital expenditures and investments of approximately 5.7 billion (which excludes capital expenditures that will be funded by unconsolidated entities), as summarized by segment in the following table. 
 FUTURE CAPITAL EXPENDITURES AND INVESTMENTS (Dollars in millions) Year ending December 31, 2023 SDG E 2,300 SoCalGas 2,100 Sempra Texas Utilities 300 Sempra Infrastructure 1,000 Total 5,700 
 We expect the majority of our capital expenditures and investments in 2023 will relate to transmission and distribution improvements at our regulated public utilities, and construction of the ECA LNG Phase 1 liquefaction project and natural gas pipelines at Sempra Infrastructure. 
 From 2023 through 2026, and subject to the factors described below, which could cause these estimates to vary substantially, Sempra expects to make aggregate capital expenditures and investments of approximately 18.7 billion (which excludes capital expenditures that will be funded by unconsolidated entities), as follows: 8.9 billion at SDG E, 7.8 billion at SoCalGas, 0.8 billion at Sempra Texas Utilities and 1.2 billion at Sempra Infrastructure. Capital expenditure amounts include capitalized interest and AFUDC related to debt. 
 Periodically, we review our construction, investment and financing programs and revise them in response to changes in regulation, economic conditions, competition, customer growth, inflation, customer rates, the cost and availability of capital, and safety and environmental requirements. 
 2022 Form 10-K | 84 

Table of Contents 

Our level of capital expenditures and investments in the next few years may vary substantially and will depend on, among other things, the cost and availability of financing, regulatory approvals, changes in U.S. federal tax law and business opportunities providing desirable rates of return. See Part I Item 1A. Risk Factors for a discussion of other factors that could affect future levels of our capital expenditures and investments. We intend to finance our capital expenditures in a manner that will maintain our investment-grade credit ratings and capital structure, but there is no guarantee that we will be able to do so. 
 
 Weighted-Average Rate Base 
 Rate base is the value of assets on which SDG E and SoCalGas are permitted to earn a specified rate of return in accordance with rules set by regulatory agencies, including the CPUC and the FERC (for SDG E), which is calculated using a 13-month average in accordance with CPUC methodology as adopted in rate-setting proceedings. The following table summarizes the weighted-average rate base for SDG E and SoCalGas for the last three years. 
 WEIGHTED-AVERAGE RATE BASE (Dollars in millions) 2022 2021 2020 SDG E 13,780 12,527 11,109 SoCalGas 10,494 9,371 8,228 
 The increase in weighted-average rate base reflects the significant capital investments that SDG E and SoCalGas have made in transmission and distribution safety and reliability. We expect the weighted-average rate base to continue to increase in 2023 based on our expected capital investments. 
 
 Capital Stock Transactions 
 Sempra 
 Cash provided by issuances of common and preferred stock was: 
 4 million in 2022 
 5 million in 2021 
 902 million in 2020 
 Cash used for repurchases of common stock was: 
 478 million in 2022 
 339 million in 2021 
 566 million in 2020 
 Sempra Common Stock Repurchases. As we discuss in Note 14 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, we repurchased 1,472,756 shares of our common stock for 200 million pursuant to an ASR program that was completed in February 2022. We repurchased an additional 1,471,957 shares of our common stock for 250 million pursuant to an ASR program that was completed in April 2022. These share repurchases were funded with commercial paper borrowings that we repaid with a portion of the proceeds received from the sale of NCI in SI Partners to ADIA, which closed in June 2022. 
 Dividends

DIVIDENDS PER SHARE ON SEMPRA COMMON STOCK (As approved by our board of directors) 

On February 27, 2023, our board of directors declared a dividend of 1.19 per share on our common stock and a dividend of 24.375 per share on our series C preferred stock, both payable on April 15, 2023. 
 All declarations of dividends on our common stock and preferred stock are made at the discretion of the board of directors. While we view dividends as an integral component of shareholder return, the amount of future dividends will depend on earnings, cash flows, financial and legal requirements, and other relevant factors at that time. As a result, Sempra s dividends on common stock and preferred stock declared on a historical basis may not be indicative of future declarations. 
 SDG E 
 In 2022, 2021 and 2020, SDG E paid common stock dividends to Enova and Enova paid corresponding dividends to Sempra of 100 million, 300 million and 200 million, respectively. SDG E s dividends on common stock declared on an annual historical basis may not be indicative of future declarations and could be impacted over the next few years in order for SDG E to maintain its authorized capital structure while managing its capital investment program. 
 Enova, a wholly owned subsidiary of Sempra, owns all of SDG E s outstanding common stock. Accordingly, dividends paid by SDG E to Enova and dividends paid by Enova to Sempra are eliminated in Sempra s consolidated financial statements. 
 SoCalGas 
 SoCalGas did not declare or pay common stock dividends in 2022. In 2021 and 2020, SoCalGas paid common stock dividends to PE and PE paid corresponding dividends to Sempra of 75 million and 100 million, respectively. SoCalGas dividends on common stock declared on an annual historical basis may not be indicative of future declarations and could be impacted over the next few years in order for SoCalGas to maintain its authorized capital structure. 
 PE, a wholly owned subsidiary of Sempra, owns all of SoCalGas outstanding common stock. Accordingly, dividends paid by SoCalGas to PE and dividends paid by PE to Sempra are eliminated in Sempra s consolidated financial statements. 
 Dividend Restrictions 
 The board of directors for each of Sempra, SDG E and SoCalGas has the discretion to determine whether to declare and, if declared, the amount of any dividends by each such entity. The CPUC s regulation of SDG E s and SoCalGas capital structures limits the amounts that are available for loans and dividends to Sempra. At December 31, 2022, based on these regulations, 
 2022 Form 10-K | 86 

Table of Contents 

Sempra could have received combined loans and dividends of approximately 504 million from SDG E and 347 million from SoCalGas. In addition, the terms of Sempra s series C preferred stock limit Sempra s ability to declare dividends on its common stock under certain circumstances. 
 We provide additional information about dividend restrictions in Restricted Net Assets in Note 1 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements and in Note 13 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. 
 
 Book Value Per Common Share 
 Sempra s book value per common share on the last day of each of the last three fiscal years was as follows: 
 83.43 in 2022 
 79.17 in 2021 
 70.11 in 2020 
 The increase in 2022 was primarily due to comprehensive income exceeding dividends and a fair value that was higher than carrying value related to the change in ownership, which did not result in a change of control, from the sale of NCI in SI Partners to ADIA. In 2021, the increase was primarily due to a fair value that was higher than carrying value related to the change in ownership, which did not result in a change of control, from the sale of NCI in SI Partners to KKR, the IEnova exchange offer and subsequent cash tender offer, and the common shares issued from the conversion of series A preferred stock and series B preferred stock. 
 
 Capitalization 
 Our debt to capitalization ratio, calculated as total debt as a percentage of total debt and equity, was as follows: 
 TOTAL CAPITALIZATION AND DEBT-TO-CAPITALIZATION RATIOS (Dollars in millions) Sempra SDG E SoCalGas December 31, 2022 Total capitalization 58,175 18,258 13,696 Debt-to-capitalization ratio 50 50 51 December 31, 2021 Total capitalization 52,064 16,655 10,611 Debt-to-capitalization ratio 47 50 49 
 
 Significant changes in 2022 that affected capitalization included the following: 
 Sempra: increase in long-term debt, offset by a decrease in short-term debt and increase in equity primarily from comprehensive income exceeding dividends and the sale of NCI. 
 SDG E: increase in long-term debt, offset by a decrease in short-term debt and increase in equity from comprehensive income exceeding dividends. 
 SoCalGas: increase in short-term and long-term debt, offset by an increase in equity from comprehensive income and equity contributions from Sempra. 

CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES 
 Management views certain accounting estimates as critical because their application is the most relevant, judgmental and/or material to our financial position and results of operations, and/or because they require the use of material judgments and estimates. We discuss critical accounting estimates that are material to our financial statements with the Audit Committee of Sempra s board of directors. 
 2022 Form 10-K | 87 

Table of Contents 

CONTINGENCIES 
 Sempra, SDG E, SoCalGas 
 We accrue losses for the estimated impacts of various conditions, situations or circumstances involving uncertain outcomes. For loss contingencies, we accrue the loss if an event has occurred on or before the balance sheet date and if: 
 information available through the date we file our financial statements indicates it is probable that a loss has been incurred, given the likelihood of uncertain future events 
 the amount of the loss or a range of possible losses can be reasonably estimated 
 We do not accrue contingencies that might result in gains. We continuously assess contingencies for litigation claims, environmental remediation and other events. 
 Actual amounts realized upon settlement of contingencies may be different than amounts recorded and disclosed and may affect our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows. Details of our issues in this area are discussed in Note 16 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. 
 REGULATORY ACCOUNTING 
 Sempra, SDG E, SoCalGas 
 As regulated entities, SDG E s and SoCalGas customer rates, as set and monitored by regulators, are designed to recover the cost of providing service and to provide the opportunity to realize their authorized rates of return on their investments. SDG E and SoCalGas assess probabilities of future rate recovery associated with regulatory account balances at the end of each reporting period and whenever new and/or unusual events occur, such as: 
 changes in the regulatory and political environment or the utility s competitive position 
 issuance of a regulatory commission order 
 passage of new legislation 
 To the extent that circumstances associated with regulatory balances change, the regulatory balances are evaluated and adjusted if appropriate. 
 Significant management judgment is required to evaluate the anticipated recovery of regulatory assets and plant investments, the recognition of incentives and revenues subject to refund, as well as the existence and amount of regulatory liabilities. Adverse regulatory or legislative actions could materially impact the amounts of our regulatory assets and liabilities and could materially adversely impact our results of operations and financial condition. Specifically, if future recovery of costs ceases to be probable, all or part of the associated regulatory assets and/or plant investments would need to be written off against current period earnings, or adverse regulatory or legislative actions could give rise to material new or higher regulatory liabilities. We discuss details of SDG E s and SoCalGas regulatory assets and liabilities and additional factors that management considers when assessing probabilities associated with regulatory balances in Notes 1, 4, 15 and 16 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. 
 INCOME TAXES 
 Sempra, SDG E, SoCalGas 
 Our income tax expense and related balance sheet amounts involve significant management judgments and estimates. Amounts of deferred income tax assets and liabilities, as well as current and noncurrent accruals, involve judgments and estimates of the timing and probability of recognition of income and deductions by taxing authorities. When we evaluate the anticipated resolution of income tax issues, we consider: 
 past resolutions of the same issue or similar issues 
 the status of any income tax examination in progress 
 positions taken by taxing authorities with other taxpayers with similar issues 
 The likelihood of deferred income tax recovery is based on analyses of the deferred income tax assets and our expectation of future taxable income, based on our strategic planning. Should a change in facts or circumstances lead to a change in judgment about the ultimate realizability of a deferred tax asset, we would record or adjust the related valuation allowance in the period that the change in facts and circumstances occurs, along with a corresponding increase or decrease in the provision for income taxes. 
 2022 Form 10-K | 88 

Table of Contents 

Actual income taxes could vary from estimated amounts because of: 
 future impacts of various items, including changes in tax laws, regulations, interpretations and rulings 
 our financial condition in future periods 
 the resolution of various income tax issues between us and taxing and regulatory authorities 
 Unrecognized tax benefits involve management s judgment regarding the likelihood of the benefit being sustained. The final resolution of uncertain tax positions could result in adjustments to recorded amounts and may affect our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows. 
 We discuss these matters and additional information related to accounting for income taxes, including uncertainty in income taxes, in Note 8 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. 
 PENSION AND PBOP PLANS 
 Sempra, SDG E, SoCalGas 
 To measure our pension and PBOP obligations, costs and liabilities, we rely on several assumptions. We consider current market conditions, including interest rates, in making these assumptions. We review these assumptions annually and update when appropriate. 
 The critical assumptions used to develop the required estimates include the following key factors: 
 discount rates 
 expected return on plan assets 
 health care cost trend rates 
 interest crediting rate on cash balance accounts 
 mortality rate 
 rate of compensation increases 
 termination and retirement rates 
 utilization of postretirement welfare benefits 
 payout elections (lump sum or annuity) 
 lump sum interest rates 
 The actuarial assumptions we use may differ materially from actual results due to: 
 return on plan assets 
 changing market and economic conditions 
 higher or lower withdrawal rates 
 longer or shorter participant life spans 
 more or fewer lump sum versus annuity payout elections made by plan participants 
 higher or lower retirement rates 
 Changes in the estimated costs or timing of pension and PBOP, or the assumptions and judgments used by management underlying these estimates (primarily the discount rate and assumed rate of return on plan assets), as well as changes in the circumstances associated with rate recovery, could have a material effect on the recorded expenses and liabilities. The following tables summarize the impact to our projected benefit obligation for pension and accumulated benefit obligation for PBOP at December 31, 2022, and 2022 net periodic benefit costs, in each case if the discount rate or assumed rate of return on plan assets were changed by 100 bps.

 For SDG E and SoCalGas plans, the effects of the assumptions on earnings are expected to be recovered in rates and therefore are offset in regulatory accounts. We provide details of our pension and PBOP plans in Note 9 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. 
 ASSET RETIREMENT OBLIGATIONS 
 Sempra, SDG E 
 SDG E s legal AROs related to the decommissioning of SONGS are estimated based on a site-specific study performed no less than every three years. The estimate of the obligations includes: 
 estimated decommissioning costs, including labor, equipment, material and other disposal costs 
 inflation adjustment applied to estimated cash flows 
 discount rate based on a credit-adjusted risk-free rate 
 actual decommissioning costs, progress to date and expected duration of decommissioning activities 
 SDG E s nuclear decommissioning expenses are subject to rate recovery and, therefore, rate-making accounting treatment is applied to SDG E s nuclear decommissioning activities. SDG E recognizes a regulatory asset, or liability, to the extent that its SONGS ARO exceeds, or is less than, the amount collected from customers and the amount earned in SDG E s NDT. 
 SDG E s ARO related to the decommissioning of SONGS was 540 million as of December 31, 2022, based on the decommissioning cost study prepared in 2020. Changes in the estimated costs, execution strategy or timing of decommissioning, or in the assumptions and judgments by management underlying these estimates, could cause material revisions to the estimated total cost to decommission this facility, which could have a material effect on the recorded liability. 
 The following table illustrates the increase to SDG E s and Sempra s ARO liability if the cost escalation rate was adjusted while leaving all other assumptions constant: 
 INCREASE TO ARO AND REGULATORY ASSET (Dollars in millions) December 31, 2022 Uniform increase in escalation percentage of 1 percentage point 62 
 The increase in the ARO liability driven by an increase in the cost escalation rate would result in a decrease in the regulatory liability for recoveries in excess of ARO liabilities. We provide additional detail in Note 15 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.

IMPAIRMENT TESTING OF LONG-LIVED ASSETS 
 Sempra 
 Whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that an asset s carrying amount may not be recoverable, we consider if the estimated future undiscounted cash flows are less than the carrying amount of the asset. If so, we estimate the fair value of the asset to determine the extent to which carrying value exceeds fair value. For such an estimate, we may consider data from multiple valuation methods, including data from market participants. We exercise judgment to estimate the future cash flows and the useful life of a long-lived asset and to determine our intent to use the asset. Our intent to use or dispose of a long-lived asset is subject to re-evaluation and can change over time. If an impairment test is required, the fair value of a long-lived asset can vary if differing estimates and assumptions are used in the valuation techniques applied as indicated by changing market or other conditions. Critical assumptions that affect our estimates of fair value may include: 
 consideration of market transactions 
 future cash flows 
 the appropriate risk-adjusted discount rate, including the impacts of country risk and entity risk 
 We discuss impairment of long-lived assets in Note 1 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. 
 IMPAIRMENT TESTING OF GOODWILL 
 Sempra 
 When determining if goodwill is impaired, the fair value of the reporting unit can vary if differing estimates and assumptions are used in the valuation techniques applied as indicated by changing market or other conditions. As a result, recognizing a goodwill impairment may or may not be required. When we perform the quantitative goodwill impairment test, we exercise judgment to develop estimates of the fair value of the reporting unit and compare that to its carrying value. Our fair value estimates are developed from the perspective of a knowledgeable market participant. We consider observable transactions in the marketplace for similar investments, if available, as well as an income-based approach such as a discounted cash flow analysis. A discounted cash flow analysis may be based directly on anticipated future revenues and expenses and may be performed based on free cash flows generated within the reporting unit. Critical assumptions that affect our estimates of fair value may include: 
 consideration of market transactions 
 future cash flows 
 projected revenue and expense growth rates 
 the appropriate risk-adjusted discount rate, including the impacts of country risk and entity risk 
 In 2022 and 2021, we performed a quantitative goodwill impairment test and determined that the estimated fair values of our reporting units in Mexico to which goodwill was allocated was substantially above their carrying value for each year as of October 1, our goodwill impairment testing date. Our goodwill impairment test is determined based on assumptions existing as of that point in time. Changes in the business (such as loss of future cash flows from customer disputes, renegotiation of customer contracts or the macroeconomic environment, including rising interest rates) may result in us having to perform an interim goodwill impairment test, which could result in an impairment of our goodwill.

 We discuss the recent accounting pronouncements that have had or may have a significant effect on our financial statements and/or disclosures in Note 2 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.

MARKET RISK POLICIES 
 Sempra has policies governing its market risk management and trading activities. Sempra, SDG E, SoCalGas and Sempra Infrastructure maintain separate risk management committees, organizations and processes to provide oversight of these activities for their respective businesses. The committees consist of senior officers who establish policy, oversee energy risk management activities, and monitor the results of trading and other activities to help ensure compliance with our stated energy risk management and trading policies. These activities include, but are not limited to, monitoring of market positions that create credit, liquidity and market risk. The respective oversight organizations and committees are independent from energy procurement departments. 
 Along with other tools, we use VaR and liquidity metrics to measure our exposure to market risk associated with commodity portfolios. VaR is an estimate of the potential loss on a position or portfolio of positions over a specified holding period, based on normal market conditions and within a given statistical confidence interval. We use a variance-covariance VaR model at a 95 confidence level. A liquidity metric is intended to monitor the amount of financial resources needed for meeting potential margin calls as forward market prices move. VaR and liquidity risk metrics are independently verified by the respective risk management oversight organizations. 
 SDG E and SoCalGas use natural gas derivatives and SDG E uses electricity derivatives to manage natural gas and electric price risk associated with servicing load requirements. The use of natural gas and electricity derivatives is subject to certain limitations imposed by company policy and regulatory requirements. SDG E s risk management and transacting activity plans for electricity derivatives are also required to be filed with, and have been approved by, the CPUC. SoCalGas is also subject to certain regulatory requirements and thresholds related to natural gas procurement under the GCIM. We discuss revenue recognition in Note 3 and additional market-risk information regarding derivative instruments in Note 11 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. 
 We have exposure to changes in commodity prices, interest rates and foreign currency and inflation rates. The following discussion of these primary market-risk exposures as of December 31, 2022 includes a discussion of how these exposures are managed. 
 COMMODITY PRICE RISK 
 Market risk related to physical commodities is created by volatility in the prices and basis of certain commodities. Our various subsidiaries are exposed, in varying degrees, to commodity price risk, primarily to prices in the natural gas and electricity markets. Our policy is to manage this risk within a framework that considers the specific markets and operating and regulatory environments of each subsidiary. 
 Sempra Infrastructure is exposed to commodity price risk indirectly through its LNG, natural gas pipelines and storage, and power-generating assets. Sempra Infrastructure has utilized and may continue to utilize commodity contracts, including physical and financial derivatives, in an effort to mitigate these risks and optimize the value of these assets. These transactions are typically priced based on market indices, but may also include fixed price purchases and sales of commodities. Any residual exposure is monitored as described above. Some of these derivatives that we use as economic hedges do not meet the requirements for hedge accounting, or hedge accounting is not elected, and as a result, the changes in fair value of these derivatives are recorded in earnings. Consequently, significant changes in commodity prices have in the past and could in the future result in earnings volatility as the economic offset of these derivatives may not be recorded at fair value. A significant decrease in the fair value of these economic hedges could also result in higher collateral requirements, which could negatively impact our liquidity and our ability to continue to mitigate our commodity risk exposure. We try to structure our hedging transactions with the objective that over time (i) realized gains and losses on our economic hedges would be largely offset by gains and losses related to our purchases or sales of natural gas and (ii) we would realize the economic benefit we anticipated at the time we structured the original transaction. 
 A hypothetical 10 change in commodity prices would have resulted in a change in the fair value of our commodity-based natural gas and electricity derivatives of 24 million and 3 million at December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. The impact of a change in energy commodity prices on our commodity-based derivative instruments at a point in time is not necessarily representative of the results that will be realized when the contracts are ultimately settled and does not typically include the generally offsetting impact of our underlying asset positions. 
 SDG E and SoCalGas separately manage risk within the parameters of their market risk management frameworks. In addition, their market-risk exposure is limited due to CPUC-authorized rate recovery of the costs of commodity purchases, interstate and intrastate transportation, and storage activity. However, SoCalGas may, at times, be exposed to market risk as a result of the

GCIM, which rewards or penalizes the utility for commodity costs below or above certain benchmarks. The one-day VaR for SDG E and SoCalGas commodity positions were 25 million and 2 million, respectively, at December 31, 2022 and 5 million and 1 million, respectively, at December 31, 2021. 
 INTEREST RATE RISK 
 We are exposed to fluctuations in interest rates primarily from our short- and long-term debt. Subject to regulatory constraints, we periodically enter into interest rate swap agreements to moderate our exposure to interest rate changes and to lower our overall cost of borrowing. 
 The table below shows the nominal amount of our debt: 
 NOMINAL AMOUNT OF DEBT (1) 
 (Dollars in millions) December 31, 2022 December 31, 2021 Sempra 
 SDG E SoCalGas Sempra 
 SDG E SoCalGas Short-term: Sempra California 1,105 205 900 1,161 776 385 Other 2,247 2,310 Long-term: Sempra California fixed-rate 13,159 7,400 5,759 10,876 6,417 4,459 Sempra California variable-rate 700 400 300 300 300 Other fixed-rate 10,079 8,591 Other variable-rate 575 341 
 (1) After the effects of interest rate swaps. Before reductions for unamortized discount and debt issuance costs and excluding finance lease obligations at December 31, 2022 and 2021, and before the effects of acquisition-related fair value adjustments at December 31, 2021. 
 
 An interest rate risk sensitivity analysis measures interest rate risk by calculating the estimated changes in earnings that would result from a hypothetical change in market interest rates. Earnings are affected by changes in interest rates on short-term debt and variable-rate long-term debt. If weighted-average interest rates on short-term debt outstanding at December 31, 2022 increased or decreased by 10 , the change in earnings over the 12-month period ending December 31, 2023 would be approximately 12 million. If interest rates increased or decreased by 10 on all variable-rate long-term debt at December 31, 2022, after considering the effects of interest rate swaps, the change in earnings over the 12-month period ending December 31, 2023 would be approximately 5 million. 
 We provide further information about debt and interest rate swap transactions in Notes 7 and 11, respectively, of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. 
 We also are subject to the effect of interest rate fluctuations on the assets of our pension plans, PBOP plans, and SDG E s NDT. However, we expect the effects of these fluctuations, as they relate to Sempra California, to be reflected in future rates . 
 FOREIGN CURRENCY EXCHANGE RATE RISK AND INFLATION EXPOSURES 
 We discuss our foreign currency exchange rate risk and inflation exposures in Part II Item 7. MD A Impact of Foreign Currency and Inflation Rates on Results of Operations. 
 2022 Form 10-K | 93 

Table of Contents 

The hypothetical effect for every 10 appreciation in the U.S. dollar against the Mexican peso, in which we have operations and investments, are as follows: 
 HYPOTHETICAL EFFECTS FROM 10 STRENGTHENING OF U.S. DOLLAR (1) 
 (Dollars in millions) Hypothetical effects Translation of 2022 earnings to U.S. dollars (2) 
 (3) Transactional exposure (3) 
 153 Translation of net assets of foreign subsidiaries and investment in foreign entities (4) 
 (19) 
 (1) After the effects of foreign currency derivatives. 
 (2) Amount represents the impact to earnings for a change in the average exchange rate throughout the reporting period. 
 (3) Amount primarily represents the effects of currency exchange rate movement from December 31, 2022 on monetary assets and liabilities and remeasurement of non-U.S. deferred income tax balances at our Mexican subsidiaries. 
 (4) Amount represents the effects of currency exchange rate movement from December 31, 2022 that would be recorded to OCI at the end of the reporting period. 
 
 Monetary assets and liabilities at our Mexican subsidiaries and JVs that are denominated in U.S. dollars may fluctuate significantly throughout the year. These monetary assets and liabilities and certain nonmonetary assets and liabilities are adjusted for Mexican inflation for Mexican income tax purposes. Based on a net monetary liability position of 4.8 billion, including those related to our investments in JVs, at December 31, 2022, the hypothetical effect of a 10 increase in the Mexican inflation rate is approximately 104 million lower earnings as a result of higher income tax expense for our consolidated entities, as well as lower equity earnings for our JVs. 
 In 2022 and 2023 to date, SDG E and SoCalGas have experienced inflationary pressures from increases in various costs, including the cost of natural gas, electric fuel and purchased power, labor, materials and supplies, as well as availability of labor and materials. Sempra Texas Utilities has experienced increased costs of labor and materials and does not have specific regulatory mechanisms that allow for recovery of higher costs due to inflation; rather, recovery is limited to rate updates through capital trackers and base rate reviews, which may result in partial non-recovery due to the regulatory lag. If such costs were to continue to be subject to significant inflationary pressures and we are not able to fully recover such higher costs in rates or there is a delay in recovery, these increased costs may have a significant effect on Sempra s, SDG E s and SoCalGas results of operations, financial condition, cash flows and/or prospects. 
 Sempra Infrastructure has experienced inflationary pressures from increases in various costs, including the cost of labor, materials and supplies. Sempra Infrastructure generally secures long-term contracts that are U.S. dollar-denominated or referenced and are periodically adjusted for market factors, including inflation, and Sempra Infrastructure generally enters into lump-sum contracts for its large construction projects in which much of the risk during construction is absorbed or hedged by the EPC contractor. If additional costs were to become subject to significant inflationary pressures, we may not be able to fully recover such higher costs through contractual adjustments for inflation, which may have a significant effect on Sempra s results of operations, financial condition, cash flows and/or prospects.

 Definition and Limitations of Internal Control over Financial Reporting 
 A company s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements. 
 Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

 The Audit Committee of Sempra s board of directors is directly responsible for the appointment, compensation, retention and oversight, including the oversight of the audit fee negotiations, of the independent registered public accounting firm for Sempra and its subsidiaries, including SDG E and SoCalGas. As a matter of good corporate governance, each of the Sempra, SDG E and SoCalGas boards of directors reviewed the performance of Deloitte Touche LLP and appointed them as the independent registered public accounting firm for each of Sempra, SDG E and SoCalGas, respectively. Sempra s board of directors has determined that each member of its Audit Committee is an independent director and is financially literate, and that Mr. Jack T. Taylor, who chairs the committee, and Ms. Cynthia L. Walker, who is a member of the committee, are audit committee financial experts as defined by the rules of the SEC. 
 Except where pre-approval is not required by SEC rules, Sempra s Audit Committee pre-approves all audit, audit-related and permissible non-audit services provided by Deloitte Touche LLP for Sempra and its subsidiaries, including all services provided by Deloitte Touche LLP for Sempra, SDG E and SoCalGas in 2022 and 2021. The committee s pre-approval policies and procedures provide for the general pre-approval of specific types of services and give detailed guidance to management as to the services that are eligible for general pre-approval, and they require specific pre-approval of all other permitted services. For both types of pre-approval, the committee considers whether the services to be provided are consistent

with maintaining the firm s independence. The committee s policies and procedures also delegate authority to the Chair of the committee to address any requests for pre-approval of services between committee meetings, with any pre-approval decisions to be reported to the committee at its next scheduled meeting.

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM 
 
 To the Shareholders and Board of Directors of Sempra Energy: 
 Opinion on the Financial Statements 
 We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Sempra Energy and subsidiaries Sempra as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, the related consolidated statements of operations, comprehensive income (loss), changes in equity, and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2022, the related notes, and the schedule listed in Item 15 (collectively referred to as the financial statements ). In our opinion, the financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of Sempra as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2022, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America U.S. GAAP ). 
 We have also audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) PCAOB ), Sempra s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2022, based on criteria established in Internal Control Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission, and our report dated February 28, 2023, expressed an unqualified opinion on Sempra s internal control over financial reporting. 
 Basis for Opinion 
 These financial statements are the responsibility of Sempra s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on Sempra s financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to Sempra in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. 
 We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audits to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. Our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion. 
 Critical Audit Matter 
 The critical audit matter communicated below is a matter arising from the current-period audit of the financial statements that was communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that (1) relates to accounts or disclosures that are material to the financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of a critical audit matter does not alter in any way our opinion on the financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matter below, providing a separate opinion on the critical audit matter or on the accounts or disclosures to which it relates. 
 Regulatory Accounting Impact of Rate Regulation on the Financial Statements Refer to Note 1 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements 
 Critical Audit Matter Description 
 Sempra is subject to rate regulation by regulators and commissions in various jurisdictions (collectively, the Commissions that have jurisdiction with respect to the rates of electric and gas transmission and distribution companies in those jurisdictions. Management has determined it meets the requirements under U.S. GAAP to prepare its financial statements applying the specialized rules to account for the effects of cost-based rate regulation. Accounting for the economics of rate regulation impacts multiple financial statement line items and disclosures, such as property, plant and equipment; regulatory assets and liabilities; operating revenues; operation and maintenance expense; depreciation expense; and taxes. 
 We identified the impact of rate regulation as a critical audit matter due to the significant judgments made by management to support its assertions about impacted account balances and disclosures and the high degree of subjectivity involved in assessing the impact of future regulatory orders on the financial statements. Management s judgments include assessing the likelihood of (1) the recovery in future rates of incurred costs and (2) potential refunds to customers. Auditing these judgments required specialized knowledge of accounting for rate regulation and the rate setting process due to its inherent complexities. 
 2022 Form 10-K | F-2 

Table of Contents 

How the Critical Audit Matter Was Addressed in the Audit 
 Our audit procedures related to the application of specialized rules to account for the effects of cost-based rate regulation and the uncertainty of future decisions by the Commissions included the following, among others: 
 We tested the effectiveness of management s controls over the evaluation of the likelihood of (1) the recovery in future rates of costs deferred as regulatory assets, and (2) a refund or a future reduction in rates that should be reported as regulatory liabilities. We tested the effectiveness of management s controls over the initial recognition of amounts as regulatory assets or liabilities and the monitoring and evaluation of regulatory developments that may affect the likelihood of recovering costs in future rates or of a future reduction in rates. 
 We read relevant regulatory orders issued by the Commissions for Sempra and other publicly available information to assess the likelihood of recovery in future rates or of a future reduction in rates based on precedents of the Commissions treatment of similar costs under similar circumstances. We evaluated the external information and compared to management s recorded regulatory asset and liability balances for completeness. 
 We evaluated Sempra s disclosures related to the impacts of rate regulation, including the balances recorded and regulatory developments.

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM 
 To the Shareholders and Board of Directors of Southern California Gas Company: 
 Opinion on the Financial Statements 
 We have audited the accompanying balance sheets of Southern California Gas Company SoCalGas as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, the related statements of operations, comprehensive income (loss), changes in shareholders equity, and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2022, and the related notes (collectively referred to as the financial statements ). In our opinion, the financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of SoCalGas as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2022, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America U.S. GAAP ). 
 We have also audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) PCAOB ), SoCalGas internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2022, based on criteria established in Internal Control Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission, and our report dated February 28, 2023, expressed an unqualified opinion on SoCalGas internal control over financial reporting. 
 Basis for Opinion 
 These financial statements are the responsibility of SoCalGas management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on SoCalGas financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to SoCalGas in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. 
 We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audits to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. Our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion. 
 Critical Audit Matter 
 The critical audit matter communicated below is a matter arising from the current-period audit of the financial statements that was communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that (1) relates to accounts or disclosures that are material to the financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of a critical audit matter does not alter in any way our opinion on the financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matter below, providing a separate opinion on the critical audit matter or on the accounts or disclosures to which it relates. 
 Regulatory Accounting Impact of Rate Regulation on the Financial Statements Refer to Note 1 of the Notes to Financial Statements 
 Critical Audit Matter Description 
 SoCalGas is subject to rate regulation by regulators and commissions in various jurisdictions (collectively, the Commissions that have jurisdiction with respect to the rates of gas transmission and distribution companies in those jurisdictions. Management has determined it meets the requirements under U.S. GAAP to prepare its financial statements applying the specialized rules to account for the effects of cost-based rate regulation. Accounting for the economics of rate regulation impacts multiple financial statement line items and disclosures, such as property, plant and equipment; regulatory assets and liabilities; operating revenues; operation and maintenance expense; depreciation expense; and taxes. 
 We identified the impact of rate regulation as a critical audit matter due to the significant judgments made by management to support its assertions about impacted account balances and disclosures and the high degree of subjectivity involved in assessing the impact of future regulatory orders on the financial statements. Management s judgments include assessing the likelihood of (1) the recovery in future rates of incurred costs and (2) potential refunds to customers. Auditing these judgments required specialized knowledge of accounting for rate regulation and the rate setting process due to its inherent complexities.

How the Critical Audit Matter Was Addressed in the Audit 
 Our audit procedures related to the application of specialized rules to account for the effects of cost-based rate regulation and the uncertainty of future decisions by the Commissions included the following, among others: 
 We tested the effectiveness of management s controls over the evaluation of the likelihood of (1) the recovery in future rates of costs deferred as regulatory assets, and (2) a refund or a future reduction in rates that should be reported as regulatory liabilities. We tested the effectiveness of management s controls over the initial recognition of amounts as regulatory assets or liabilities and the monitoring and evaluation of regulatory developments that may affect the likelihood of recovering costs in future rates or of a future reduction in rates. 
 We read relevant regulatory orders issued by the Commissions for SoCalGas and other publicly available information to assess the likelihood of recovery in future rates or of a future reduction in rates based on precedents of the Commissions treatment of similar costs under similar circumstances. We evaluated the external information and compared to management s recorded regulatory asset and liability balances for completeness. 
 We evaluated SoCalGas disclosures related to the impacts of rate regulation, including the balances recorded and regulatory developments.

These utilized funds will be subject to review by the CPUC, which will make a determination as to the degree an IOU s conduct related to an ignition of a wildfire was prudent or imprudent. The Revised Prudent Manager Standard requires that the CPUC apply clear standards when reviewing wildfire liability losses paid when determining the reasonableness of an IOU s conduct related to an ignition. Under this standard, the conduct under review related to the ignition may include factors within and beyond the IOU s control, including humidity, temperature and winds. Costs and expenses may be allocated for cost recovery in full or in part. Also, under this standard, an IOU s conduct will be deemed reasonable if a valid annual safety certification is in place at the time of the ignition, unless a serious doubt is raised, in which case the burden shifts to the utility to dispel that doubt. The IOUs will receive an annual safety certification from OEIS if they meet various requirements. 
 If an IOU has maintained a valid annual safety certification, to the extent it is found to be imprudent, claims will be reimbursable by the IOU to the Wildfire Fund up to a cap based on the IOU s rate base. The aggregate requirement to reimburse the Wildfire Fund over a trailing three calendar year period is capped at of the equity portion of an IOU s electric transmission and distribution rate base in the year of the prudency determination. Based on its 2022 rate base, the liability cap for SDG E is approximately billion, which is adjusted annually. The liability cap will apply on a rolling three-year basis so long as future annual safety certifications are received and the Wildfire Fund has not been terminated, which could occur if funds are exhausted. Amounts in excess of the liability cap and amounts that are determined to be prudently incurred do not need to be reimbursed by an IOU to the Wildfire Fund. The Wildfire Fund does not have a specified term and coverage will continue until the assets of the Wildfire Fund are exhausted and the Wildfire Fund is terminated, in which case, the remaining funds, if any, will be transferred to California s general fund to be used for fire risk mitigation programs. 
 In August 2022, the OEIS approved SDG E s 2022 Wildfire Mitigation Plan, which is effective until the OEIS approves a new plan. SDG E received its annual wildfire safety certification from the OEIS in December 2022. 
 The Wildfire Fund was initially funded up to billion by a loan from the California Surplus Money Investment Fund. The loan is financed through a DWR bond, which was put in place in October 2020 and is securitized through a dedicated surcharge on ratepayers bills attributable to the DWR. In October 2019, the CPUC adopted a decision authorizing a non-bypassable charge to be collected by the IOUs to support the anticipated DWR bond issuance authorized by AB 1054. The CPUC decision also determined that ratepayers of non-participating electrical corporations shall not pay the non-bypassable charge. 
 The Wildfire Fund was also funded by initial shareholder contributions from the IOUs totaling billion. SDG E s share was million. The IOUs are also required to make annual shareholder contributions to the Wildfire Fund with an aggregate value of billion over a -year period starting in 2019. SDG E s share is million. The contributions are not subject to rate recovery. 
 Wildfire Fund Asset and Obligation 
 In 2019, SDG E recorded both a Wildfire Fund asset and a related obligation for its commitment to make shareholder contributions of million to the Wildfire Fund, measured at present value as of July 25, 2019 (the date by which both Edison and SDG E opted to contribute to the Wildfire Fund). SDG E paid its initial shareholder contribution of million to the Wildfire Fund in September 2019. SDG E funded this contribution with proceeds from an equity contribution from 
 2022 Form 10-K | F-33 

Table of Contents 

million through December 31, 2028. SDG E is accreting the present value of the Wildfire Fund obligation until the liability is settled. 
 SDG E is amortizing the Wildfire Fund asset on a straight-line basis over the estimated period of benefit, as adjusted for utilization by the IOUs. The estimated period of benefit of the Wildfire Fund asset is years and is based on several assumptions, including, but not limited to: 
 historical wildfire experience of each IOU in California, including frequency and severity of the wildfires 
 the value of property potentially damaged by wildfires 
 the effectiveness of wildfire risk mitigation efforts by each IOU 
 liability cap of each IOU 
 IOU prudency determination levels 
 FERC jurisdictional allocation levels 
 insurance coverage levels 
 The use of different assumptions, or changes to the assumptions used, could have a significant impact on the estimated period of benefit of the Wildfire Fund asset. SDG E periodically evaluates the estimated period of benefit of the Wildfire Fund asset based on actual experience and changes in these assumptions. SDG E recognizes a reduction of its Wildfire Fund asset and records a charge against earnings in the period when there is a reduction of the available coverage due to recoverable claims from any of the participating IOUs. Wildfire claims that are recoverable from the Wildfire Fund, net of anticipated or actual reimbursement to the Wildfire Fund by the responsible IOU, decrease the Wildfire Fund asset and remaining available coverage.

SDG E 
 SDG E s power procurement is subject to reliability requirements that may require SDG E to enter into various PPAs that include variable interests. SDG E evaluates the respective entities to determine if variable interests exist and, based on the qualitative and quantitative analyses described above, if SDG E, and indirectly Sempra, is the primary beneficiary. 
 SDG E has agreements under which it purchases power generated by facilities for which it supplies all of the natural gas to fuel the power plant (i.e., tolling agreements). SDG E s obligation to absorb natural gas costs may be a significant variable interest. In addition, SDG E has the power to direct the dispatch of electricity generated by these facilities. Based on our analysis, the ability to direct the dispatch of electricity may have the most significant impact on the economic performance of the entity owning the generating facility because of the associated exposure to the cost of natural gas, which fuels the plants, and the value of electricity produced. To the extent that SDG E (1) is obligated to purchase and provide fuel to operate the facility, (2) has the power to direct the dispatch, and (3) purchases all of the output from the facility for a substantial portion of the facility s useful life, SDG E may be the primary beneficiary of the entity owning the generating facility. SDG E determines if it is the primary beneficiary in these cases based on a qualitative approach in which it considers the operational characteristics of the facility, including its expected power generation output relative to its capacity to generate and the financial structure of the entity, among other factors. If SDG E determines that it is the primary beneficiary, SDG E and Sempra consolidate the entity that owns the facility as a VIE. 
 In addition to tolling agreements, other variable interests involve various elements of fuel and power costs, and other components of cash flows expected to be paid to or received by our counterparties. In most of these cases, the expectation of variability is not substantial, and SDG E generally does not have the power to direct activities, including the operation and maintenance activities of the generating facility, that most significantly impact the economic performance of the other VIEs. If our ongoing evaluation of these VIEs were to conclude that SDG E becomes the primary beneficiary and consolidation by SDG E becomes necessary, the effects could be significant to the financial position and liquidity of SDG E and Sempra. 
 SDG E determined that none of its PPAs and tolling agreements resulted in SDG E being the primary beneficiary of a VIE at December 31, 2022 and 2021. PPAs and tolling agreements that relate to SDG E s involvement with VIEs are primarily accounted for as finance leases. The carrying amounts of the assets and liabilities under these contracts are included in PP E, net, and finance lease liabilities with balances of million and million at December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. SDG E recovers costs incurred on PPAs, tolling agreements and other variable interests through CPUC-approved long-term power procurement plans. SDG E has no residual interest in the respective entities and has not provided or guaranteed any debt or equity support, liquidity arrangements, performance guarantees or other commitments associated with these contracts other than the purchase commitments described in Note 16. As a result, SDG E s potential exposure to loss from its variable interest in these VIEs is not significant. 
 Sempra Texas Utilities 
 Oncor Holdings is a VIE. Sempra is not the primary beneficiary of this VIE because of the structural and operational ring-fencing and governance measures in place that prevent us from having the power to direct the significant activities of Oncor Holdings. As a result, we do not consolidate Oncor Holdings and instead account for our ownership interest as an equity method investment. See Note 6 for additional information about our equity method investment in Oncor Holdings and restrictions on our ability to influence its activities. Our maximum exposure to loss, which fluctuates over time, from our interest in Oncor Holdings does not exceed the carrying value of our investment, which was million and million at December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. 
 Sempra Infrastructure 
 Cameron LNG JV 
 Cameron LNG JV is a VIE principally due to contractual provisions that transfer certain risks to customers. Sempra is not the primary beneficiary of this VIE because we do not have the power to direct the most significant activities of Cameron LNG JV, 
 2022 Form 10-K | F-39 

Table of Contents 

including LNG production and operation and maintenance activities at the liquefaction facility. Therefore, we account for our investment in Cameron LNG JV under the equity method. The carrying value of our investment, including amounts recognized in AOCI related to interest-rate cash flow hedges at Cameron LNG JV, was million and million at December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. Our maximum exposure to loss, which fluctuates over time, includes the carrying value of our investment and our obligation under the SDSRA, which we discuss in Note 6. 
 CFIN 
 As we discuss in Note 6, in July 2020, Sempra entered into a Support Agreement for the benefit of CFIN, which is a VIE. Sempra is not the primary beneficiary of this VIE because we do not have the power to direct the most significant activities of CFIN, including modification, prepayment, and refinance decisions related to the financing arrangement with external lenders and Cameron LNG JV s four project owners as well as the ability to determine and enforce remedies in the event of default. The conditional obligations of the Support Agreement represent a variable interest that we measure at fair value on a recurring basis (see Note 12). Sempra s maximum exposure to loss under the terms of the Support Agreement is million. 
 ECA LNG Phase 1 
 ECA LNG Phase 1 is a VIE because its total equity at risk is not sufficient to finance its activities without additional subordinated financial support. We expect that ECA LNG Phase 1 will require future capital contributions or other financial support to finance the construction of the facility. Sempra is the primary beneficiary of this VIE because we have the power to direct the development activities related to the construction of the liquefaction facility, which we consider to be the most significant activities of ECA LNG Phase 1 during the construction phase of its natural gas liquefaction project. As a result, we consolidate ECA LNG Phase 1. Sempra consolidated million and million of assets at December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively, consisting primarily of PP E, net, and Accounts Receivable Other attributable to ECA LNG Phase 1 that could be used only to settle obligations of this VIE and that are not available to settle obligations of Sempra, and million and million of liabilities at December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively, consisting primarily of long-term debt, short-term debt and accounts payable attributable to ECA LNG Phase 1 for which creditors do not have recourse to the general credit of Sempra. Additionally, as we discuss in Note 7, IEnova and TotalEnergies SE have provided guarantees for and , respectively, of the loan facility supporting construction of the liquefaction facility.

 Sempra Infrastructure 
 Sale of NCI in SI Partners to KKR. On October 1, 2021, Sempra, its wholly owned subsidiary, SI Partners (formerly Sempra Global), and KKR consummated the transactions contemplated under a purchase and contribution agreement dated April 4, 2021 (as amended prior to closing, the KKR Purchase Agreement). Pursuant to the KKR Purchase Agreement, KKR acquired newly designated Class A Units representing a NCI in SI Partners for a purchase price of billion, including post-closing adjustments. As a result of this sale, we recorded a billion increase in equity held by NCI and an increase in Sempra s shareholders equity of billion, net of million in transaction costs and million in tax impacts, including the tax effect of the sale and changes to a deferred income tax liability related to outside basis differences in SI Partners. Transaction costs include million paid to KKR for reimbursement of certain expenses that KKR incurred in connection with closing the transaction. 
 Prior to the closing of the transactions contemplated under the KKR Purchase Agreement on October 1, 2021, we completed an internal legal reorganization to consolidate the assets of Sempra LNG Holding, LP and our ownership of IEnova under Sempra Global, which was renamed SI Partners. 
 Pursuant to the KKR Purchase Agreement, we have agreed to indemnify SI Partners for, among other things, certain losses arising from liabilities of SI Partners and its subsidiaries to the extent not primarily relating to the undertaking of the business of SI Partners, and we have agreed to indemnify KKR for losses attributable to pre-closing taxes. 
 SI Partners has two authorized classes of units, designated as Class A Units (which are common voting units) and Sole Risk Interests. If KKR approves our request that a project not be pursued jointly, or if KKR decides not to participate in any proposed project for which we nevertheless desire to make a positive final investment decision, we may proceed with such project either independently through a different investment vehicle or as a Sole Risk Project within SI Partners and receive Sole Risk Interests in respect thereof. Sole Risk Projects are separated from other SI Partners projects and are conducted at our sole cost, expense and liability and we receive, through the acquisition of Sole Risk Interests, any economic and other benefits from such projects. KKR is not entitled to any benefits or rights in respect of any Sole Risk Project. The Guaymas-El Oro segment of the Sonora pipeline currently constitutes a Sole Risk Project. Until a specified date, KKR has certain discretionary rights to cause the Guaymas-El Oro segment of the Sonora pipeline to cease to be a Sole Risk Project and be pursued jointly within SI Partners. 
 At the closing of the sale of NCI in SI Partners to KKR, Sempra and KKR entered into a limited partnership agreement (the LP Agreement), which governs our and their respective rights and obligations in respect of our ownership interests in SI Partners. The LP Agreement contains certain default remedies if we or KKR fails to fund any amounts required to be funded under the LP Agreement. The LP Agreement also requires that SI Partners distribute to us and to KKR at least of distributable cash of SI Partners and its subsidiaries on a quarterly basis, subject to certain exceptions and reserves. Generally, distributions from SI

NCI in SI Partners for a purchase price of billion. Following the closing of the transaction, Sempra, KKR and ADIA directly or indirectly own , , and , respectively, of the outstanding Class A Units of SI Partners, which excludes the non-voting Sole Risk Interests held only by Sempra. As a result of this sale to ADIA, we recorded a million increase in equity held by NCI and an increase in Sempra s shareholders equity of million, net of million in transaction costs and million in tax impacts. Transaction costs include million paid to ADIA for reimbursement of certain expenses that ADIA incurred in connection with closing the transaction. 
 At the closing of the sales of NCI in SI Partners to KKR and ADIA, SI Partners indirectly owned of the outstanding shares of IEnova. To the extent we acquire additional shares of IEnova after each respective closing, such additional shares will be acquired by SI Partners, and KKR and ADIA will provide and , respectively, of the funding. 
 At the closing, KKR and ADIA (the Minority Partners) and Sempra entered into a second amended and restated agreement of limited partnership of SI Partners (the Amended LP Agreement), which governs their respective rights and obligations in respect of their ownership of SI Partners. Under the Amended LP Agreement, matters are decided generally by majority vote and the managers designated by Sempra, KKR and ADIA each, as a group, have voting power equivalent to the ownership percentage of their respective designating limited partner. Sempra maintains control of SI Partners. However, SI Partners and its controlled subsidiaries are prohibited from taking certain limited actions without the prior written approval of the Minority Partners (subject to each Minority Partner maintaining certain ownership thresholds in SI Partners). The minority protections held by ADIA constitute a subset of the minority protections granted to KKR. 
 The terms of the Amended LP Agreement applicable to ADIA in relation to capital contributions and distributions are generally consistent with those granted to KKR, with adjustments and limitations to take into account ADIA s relative ownership percentage, including limiting ADIA s priority distribution rights to the failure of certain proposed projects to receive a positive final investment decision by a certain date or to achieve specified thresholds of projected internal rates of return or leverage. The transfer rights and restrictions and registration rights in the Amended LP Agreement applicable to ADIA are also generally consistent with those granted to KKR, with adjustments and limitations to take into account ADIA s relative ownership percentage, including a general restriction on ADIA transferring its interests in SI Partners to third parties (other than pursuant to certain specified permitted transfers) for a specified period following its entry into the Amended LP Agreement. 
 SI Partners Subsidiaries. In May 2021, we acquired publicly owned shares of IEnova in exchange for newly issued shares of our common stock upon completion of our exchange offer launched in the U.S. and Mexico, which increased our ownership interest in IEnova from to . Upon completing the exchange offer, Sempra s common stock became listed on the Mexican Stock Exchange under the trading symbol SRE.MX. We acquired the IEnova shares at an exchange ratio of shares of our common stock for each one IEnova share. In connection with the exchange offer, we recorded a billion decrease in equity held by NCI and an increase in Sempra s shareholders equity of billion, net of million in transactions costs. 
 In September 2021, we acquired publicly owned shares of IEnova for billion Mexican pesos (approximately million in U.S. dollars) in cash upon completion of our tender offer launched in the U.S. and Mexico in August 2021, which increased our ownership interest in IEnova from to . We acquired these IEnova shares at a price of Mexican pesos per share (approximately per share in U.S. dollars). In connection with the cash tender offer, we recorded a million decrease in equity held by NCI and a decrease in Sempra s shareholders equity of million, including million in transaction costs.

million offset by a deferred income tax asset related to the outside basis difference in IEnova s shares. Upon completing the sale of a NCI in SI Partners to KKR in October 2021, which we discuss above, we recorded million in net income tax expense related to the utilization of this deferred income tax asset. 
 Following the exchange offer and the cash tender offer, IEnova s shares were delisted from the Mexican Stock Exchange effective October 15, 2021. In connection with the delisting, we are maintaining a trust for the purpose of purchasing the IEnova shares that remained publicly owned as of the completion of the cash tender offer for Mexican pesos per share, the same price per share that was offered in our cash tender offer. The trust was to be in place through the earlier of April 14, 2022 or the date on which we acquired all the remaining publicly owned IEnova shares. On April 13, 2022, the term of the trust was amended so that it will remain in place until we terminate it, subject to any maximum term under applicable Mexican law. As of February 21, 2023, an aggregate of of the remaining publicly owned IEnova shares had been acquired by such trust. 
 In 2020, IEnova repurchased shares of its outstanding common stock held by NCI for approximately million, resulting in an increase in Sempra s ownership interest in IEnova from to . 
 In 2020, Sempra Infrastructure purchased additional shares in ICM Ventures Holdings B.V. for million, increasing its ownership interest from to . ICM Ventures Holdings B.V. owns certain permits and land where Sempra Infrastructure is developing a terminal in the vicinity of Manzanillo for the receipt, storage and delivery of refined products. In July 2021, Sempra Infrastructure acquired the remaining interest held by NCI in ICM Ventures Holdings B.V. for million. 
 In 2020, an affiliate of TotalEnergies SE acquired a ownership interest in ECA LNG Phase 1. 
 In 2020, Sempra Infrastructure purchased for million the minority interest in Liberty Gas Storage LLC, increasing Sempra Infrastructure s ownership in Liberty Gas Storage LLC to . Prior to the purchase, the minority partner converted million in notes payable due from Sempra Infrastructure to equity. As a result of the purchase, we recorded an increase in Sempra s shareholders equity of million for the difference between the carrying value and fair value related to the change in ownership.

 Sempra California 
 Sempra, SDG E and SoCalGas provide certain services to each other and are charged an allocable share of the cost of such services. Also, from time-to-time, SDG E and SoCalGas may make short-term advances of surplus cash to Sempra at interest rates based on the federal funds effective rate plus a margin of to bps, depending on the loan balance. 
 SoCalGas provides natural gas transportation and storage services to SDG E and charges SDG E for such services monthly. SoCalGas records revenues and SDG E records a corresponding amount to cost of sales. 
 SDG E and SoCalGas charge one another, as well as other Sempra affiliates, for shared asset depreciation. SoCalGas and SDG E record revenues and the affiliates record corresponding amounts to O M. 
 The natural gas supply for SDG E s and SoCalGas core natural gas customers is purchased by SoCalGas as a combined procurement portfolio managed by SoCalGas. Core customers are primarily residential and small commercial and industrial customers. This core gas procurement function is considered a shared service; therefore, revenues and costs related to SDG E are presented net in SoCalGas Statements of Operations. 
 SDG E has a -year contract for up to MW of renewable power supplied from the ESJ wind power generation facility. Prior to March 2021, ESJ was a owned and unconsolidated JV of Sempra Infrastructure. In March 2021, Sempra Infrastructure completed the acquisition of the remaining interest in ESJ and ESJ became a consolidated subsidiary of Sempra. A second -year contract between SDG E and ESJ for up to MW of renewable power supplied from the same facility commenced in January 2022. 
 Sempra Infrastructure 
 Sempra Infrastructure provides maintenance and administrative services to TAG Pipelines Norte, S. de. R.L. de C.V. Additionally, Sempra Infrastructure subleases office space for personnel to TAG Pipelines Norte, S. de. R.L. de C.V. and TAG. 
 Sempra Infrastructure has agreements with Cameron LNG JV to provide certain business services and project development services related to the Cameron LNG Phase 2 project. Sempra Infrastructure had an agreement to provide transportation services to Cameron LNG JV for capacity on the Cameron Interstate Pipeline through August 2020, when Cameron LNG JV achieved commercial operations of Train 3 of its Phase 1 project. 
 Sempra provided guarantees related to Cameron LNG JV s construction-period debt that were terminated in March 2021, as well as guarantees related to Cameron LNG JV s SDSRA and CFIN s Support Agreement that remain outstanding. We discuss these guarantees in Note 6.

billion. Additionally, the amount of restricted net assets of our unconsolidated entities is billion. Although the restrictions cap the amount of funding that the various operating subsidiaries can provide to Sempra, we do not believe these restrictions will have a significant impact on our ability to access cash to pay dividends and fund operating needs. 
 As we discuss in Note 6, billion of Sempra s retained earnings represents undistributed earnings of equity method investments at December 31, 2022. 
 Sempra California 
 The CPUC s regulation of SDG E s and SoCalGas capital structures limits the amounts available for dividends and loans to Sempra. At December 31, 2022, Sempra could have received combined loans and dividends of approximately million from SDG E and approximately million from SoCalGas. 
 The payment and amount of future dividends by SDG E and SoCalGas are at the discretion of their respective boards of directors. The following restrictions limit the amount of retained earnings that may be paid as common stock dividends or loaned to Sempra from either utility: 
 The CPUC requires that SDG E s and SoCalGas common equity ratios be no lower than one percentage point below the CPUC-authorized percentage of each entity s authorized capital structure. The authorized percentage at December 31, 2022 is at both SDG E and SoCalGas. 
 SDG E and SoCalGas each have a revolving credit line that requires it to maintain a ratio of consolidated indebtedness to consolidated capitalization (as defined in the agreements) of no more than , as we discuss in Note 7. 
 Based on these restrictions, at December 31, 2022, SDG E s restricted net assets were billion and SoCalGas restricted net assets were billion, which could not be transferred to Sempra. 
 Sempra Texas Utilities 
 Sempra owns an indirect, interest in Oncor Holdings, which owns an interest in Oncor. As we discuss in Note 6, we account for our investment in Oncor Holdings under the equity method. Significant restrictions at Oncor that limit the amount that may be paid as dividends to Sempra include: 
 In connection with ring-fencing measures, governance mechanisms and commitments, Oncor may not pay any dividends or make any other distributions (except for contractual tax payments) if a majority of its independent directors or a minority member director determines that it is in the best interests of Oncor to retain such amounts to meet expected future requirements. 
 Oncor must remain in compliance with its debt-to-equity ratio established by the PUCT for ratemaking purposes and may not pay dividends or other distributions (except for contractual tax payments) if that payment would cause it to exceed its PUCT authorized debt-to-equity ratio. Oncor s authorized regulatory capital structure is debt to equity at December 31, 2022. 
 If the credit rating on Oncor s senior secured debt by any of the Rating Agencies falls below BBB (or the equivalent), Oncor will suspend dividends and other distributions (except for contractual tax payments), unless otherwise allowed by the PUCT. At December 31, 2022, all of Oncor s senior secured ratings were above BBB. 
 Oncor s revolving credit line and certain of its other debt agreements require it to maintain a consolidated senior debt-to-capitalization ratio of no more than and observe certain affirmative covenants. At December 31, 2022, Oncor was in compliance with these covenants. 
 Based on these restrictions, at December 31, 2022, Oncor s restricted net assets were billion, which could not be transferred to its owners. 
 Sempra owns an indirect, interest in Sharyland Holdings, which owns a interest in Sharyland Utilities. Significant restrictions related to this equity method investment include: 
 Sharyland Utilities may not pay dividends or make other distributions (except for contractual payments) without the consent of the JV partner. 
 Sharyland Utilities must remain in compliance with the capital structure established by the PUCT for ratemaking purposes and may not pay dividends or other distributions (except for contractual tax payments) if that payment would cause its debt to exceed of its capital structure.

and observe certain customary reporting requirements and other affirmative covenants. At December 31, 2022, Sharyland Utilities was in compliance with these and all other covenants. 
 Based on these restrictions, at December 31, 2022, Sharyland Utilities restricted net assets were million, which could not be transferred to its owners. 
 Sempra Infrastructure 
 Significant restrictions at Sempra Infrastructure include: 
 Partnerships and JVs at Sempra Infrastructure may not pay dividends or make other distributions (except for contractual payments) without the consent of the partners. 
 Sempra Infrastructure has an equity method investment in Cameron LNG JV, which has debt agreements that require the establishment and funding of project accounts to which the proceeds of loans, project revenues and other amounts are deposited and applied in accordance with the debt agreements. The debt agreements require the JV to maintain reserve accounts in order to pay the project debt service, and also contain restrictions related to the payment of dividends and other distributions to the members of the JV. 
 Pursuant to the transfer restriction agreement under the debt agreements, Sempra must retain at least of the indirect fully diluted economic and beneficial ownership interest in Cameron LNG JV. In addition, at all times, a Sempra controlled (but not necessarily wholly owned) subsidiary must directly own of the membership interests of Cameron LNG JV. 
 To support Cameron LNG JV s obligations under its debt agreements, Cameron LNG JV has granted security over all of its assets, subject to customary exceptions, and all equity interests in Cameron LNG JV were pledged to HSBC Bank USA, National Association, as security trustee for the benefit of all of Cameron LNG JV s creditors. As a result, an enforcement action by the lenders taken in accordance with the finance documents could result in the exercise of such security interests by the lenders and the loss of ownership interests in Cameron LNG JV by Sempra and the other project partners. 
 Under these restrictions, net assets of Cameron LNG JV of approximately million are restricted at December 31, 2022. 
 Mexico requires domestic corporations to maintain minimum legal reserves as a percentage of capital stock, resulting in restricted net assets of million at Sempra Infrastructure s consolidated Mexican subsidiaries at December 31, 2022. 
 IEnova has restrictions under trust and debt agreements related to pipeline projects to pay for rights-of-way, license fees, permits, topographic surveys and other costs. Under these restrictions, net assets totaling million are restricted at December 31, 2022. 
 TAG, a owned and unconsolidated JV of Sempra Infrastructure, has a long-term debt agreement that requires it to maintain a reserve account to pay the projects debt. Under these restrictions, net assets totaling million are restricted at December 31, 2022. 
 As we discuss in Note 16, Sempra Infrastructure drew against and fully exhausted Gazprom s letters of credit in April 2022 due to Gazprom s non-renewal of such letters of credit as required under its LNG storage and regasification agreement. As a result, Sempra Infrastructure has restricted cash for funds drawn from the letters of credit. Under these restrictions, net assets totaling million are restricted at December 31, 2022. 
 Based on these restrictions, at December 31, 2022, Sempra Infrastructure s restricted net assets of its consolidated and unconsolidated entities were million and million, respectively, which could not be transferred to its owners.

 Regulatory Assets Earning a Return 
 Over- and undercollected regulatory balancing accounts and other regulatory assets, net, reflect the difference between customer billings and recorded or CPUC-authorized amounts. Depreciation, taxes and return on rate base may also be included in certain accounts. Amounts in the balancing accounts are recoverable (receivable) or refundable (payable) in future rates, subject to CPUC approval. SDG E and SoCalGas periodically make requests to the CPUC to true up their revenue requirement for amounts accumulated in the regulatory balancing accounts and in other regulatory assets, net. The CPUC may impose various review procedures before authorizing recovery or refund of amounts accumulated for authorized programs, including limitations on the program s total cost, revenue requirement limits or reviews of costs for reasonableness. These procedures could result in delays or disallowances of recovery from ratepayers. 
 Amortization expense on certain regulatory assets for the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020 was million, million and million, respectively, at Sempra, million, million and million, respectively, at SDG E, and million, million and million, respectively, at SoCalGas.

 COVID-19 Pandemic Protections 
 In connection with the COVID-19 pandemic and at the direction of the CPUC, SDG E and SoCalGas implemented certain measures to assist customers, including suspending service disconnections due to nonpayment for all customers (except for SoCalGas noncore customers), waiving late payment fees, and offering flexible payment plans. At the CPUC s direction, SDG E and SoCalGas enrolled residential and small business customers with past-due balances in long-term repayment plans. 
 In 2021, SDG E and SoCalGas applied, on behalf of their customers, for financial assistance from the California Department of Community Services and Development under the 2021 California Arrearage Payment Program, which provided funds of million and million for SDG E and SoCalGas, respectively. In the first quarter of 2022, SDG E and SoCalGas received and applied the amounts directly to eligible customer accounts to reduce past due balances. In June 2022, AB 205 was approved establishing, among other things, the 2022 California Arrearage Payment Program. In December 2022, SDG E and SoCalGas received funding of million and million, respectively, related to this program and, in January 2023, applied the amounts directly to eligible customer accounts to reduce past due balances. 
 SDG E and SoCalGas have been authorized to track and request recovery of incremental costs associated with complying with customer protection measures implemented by the CPUC related to the COVID-19 pandemic, including costs associated with suspending service disconnections and uncollectible expenses that arise from customers failure to pay. SDG E and SoCalGas expect to pursue recovery of small and medium-large commercial and industrial customers tracked costs in rates in future CPUC

million for 2022 and million for 2023. For SoCalGas, the decision authorizes revenue requirement increases of million for 2022 and million for 2023. 
 In May 2022, SDG E and SoCalGas filed their 2024 GRC applications requesting CPUC approval of test year revenue requirements for 2024 and attrition year adjustments for 2025 through 2027. SDG E and SoCalGas requested revenue requirements for 2024 of billion and billion, respectively. SDG E and SoCalGas are proposing post-test year revenue requirement changes using various mechanisms that are estimated to result in annual increases of approximately to at SDG E and approximately to at SoCalGas. In October 2022, the CPUC issued a scoping ruling that set a schedule for the proceeding, including the expected issuance of a proposed decision in the second quarter of 2024. SDG E and SoCalGas expect the final decision will be effective retroactive to January 1, 2024. SDG E expects to submit separate requests in its GRC for review and recovery of its wildfire mitigation plan costs in mid-2023 for costs incurred from 2019 through 2022 and in mid-2024 for costs incurred in 2023. 
 CPUC Cost of Capital 
 at the end of the measurement period. The CCM, if triggered, would automatically update the authorized cost of debt based on actual costs and update the authorized ROE upward or downward by one-half of the difference between the CCM benchmark rate and the applicable Moody s utility bond index. Alternatively, each of SDG E and SoCalGas are permitted to file a cost of capital application in an interim year in which an extraordinary or catastrophic event materially impacts its cost of capital and affects utilities differently than the market as a whole to have its cost of capital determined in lieu of the CCM. 
 In December 2019, the CPUC approved the following cost of capital for SDG E and SoCalGas that became effective on January 1, 2020 and remained in effect through December 31, 2022, subject to the CCM.

In August 2021, SDG E filed an application with the CPUC to update its cost of capital for 2022 due to the ongoing effects of the COVID-19 pandemic rather than have the CCM apply. In November 2022, the CPUC issued a final decision that found there was an extraordinary event, the CCM will be suspended for 2022 and SDG E s current authorized cost of capital for 2022 will be preserved. 
 In December 2022, the CPUC approved the following cost of capital for SDG E and SoCalGas that became effective on January 1, 2023 and will remain in effect through December 31, 2025, subject to the CCM. The CPUC will open a second phase of this cost of capital proceeding to evaluate the CCM. For the measurement period that ends on September 30, 2023, SDG E s CCM benchmark rate is based on Moody s Baa- utility bond index and SoCalGas CCM benchmark rate is based on Moody s A- utility bond index. SDG E did not propose a 2023 cost of preferred equity in this proceeding. In January 2023, SDG E filed an advice letter to continue the cost of preferred equity for test year 2023 at , which the CPUC approved in February 2023.

 FERC Rate Matters 
 SDG E files separately with the FERC for its authorized ROE on FERC-regulated electric transmission operations and assets. SDG E s currently effective TO5 settlement provides for a ROE of , consisting of a base ROE of plus an additional bps for participation in the California ISO (the California ISO adder). If the FERC issues an order ruling that California IOUs are no longer eligible for the California ISO adder, SDG E would refund the California ISO adder as of the refund effective date (June 1, 2019) if such a refund is determined to be required by the terms of the TO5 settlement. The TO5 term is effective June 1, 2019 and shall remain in effect until terminated by a notice provided at least six months before the end of the calendar year. Following such notice, SDG E would file an updated rate request with an effective date of January 1 of the following year. 
 SOCALGAS 
 OSCs Energy Efficiency and Advocacy 
 In October 2019, the CPUC issued an OSC to determine whether SoCalGas should be sanctioned for violation of certain CPUC code sections and orders relating to energy efficiency (EE) codes and standards advocacy activities, which were undertaken by SoCalGas following a CPUC decision disallowing SoCalGas future engagement in advocacy around such EE codes and standards. In March 2022, the CPUC issued a final decision that found that SoCalGas did undertake prohibited EE codes and standards advocacy activities using ratepayer funds. The final decision imposed on SoCalGas a financial penalty of million; customer refunds for certain ratepayer expenditures and shareholder incentives that SoCalGas estimates will be negligible; and a prohibition from recovering from ratepayers costs of proposed codes and standards advocacy activities until SoCalGas demonstrates policies, practices and procedures that adhere to the CPUC s intent for codes and standards advocacy. 
 In December 2019, the CPUC issued a second OSC to determine whether SoCalGas is entitled to the EE program s shareholder incentives for codes and standards advocacy activities in 2016 and 2017 (later expanded to include 2014 and 2015), whether its shareholders should bear the costs of those advocacy activities, and to address whether any other remedies are appropriate. In April 2022, the CPUC issued a final decision that found there were violations of certain legal principles and imposed a financial penalty of .

Sempra s maximum exposure to loss is replenishment of the amount withdrawn by Sempra Infrastructure from the SDSRA, or million. We recorded a guarantee liability of million in June 2021, with an associated carrying value of million at December 31, 2022, for the fair value of the promissory note, which is being reduced over the duration of the guarantee through Sempra Infrastructure s investment in Cameron LNG JV. The guarantee will terminate upon full repayment of Cameron LNG JV s debt, scheduled to occur in 2039, or replenishment of the amount withdrawn by Sempra Infrastructure from the SDSRA. 
 Sempra Support Agreement for CFIN 
 In July 2020, CFIN entered into a financing arrangement with Cameron LNG JV s four project owners and received aggregate proceeds of billion from two project owners and from external lenders on behalf of the other two project owners (collectively, the affiliate loans), based on their proportionate ownership interest in Cameron LNG JV. CFIN used the proceeds from the affiliate loans to provide a loan to Cameron LNG JV. The affiliate loans mature in 2039. Principal and interest will be

million share of the proceeds for working capital and other general corporate purposes, including the repayment of indebtedness. 
 Sempra Infrastructure s million proportionate share of the affiliate loans, based on SI Partners ownership interest in Cameron LNG JV, was funded by external lenders comprised of a syndicate of eight banks (the bank debt) to whom Sempra has provided a guarantee pursuant to a Support Agreement under which: 
 Sempra has severally guaranteed repayment of the bank debt plus accrued and unpaid interest if CFIN fails to pay the external lenders; 
 the external lenders may exercise an option to put the bank debt to Sempra Infrastructure upon the occurrence of certain events, including a failure by CFIN to meet its payment obligations under the bank debt; 
 the external lenders will put some or all of the bank debt to Sempra Infrastructure on the fifth, tenth, or fifteenth anniversary date of the affiliate loans, except the portion of the debt owed to any external lender that has elected not to participate in the put option six months prior to the respective anniversary date; 
 Sempra Infrastructure also has a right to call the bank debt back from, or to refinance the bank debt with, the external lenders at any time; and 
 the Support Agreement will terminate upon full repayment of the bank debt, including repayment following an event in which the bank debt is put to Sempra Infrastructure. 
 In exchange for this guarantee, the external lenders will pay a guarantee fee that is based on the credit rating of Sempra s long-term senior unsecured non-credit enhanced debt rating, which guarantee fee Sempra Infrastructure will recognize as interest income as earned. Sempra s maximum exposure to loss is the bank debt plus any accrued and unpaid interest and related fees, subject to a liability cap of of the bank debt, or million. We measure the Support Agreement at fair value, net of related guarantee fees, on a recurring basis (see Note 12). At December 31, 2022, the fair value of the Support Agreement was million, of which million is included in Other Current Assets and million is included in Other Long-Term Assets on Sempra s Consolidated Balance Sheet. 
 ESJ 
 As we discuss in Note 5, in March 2021, Sempra Infrastructure completed the acquisition of the remaining equity interest in ESJ and ESJ became a consolidated subsidiary. Prior to the acquisition date, Sempra Infrastructure owned of ESJ and accounted for its interest as an equity method investment. 
 IMG 
 Sempra Infrastructure has a interest in IMG, a JV with a subsidiary of TC Energy Corporation, and accounts for its interest as an equity method investment. IMG owns and operates the Sur de Texas-Tuxpan natural gas marine pipeline, which is fully contracted under a -year natural gas transportation service contract with the CFE. 
 TAG 
 Sempra Infrastructure has a beneficial ownership interest in TAG, a JV with TETL JV Mexico Norte, S. de R.L. de C.V. and Bravo N Mergeco, S. de R.L. de C.V. that holds a interest in the Los Ramones Norte pipeline. Sempra Infrastructure accounts for its interest in TAG as an equity method investment.

Subject to make-whole provisions 
 First Mortgage Bonds 
 SDG E and SoCalGas issue first mortgage bonds secured by liens on their respective utility plant assets. SDG E and SoCalGas may issue additional first mortgage bonds if in compliance with the provisions of their bond agreements (indentures). These indentures require, among other things, the satisfaction of pro forma earnings-coverage tests on first mortgage bond interest and the availability of sufficient mortgaged property to support the additional bonds, after giving effect to prior bond redemptions. The most restrictive of these tests (the property test) would permit the issuance, subject to CPUC authorization, of additional first mortgage bonds of billion at SDG E and billion at SoCalGas at December 31, 2022. 
 SDG E 
 In March 2022, SDG E issued million aggregate principal amount of first mortgage bonds due in full upon maturity on March 15, 2032 and received proceeds of million (net of debt discount, underwriting discounts and debt issuance costs of million), and million aggregate principal amount of first mortgage bonds due in full upon maturity on March 15, 2052 and received proceeds of million (net of debt discount, underwriting discounts and debt issuance costs of million). Each series of first mortgage bonds is redeemable prior to maturity, subject to its terms, and in certain circumstances subject to make-whole provisions. SDG E used the net proceeds for repayment of commercial paper and its -day term loan and for capital expenditures and other general corporate purposes. 
 SoCalGas 
 In November 2022, SoCalGas issued million aggregate principal amount of green first mortgage bonds due in full upon maturity on November 15, 2052 and received proceeds of million (net of debt discount, underwriting discounts and debt issuance costs of million). The first mortgage bonds are redeemable prior to maturity, subject to their terms, and in certain circumstances subject to make-whole provisions. SoCalGas intends to use the net proceeds to finance or refinance eligible projects that fall into one or more of the following categories: pollution prevention and control, green buildings and clean transportation. 
 Other Long-Term Debt 
 Sempra 
 In March 2022, we issued million aggregate principal amount of senior unsecured notes due in full upon maturity on April 1, 2025 and received proceeds of million (net of debt discount, underwriting discounts and debt issuance costs of million), and million of senior unsecured notes due in full upon maturity on April 1, 2029 and received proceeds of million (net of debt discount, underwriting discounts and debt issuance costs of million). Each series of notes is redeemable prior to maturity, subject to its terms, and in certain circumstances subject to make-whole provisions. We used the net proceeds for general corporate purposes and repayment of commercial paper. 
 SDG E 
 In February 2022, SDG E entered into a million, term loan with a maturity date of February 18, 2024. SDG E borrowed million in the three months ended March 31, 2022 and an additional million in the three months ended June 30, 2022. The borrowings bear interest at benchmark rates plus bps and are due in full upon maturity. The margin is based on SDG E s long-term senior unsecured credit rating. SDG E used the net proceeds for repayment of commercial paper and for general corporate purposes.

SoCalGas used the net proceeds for repayment of commercial paper and general corporate purposes. 
 Sempra Infrastructure 
 SI Partners. In January 2022, SI Partners completed a private offering of million in aggregate principal of senior unsecured notes due in full upon maturity on January 15, 2032 to qualified institutional buyers as defined in Rule 144A under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the Securities Act), and non-U.S. persons outside the U.S. under Regulation S under the Securities Act. The notes are redeemable prior to maturity, subject to their terms, and in certain circumstances subject to make-whole provisions, and holders of the notes have the right to require SI Partners to offer to purchase some or all of the notes at a premium upon the occurrence of specific kinds of change of control events that result in a downgrade of SI Partners credit ratings. Sempra Infrastructure received proceeds of million (net of debt discount, underwriting discounts and debt issuance costs of million). Sempra Infrastructure used the net proceeds for general corporate purposes, including the repayment of certain indebtedness of its subsidiaries. 
 ECA LNG Phase 1. In December 2020, ECA LNG Phase 1 entered into a loan agreement with a syndicate of external lenders for an aggregate principal amount of up to billion. Sempra, IEnova and TotalEnergies SE provided guarantees for repayment of the loans plus accrued and unpaid interest based on their proportionate ownership interest in ECA LNG Phase 1 of , and , respectively. At issuance, borrowings under the loan agreement bore interest at a weighted-average blended rate of plus a benchmark interest rate per annum equal to (a) the LIBOR for such interest period, divided by (b) one minus the Eurodollar Reserve Percentage, provided that in no event shall the benchmark interest rate at any time be less than per annum. In July 2022, ECA LNG Phase 1 replaced Sempra with IEnova as the guarantor and replaced of the external lenders and their combined principal commitment of million (of which million was outstanding and repaid) with a shareholder loan from IEnova, thereby reducing the syndicate to external lenders, increasing the weighted-average blended rate to and reducing the aggregate principal amount of borrowing capacity from external lenders to billion. In December 2022, the loan agreement was amended to change the benchmark interest rate per annum to (a) the Term SOFR based on a tenor comparable to the applicable interest period, plus (b) a margin per annum, for any interest period beginning on or after December 30, 2022. At December 31, 2022 and December 31, 2021, million and million, respectively, of borrowings from external lenders were outstanding under the loan agreement, with a weighted-average interest rate of and , respectively. 
 IEnova Pipelines. In September 2022, Sempra Infrastructure used proceeds from borrowings against IEnova s committed and uncommitted lines of credit to fully repay million of outstanding principal plus accrued and unpaid interest on the IEnova Pipelines variable-rate loans prior to scheduled maturity dates through 2026, and recognized approximately million million after tax and NCI) in charges associated with the write-off of acquisition-related fair value adjustments offset by a hedge termination benefit.

 For SDG E and SoCalGas, the CPUC requires flow-through rate-making treatment for the current income tax benefit or expense arising from certain property-related and other temporary differences between the treatment for financial reporting and income tax, which will reverse over time. Under the regulatory accounting treatment required for these flow-through temporary differences, deferred income tax assets and liabilities are not recorded to deferred income tax expense, but rather to a regulatory asset or liability, which impacts the ETR. As a result, changes in the relative size of these items compared to pretax income, from period to period, can cause variations in the ETR. The following items are subject to flow-through treatment: 
 repairs expenditures related to a certain portion of utility plant fixed assets 
 the equity portion of AFUDC, which is non-taxable 
 a portion of the cost of removal of utility plant assets 
 utility self-developed software expenditures 
 depreciation on a certain portion of utility plant assets

 The AFUDC related to equity recorded for regulated construction projects at Sempra Infrastructure has similar flow-through treatment.

 Sempra is subject to U.S. federal income tax as well as income tax of multiple state and non-U.S. jurisdictions. We remain subject to examination for U.S. federal tax years after 2018. We are subject to examination by major state tax jurisdictions for tax years after 2012. Certain major non-U.S. income tax returns for tax years 2013 through the present are open to examination. 
 SDG E and SoCalGas are subject to U.S. federal income tax and state income tax. They remain subject to examination for U.S. federal tax years after 2018 and state tax years after 2012. 
 In addition, Sempra has filed protests to contest proposed state audit adjustments for tax years 2009 through 2012. The pre-2013 tax years for our major state tax jurisdictions are closed to new issues; therefore, no additional tax may be assessed by the taxing authorities for these tax years.

 years from the date of grant. Unvested option awards are subject to forfeiture following a termination of employment, except where the retirement criteria under such awards have been met and subject to certain other exceptions described below. 
 Performance-Based Restricted Stock Units : These RSU awards generally vest in Sempra common stock at the end of three -year performance periods based on Sempra s total return to shareholders relative to that of specified market indices or based on the compound annual growth rate of Sempra s EPS. The comparative market indices for the awards that vest based on total return to shareholders are the S P 500 Utilities Index (excluding water companies) and the S P 500 Index. We use long-term analyst consensus growth estimates for S P 500 Utilities Index peer companies (excluding water companies) to develop our targets for awards that vest based on EPS growth. These RSU awards are subject to forfeiture prior to vesting following a termination of employment, except where the retirement criteria under such awards have been met and subject to certain other exceptions described below. 
 If Sempra s total return to shareholders or EPS growth is below the target levels but above threshold performance levels, shares are subject to partial vesting on a pro rata basis. If Sempra s total return to shareholders or EPS growth exceeds target levels, up to an additional of the granted RSUs may be issued. 
 For certain awards granted in 2018 that vest based on Sempra s total return to shareholders, a modifier adds to the award s payout (as initially calculated based on total return to shareholders relative to that of specified market indices) for total shareholder return performance in the top quartile relative to historical benchmark data for Sempra and reduces the award s payout by for performance in the bottom quartile. However, in no event will more than an additional of the granted RSUs be issued. If performance falls within the second or third quartiles, the modifier is not triggered, and the payout is based solely on total return to shareholders relative to that of specified market indices. 
 Service-Based Restricted Stock Units: RSUs may also be service-based; these generally vest ratably over three -year service periods (for awards granted after 2018), or at the end of three -year service periods (for awards granted during 2018). These awards are subject to earlier forfeiture upon termination of employment, subject to certain exceptions described below. 
 For awards that would otherwise be forfeited upon termination of employment, the Compensation and Talent Development Committee of Sempra s board of directors may waive the forfeiture requirement and, with respect to options and service-based RSUs, may accelerate vesting. Awards are also subject to accelerated vesting under certain circumstances upon a change in control under the applicable LTIP, in accordance with severance pay agreements or to the extent otherwise required by the terms of the applicable award. Dividend equivalents on shares subject to RSUs are reinvested to purchase additional common shares that become subject to the same vesting conditions as the RSUs to which the dividends relate.

The contingent interest rate swap has a tenor, and its settlement is conditional upon the closing of project-level debt financing with respect to the proposed PA LNG Phase 1 project. We may elect to (i) cash settle the contingent interest rate swap five days after reaching the closing of project-level debt financing, or (ii) terminate the contingent interest rate swap and enter into new long-term interest rate swaps that are adjusted for the termination value of the contingent interest rate swap.

SoCalGas expects that million of losses, net of income tax benefit, that are currently recorded in AOCI related to cash flow hedges will be reclassified into earnings during the next 12 months as the hedged items affect earnings. Actual amounts ultimately reclassified into earnings depend on the interest rates in effect when derivative contracts mature.

SDG E did not have this group of derivative instruments in a liability position at December 31, 2022 or 2021. At December 31, 2022, if the credit ratings of Sempra or SoCalGas were reduced below investment grade, million and million, respectively, of additional assets could be required to be posted as collateral for these derivative contracts. 
 For Sempra, SDG E and SoCalGas, some of our derivative contracts contain a provision that would permit the counterparty, in certain circumstances, to request adequate assurance of our performance under the contracts. Such additional assurance, if needed, is not material and is not included in the amounts above.

 A significant increase (decrease) in market electricity forward prices would result in a significantly higher (lower) fair value. We summarize long-term, fixed-price electricity position volumes in Note 11. 
 Realized gains and losses associated with CRRs and long-term, fixed-price electricity positions, which are recoverable in rates, are recorded in Cost of Electric Fuel and Purchased Power on the Consolidated Statements of Operations. Because unrealized gains and losses are recorded as regulatory assets and liabilities, they do not affect earnings.

 The fair value of the Support Agreement, net of related guarantee fees, is based on a discounted cash flow model using a probability of default and survival methodology. Our estimate of fair value considers inputs such as third-party default rates, credit ratings, recovery rates, and risk-adjusted discount rates, which may be readily observable, market corroborated or generally unobservable inputs. Because CFIN s credit rating and related default and survival rates are unobservable inputs that are significant to the valuation, the Support Agreement, net of related guarantee fees, is classified as Level 3. We assigned CFIN an internally developed credit rating of A3 and relied on default rate data published by Moody s to assign a probability of default. A hypothetical change in the credit rating up or down one notch could result in a significant change in the fair value of the Support Agreement.

 million and million shares of preferred stock, respectively. At December 31, 2022 and 2021, SDG E had preferred stock outstanding. The rights, preferences, privileges and restrictions for any new series of preferred stock would be established by each company s board of directors at the time of issuance. We discuss SoCalGas preferred stock below. 
 SEMPRA MANDATORY CONVERTIBLE PREFERRED STOCK 
 On January 15, 2021, we converted shares of series A preferred stock into shares of our common stock based on a conversion rate of shares of our common stock for each issued and outstanding share of series A preferred stock. As a consequence, no shares of series A preferred stock were outstanding after January 15, 2021 and the shares that were formerly series A preferred stock have returned to the status of authorized and unissued shares of preferred stock.

shares of series B preferred stock into an aggregate of shares of our common stock and a nominal amount of cash in lieu of fractional share interests, based on a conversion rate of shares of our common stock for each issued and outstanding share of series B preferred stock. As a consequence, no shares of series B preferred stock were outstanding after July 15, 2021 and the shares that were formerly series B preferred stock have returned to the status of authorized and unissued shares of preferred stock. 
 SEMPRA SERIES C PREFERRED STOCK 
 At December 31, 2022 and 2021, Sempra had shares of fixed-rate reset cumulative redeemable perpetual preferred stock, series C (series C preferred stock) outstanding. 
 Liquidation Preference 
 Each share of series C preferred stock has a liquidation preference of plus any accumulated and unpaid dividends (whether or not declared) on such share. 
 Redemption at the Option of Sempra 
 The shares of series C preferred stock are perpetual and have no maturity date. However, we may, at our option, redeem the series C preferred stock in whole or in part, from time to time, on any day during the period from and including the July 15 immediately preceding October 15, 2025 and October 15 of every fifth year after 2025 through and including such October 15 at a redemption price in cash equal to per share. Additionally, in the event that a credit rating agency then publishing a rating for us makes certain amendments, clarifications or changes to the criteria it uses to assign equity credit to securities such as the series C preferred stock (Ratings Event), we may redeem the series C preferred stock, in whole but not in part, at any time within 120 days after the conclusion of any review or appeal process instituted by us following the occurrence of the Ratings Event or, if no such review or appeal process is available or sought, the occurrence of such Ratings Event, at a redemption price in cash equal to per share of the liquidation preference per share). 
 Dividends 
 Dividends on the series C preferred stock, when, as and if declared by our board of directors or an authorized committee thereof, are payable in cash, on a cumulative basis, semi-annually in arrears. Dividends on the series C preferred stock will be cumulative whether or not: 
 we have earnings; 
 the payment of such dividends is then permitted under California law; 
 such dividends are authorized or declared; and 
 any agreements to which we are a party prohibit the current payment of dividends, including any agreement relating to our indebtedness. 
 We accrue dividends on the series C preferred stock on a monthly basis. The dividend rate from and including June 19, 2020 to, but excluding, October 15, 2025 is per annum of the liquidation preference per share. The dividend rate will reset on October 15, 2025 and on October 15 of every fifth year after 2025 and, for each five-year period following such reset dates, will be a per annum rate equal to the Five-year U.S. Treasury Rate (as defined in the certificate of determination of preferences of the series C preferred stock) as of the second business day prior to such reset date, plus a spread of , of the liquidation preference per share. 
 Voting Rights 
 The holders of series C preferred stock do not have any voting rights, except with respect to any authorization, creation or increase in the authorized amount of any class or series of capital stock ranking senior to the series C preferred stock, certain amendments to the terms of the series C preferred stock, in certain other limited circumstances and as otherwise specifically required by California law. In addition, whenever dividends on any shares of series C preferred stock have not been declared and paid or have been declared but not paid for three or more dividend periods, whether or not consecutive, the authorized number of directors on our board of directors will automatically be increased by two and the holders of the series C preferred stock, voting together as a single class with holders of any and all other outstanding series of preferred stock of equal rank having similar voting rights, will be entitled to elect two directors who satisfy certain requirements to fill such two newly created directorships. This voting right will terminate when all accumulated and unpaid dividends on the series C preferred stock have been paid in full and, upon such termination and the termination of the same voting rights of all other holders of outstanding series of preferred

 ownership interest in SONGS, a nuclear generating facility near San Clemente, California, which permanently ceased operations in June 2013 after an extended outage as a result of issues with the steam generators used in the facility. Edison, the majority owner and operator of SONGS, notified SDG E that it had reached a decision to permanently retire SONGS and seek approval from the NRC to start the decommissioning activities for the entire facility. SONGS is subject to the jurisdiction of the NRC and the CPUC. 
 SDG E, and each of the other owners, holds its undivided interest as a tenant in common in the property. Each owner is responsible for financing its share of costs. SDG E s share of operating expenses is included in Sempra s and SDG E s Consolidated Statements of Operations. 
 NUCLEAR DECOMMISSIONING AND FUNDING 
 As a result of Edison s decision to permanently retire SONGS Units 2 and 3, Edison began the decommissioning phase of the plant. Major decommissioning work began in 2020. We expect the majority of the decommissioning work to take approximately years. Decommissioning of Unit 1, removed from service in 1992, is largely complete. The remaining work for Unit 1 will be completed once Units 2 and 3 are dismantled and the spent fuel is removed from the site. The spent fuel is currently being stored on-site, until the DOE identifies a spent fuel storage facility and puts in place a program for the fuel s disposal, as we discuss below. SDG E is responsible for approximately of the total decommissioning cost. 
 The Samuel Lawrence Foundation filed a writ petition under the California Coastal Act in LA Superior Court in December 2019 seeking to invalidate the coastal development permit and to obtain injunctive relief to stop decommissioning work. The petition was denied in September 2021. In December 2021, the Samuel Lawrence Foundation filed a notice of appeal. In August 2022, the court dismissed the case based on the Samuel Lawrence Foundation s request for dismissal, which finally resolves the writ petition. Decommissioning work was not interrupted as a result of this writ petition. 
 In accordance with state and federal requirements and regulations, SDG E has assets held in the NDT to fund its share of decommissioning costs for SONGS Units 1, 2 and 3. Amounts that were collected in rates for SONGS decommissioning are invested in the NDT, which is comprised of externally managed trust funds. Amounts held by the NDT are invested in accordance

million for forecasted 2023 costs. 
 In September 2020, the IRS and the U.S. Department of the Treasury published final regulations that clarify the definition of nuclear decommissioning costs, which are costs that may be paid for or reimbursed from a qualified trust fund. The final regulations adopted most of the provisions of the proposed regulations issued in December 2016. The final regulations apply to taxable years ending on or after September 4, 2020 and confirm that the definition of nuclear decommissioning costs includes amounts related to the storage of spent nuclear fuel at both on-site and off-site ISFSIs. 
 The final regulations also clarify that costs incurred for ISFSIs that may be or are expected to be reimbursed by the DOE may be paid or reimbursed from a qualified trust fund. Accordingly, the final regulations allow SDG E the option to access qualified trust funds to recover spent fuel storage costs before Edison reaches final settlement with the DOE regarding the DOE s reimbursement of these costs. Historically, the DOE s reimbursements of spent fuel storage costs have not resulted in timely or complete recovery of these costs. We discuss the DOE s responsibility for spent nuclear fuel below.

 ASSET RETIREMENT OBLIGATION 
 The present value of SDG E s ARO related to decommissioning costs for all three SONGS units was million at December 31, 2022 and is based on a cost study prepared in 2020 that is pending CPUC approval, which SDG E expects to receive in 2023. The ARO for Units 2 and 3 reflects the acceleration of the start of decommissioning of these units as a result of the early closure of the plant. We expect SDG E s undiscounted SONGS decommissioning payments to be million in 2023, million in 2024, million in 2025, million in 2026, million in 2027, and million thereafter. 
 U.S. DEPARTMENT OF ENERGY NUCLEAR FUEL DISPOSAL 
 Spent nuclear fuel from SONGS is currently stored on-site in an ISFSI licensed by the NRC. The ISFSI will operate until 2051, when it is assumed that the DOE will have taken custody of all the SONGS spent fuel. The ISFSI would then be decommissioned, and the site restored to its original environmental state. Until then, SONGS owners are responsible for interim storage of spent nuclear fuel at SONGS. 
 The Nuclear Waste Policy Act of 1982 made the DOE responsible for accepting, transporting, and disposing of spent nuclear fuel. However, it is uncertain when the DOE will begin accepting spent nuclear fuel from SONGS. This delay will lead to increased costs for spent fuel storage. In November 2019, Edison filed a claim for spent fuel management costs in the U.S. Court of Federal Claims for the time period from January 2017 through July 2018, which is pending DOE approval. It is unclear when Edison will pursue litigation claims for spent fuel management costs incurred on or after August 1, 2018. SDG E will continue to support Edison in its pursuit of claims on behalf of the SONGS co-owners against the DOE for its failure to timely accept the spent nuclear fuel. 
 NUCLEAR INSURANCE 
 SDG E and the other owners of SONGS have insurance to cover claims from nuclear liability incidents arising at SONGS. Currently, this insurance provides million in coverage limits, the maximum amount available, including coverage for acts of terrorism. In addition, the Price-Anderson Act provides an additional million of coverage. If a nuclear liability loss occurs at SONGS and exceeds the million insurance limit, this additional coverage would be available to provide a total of million in coverage limits per incident. 
 The SONGS owners have nuclear property damage insurance of million, which exceeds the minimum federal requirement of million. This insurance coverage is provided through NEIL. The NEIL policies have specific exclusions and limitations that can result in reduced coverage. Insured members as a group are subject to retrospective premium assessments to cover losses sustained by NEIL under all issued policies. SDG E could be assessed up to million of retrospective premiums based on overall member claims. 
 The nuclear property insurance program includes an industry aggregate loss limit for non-certified acts of terrorism (as defined by the Terrorism Risk Insurance Act) of billion. This is the maximum amount that will be paid to insured members who suffer losses or damages from these non-certified terrorist acts.

NOTE 16. 
 At December 31, 2022, loss contingency accruals for legal matters, including associated legal fees and regulatory matters related to the Leak, that are probable and estimable were million for Sempra, including million for SoCalGas. Amounts for Sempra and SoCalGas include million for matters related to the Leak, which we discuss below. We discuss our policy regarding accrual of legal fees in Note 1. 
 
 SoCalGas 
 Aliso Canyon Natural Gas Storage Facility Gas Leak 
 From October 23, 2015 through February 11, 2016, SoCalGas experienced a natural gas leak from one of the injection-and-withdrawal wells, SS25, at its Aliso Canyon natural gas storage facility in Los Angeles County. 
 Litigation Resolved. In September 2021, SoCalGas and Sempra entered into an agreement with counsel to resolve approximately lawsuits including approximately plaintiffs (the Individual Plaintiffs) pending against SoCalGas and Sempra related to the Leak (the Individual Plaintiff Litigation) for a payment of up to billion. 
 These cases were coordinated before a single court in the LA Superior Court for pretrial management under a Third Amended Consolidated Master Case Complaint for Individual Actions filed in November 2017. The consolidated complaint asserts causes of action for negligence, negligence per se, private and public nuisance (continuing and permanent), trespass, inverse condemnation, strict liability, negligent and intentional infliction of emotional distress, fraudulent concealment, loss of consortium and wrongful death against SoCalGas and Sempra (the Individual Plaintiff Litigation). The complaint also asserted violations of Proposition 65, which were resolved in January 2022. The consolidated complaint seeks compensatory and punitive damages for personal injuries, lost wages and/or lost profits, property damage and diminution in property value, injunctive relief, costs of future medical monitoring, civil penalties, and attorneys fees. 
 The agreement governing the settlement of the Individual Plaintiff Litigation requires each plaintiff who agrees to participate in the settlement to release all such plaintiff s claims against SoCalGas, Sempra and their respective affiliates related to the Leak and the Individual Plaintiff Litigation. The Individual Plaintiffs who do not participate in the settlement (the Remaining Individual Plaintiffs) will be able to continue to pursue their claims. Over of the Individual Plaintiffs agreed to participate and submitted valid releases, and SoCalGas paid billion in 2022 under the agreement. As of February 21, 2023, approximately of the Remaining Individual Plaintiffs had not been located or had failed to respond, according to plaintiffs counsel. 
 In September 2021, SoCalGas and Sempra entered into an agreement to settle a class action on behalf of persons and businesses who owned or leased real property within a five-mile radius of the well where the Leak occurred for a total amount of million. In April 2022, the LA Superior Court gave final approval of the settlement. 
 In October 2018 and October 2020, complaints on behalf of five property developers (the Developer Plaintiffs) were filed against SoCalGas and Sempra in connection with the Leak. The complaints alleged causes of action for strict liability, negligence per se, negligence, negligent interference, continuing nuisance, permanent nuisance, inverse condemnation and violation of the California Unfair Competition Law and California Public Utilities Code section 2106, and sought compensatory, statutory and punitive damages, injunctive relief and attorneys fees. In 2022, SoCalGas and Sempra settled the claims of all of the Developer Plaintiffs and their claims were dismissed. 
 Litigation Unresolved. shareholder derivative actions were filed alleging breach of fiduciary duties against certain officers and certain directors of Sempra and/or SoCalGas. of the shareholder derivative actions that were filed alleging breach of fiduciary duties against certain officers and certain directors of Sempra and/or SoCalGas were joined in an Amended Consolidated Shareholder Derivative Complaint filed in the coordinated proceeding in the LA Superior Court, which was

dismissed with prejudice in January 2021. The plaintiffs have appealed this dismissal. The LA Superior Court dismissed the remaining fourth action with prejudice in November 2022. The plaintiffs have appealed this dismissal. 
 In addition, the Remaining Individual Plaintiffs referred to above will be able to continue to pursue their claims. Also, as of February 21, 2023, new lawsuits on behalf of approximately plaintiffs were filed since the September 2021 settlement. 
 Regulatory Proceedings Subject to Agreements to Resolve. In June 2019, the CPUC opened an OII (the Leak OII) to investigate and consider, among other things, whether SoCalGas should be sanctioned for the Leak and what damages, fines or other penalties, if any, should be imposed for any violations, unreasonable or imprudent practices or failure to cooperate sufficiently with SED, as well as to determine the amount of various costs incurred by SoCalGas and other parties in connection with the Leak and the ratemaking treatment or other disposition of such costs, which could result in little or no recovery of such costs by SoCalGas. In October 2022, SoCalGas executed a settlement agreement with SED and the Public Advocates Office at the CPUC to resolve all aspects of the Leak OII. The settlement agreement provides for financial penalties, certain costs that SoCalGas will reimburse, a violation of California Public Utilities Code section 451, and costs previously incurred by SoCalGas for which it will not seek recovery from ratepayers, among other provisions. The settlement agreement was filed with and is subject to approval by the CPUC. 
 Regulatory Proceedings Unresolved. In February 2017, the CPUC opened a proceeding pursuant to the SB 380 OII to determine the feasibility of minimizing or eliminating the use of the Aliso Canyon natural gas storage facility while still maintaining energy and electric reliability for the region, but excluding issues with respect to air quality, public health, causation, culpability or cost responsibility regarding the Leak. The first phase of the proceeding established a framework for the hydraulic, production cost and economic modeling assumptions for the potential reduction in usage or elimination of the Aliso Canyon natural gas storage facility, as well as evaluating the impacts of reducing or eliminating the Aliso Canyon natural gas storage facility using the established framework and models. The next phase of the proceeding included engaging a consultant to analyze alternative means for meeting or avoiding the demand for the facility s services if it were eliminated in either the 2027 or 2035 timeframe, and to address potential implementation of alternatives to the Aliso Canyon natural gas storage facility if the CPUC determines that the Aliso Canyon natural gas storage facility should be permanently closed. The CPUC also added all California IOUs as parties to the proceeding and encouraged all load serving entities in the Los Angeles Basin to join the proceeding. 
 In November 2021, the CPUC issued a decision on the interim range of gas inventory levels at the Aliso Canyon natural gas storage facility, setting an interim range of gas inventory levels of up to 41.16 Bcf. The CPUC may issue future changes to this interim range of authorized gas inventory levels before issuing a final inventory determination within the SB 380 OII proceeding. 
 At December 31, 2022, the Aliso Canyon natural gas storage facility had a net book value of million. If the Aliso Canyon natural gas storage facility were to be permanently closed or if future cash flows from its operation were otherwise insufficient to recover its carrying value, we may record an impairment of the facility, which could be material, or we could incur materially higher than expected operating costs and/or be required to make material additional capital expenditures (any or all of which may not be recoverable in rates), and natural gas reliability and electric generation could be jeopardized. 
 Cost Estimate, Insurance and Accounting and Other Impacts. SoCalGas has incurred significant costs related to the Leak, primarily to defend against and settle civil and criminal litigation and regulatory proceedings arising from the Leak; for temporary relocation of community residents; to control the well and stop the Leak; to mitigate the natural gas released; to purchase natural gas to replace what was lost through the Leak; to pay the costs of the government-ordered response to the Leak, including the costs for a root cause analysis; to respond to various government and agency investigations regarding the Leak; and to comply with increased regulation imposed as a result of the Leak. At December 31, 2022, SoCalGas estimates these costs related to the Leak are million (the cost estimate), including million of costs recovered from insurance. Other than insurance for directors and officers liability, we have exhausted all of our insurance for this matter. We continue to pursue other sources of insurance coverage for costs related to this matter, but we may not be successful in obtaining additional insurance recovery for any of these costs. At December 31, 2022, million of the cost estimate is accrued in Reserve for Aliso Canyon Costs and million of the cost estimate is accrued in Deferred Credits and Other on SoCalGas and Sempra s Consolidated Balance Sheets. 
 SoCalGas recorded total charges of million million after tax), billion billion after tax) and million million after tax) in the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively, in Aliso Canyon Litigation and Regulatory Matters on the SoCalGas and Sempra Consolidated Statements of Operations related to the litigation and regulatory proceedings that we describe above. These charges are included in the cost estimate. 
 Except for the amounts paid or estimated to settle certain legal and regulatory matters as described above, the cost estimate does not include any amounts necessary to resolve the matters that we describe above in Litigation Unresolved and Regulatory Proceedings Unresolved, threatened litigation, other potential litigation or other costs, in each case to the extent it is not possible to predict at this time the outcome of these actions or reasonably estimate the possible costs or a range of possible costs.

In October 2020, the High Court of Justice assessed costs and interest to be approximately million (approximately million in U.S. dollars at December 31, 2022) as of that date, with interest continuing to accrue. The Defendants appealed and, in May 2021, the Court of Appeal set aside the High Court of Justice s decision and ordered a retrial. In July 2022, the Supreme Court of the U.K. denied the Liquidating Companies application for permission to appeal the Court of Appeal s decision. No date has been scheduled for the retrial. J.P. Morgan Chase Co., which acquired RBS SEE and later sold it to Mercuria Energy Group, Ltd., previously notified us that Mercuria Energy Group, Ltd. has sought indemnity for the claim, and J.P. Morgan Chase Co. has in turn sought indemnity from Sempra and RBS. 
 We recorded million in equity losses from our investment in RBS Sempra Commodities in Equity Earnings on Sempra s Consolidated Statement of Operations in 2020, which represented an estimate of our obligations to settle pending VAT matters and related legal costs. In 2021, we reduced this estimate by million based on a related settlement with HMRC on the First-Tier Tribunal case and revised assumptions on the High Court of Justice case.

 Certain EFH subsidiaries that we acquired as part of the merger of EFH with an indirect subsidiary of Sempra were defendants in personal injury lawsuits brought in state courts throughout the U.S. These cases alleged illness or death as a result of exposure to asbestos in power plants designed and/or built by companies whose assets were purchased by predecessor entities to the EFH subsidiaries, and generally assert claims for product defects, negligence, strict liability and wrongful death. They sought compensatory and punitive damages. As of February 21, 2023, lawsuits are pending. Additionally, in connection with a December 2015 deadline in the EFH bankruptcy proceeding, approximately proofs of claim were filed on behalf of persons who allege exposure to asbestos under similar circumstances and assert the right to file such lawsuits in the future. None of these claims or lawsuits were discharged in the EFH bankruptcy proceeding. The costs to defend or resolve these lawsuits or claims and the amount of damages that may be imposed or incurred could have a material adverse effect on Sempra s results of operations, financial condition, cash flows and/or prospects. 
 Ordinary Course Litigation 
 We are also defendants in ordinary routine litigation incidental to our businesses, including personal injury, employment litigation, product liability, property damage and other claims. Juries have demonstrated an increasing willingness to grant large awards, including punitive damages, in these types of cases.

Lessee Accounting 
 We have operating and finance leases for real and personal property (including office space, land, fleet vehicles, machinery and equipment, warehouses and other operational facilities) and PPAs with renewable energy, energy storage and peaker plant facilities. 
 Some of our leases include options to extend the lease terms for up to years, or to terminate the lease within . Our lease liabilities and ROU assets are based on lease terms that may include such options when it is reasonably certain that we will exercise the option. 
 
 Certain of our leases contain escalation clauses requiring annual increases in rent ranging from to or based on the Consumer Price Index. The rentals payable under these leases may increase by a fixed amount each year or by a percentage of a base year. Variable lease payments that are based on an index or rate are included in the initial measurement of our lease liability and ROU asset based on the index or rate at lease commencement and are not remeasured because of changes to the index or rate. Rather, changes to the index or rate are treated as variable lease payments and recognized in the period in which the obligation for those payments is incurred. 
 Similarly, PPAs for the purchase of renewable energy at SDG E require lease payments based on a stated rate per MWh produced by the facilities, and we are required to purchase substantially all the output from the facilities. SDG E is required to pay additional amounts for capacity charges and actual purchases of energy that exceed the minimum energy commitments. Under these contracts, we do not recognize a lease liability or ROU asset for leases for which there are no fixed lease payments. Rather, these variable lease payments are recognized separately as variable lease costs. SDG E estimates these variable lease payments to be million in each of 2023 and 2024, million in 2025, million in 2026, million in 2027 and million thereafter.

 Leases That Have Not Yet Commenced 
 SDG E has entered into two energy storage tolling agreements, of which SDG E expects one will commence in the first quarter of 2023 and one will commence in the third quarter of 2023. SDG E expects the future minimum lease payments to be million in 2023, million in each of 2024 through 2027 and million thereafter until expiration in 2033. 
 SoCalGas has entered into a fleet vehicle agreement, under which SoCalGas expects leases will commence in the first quarter of 2023 through the fourth quarter of 2023. SoCalGas expects the future minimum lease payments to be million in 2023, million in each of 2024 through 2027 and million thereafter until expiration in 2031. 
 Lessor Accounting 
 Sempra Infrastructure is a lessor for certain of its natural gas and ethane pipelines, compressor stations, LPG storage facilities, a rail facility and refined products terminals, which we account for as operating or sales-type leases. These leases expire at various dates from 2026 through 2042. 
 Over the lease term, we monitor the underlying assets in operating leases for impairment, and we evaluate the net investment in sales-type leases for expected credit losses. Sempra Infrastructure expects to continue to derive value from the underlying assets associated with its pipelines following the end of their respective lease terms based on the expected remaining useful life, expected market conditions and plans to re-market and re-contract the underlying assets. 
 
 In July 2021, a rail facility agreement commenced, which Sempra Infrastructure is accounting for as a sales-type lease. The rail facility is being used by the lessee to transport refined products out of the Veracruz terminal. The lessee has the right to direct the use of the rail facility and will obtain substantially all of the economic benefits of the rail facility. At lease commencement, Sempra Infrastructure derecognized the million carrying value of the rail facility from PP E and recognized a net investment in sales-type lease asset of million and a selling profit of million. The agreement expires in 2041 and will automatically renew for successive five-year terms unless written notice is provided by Sempra Infrastructure or the lessee. Fixed lease payments are payable in the first five years of the agreement, which the lessee is required to pay even in the event of lease termination.

 LNG Purchase Agreement 
 Sempra Infrastructure has an SPA for the supply of LNG to the ECA Regas Facility. The commitment amount is calculated using a predetermined formula based on estimated forward prices of the index applicable from 2023 to 2029. Although this agreement specifies a number of cargoes to be delivered, under its terms, the supplier may divert certain cargoes, which would reduce amounts paid under the agreement by Sempra Infrastructure.

 Payments on these contracts represent capacity charges and minimum energy and transmission purchases that exceed the minimum commitment. SDG E is required to pay additional amounts for actual purchases of energy that exceed the minimum energy commitments. SDG E estimates these variable payments to be million in each of 2023 through 2027 and million thereafter. Total payments under purchased-power contracts for Sempra and SDG E were million in 2022, million in 2021 and million in 2020. 
 Construction and Development Projects 
 Sempra has various capital projects in progress in the U.S. and Mexico. Our total contractual commitments at December 31, 2022 under these projects are approximately million, requiring future payments of million in 2023, million in 2024, million in 2025, million in 2026, million in 2027 and million thereafter. The following is a summary by segment of contractual commitments and contingencies related to such projects. 
 SDG E 
 At December 31, 2022, SDG E has commitments to make future payments of million for construction projects that include: 
 million related to spent fuel management at SONGS; and 
 million for infrastructure improvements for electric transmission and distribution systems. 
 SDG E expects future payments under these contractual commitments to be million in 2023, million in each of 2024 through 2026, million in 2027 and million thereafter. 
 SoCalGas 
 At December 31, 2022, SoCalGas has commitments to make future payments of million for an information technology software project. SoCalGas expects future payments under this contractual commitment to be million in each of 2023 and 2024 and million in each of 2025 and 2026. 
 Sempra Infrastructure 
 At December 31, 2022, Sempra Infrastructure has commitments to make future payments of million for construction and development projects that include: 
 million for refined products terminals; 
 million for natural gas pipelines and ongoing maintenance services; and 
 million for renewables and other projects. 
 Sempra Infrastructure expects future payments under these contractual commitments to be million in 2023, million in 2024, million in each of 2025 through 2027 and million thereafter.

million per year in 2023 through 2027 and million thereafter, subject to escalation of per year, ending in 2069. At December 31, 2022, the present value of these future payments of million has been recorded as a regulatory asset as the amounts represent a cost that we expect will be recovered from customers in the future. 
 Franchise Agreements 
 In July 2021, SDG E s natural gas and electric franchise agreements for the City of San Diego went into effect. These franchise agreements provide SDG E the opportunity to serve the City of San Diego for a period of 20 years, consisting of 10-year agreements that will automatically renew for an additional 10 years unless the City Council voids the automatic renewals with a supermajority vote. At December 31, 2022, SDG E has commitments to make future principal and interest payments as consideration for the franchise agreements of million in 2023, million in each of 2024 and 2025, million in 2026, million in 2027 and million thereafter. The consideration paid will not be recovered from customers and will be amortized over 20 years. 
 In 2021, two lawsuits were filed in the California Superior Court challenging various aspects of the natural gas and electric franchise agreements granted by the City of San Diego to SDG E. Both lawsuits ultimately sought to void the franchise agreements. In one of the cases, judgment was granted in favor of SDG E and the City of San Diego. A final ruling is pending on the second case. 
 SoCalGas 
 In May 2022, SoCalGas new gas franchise agreement with the City of Los Angeles (City of LA) went into effect. This franchise agreement provides SoCalGas a gas system franchise to install, retain, operate and maintain its gas system within the City of LA for 21 years, consisting of a 13-year term that will automatically renew for an additional eight years unless the City of LA exercises its option to terminate the renewal term. At December 31, 2022, SoCalGas has one remaining future payment obligation of million to be paid within 30 days of commencement of the eight-year renewal term in 2035 (if the renewal term is not terminated by the City of LA). This future payment obligation would not be recovered from customers and would be amortized over eight years. 
 Sempra Infrastructure 
 Additional consideration for a 2006 comprehensive legal settlement with California to resolve the Continental Forge litigation included an agreement that, for a period of years beginning in 2011, Sempra Infrastructure would sell to SDG E and SoCalGas, subject to annual CPUC approval, up to MMcf per day of regasified LNG from Sempra Infrastructure s ECA Regas Facility that is not delivered or sold in Mexico at the price indexed to the California border minus per MMBtu. There are no specified minimums required, and to date, Sempra Infrastructure has not been required to deliver any natural gas pursuant to this agreement.

However, because the rights of the series C preferred stock in many cases impact the rights of our common stock, we have included the material terms of the series C preferred stock in this description. In this exhibit, we use the term preferred stock to describe our series C preferred stock or the class of preferred stock generally, as the context requires. 
 DESCRIPTION OF CAPITAL STOCK 
 The following description of our capital stock is a summary and does not purport to be complete. It is subject to and qualified in its entirety by reference to our amended and restated articles of incorporation (as they may be amended from time to time and including any Certificate of Determination of Preferences that has been filed and is then in effect, the Articles of Incorporation and bylaws (as they may be amended from time to time, the Bylaws ), each of which is an exhibit to the Annual Report on Form 10-K with which this Exhibit 4.2 is filed or incorporated by reference, as well as applicable provisions of California law. We encourage you to read our Articles of Incorporation and Bylaws and applicable provisions of California law for additional information. Our Articles of Incorporation were most recently amended and restated effective May 23, 2008, and our Bylaws were most recently amended on April 14, 2020. 
 The total number of shares of all classes of capital stock that Sempra is authorized to issue is 800,000,000, of which 750,000,000 are shares of common stock and 50,000,000 are shares of preferred stock. Shares of preferred stock may be issued from time to time in one or more series as determined by the Board of Directors. Of such preferred stock, at December 31, 2022, 17,250,000 shares were designated as 6 Mandatory Convertible Preferred Stock, Series A, no par value, none of which were outstanding or registered under Section 12 of the Exchange Act, 5,750,000 shares were designated as 6.75 Mandatory Convertible Preferred Stock, Series B, no par value, none of which were outstanding or registered under Section 12 of the Exchange Act, and 900,000 shares were designated as series C preferred stock. No other classes of capital stock are authorized under our Articles of Incorporation. 
 Common Stock 
 Dividend Rights 
 The holders of our common stock are entitled to receive, ratably, such dividends as the Board of Directors may from time to time declare, subject to any rights of holders of outstanding shares of any series of our preferred stock to receive dividends before dividends may be paid on our common stock. 
 Liquidation Rights 
 In the event of any liquidation, dissolution or winding up of Sempra, whether voluntary or involuntary, the holders of shares of our common stock are entitled, subject to any rights of the holders of outstanding shares of any series of our preferred stock to 
 1 

receive distributions in such event before any distributions are made to holders of our common stock, to receive, ratably, any of our remaining assets after the discharge of our liabilities. 
 Voting Rights 
 Except as otherwise provided by law, each holder of our common stock is entitled to one vote per share on each matter submitted to a vote of our shareholders, subject to the voting rights, if any, of holders of outstanding shares of any series of our preferred stock, which could include the right to vote separately as a class or series, or the right to vote together with the common stock as a single class. 
 At each annual meeting of our shareholders, directors will be elected to hold office until the next annual meeting of shareholders and until their successors have been elected and qualified or until their earlier resignation or removal. Pursuant to our Bylaws, directors standing for election in an uncontested election (as defined below) will be elected by the affirmative vote of a majority of the shares entitled to vote for them represented and voting at a duly held meeting at which a quorum is present (and such affirmative votes must also represent more than 25 of the outstanding shares entitled to vote in the election of such directors). In any election of directors that is not an uncontested election, the candidates receiving the highest number of affirmative votes of the shares entitled to vote for them, up to the number of directors to be elected by those shares, will be elected and votes against a director and votes withheld will have no effect. The rights of holders of our common stock to elect directors are subject to the voting rights, if any, of holders of outstanding shares of any series of our preferred stock, which could include (i) voting as a separate class or series, the right to elect one or more directors, or (ii) voting together with our common stock as a single class, the right to vote in the election of directors generally. Our Bylaws define an uncontested election as, in general, an election of directors in which the number of candidates for election does not exceed the number of directors to be elected by our shareholders at that election, determined at the times specified in our Bylaws. None of our shareholders may cumulate votes in the election of directors.

Additionally, in the event that a credit rating agency then publishing a rating for us makes certain amendments, clarifications or changes to the criteria it uses to assign equity credit to securities such as the series C preferred stock (a Ratings Event ), we may redeem the series C preferred stock, in whole but not in part, at any time within 120 days after the conclusion of any review or appeal process instituted by us following the occurrence of the Ratings Event or, if no such review or appeal process is available or sought, the occurrence of such Ratings Event, at a redemption price in cash equal to 1,020 per share (102 of the Liquidation Preference (as defined below)). 
 Dividend Rights 
 Dividends on our series C preferred stock are payable semi-annually in cash on a cumulative basis when, as and if declared by the Board of Directors, or an authorized committee thereof, out of funds legally available for payment, at a resetting fixed-rate equal to 4.875 per annum of the Liquidation Preference from and including June 19, 2020 to, but excluding, October 15, 2025 and, for each five-year period following October 15, 2025 and October 15 of every fifth year after 2025, a per annum rate equal to the Five-year U.S. Treasury Rate (as defined in the Certificate of Determination of Preferences of the series C preferred stock) as of the second U.S. business day prior to such reset date, plus a spread of 4.550 of the Liquidation Preference. 
 So long as any share of series C preferred stock remains outstanding, no dividend or distribution will be declared or paid on common stock or any other junior stock, and no common stock or any other junior stock will be purchased, redeemed or otherwise acquired for consideration by us or any of our subsidiaries unless, in each case, all accumulated and unpaid dividends for all preceding dividend periods have been declared and paid, or a sufficient sum of cash or number of shares of common stock has been set apart for the payment of such dividends, on all outstanding shares of series C preferred stock. The foregoing limitation will not apply to (i) any dividend or distribution payable in shares of common stock or other junior stock, together with cash in lieu of any fractional share (ii) purchases, redemptions or other acquisitions of common stock or other junior stock in connection with the administration of any benefit or other incentive plan, including any employment contract, in the ordinary course of business, including, without limitation, (x) purchases to offset the share dilution amount pursuant to a publicly announced repurchase plan provided that any purchases to offset the share dilution amount will in no event exceed the share dilution amount (y) the forfeiture of unvested shares of restricted stock or share withholdings or other surrender of shares to which the holder may otherwise be entitled upon exercise, delivery or vesting of equity awards (whether in payment of applicable taxes, the exercise price or otherwise) and (z) the payment of cash in lieu of fractional shares (iii) purchases of fractional interests in shares of common stock or other junior stock pursuant to the conversion or exchange provisions of such shares of other junior stock or any securities exchangeable for or convertible into shares of common stock or other junior stock, (iv) any dividends or distributions of rights or common stock or junior stock in connection with a shareholders rights plan or any redemption or repurchase of rights pursuant to any shareholders rights plan (v) purchases of common stock or other junior stock pursuant to a contractually binding requirement to buy common stock or other junior stock existing prior to the preceding dividend period, including under a contractually binding stock repurchase plan (vi) the deemed purchase or acquisition of fractional interests in shares of common stock or other junior stock pursuant to the conversion or exchange provisions of such shares or the security being converted or exchanged (vii) the acquisition by us or any of our subsidiaries of record ownership in common stock or other junior stock or parity stock for the beneficial ownership of any other persons (other than for us or any of our subsidiaries), including as trustees or custodians, and the payment of cash in lieu of fractional shares and (viii) the exchange or conversion of junior stock for or into other junior stock or of parity stock for or into other parity stock (with the

 When dividends on shares of series C preferred stock (A) have not been declared and paid in full on any dividend payment date or (B) have been declared but a sum of cash sufficient for payment thereof has not been set aside for the benefit of the holders thereof on the applicable record date, no dividends may be declared or paid on any parity stock unless dividends are declared on the shares of series C preferred stock such that the respective amounts of such dividends declared on the shares of series C preferred stock and such parity stock bear the same ratio to each other as all accumulated dividends and all declared and unpaid dividends per share on the shares of series C preferred stock and such parity stock bear to each other provided, however, that any unpaid dividends will continue to accumulate. 
 Subject to the foregoing, and not otherwise, such dividends (payable in cash, securities or other property) as may be determined by the Board of Directors, or an authorized committee thereof, may be declared and paid on any securities, including common stock, from time to time out of any funds legally available for such payment, and holders of our series C preferred stock will not be entitled to participate in any such dividends declared on securities other than the series C preferred stock. 
 Liquidation Rights 
 In the event of our liquidation, winding up or dissolution, whether voluntary or involuntary, each holder of our series C preferred stock will be entitled to receive 1,000 per share (the Liquidation Preference of such preferred stock, plus an amount (the Liquidation Dividend Amount equal to accumulated and unpaid dividends on such shares to (but excluding) the date fixed for liquidation, winding-up or dissolution to be paid out of our assets legally available for distribution to our shareholders, after satisfaction of debt and other liabilities owed to our creditors and holders of shares of any senior stock and before any payment or distribution is made to holders of any junior stock, including, without limitation, common stock. 
 If, upon our voluntary or involuntary liquidation, winding-up or dissolution, the amounts payable with respect to (i) the Liquidation Preference plus the Liquidation Dividend Amount on the shares of series C preferred stock and (ii) the liquidation preference of, and the amount of accumulated and unpaid dividends (to, but excluding, the date fixed for liquidation, winding-up or dissolution) on, all other parity stock are not paid in full, the holders of our series C preferred stock and all holders of any such other parity stock will share equally and ratably in any distribution of our assets in proportion to the respective liquidation preferences and amounts equal to the accumulated and unpaid dividends to which they are entitled. 
 After the payment to any holder of our series C preferred stock of the full amount of the Liquidation Preference and the Liquidation Dividend Amount for each of such holder s shares of such preferred stock, such holder as such will have no right or claim to any of our remaining assets. 
 Neither the sale, lease or exchange of all or substantially all of our assets, nor our merger or consolidation into or with any other person, will be deemed to be our voluntary or involuntary liquidation, winding-up or dissolution. 
 Voting Rights 
 The holders of the series C preferred stock do not have voting rights with respect to their preferred stock, except as described below and as specifically required by applicable California law from time to time. 
 Whenever dividends on the series C preferred stock have not been declared or paid or have been declared but not paid for three or more semi-annual dividend periods, whether or not consecutive, the authorized number of directors on the Board of Directors will automatically be increased by two and the holders of the series C preferred stock, voting together as a single class with holders of any and all other outstanding preferred stock of equal rank having similar voting rights, will be entitled to elect two directors who satisfy certain requirements to fill such newly created directorships. Such directors will stand for reelection annually, and at each subsequent annual meeting of shareholders, so long as the holders of preferred stock continue to have this voting right. This right will terminate with respect to the series C preferred stock when all accumulated and unpaid dividends on 
 4 

such preferred stock have been paid in full, subject to the revesting of the right in the event of each subsequent nonpayment for three or more semi-annual dividend periods. Upon the termination of this voting right for all series of preferred stock, the term of office of each director elected pursuant to the right will terminate and the authorized number of directors will automatically decrease by two. 
 So long as any shares of series C preferred stock are outstanding, we must obtain the affirmative vote or consent of the holders of at least two-thirds of the outstanding shares of such preferred stock, voting together as a single class, in order to, subject to certain exceptions and limitations, amend or alter our Articles of Incorporation so as to authorize, create or increase the authorized amount of any class or series of senior stock or adversely affect the special rights, preferences, privileges or voting powers of the series C preferred stock, consummate a binding share exchange or reclassification involving the shares of the series C preferred stock or consummate a merger or consolidation of us with another entity provided that if any such amendment, alteration, repeal, share exchange, reclassification, merger or consolidation would adversely affect one or more but not all series of preferred stock, then only the series of preferred stock adversely affected and entitled to vote will so vote as a class. We may amend, alter, supplement or repeal any terms of the series C preferred stock without the vote or consent of the holders thereof, so long as such action does not adversely affect the special rights, preferences, privileges, voting powers, limitations or restrictions of such preferred stock, to cure any ambiguity or mistake, to correct or supplement any provision that may be defective or inconsistent with any other provision in the Certificate of Determination of Preferences of the series C preferred stock, to make any provision with respect to matters or questions relating to the series C preferred stock that is not inconsistent with the provisions of our Articles of Incorporation or to waive any of our rights with respect thereto. 
 Terms of Conversion

 Other Rights

 Anti-Takeover Effects of our Articles of Incorporation and Bylaws 
 Certain provisions of our Articles of Incorporation and Bylaws could have the effect of delaying, deterring or preventing another party from acquiring or seeking to acquire control of us. These provisions are intended to discourage certain types of coercive takeover practices and inadequate takeover bids and to encourage anyone seeking to acquire control of us to negotiate first with the Board of Directors. However, these provisions could also delay, deter or prevent a change of control or other takeover of our company that our shareholders might consider to be in their best interests, including transactions that might result in a premium being paid over the market prices of our common stock and any outstanding preferred stock, and may also limit the prices that investors are willing to pay in the future for our common stock and any outstanding preferred stock. These provisions may also have the effect of preventing changes in our management. Our Articles of Incorporation and Bylaws include anti-takeover provisions that 
 authorize the Board of Directors, without a vote or other action by our shareholders, to cause the issuance of preferred stock in one or more series and, with respect to each series, to fix the number of shares constituting that series and to establish the rights, preferences, privileges and restrictions of that series, which may include, among other things, dividend and liquidation rights and preferences, rights to convert such shares into common stock, voting rights and other rights which may dilute or otherwise adversely affect the voting or other rights and the economic interests of holders of our common stock or one or more other series of our preferred stock, if any, then outstanding

 provide that no shareholder may cumulate votes in the election of directors, which means that the holders of a majority of our outstanding shares of common stock can elect all directors standing for election by our common shareholders 
 require that any action to be taken by our shareholders must be taken either (i) at a duly called annual or special meeting of shareholders, or (ii) by the unanimous written consent of all of our shareholders, unless the Board of Directors, by resolution adopted by two-thirds of the authorized number of directors, waives the foregoing provision in any particular circumstance and 
 require action by shareholders holding not less than 1 10th of the voting power of our capital stock in order for our shareholders to call a special meeting of shareholders.

DESCRIPTION OF DEBT SECURITIES 
 The following description of the notes is a summary and does not purport to be complete. It is subject to and qualified in its entirety by reference to the subordinated indenture, dated as of June 26, 2019 (the indenture ), between Sempra and the U.S. Bank National Association, as trustee (the trustee ). The indenture is an exhibit to the Annual Report on Form 10-K with which this Exhibit 4.2 is filed or incorporated by reference. We encourage you to read the indenture, as supplemented, for additional information. 
 The notes constitute a separate series of our subordinated debt securities under the indenture and were issued in the aggregate principal amount of 758 million, which remained the aggregate principal amount outstanding as of December 31, 2022. 
 Maturity 
 The maturity date of the notes is July 1, 2079. The notes are subject to early redemption at our option as described under Redemption Optional Redemption below. 
 Interest 
 The notes bear interest at the rate of 5.75 per year. Subject to our right to defer interest payments as described below, interest on the notes is payable quarterly in arrears on January 1, April 1, July 1 and October 1 of each year. 
 So long as no event of default under the indenture with respect to the notes has occurred and is continuing, we may, at our option, defer interest payments on the notes, from time to time, for one or more deferral periods of up to 40 consecutive quarterly interest payment periods each (each such deferral period, commencing on the interest payment date on which the first such deferred interest payment otherwise would have been made, an optional deferral period ), except that no such optional deferral period may extend beyond the final maturity date of the notes. In other words, we may declare at our discretion up to a 10-year interest payment moratorium on the notes and we may choose to do that on more than one occasion, except that we cannot begin a new optional deferral period until we have paid all accrued and unpaid interest on the notes from any previous optional deferral period. No interest on the notes will be payable during any optional deferral period unless we elect, at our option, to redeem notes during such optional deferral period, in which case accrued and unpaid interest will be paid on the notes, and only on the notes, being redeemed, or unless the principal of and interest on the notes has been declared due and payable as a result of an event of default under the indenture with respect to the notes, in which case accrued and unpaid interest will be paid on all of the notes. We may elect, at our option, to extend the length of any optional deferral period that is shorter than 40 consecutive quarterly interest payment periods (but not beyond the final maturity date of the notes) and to shorten the length of any optional deferral period. 
 During any optional deferral period, interest on the notes will continue to accrue at the rate of 5.75 per year and interest on deferred interest will accrue at the rate of 5.75 per year, compounded quarterly, to the extent permitted by applicable law. In addition, during any optional deferral period, we are prohibited from taking certain specified actions as set forth in the indenture, including, subject to certain exceptions and limitations, declaring or paying any dividends or distributions on our capital stock redeeming, purchasing, acquiring or making a liquidation payment with respect to our capital stock paying any principal, interest or premium on, or repaying, repurchasing or redeeming, any of our indebtedness that ranks equal with or junior to the notes in right of payment or making any payments with respect to any guarantees by us of any indebtedness if such guarantees rank equal with or junior to the notes in right of payment. 
 Redemption 
 At our option, we may redeem some or all of the notes before their maturity, as follows 
 on or after October 1, 2024, at any time in whole or from time to time in part, at a redemption price equal to 100 of the principal amount of the notes to be redeemed plus, subject to certain interest payment procedures as set forth in the indenture, accrued and unpaid interest on the notes to be redeemed to the redemption date 
 before October 1, 2024, in whole but not in part, following the occurrence and during the continuance of a Tax Event (as defined below), at a redemption price equal to 100 of the principal amount of the notes, plus, subject to certain interest payment procedures as set forth in the indenture, accrued and unpaid interest on the notes to the redemption date or 
 7 

before October 1, 2024, in whole but not in part, following the occurrence and during the continuance of a Rating Agency Event (as defined below), at a redemption price equal to 102 of the principal amount of the notes, plus, subject to certain interest payment procedures as set forth in the indenture, accrued and unpaid interest on the notes to the redemption date. 
 A Tax Event means that we have received an opinion of counsel experienced in such matters to the effect that, as a result of 
 any amendment to, clarification of, or change, including any announced prospective change, in the laws or treaties of the United States or any of its political subdivisions or taxing authorities, or any regulations under those laws or treaties 
 an administrative action, which means any judicial decision or any official administrative pronouncement, ruling, regulatory procedure, notice or announcement including any notice or announcement of intent to issue or adopt any administrative pronouncement, ruling, regulatory procedure or regulation 
 any amendment to, clarification of, or change in the official position or the interpretation of any administrative action or judicial decision or any interpretation or pronouncement that provides for a position with respect to an administrative action or judicial decision that differs from the previously generally accepted position, in each case by any legislative body, court, governmental authority or regulatory body, regardless of the time or manner in which that amendment, clarification or change is introduced or made known or 
 a threatened challenge asserted in writing in connection with a tax audit of us or any of our subsidiaries, or a publicly-known threatened challenge asserted in writing against any other taxpayer that has raised capital through the issuance of securities that are substantially similar to the notes, 
 which amendment, clarification or change is effective or the administrative action is taken or judicial decision, interpretation or pronouncement is issued or threatened challenge is asserted or becomes publicly-known after June 13, 2019, there is more than an insubstantial risk that interest payable by us on the notes is not deductible, or within 90 days would not be deductible, in whole or in part, by us for United States federal income tax purposes. 
 Rating Agency Event means a change in the methodology published by any nationally recognized statistical rating organization within the meaning of Section 3(a)(62) of the Exchange Act that published a rating for Sempra as of June 13, 2019 (a rating agency in assigning equity credit to securities such as the notes, as such methodology was in effect on June 13, 2019 (the current methodology ), that results in (i) any shortening of the length of time for which equity credit pertaining to the notes by such rating agency would have been in effect had the current methodology not been changed or (ii) a lower equity credit being assigned by such rating agency to the notes as of the date of such change than the equity credit that would have been assigned to the notes by such rating agency had the current methodology not been changed. 
 Subordination and Security 
 The notes are our unsecured obligations. The notes rank junior and subordinate in right of payment to our existing and future Senior Indebtedness (as defined below), to the extent and in the manner described below. At December 31, 2022, we had outstanding Senior Indebtedness of approximately 9 billion. The notes rank equally in right of payment with any existing and future unsecured indebtedness if the terms of such indebtedness provide that it ranks equally with the notes in right of payment. The notes are effectively subordinated in right of payment to any secured indebtedness that we have or may incur and to all indebtedness and other liabilities of our subsidiaries. At December 31, 2022, we had no outstanding secured indebtedness and our subsidiaries had outstanding total indebtedness and liabilities owed to unaffiliated third parties of approximately 41 billion and total liabilities owed to us of approximately 607 million. 
 The notes are subordinated in right of payment to the prior payment in full of all our Senior Indebtedness. This means that upon 
 (a) any payment by, or distribution of the assets of, Sempra upon our dissolution, winding-up, liquidation or reorganization, whether voluntary or involuntary or in bankruptcy, insolvency, receivership or other proceedings or 
 (b) a failure to pay any interest, principal or other monetary amounts due on any of our Senior Indebtedness when due and continuance of that default beyond any applicable grace period or 
 (c) acceleration of the maturity of any Senior Indebtedness as a result of a default 
 8 

the holders of all of our Senior Indebtedness will be entitled to receive 
 in the case of clause (a) above, payment of all amounts due or to become due on all Senior Indebtedness or 
 in the case of clauses (b) and (c) above, payment of all amounts due on all Senior Indebtedness, 
 before the holders of the notes are entitled to receive any payment. So long as any of the events in clauses (a), (b), or (c) above has occurred and is continuing, any amounts payable or assets distributable on the notes will instead be paid or distributed, as the case may be, directly to the holders of Senior Indebtedness to the extent necessary to pay, in the case of clause (a) above, all amounts due or to become due upon all such Senior Indebtedness, or, in the case of clauses (b) and (c) above, all amounts due on all such Senior Indebtedness, and, if any such payment or distribution is received by the trustee under the indenture or the holders of any of the notes before all Senior Indebtedness due and to become due or due, as applicable, is paid, such payment or distribution must be paid over to the holders of the unpaid Senior Indebtedness. Subject to paying the Senior Indebtedness due and to become due in the case of clause (a) or the Senior Indebtedness due in the case of clauses (b) and (c), the holders of the notes will be subrogated to the rights of the holders of the Senior Indebtedness to receive payments applicable to the Senior Indebtedness until the notes are paid in full. 
 Neither the notes nor the indenture limit our ability to incur Senior Indebtedness or our or any of our subsidiaries ability to incur other secured and unsecured indebtedness or liabilities. 
 Senior Indebtedness means, with respect to the notes, (i) indebtedness of Sempra, whether outstanding at the date of the indenture or incurred, created or assumed after such date, (a) in respect of money borrowed by Sempra (including any financial derivative, hedging or futures contract or similar instrument, to the extent any such item is primarily a financing transaction) and (b) evidenced by debentures, bonds, notes, credit or loan agreements or other similar instruments or agreements issued or entered into by Sempra (ii) all finance lease obligations of Sempra (iii) all obligations of Sempra issued or assumed as the deferred purchase price of property, all conditional sale obligations of Sempra and all obligations of Sempra under any title retention agreement (but excluding, for the avoidance of doubt, trade accounts payable arising in the ordinary course of business and long-term purchase obligations) (iv) all obligations of Sempra for the reimbursement of any letter of credit, banker s acceptance, security purchase facility or similar credit transaction and (v) all obligations of the type referred to in clauses (i) through (iv) above of other persons for the payment of which Sempra is responsible or liable as obligor, guarantor or otherwise, except for any obligations, instruments or agreements of the type referred to in any of clauses (i) through (v) above that, by the terms of the instruments or agreements creating or evidencing the same or pursuant to which the same is outstanding, are subordinated or equal in right of payment to the notes. 
 Events of Default 
 An event of default occurs with respect to the notes if 
 we do not pay any interest on any note when it becomes due and payable and such default continues for 30 days (whether or not such payment is prohibited by the subordination provisions applicable to the notes) 
 we do not pay any principal of or premium, if any, on any note when it becomes due and payable (whether or not such payment is prohibited by the subordination provisions applicable to the notes) 
 we remain in breach of any other covenant or warranty (excluding covenants and warranties solely applicable to one or more other series of subordinated debt securities issued under the indenture) in the indenture or the notes for 60 days after there has been given to us, by registered or certified mail, a written notice of default sent by either the trustee or registered holders of at least 25 of the principal amount of the outstanding notes that specifies the default or breach and requires remedy of the default or breach or 
 we file for bankruptcy or other specified events of bankruptcy, insolvency, receivership or reorganization occur with respect to us. 
 No event of default with respect to the notes will necessarily constitute an event of default with respect to the subordinated debt securities of any other series issued under the indenture, and no event of default with respect to any such other series of subordinated debt securities issued under the indenture will necessarily constitute an event of default with respect to the notes. 
 9 

Under the terms of the indenture, we furnish the trustee with an annual statement as to our compliance with the conditions and covenants in the indenture.

However, no amendment or modification may, without the consent of the registered holder of each outstanding debt security affected thereby 
 change the stated maturity of the principal or interest on any debt security or reduce the principal amount, interest or premium payable or change any place of payment where or the currency in which any debt security is payable, or impair the right to bring suit to enforce any payment, or, if Sempra has the right to extend or defer the payment of interest on such debt security, to increase the maximum time period of any such extension or deferral or increase the maximum number of times Sempra may extend or defer any such interest payment

 in the case of the subordinated indenture, modify, delete or supplement any of the subordination provisions or the definition of Senior Indebtedness applicable to the subordinated debt securities of any series then outstanding in a manner adverse to the holders of such subordinated debt securities. 
 Consolidation, Merger or Conveyance of Assets 
 We have agreed not to consolidate or merge with or into any other entity, or to sell, transfer, lease or otherwise convey our properties and assets as an entirety or substantially as an entirety to any entity, unless 
 (i) in the case of a merger, we are the continuing entity, or (ii) the successor entity formed by any such consolidation or into which we are merged or which acquires by sale, transfer, lease or other conveyance our properties and assets as an entirety or substantially as an entirety, is a corporation organized and existing under the laws of the United States of America

 immediately after giving effect to the transaction, no event of default, and no event which after notice or lapse of time or both would become an event of default under the indenture, has or will have occurred and be continuing. 
 Defeasance, Satisfaction and Discharge 
 The indenture provides that we may, upon satisfying several conditions, be discharged from our obligations, with some exceptions, with respect to the notes, which we refer to as defeasance . One such condition is the irrevocable deposit with the trustee, in trust, of money and or government obligations that, through the scheduled payment of principal and interest on those obligations, would provide sufficient moneys to pay the principal of and any premium and interest on the notes on the maturity dates of the payments or upon redemption.

Contractor acknowledges that this Agreement constitutes a fixed price (other than the Provisional Sums, as expressed herein), date certain obligation to engineer, design, procure, construct, test and start-up a turnkey project (including the training of the Operating Personnel as described herein). References to the obligations of Contractor under this Agreement as being turnkey and performing the Work on a turnkey basis means that Contractor is obligated to supply all of the Equipment, labor and design services and to supply and perform all of the Work, in each case as may reasonably be required, necessary, incidental, or appropriate to complete the Work such that the LNG Facility meets the Guaranteed Performance Levels, or the Minimum Performance Standards, where applicable, and the LNG Facility otherwise complies with the applicable terms, conditions and other requirements set forth in this Agreement, all for the Contract Price. Contractor acknowledges that turnkey or turnkey basis does not limit Owner s right to review, inspect or comment on any aspect of the Work or Contractor s performance thereof as permitted under this Agreement. Contractor further acknowledges that it may have miscalculated its and its Suppliers costs to perform the Work, and that the performance of the Work in accordance with this Agreement may result in Contractor (or its Suppliers) expending more resources than it or they estimated or budgeted or otherwise intend to expend. Similarly, Owner acknowledges that Contractor may have been conservative in its assumptions regarding the overall cost of the Work, and that the actual cost to Contractor to perform the Work may in fact be significantly less than the Contract Price. The fact that either Party may have so miscalculated the costs to perform the Work hereunder, or that either Party expended extra resources that it did not intend to spend as a result of such miscalculation, shall not form the basis for any claim of relief hereunder, whether such claim arises in contract or tort.

In addition to its obligations under Section 18.2.1 , if Contractor claims there is a Claim Submission Event, Contractor shall (a) within thirty (30) Business Days after it becomes aware or reasonably should have become aware of such condition, notify Owner in writing of the nature and cause of such event, its anticipated duration and effect upon the performance of such Party s obligations, and the estimated cost (if eligible) of such Claim Submission Event, and state any action being taken to avoid or minimize its effect (b) state whether and to what extent the condition is reasonably expected to delay the Substantial Completion Date for a Stage or any other Key Date Items as set forth on the Key Date Schedule and (c) state whether Contractor requests a Change Order pursuant to Article 8 with respect thereto (an Impact Notice ). Failure to provide an Impact Notice within such Business Day period shall reduce Contractor s claim for which such notice was required if Contractor acted in bad faith in not submitting such Impact Notice or Owner is prejudiced as a result of not getting the Impact Notice within such period. The Party claiming that a Claim Submission Event occurred shall have a continuing obligation to deliver to the other Party additional documentation or analysis supporting its claim regarding the occurrence of such Claim Submission Event promptly after such information is available to the Party claiming such Claim Submission Event. The burden of proof shall be on the Party claiming to be affected by such Claim Submission Event (which burden of proof also extends to all of claiming Party s claims for relief hereunder). All costs incurred by a Party to document the existence of the Claim Submission Event, including such costs necessary to document the impact (whether cost or schedule related) of such events, shall be borne exclusively by the Party which makes such claim and shall not be subject to reimbursement hereunder.

If Contractor submits a preliminary Claim by the initial Claim Submission Deadline and the Claim Submission Deadline is extended, Owner shall be under no obligation to review or respond to the preliminary Claim and the Owner Change Order Review Period shall not commence until the final Claim has been submitted. Because a delay in issuing its claim beyond the Claim Submission Deadline will prejudice Owner s ability to reasonably verify whether the cost or schedule extension claimed by Contractor were actually and demonstrably incurred by Contractor as a result of such Claim Submission Event, Contractor and Owner have agreed that a failure to deliver such notice (with such Claim, if any) by the Claim Submission Deadline is a 
 208 

reasonable and enforceable basis to deny relief hereunder as a result of the occurrence of such event (whether the claim for such relief is Contract Price related, Project Schedule related, or both). Oral notice, shortness of time or Owner s actual knowledge of a particular circumstance shall not waiver, satisfy, discharge or otherwise excuse Contractor s compliance with the requirements of this Section 18.2 . 
 18.2.4 Scope of Suspension Duty to Mitigate .

Upon the passing of the Force Majeure event consisting of a Named Windstorm, Contractor shall resume Work at the Site and cause its and its Subcontractors applicable staff and labor to return to the Site. Contractor shall be entitled to a Change Order in respect of any such evacuation from the Site in accordance with the agreed evacuation plan.

 18.4 Labor Impacts . Where a Named Windstorm that impacts the Port Arthur region results in a shortage or unavailability of craft or labor to perform the Work, despite Contractor s attempts to mitigate the impacts of such Force Majeure event on the Work in accordance with Section 18.2.4 , Contractor shall consult with Owner as to the actions that Contractor will take to overcome such shortage or unavailability, including short-term incentives, accommodations, per

If Owner accepts such Change Order, then Contractor shall not have any right under this Agreement to any extension to the Guaranteed Substantial Completion Dates and the other Key Date Schedule as a result of any shortage or unavailability of craft or labor as a result of such Named Windstorm, except to the extent agreed in such Change Order. If Owner exercises its rights to reject such Change Order request, then, if such shortage or unavailability of craft or labor delays Contractor in the performance of Critical Path Items such that, based on the CPM Schedule and using critical path analysis, Contractor will fail to achieve Substantial Completion by the Target Substantial Completion Date, then, subject to Contractor s compliance with its duty to mitigate in accordance with Section 18.2.4 and Contractor s having implemented and followed the actions agreed with Owner pursuant to this Section 18.4 , Contractor may, as its sole and exclusive remedy hereunder resulting from such shortage or unavailability of craft or labor caused by such Named Windstorm, request a Change Order in accordance with Section 8.3.1(h) with respect to adjustments to the Guaranteed Substantial Completion Dates and the other Key Date Items as determined in accordance with Section 8.4.1(a) , but Contractor shall not otherwise be entitled to any adjustment to the Contract Price as a result of such shortage or unavailability.

Notwithstanding any other provision of this agreement to arbitrate or the JAMS Rules, the scope, applicability, enforceability, revocability or validity of this Representative PAGA Waiver may be resolved only by a court of competent jurisdiction and not by an arbitrator. If any provision of this representative PAGA Waiver is found to be unenforceable or unlawful for any reason, the unenforceable provision shall be severed from this Dispute Resolution provision, and any such representative PAGA claims or other representative private attorneys general act claims must be litigated in a court of competent jurisdiction and not in arbitration. To the extent that there are any Arbitrable Disputes to be litigated in a court of competent jurisdiction because a court determines that the Representative PAGA Waiver is unenforceable with respect to those disputes, the Parties agree that litigation of those Arbitrable Disputes shall be stayed pending the outcome of any individual disputes in arbitration.

Subject to Section 15 of this Agreement, each party shall pay its own attorneys fees and pay any costs that are not unique to arbitration (i.e., costs that each party would incur if the claim(s) were litigated in a court, such as costs to subpoena witnesses and or documents, take depositions and purchase deposition transcripts, copy documents, etc.). However, subject to Section 15 of this Agreement, if any party prevails on a statutory claim that authorizes an award of attorneys fees to the prevailing party, or if there is a written agreement providing for attorneys fees, the arbitrator may award reasonable attorneys fees to the prevailing party, applying the same standards a court would apply under the law applicable to the claim. 
 (e) The arbitrator shall apply the Federal Rules of Evidence, shall have the authority to entertain a motion to dismiss or a motion for summary judgment by any party, and shall apply the standards governing such motions under the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure.

The arbitrator does not have the authority to consider, certify, or hear an arbitration as a class action, collective action, or any other type of representative action. In addition, unless all parties agree in writing otherwise, the arbitrator shall not consolidate or join the arbitrations of one or more than one individual. Neither party may seek, nor may the arbitrator award, any relief that is not individualized to the claimant or that affects other individuals. The arbitrator may award declaratory or injunctive relief only in favor of the individual party seeking relief and only to the extent necessary to provide relief warranted by that party s individual claims. Sempra Energy and the Executive recognize that this agreement to arbitrate arises out of or concerns interstate commerce and that the Federal Arbitration Act shall govern the arbitration and shall govern the interpretation or enforcement of this Agreement or any arbitration award.

The Company will not retaliate against the Executive in any way for a disclosure made pursuant to this Section 14(b). Further, in the event the Executive makes such a disclosure, and files a lawsuit against the Company alleging that the Company retaliated against the Executive because of the disclosure, the Executive may disclose the relevant trade secret or confidential information to the Executive s attorney, and may use the same in the court proceeding only if (X) the Executive ensures that any court filing that includes the trade secret or confidential information at issue is made under seal and (Y) the Executive does not otherwise disclose the trade secret or confidential information except as required by court order. 
 (c) Non-Solicitation of Employees . The Executive recognizes that the Executive possesses and will possess confidential information about other employees of Sempra Energy and its Affiliates relating to their education, experience, skills, abilities, compensation

The Executive recognizes that the information the Executive possesses and will possess about these other employees is not generally known, is of substantial value to Sempra Energy and its Affiliates in developing their business and in securing and retaining customers, and has been and will be acquired by the Executive because of the Executive s business position with Sempra Energy and its Affiliates. The Executive agrees that at all times during the Executive s employment with the Company and for a period of one (1) year thereafter, the Executive will not use such information to directly or indirectly solicit or recruit any employee of the Company or its Affiliates for the purpose of being employed by the Executive or by any competitor of the Company or its Affiliates on whose behalf the Executive is acting as an agent, representative or employee and that the Executive will not convey any such confidential information or trade secrets about other employees of Sempra Energy and its Affiliates to any other Person provided, however , that it shall not constitute a solicitation or recruitment of employment in violation of this Section 14(c) to discuss employment opportunities with any employee of the Company or its Affiliates who has either first contacted the Executive or regarding whose employment the Executive has discussed with and received the written approval of the Company s most senior officer of Human Resources (or, if such position is vacant, the Company s then Chief Executive Officer), prior to making such solicitation or recruitment. In view of the nature of the Executive s employment with the Company, the Executive likewise agrees that Sempra Energy and its Affiliates would be irreparably harmed by any solicitation or recruitment in violation of the terms of this Section 14(c) and that Sempra Energy and its Affiliates shall therefore be entitled to preliminary and or permanent injunctive relief prohibiting the Executive from engaging in any activity or threatened activity in violation of the terms of this Section 14(c) and to any other relief available to them. 
 (d) Survival of Provisions . The obligations contained in Section 14(a), (b) and (c) above shall survive the termination of the Executive s employment within the Company and shall be fully enforceable thereafter to the same extent that it was enforceable prior to such termination.

 1. Separation Date . Employee s employment with the Company terminated at the close of business on ____________ (the Separation Date ). Employee has received his her final wages through the Separation Date, less deductions required by law, including any accrued but unused vacation, in accordance with applicable law.

The term affiliate as used herein shall include, without limitation, such Person s parent companies, divisions and subsidiaries, whether or not specified. 
 2. Severance Benefits . In exchange for Employee entering into this Agreement and not revoking it, and for the covenants and releases contained herein, the Company will provide Employee with the severance benefits described below. Employee acknowledges that the amounts and benefits set forth in this Section 2 as well as any benefits and claims not released under Section 4(b), fully satisfy any entitlement Employee may have to any payments or benefits from the Company through the Separation Date, including under the Severance Pay Agreement. Employee further acknowledges that no part of the severance payments described in this Section 2 consist of wages owed to Employee for his her employment through the Separation Date. 

(a) The Company will pay Employee a lump sum payment of ______________________ , less applicable withholdings, pursuant to Section 4 5 of the Severance Pay Agreement. Pursuant to Section 409A of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the Code ), payment will be made on the earlier of (i) the date that is six (6) months and one (1) day after the Separation Date and (ii) the date of Employee s death. 
 (b) The Company will pay Employee a lump sum payment of ___________ , less applicable withholdings, which is equal to the Consulting Payment set forth in Section 14(e) of the Severance Pay Agreement. Such payment will be made during the thirty (30) day period commencing on the earlier of (i) a date that is six (6) months and one (1) day after the Separation Date and (ii) the date of Employee s death 
 (c) The Company will also provide Employee with the severance benefits set forth in Sections 4(c), (d) and (e) of the Severance Pay Agreement. For the avoidance of doubt, the value of the services set forth in Sections 4(c), (d) and (e) of the Severance Pay Agreement shall not be subject to liquidation or exchange for any other benefit. 
 3. Tax Consequences . The Company makes no representations or warranties with respect to the tax consequences of the payments and any other consideration provided to Employee or made on Employee s behalf under the terms of this Agreement. Employee agrees and understands that Employee is responsible for payment, if any, of local, state, and or federal taxes on the payments and any other consideration provided hereunder by the Company and any penalties or assessments thereon. Employee further agrees to indemnify and hold the Company and its affiliates harmless from any claims, demands, deficiencies, penalties, interest, assessments, executions, judgments, or recoveries by any government agency against the Company or any of its affiliates for any amounts claimed due on account of (a) Employee s failure to pay or delayed payment of federal or state taxes, or (b) damages sustained by the Company or any of its affiliates by reason of any such claims, including reasonable attorneys fees and costs 
 4. Release of Claims . As a material inducement for the payment of the severance and benefits of the Severance Pay Agreement, and except as otherwise provided in this Agreement, Employee, on behalf of him herself and on behalf of his her heirs, family members, executors, agents and assigns, hereby irrevocably and unconditionally releases, acquits and forever discharges the Company Releasees from any and all Claims he she has or may have. For purposes of this Agreement and the preceding sentence, the words Releasee or Releasees and Claim or Claims shall have the meanings set forth below 
 (a) Company Releasees shall refer to (i) the Company, (ii) each of the Company s owners, stockholders, predecessors, successors, assigns, agents, directors, officers, employees, representatives, attorneys, advisors, and affiliates (including parent companies, divisions, and subsidiaries), (iii) agents, directors, officers, employees, representatives, attorneys and advisors of such affiliates (including parent companies, divisions, and subsidiaries), and (iv) all persons and entities acting by, through, under or in concert with any of them 
 (b) The words Claim or Claims shall refer to any charges, complaints, claims, liabilities, obligations, promises, agreements, controversies, damages, actions, causes of action, suits, rights, demands, costs, losses, debts and expenses (including attorneys fees and costs actually incurred) of any nature whatsoever, known or unknown, suspected or unsuspected, which Employee had or may have, own or hold against any of the Company Releasees through and including the Effective Date that in any way arise out of, relate to, or are in connection with Employee s employment relationship with the Company and its affiliates and the termination of that relationship, including, without limitation, all rights arising out of alleged violations of any contracts, express or implied, including the Severance Pay Agreement any tort claim any legal 
 A-2 

restrictions on the Company s right to terminate employment relationships and any federal, state or other governmental statute, regulation, law or ordinance, including common law principles, governing the employment relationship including, without limitation, all laws and regulations prohibiting discrimination or harassment based on protected categories, and all laws and regulations prohibiting retaliation against employees, including retaliation for engaging in protected activity or legal off-duty conduct. This release does not extend to claims for workers compensation or other claims which by law may not be waived or released by this Agreement, nor does it limit Employee s right to receive any vested payments or benefits to which he she is entitled under any Company (including its affiliates) benefit plan (including, without limitation, any of the Company s (including its affiliates) qualified retirement plans or non-qualified deferred compensation plan), which payments or benefits will be paid or provided pursuant to the terms of the applicable governing documents. 
 5. Release of Unknown Claims. Employee expressly waives and relinquishes all rights and benefits afforded by any statute (including, but not limited to, Section 1542 of the Civil Code of the State of California and analogous laws of other states), which limits the effect of a release with respect to unknown claims. Employee does so understanding and acknowledging the significance of the release of unknown claims and the waiver of statutory protection against a release of unknown claims (including, but not limited to, Section 1542). Section 1542 of the Civil Code of the State of California states as follows 
 A GENERAL RELEASE DOES NOT EXTEND TO CLAIMS WHICH THE CREDITOR OR RELEASING PARTY DOES NOT KNOW OR SUSPECT TO EXIST IN HIS OR HER FAVOR AT THE TIME OF EXECUTING THE RELEASE AND THAT, IF KNOWN BY HIM OR HER, WOULD HAVE MATERIALLY AFFECTED HIS OR HER SETTLEMENT WITH THE DEBTOR OR RELEASED PARTY. 
 Thus, notwithstanding the provisions of Section 1542 or of any similar statute, and for the purpose of implementing a full and complete release and discharge of the Company Releasees, Employee expressly acknowledges that this Agreement is intended to include in its effect, without limitation, all Claims which are known and all Claims which Employee does not know or suspect to exist in Employee s favor at the time of execution of this Agreement and that this Agreement contemplates the extinguishment of all such Claims. Employee acknowledges that he she might hereafter discover facts different from, or in addition to, those Employee now knows or believes to be true with respect to a Claim or Claims released herein, and they expressly agree to assume the risk of possible discovery of additional or different facts, and agree that this Agreement shall be and remain effective, in all respects, regardless of such additional or different discovered facts. 
 6. Covenant Not to Sue . Employee agrees that Employee will not file any suit, claim, proceeding or complaint against any Company Releasees arising out of or in connection with any Claims released herein, except as required to enforce the terms of this Agreement. Employee s right to file or participate in an administrative claim or investigation by the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission, or any other local, state, or federal administrative body or government agency against the Company, which is guaranteed by law, cannot be and is not waived. However, to the extent permitted by law, and except as to Securities and Exchange Commission whistleblower awards, Employee agrees that if such an administrative claim is made against any Company Releasee(s) on Employee s behalf, Employee shall not be entitled to recover any individual monetary relief or other individual remedies beyond the separation benefits identified in this Agreement. 
 A-3 

7. No Pending Lawsuits . Employee represents and warrants that Employee does not have any lawsuits, charges, claims, grievances, or actions of any kind pending against any Company Releasees arising out of or in connection with any Claims released herein, by or on behalf of Employee or on behalf of any other person or entity, and that, to the best of Employee s knowledge, Employee possess no such claims (including, but not limited to, under the Family and Medical Leave Act, the Age Discrimination in Employment Act, the California Family Rights Act, the Fair Labor Standards Act, the California Labor Code and or workers compensation claims). Employee further acknowledges that he she is not aware of, or has fully disclosed to the Company, any information that could reasonably give rise to such a claim, cause of action, lawsuit or proceeding against any Company Releasee(s). 
 8. No Cooperation . Employee agrees that he she will not knowingly encourage, counsel, or assist any attorneys or their clients in the presentation or prosecution of any disputes, differences, grievances, claims, charges, or complaints by any third party against any Company Releasee(s) arising out or in connection with any Claims released herein, unless under a subpoena or other court order to do so. Employee agrees to immediately notify the Company upon receipt of any such subpoena or court order, and to furnish to the Company, within three (3) business days of its receipt, a copy of such subpoena or other court order. 
 9. Payment of Salary and Receipt of All Benefits . Employee acknowledges and represents that, except as provided in this Agreement, the Company has fully paid or provided Employee all salary, wages, bonuses, accrued vacation paid time off, premiums, leaves, housing allowances, relocation costs, interest, severance, outplacement costs, fees, reimbursable expenses, commissions or other incentive compensation, stock, stock options, vesting, and any and all other benefits and compensation due to Employee. Employee specifically represents that Employee is not owed any further sum by way of reimbursement from the Company or any of its affiliates. To the extent Employee claims that additional wages are or may become owed to Employee, there is a good faith dispute based in law and fact over whether any wages in excess of the wages already paid to Employee are or will be due, and thus California Labor Code Section 206.5 is inapplicable. 
 10. Indemnification . 
 (a) As a further material inducement to the Company to enter into this Agreement, Employee hereby agrees to indemnify and hold each of the Company Releasees harmless from all loss, costs, damages, or expenses, including without limitation, reasonable attorneys fees incurred by the Company Releasees, arising out of any breach of this Agreement by Employee or the fact that any representation made in this Agreement by Employee was false when made. As a further material inducement to Employee to enter into this Agreement, the Company hereby agrees to indemnify and hold each of the Company Releasees harmless from all loss, costs, damages, or expenses, including without limitation, reasonable attorneys fees incurred by the Company Releasees, arising out of any breach of this Agreement by the Company or the fact that any representation made in this Agreement by the Company was knowingly false when made. 
 (b) If Employee is a party or is threatened to be made a party to any proceeding by reason of the fact that Employee was an employee, officer or director of the Company or any of its affiliates, the Company shall indemnify and hold harmless Employee against any expenses (including reasonable attorneys fees, provided , that counsel has been approved by the Company, which approval shall not be unreasonably withheld), judgments, fines, settlements and other amounts actually or reasonably incurred by Employee in connection with that proceeding, and provided, that Employee acted in good faith and in a manner Employee reasonably believed to be in the best interest of the Company. The limitations of Section 317 of the Corporations Code of the State of California shall apply to this assurance of indemnification. 
 A-4 

Notwithstanding the foregoing or any other provision contained herein, this Agreement shall not supersede or in any way limit any (i) indemnification arrangements in favor of the Employee under the Company s or any of its affiliates charter documents or bylaws or pursuant to any agreement between the Employee and the Company or any of the Company s affiliates or (ii) the provision of insurance against insurable events which occurred while the Executive was a director or officer of the Company, in each as provided by and subject to the limitations set forth in Section 10 of the Severance Pay Agreement. 
 11. No Admission of Liability . 
 The Parties understand and acknowledge that no action taken by either Party in connection hereto, either previously or in connection with this Agreement, shall be deemed or construed to be (i) an admission of the truth or falsity of any actual or potential claims, or (ii) an acknowledgement or admission by either Party of any fault or liability whatsoever to the other Party or to any third party. This Agreement shall not in any way be construed as an admission by the Company that it has acted wrongfully with respect to Employee or any other person or entity, or that Employee has any rights whatsoever against the Company, and the Company specifically disclaims any liability to or wrongful acts against Employee or any other person or entity, on the part of itself, its employees or its agents. This Agreement shall not in any way be construed as an admission by Employee that Employee has acted wrongfully with respect to the Company, or that Employee failed to perform Employee s duties or negligently performed or breached Employee s duties, or that the Company had good cause to terminate Employee s employment. 
 12. Cooperation in Litigation . Employee agrees to cooperate with the Company and its affiliates and their respective designated attorneys, representatives and agents in connection with any actual or threatened judicial, administrative or other legal or equitable proceeding in which the Company or any of the Company s affiliates is or may become involved. Upon reasonable notice, Employee agrees to meet with and provide to the Company and its affiliates and their respective designated attorneys, representatives or agents all information and knowledge Employee has relating to the subject matter of any such proceeding. The Company agrees to reimburse Employee for any reasonable costs Employee incurs in providing such cooperation. 
 13. Governing Law. This Agreement is entered into in state and, except as provided in this section, shall be governed by substantive state law. 
 14. Arbitration of Disputes . If any dispute arises between Employee and the Company relating to this Agreement, including any dispute regarding the interpretation, enforceability, or validity of this Agreement Arbitrable Dispute ), the Parties agree to resolve that Arbitrable Dispute through final and binding arbitration under this section. Employee also agrees to arbitrate any Arbitrable Dispute which also involves any other Company Releasee who offers or agrees to arbitrate the dispute under this section. 
 (a) Any Arbitrable Dispute will be decided by an arbitrator though individual arbitration, and Employee and the Company waive any right to a jury trial or a court bench trial . Employee and the Company also waive the right for any dispute to be brought, maintained, decided or arbitrated as a class and or collective action and the arbitrator shall have no authority to hear or preside over any such action Class Action Waiver ). Further, Arbitrable Disputes must be brought in the individual capacity of the party asserting the claim, Employee and the Company are waiving the right to pursue or have a dispute resolved as a plaintiff or class member in any purported class, collective or representative proceeding. To the extent the Class Action Waiver is determined to be invalid, unenforceable, or void, any class and or collective action must proceed in a court of law and not in arbitration. 
 A-5 

Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, to the fullest extent permitted by law, Employee and the Company (1) agree not to bring a representative action on behalf of others under the Private Attorneys General Act of 2004 PAGA ), California Labor Code 2698 et seq ., in any court or in arbitration, and (2) agree that, for any claim brought on a private attorney general basis, including under the California PAGA, any such dispute shall be resolved in arbitration on an individual basis only i.e ., to resolve whether Employee has personally been aggrieved or subject to any violations of law), and that such an action may not be used to resolve the claims or rights of other individuals in a single or collective proceeding (collectively, Representative PAGA Waiver ). Notwithstanding any other provision of this arbitration agreement or the JAMS Rules, the scope, applicability, enforceability, revocability or validity of this Representative PAGA Waiver may be resolved only by a court of competent jurisdiction and not by an arbitrator. If any provision of this representative PAGA Waiver is found to be unenforceable or unlawful for any reason, the unenforceable provision shall be severed from this Dispute Resolution provision, and any such representative PAGA claims or other representative private attorneys general act claims must be litigated in a court of competent jurisdiction and not in arbitration. To the extent that there are any Arbitrable Disputes to be litigated in a court of competent jurisdiction because a court determines that the representative PAGA Waiver is unenforceable with respect to those disputes, the Parties agree that litigation of those Arbitrable Disputes shall be stayed pending the outcome of any individual disputes in arbitration. 
 (b) The Arbitration shall take place at the office of JAMS that is nearest to the location where Employee last worked for the Company in accordance with the JAMS Employment Arbitration Rules & Procedures then in effect JAMS Rules (or, if Employee is employed outside of California at the time of the termination of Employee s employment, at the nearest location of the American Arbitration Association AAA and in accordance with the AAA Employment Arbitration Rules and Mediation Procedures then in effect AAA Rules )), copies of which are available at www.jamsadr.com tel 800.352.5267 and www.adr.org tel 800.778.7879, before a single experienced employment arbitrator selected in accordance with those rules. 
 (c) The Arbitrator may not modify or change this Agreement in any way. The Company will be responsible for paying any filing fee and the fees and costs of the Arbitrator provided, however, that if Employee is the party initiating the claim, Employee will contribute an amount equal to the filing fee that would be paid to initiate a claim in the court of general jurisdiction in the state in which Employee is employed by the Company, unless a lower fee amount would be owed by Employee pursuant to the JAMS Rules (or AAA Rules, as applicable) or applicable law. Each Party shall pay for its own costs and attorneys fees and pay any costs that are not unique to arbitration (i.e., cost that each party would incur if the claim(s) were litigated in a court, such as costs to subpoena witnesses and or documents, take depositions and purchase deposition transcripts, copy documents, etc.), if any. However if any party prevails on a statutory claim which affords the prevailing party attorneys fees and costs, or if there is a written agreement providing for attorneys fees and or costs, the Arbitrator may award reasonable attorney s fees and or costs to the prevailing party, applying the same standards a court would apply under the law applicable to the claim. 
 (d) The Arbitrator shall apply the Federal Rules of Evidence and shall have the authority to entertain a motion to dismiss or a motion for summary judgment by any party and shall apply the standards governing such motions under the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure. The Arbitrator is required to issue a written award and opinion setting forth the essential findings and conclusions on which the award is based, and any judgment or award issued by the Arbitrator may be entered in any court of competent jurisdiction. The Arbitrator does not have the authority to consider, certify, or hear an arbitration as a class action, collective action, or any other type of representative action. In addition, unless all parties agree in writing 
 A-6 

otherwise, the Arbitrator shall not consolidate or join the arbitrations of one or more than one individual. Neither party may seek, nor may the Arbitrator award, any relief that is not individualized to the claimant or that affects other individuals. The Arbitrator may award declaratory or injunctive relief only in favor of the individual party seeking relief and only to the extent necessary to provide relief warranted by that Party s individual claims. 
 (e) Employee and the Company recognize that this agreement to arbitrate arises out of or concerns interstate commerce and that the Federal Arbitration Act shall govern the arbitration and the interpretation or enforcement of this section or any arbitration award. If a court decides that applicable law does not permit the enforcement of any of this section s limitations as to a particular claim or any particular remedy for a claim, then that claim or particular remedy (and only that claim or particular remedy) must be severed from the arbitration and may be brought in court. To the extent that the Federal Arbitration Act is inapplicable, California law pertaining to arbitration agreements shall apply. Arbitration in this manner shall be the exclusive remedy for any Arbitrable Dispute. Except as prohibited by the Age Discrimination in Employment Act of 1967, as amended, should Employee or the Company attempt to resolve an Arbitrable Dispute by any method other than arbitration pursuant to this section, the responding party will be entitled to recover from the initiating party all damages, expenses, and attorneys fees incurred as a result of this breach. This Section 13 supersedes any existing arbitration agreement between the Company and Employee as to any Arbitrable Dispute (as defined herein). Notwithstanding anything in this Section 13 to the contrary, a claim for benefits under an Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, as amended, covered plan shall not be an Arbitrable Dispute. 
 15. Effective Date . The Parties understand and agree that this Agreement is final and binding eight (8) days after its execution and return (the Effective Date ). Should Employee nevertheless attempt to challenge the enforceability of this Agreement as provided in Section 13 or, in violation of that section, through litigation, as a further limitation on any right to make such a challenge, Employee shall initially tender to the Company, by certified check delivered to the Company, all monies received pursuant to Section 4 or 5 of the Severance Pay Agreement, as applicable, plus interest, and invite the Company to retain such monies and agree with Employee to cancel this Agreement and void the Company s obligations under the Severance Pay Agreement. In the event the Company accepts this offer, the Company shall retain such monies and this Agreement shall be canceled and the Company shall have no obligation under Section 14(e) of the Severance Pay Agreement. In the event the Company does not accept such offer, the Company shall so notify Employee and shall place such monies in an interest-bearing escrow account pending resolution of the dispute between Employee and the Company as to whether or not this Agreement and the Company s obligations under the Severance Pay Agreement shall be set aside and or otherwise rendered voidable or unenforceable. Additionally, any consulting agreement then in effect between Employee and the Company shall be immediately rescinded with no requirement of notice. 
 16. Notices . Any notices required to be given under this Agreement shall be delivered either personally or by first class United States mail, postage prepaid, addressed to the respective parties and shall be effective upon receipt as follows

 (b) The Pre-Change in Control Severance Payment or the Post-Change in Control Severance Payment (whichever is applicable) payable under this Agreement shall not be reduced under Section 8(a) if 
 (i) such reduction in such Payment is not sufficient to cause no portion of any Payment to be subject to the Excise Tax, or 
 (ii) the Net After-Tax Unreduced Payments (as defined below) would equal or exceed one hundred five percent (105 of the Net After-Tax Reduced Payments (as defined below). 
 For purposes of determining the amount of any Reduced Payment under Section 8(a), and the Net-After Tax Reduced Payments and the Net After-Tax Unreduced Payments, the Executive shall be considered to pay federal, state and local income and employment taxes at the Executive s applicable marginal rates taking into consideration any reduction in federal income taxes which could be obtained from the deduction of state and local income taxes, and any 
 14

 (ii) next, if after the reduction described in Section 8(c)(i), additional reductions are required, then by reducing the cash portion of the Payment that constitutes deferred compensation (within the meaning of Section 409A) subject to Section 409A, with the reductions to be applied first to the portion of the Payment scheduled for the latest distribution date, and then applied to distributions scheduled for progressively earlier distribution dates, to the extent necessary to decrease the Payment as required under this Section 8 and 
 (iii) next, if after the reduction described in Section 8(c)(ii), additional reductions are required, then, by reducing the non-cash portion of the Payment that constitutes deferred compensation (within the meaning of Section 409A) subject to Section 409A, with the reductions to be applied first to the portion of the Payment scheduled for the latest distribution date, and then applied to distributions scheduled for progressively earlier distribution dates, to the extent necessary to decrease the Payment as required under this Section 8. 
 (d) The following definitions shall apply for purposes of this Section 8 
 (i) Net After-Tax Reduced Payments shall mean the total amount of all Payments that the Executive would retain, on a Net After-Tax Basis, in the event that the Payments payable under this Agreement are reduced pursuant to Section 8(a). 
 (ii) Net After-Tax Unreduced Payments shall mean the total amount of all Payments that the Executive would retain, on a Net After-Tax Basis, in the event that the Payments payable under this Agreement are not reduced pursuant to Section 8(a). 
 (iii) Net After-Tax Basis shall mean, with respect to the Payments, either with or without reduction under Section 8(a) (as applicable), the amount that would be retained by the Executive from such Payments after the payment of all Taxes.

The Accounting Firm shall provide detailed supporting calculations to both the Company and the Executive within fifteen (15) business days of the receipt of notice from the Executive that there has been a Payment or such earlier time as is requested by the Company. All fees and expenses of the Accounting Firm shall be borne solely by the Company. Any determination by the Accounting Firm shall be binding upon the Company and the Executive. For purposes of determining whether and the extent to which the Payments will be subject to the Excise Tax, (i) no portion of the Payments the receipt or enjoyment of which the Executive shall have waived at such time and in such manner as not to constitute a payment within the meaning of Section 280G(b) of the Code shall be taken into account, (ii) no portion of the Payments shall be taken into account 
 15 

which, in the written opinion of the Accounting Firm, does not constitute a parachute payment within the meaning of Section 280G(b)(2) of the Code (including by reason of Section 280G(b)(4)(A) of the Code) and, in calculating the Excise Tax, no portion of such Payments shall be taken into account which, in the opinion of the Accounting Firm, constitutes reasonable compensation for services actually rendered, within the meaning of Section 280G(b)(4)(B) of the Code, in excess of the base amount (as defined in Section 280G(b)(3) of the Code) allocable to such reasonable compensation, and (iii) the value of any non-cash benefit or any deferred payment or benefit included in the Payments shall be determined by the Accounting Firm in accordance with the principles of Section 280G(d)(3) and (4) of the Code.

In no event shall the Executive be obligated to seek other employment or take any other action by way of mitigation of the amounts (including amounts for damages for breach) payable to the Executive under any of the provisions of this Agreement, and such amounts shall not be reduced whether or not the Executive obtains other employment. 
 Section 13. Dispute Resolution and Arbitration .

Any Arbitrable Dispute will be decided by an arbitrator through individual arbitration and not by way of court or jury trial. Sempra Energy and the Executive waive any right to a jury trial or a court bench trial . 
 (b) Sempra Energy and the Executive agree to bring any dispute in arbitration in an individual capacity only

Notwithstanding any other provision of this agreement to arbitrate or the JAMS Rules, the scope, applicability, enforceability, revocability or validity of this Representative PAGA Waiver may be resolved only by a court of competent jurisdiction and not by an arbitrator. If any provision of this representative PAGA Waiver is found to be unenforceable or unlawful for any reason, the unenforceable provision shall be severed from this Dispute Resolution provision, and any such representative PAGA claims or other representative private attorneys general act claims must be litigated in a court of competent jurisdiction and not in arbitration. To the extent that there are any Arbitrable Disputes to be litigated in a court of competent jurisdiction because a court determines that the Representative PAGA Waiver is unenforceable with respect to those disputes, the Parties agree that litigation of those Arbitrable Disputes shall be stayed pending the outcome of any individual disputes in arbitration. 
 
 (c) Arbitration shall take place at the office of JAMS (or, if the Executive is employed outside of California, the American Arbitration Association AAA )) nearest to the location where the Executive last worked for the Company.

However, the Executive will be responsible for contributing up to any amount equal to the filing fee that would be paid to initiate the claim in a court of general jurisdiction in the state in which the Executive is employed, unless a lower fee amount would be owed by the Executive pursuant to the JAMS Rules (or AAA rules, as applicable) or applicable law. Subject to Section 15 of this Agreement, each party shall pay its own attorneys fees and pay any costs that are not unique to arbitration (i.e., costs that each party would incur if the claim(s) were litigated in a court, such as costs to subpoena witnesses and or documents, take depositions and purchase deposition transcripts, copy documents, etc.). However, subject to Section 15 of this Agreement, if any party prevails on a statutory claim that authorizes an award of attorneys fees to the prevailing party, or if there is a written agreement providing for attorneys fees, the arbitrator may award reasonable attorneys fees to the prevailing party, applying the same standards a court would apply under the law applicable to the claim. 
 (e) The arbitrator shall apply the Federal Rules of Evidence, shall have the authority to entertain a motion to dismiss or a motion for summary judgment by any party, and shall apply the standards governing such motions under the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure. The arbitrator is required to issue a written award and opinion setting forth the essential findings and conclusions on which the award is based, and any judgment or award issued by an arbitrator may be entered in any court of competent jurisdiction. The arbitrator does not have the authority to consider, certify, or hear an arbitration as a class action, collective action, or any other type of representative action. In addition, unless all parties agree in writing otherwise, the arbitrator shall not consolidate or join the arbitrations of one or more than one individual. Neither party may seek, nor may the arbitrator award, any relief that is not individualized to the claimant or that affects other individuals. The arbitrator may award declaratory or injunctive relief only in favor of the individual party seeking relief and only to the extent necessary to provide relief warranted by that party s individual claims. Sempra Energy and the Executive recognize that this agreement to arbitrate arises out of or concerns interstate commerce and that the Federal Arbitration Act shall govern the arbitration and shall govern the interpretation or enforcement of this Agreement or any arbitration award. 
 18 

(f) If a court decides that applicable law does not permit the enforcement of any of this section s limitations as to a particular claim or any particular remedy for a claim, then that claim or particular remedy (and only that claim or particular remedy) must be severed from the arbitration and may be brought in court.

 (b) Governmental Reporting .

The Executive cannot and will not be held criminally or civilly liable under any federal or state trade secret law for disclosing otherwise protected trade secrets and or confidential or proprietary information so long as the disclosure is made in (i) confidence to a federal, state, or local government official, directly or indirectly, or to an attorney and solely for the purpose of reporting or investigating a suspected violation of law or (ii) a complaint or other document filed in a lawsuit or other proceeding, so long as such filing is made under seal. The Company will not retaliate against the Executive in any way for a disclosure made pursuant to this Section 14(b). Further, in the event the Executive makes such a disclosure, and files a lawsuit against the Company alleging that the Company retaliated against the Executive because of the disclosure, the Executive may disclose the relevant trade secret or confidential information to the Executive s attorney, and may use the same in the court proceeding only if (X) the Executive ensures that any court filing that includes the trade secret or confidential information at issue is made under seal and (Y) the Executive does not otherwise disclose the trade secret or confidential information except as required by court order. 
 (c) Non-Solicitation of Employees . The Executive recognizes that the Executive possesses and will possess confidential information about other employees of Sempra Energy and its Affiliates relating to their education, experience, skills, abilities, compensation

The Executive recognizes that the information the Executive possesses and will possess about these other employees is not generally known, is of substantial value to Sempra Energy and its Affiliates in developing their business and in securing and retaining customers, and has been and will be acquired by the Executive because of the Executive s business position with Sempra Energy and its Affiliates. The Executive agrees that at all times during the Executive s employment with the Company and for a period of one (1) year thereafter, the Executive will not use such information to directly or indirectly solicit or recruit any employee of the Company or its Affiliates for the purpose of being employed by the Executive or by any competitor of the Company or its Affiliates on whose behalf the Executive is acting as an agent, representative or employee and that the Executive will not convey any such confidential information or trade secrets about other employees of Sempra Energy and its Affiliates to any other Person provided, however , that it shall not constitute a solicitation or recruitment of employment in violation of this Section 14(c) to discuss employment opportunities with any employee of the Company or its Affiliates who has either first contacted the Executive or regarding whose employment the Executive has discussed with and received the written approval of the Company s most senior officer of Human Resources (or, if such position is vacant, the Company s then Chief Executive Officer), prior to making such solicitation or recruitment. In view of the nature of the Executive s employment with the Company, the Executive likewise agrees that Sempra Energy and its Affiliates would be irreparably harmed by any solicitation or recruitment in violation of the terms of this Section 14(c) and that Sempra Energy and its Affiliates shall therefore be entitled to preliminary and or permanent injunctive relief prohibiting the Executive from engaging in any activity or threatened activity in violation of the terms of this Section 14(c) and to any other relief available to them. 
 (d) Survival of Provisions . The obligations contained in Section 14(a), (b) and (c) above shall survive the termination of the Executive s employment within the Company and shall be fully enforceable thereafter to the same extent that it was enforceable prior to such termination.

(l) The Company will pay Employee a lump sum payment of ______________________ , less applicable withholdings, pursuant to Section 4 5 of the Severance Pay Agreement.

For the avoidance of doubt, the value of the services set forth in Sections 4(c), (d) and (e) of the Severance Pay Agreement shall not be subject to liquidation or exchange for any other benefit. 
 3. Tax Consequences . The Company makes no representations or warranties with respect to the tax consequences of the payments and any other consideration provided to Employee or made on Employee s behalf under the terms of this Agreement. Employee agrees and understands that Employee is responsible for payment, if any, of local, state, and or federal taxes on the payments and any other consideration provided hereunder by the Company and any penalties or assessments thereon. Employee further agrees to indemnify and hold the Company and its affiliates harmless from any claims, demands, deficiencies, penalties, interest, assessments, executions, judgments, or recoveries by any government agency against the Company or any of its affiliates for any amounts claimed due on account of (a) Employee s failure to pay or delayed payment of federal or state taxes, or (b) damages sustained by the Company or any of its affiliates by reason of any such claims, including reasonable attorneys fees and costs 
 4. Release of Claims . As a material inducement for the payment of the severance and benefits of the Severance Pay Agreement, and except as otherwise provided in this Agreement, Employee, on behalf of him herself and on behalf of his her heirs, family members, executors, agents and assigns, hereby irrevocably and unconditionally releases, acquits and forever discharges the Company Releasees from any and all Claims he she has or may have. For purposes of this Agreement and the preceding sentence, the words Releasee or Releasees and Claim or Claims shall have the meanings set forth below 
 (a) Company Releasees shall refer to (i) the Company, (ii) each of the Company s owners, stockholders, predecessors, successors, assigns, agents, directors, officers, employees, representatives, attorneys, advisors, and affiliates (including parent companies, divisions, and subsidiaries), (iii) agents, directors, officers, employees, representatives, attorneys and advisors of such affiliates (including parent companies, divisions, and subsidiaries), and (iv) all persons and entities acting by, through, under or in concert with any of them 
 (b) The words Claim or Claims shall refer to any charges, complaints, claims, liabilities, obligations, promises, agreements, controversies, damages, actions, causes of action, suits, rights, demands, costs, losses, debts and expenses (including attorneys fees and costs actually incurred) of any nature whatsoever, known or unknown, suspected or unsuspected, which Employee had or may have, own or hold against any of the Company Releasees through and including the Effective Date that in any way arise out of, relate to, or are in connection with Employee s employment relationship with the Company and its affiliates and the termination of that relationship, including, without limitation, all rights arising out of alleged violations of any contracts, express or implied, including the Severance Pay Agreement any tort claim any legal 
 A-2 

restrictions on the Company s right to terminate employment relationships and any federal, state or other governmental statute, regulation, law or ordinance, including common law principles, governing the employment relationship including, without limitation, all laws and regulations prohibiting discrimination or harassment based on protected categories, and all laws and regulations prohibiting retaliation against employees, including retaliation for engaging in protected activity or legal off-duty conduct. This release does not extend to claims for workers compensation or other claims which by law may not be waived or released by this Agreement, nor does it limit Employee s right to receive any vested payments or benefits to which he she is entitled under any Company (including its affiliates) benefit plan (including, without limitation, any of the Company s (including its affiliates) qualified retirement plans or non-qualified deferred compensation plan), which payments or benefits will be paid or provided pursuant to the terms of the applicable governing documents. 
 5. Release of Unknown Claims. Employee expressly waives and relinquishes all rights and benefits afforded by any statute (including, but not limited to, Section 1542 of the Civil Code of the State of California and analogous laws of other states), which limits the effect of a release with respect to unknown claims. Employee does so understanding and acknowledging the significance of the release of unknown claims and the waiver of statutory protection against a release of unknown claims (including, but not limited to, Section 1542). Section 1542 of the Civil Code of the State of California states as follows 
 A GENERAL RELEASE DOES NOT EXTEND TO CLAIMS WHICH THE CREDITOR OR RELEASING PARTY DOES NOT KNOW OR SUSPECT TO EXIST IN HIS OR HER FAVOR AT THE TIME OF EXECUTING THE RELEASE AND THAT, IF KNOWN BY HIM OR HER, WOULD HAVE MATERIALLY AFFECTED HIS OR HER SETTLEMENT WITH THE DEBTOR OR RELEASED PARTY. 
 Thus, notwithstanding the provisions of Section 1542 or of any similar statute, and for the purpose of implementing a full and complete release and discharge of the Company Releasees, Employee expressly acknowledges that this Agreement is intended to include in its effect, without limitation, all Claims which are known and all Claims which Employee does not know or suspect to exist in Employee s favor at the time of execution of this Agreement and that this Agreement contemplates the extinguishment of all such Claims. Employee acknowledges that he she might hereafter discover facts different from, or in addition to, those Employee now knows or believes to be true with respect to a Claim or Claims released herein, and they expressly agree to assume the risk of possible discovery of additional or different facts, and agree that this Agreement shall be and remain effective, in all respects, regardless of such additional or different discovered facts. 
 6. Covenant Not to Sue . Employee agrees that Employee will not file any suit, claim, proceeding or complaint against any Company Releasees arising out of or in connection with any Claims released herein, except as required to enforce the terms of this Agreement. Employee s right to file or participate in an administrative claim or investigation by the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission, or any other local, state, or federal administrative body or government agency against the Company, which is guaranteed by law, cannot be and is not waived. However, to the extent permitted by law, and except as to Securities and Exchange Commission whistleblower awards, Employee agrees that if such an administrative claim is made against any Company Releasee(s) on Employee s behalf, Employee shall not be entitled to recover any individual monetary relief or other individual remedies beyond the separation benefits identified in this Agreement. 
 A-3 

7. No Pending Lawsuits . Employee represents and warrants that Employee does not have any lawsuits, charges, claims, grievances, or actions of any kind pending against any Company Releasees arising out of or in connection with any Claims released herein, by or on behalf of Employee or on behalf of any other person or entity, and that, to the best of Employee s knowledge, Employee possess no such claims (including, but not limited to, under the Family and Medical Leave Act, the Age Discrimination in Employment Act, the California Family Rights Act, the Fair Labor Standards Act, the California Labor Code and or workers compensation claims). Employee further acknowledges that he she is not aware of, or has fully disclosed to the Company, any information that could reasonably give rise to such a claim, cause of action, lawsuit or proceeding against any Company Releasee(s). 
 8. No Cooperation . Employee agrees that he she will not knowingly encourage, counsel, or assist any attorneys or their clients in the presentation or prosecution of any disputes, differences, grievances, claims, charges, or complaints by any third party against any Company Releasee(s) arising out or in connection with any Claims released herein, unless under a subpoena or other court order to do so. Employee agrees to immediately notify the Company upon receipt of any such subpoena or court order, and to furnish to the Company, within three (3) business days of its receipt, a copy of such subpoena or other court order. 
 9. Payment of Salary and Receipt of All Benefits . Employee acknowledges and represents that, except as provided in this Agreement, the Company has fully paid or provided Employee all salary, wages, bonuses, accrued vacation paid time off, premiums, leaves, housing allowances, relocation costs, interest, severance, outplacement costs, fees, reimbursable expenses, commissions or other incentive compensation, stock, stock options, vesting, and any and all other benefits and compensation due to Employee. Employee specifically represents that Employee is not owed any further sum by way of reimbursement from the Company or any of its affiliates. To the extent Employee claims that additional wages are or may become owed to Employee, there is a good faith dispute based in law and fact over whether any wages in excess of the wages already paid to Employee are or will be due, and thus California Labor Code Section 206.5 is inapplicable. 
 10. Indemnification . 
 (o) As a further material inducement to the Company to enter into this Agreement, Employee hereby agrees to indemnify and hold each of the Company Releasees harmless from all loss, costs, damages, or expenses, including without limitation, reasonable attorneys fees incurred by the Company Releasees, arising out of any breach of this Agreement by Employee or the fact that any representation made in this Agreement by Employee was false when made. As a further material inducement to Employee to enter into this Agreement, the Company hereby agrees to indemnify and hold each of the Company Releasees harmless from all loss, costs, damages, or expenses, including without limitation, reasonable attorneys fees incurred by the Company Releasees, arising out of any breach of this Agreement by the Company or the fact that any representation made in this Agreement by the Company was knowingly false when made. 
 (p) If Employee is a party or is threatened to be made a party to any proceeding by reason of the fact that Employee was an employee, officer or director of the Company or any of its affiliates, the Company shall indemnify and hold harmless Employee against any expenses (including reasonable attorneys fees, provided , that counsel has been approved by the Company, which approval shall not be unreasonably withheld), judgments, fines, settlements and other amounts actually or reasonably incurred by Employee in connection with that proceeding, and provided, that Employee acted in good faith and in a manner Employee reasonably believed to be in the best interest of the Company. The limitations of Section 317 of the Corporations Code of the State of California shall apply to this assurance of indemnification. 
 A-4 

Notwithstanding the foregoing or any other provision contained herein, this Agreement shall not supersede or in any way limit any (i) indemnification arrangements in favor of the Employee under the Company s or any of its affiliates charter documents or bylaws or pursuant to any agreement between the Employee and the Company or any of the Company s affiliates or (ii) the provision of insurance against insurable events which occurred while the Executive was a director or officer of the Company, in each as provided by and subject to the limitations set forth in Section 10 of the Severance Pay Agreement. 
 11. No Admission of Liability . 
 The Parties understand and acknowledge that no action taken by either Party in connection hereto, either previously or in connection with this Agreement, shall be deemed or construed to be (i) an admission of the truth or falsity of any actual or potential claims, or (ii) an acknowledgement or admission by either Party of any fault or liability whatsoever to the other Party or to any third party. This Agreement shall not in any way be construed as an admission by the Company that it has acted wrongfully with respect to Employee or any other person or entity, or that Employee has any rights whatsoever against the Company, and the Company specifically disclaims any liability to or wrongful acts against Employee or any other person or entity, on the part of itself, its employees or its agents. This Agreement shall not in any way be construed as an admission by Employee that Employee has acted wrongfully with respect to the Company, or that Employee failed to perform Employee s duties or negligently performed or breached Employee s duties, or that the Company had good cause to terminate Employee s employment. 
 12. Cooperation in Litigation . Employee agrees to cooperate with the Company and its affiliates and their respective designated attorneys, representatives and agents in connection with any actual or threatened judicial, administrative or other legal or equitable proceeding in which the Company or any of the Company s affiliates is or may become involved. Upon reasonable notice, Employee agrees to meet with and provide to the Company and its affiliates and their respective designated attorneys, representatives or agents all information and knowledge Employee has relating to the subject matter of any such proceeding. The Company agrees to reimburse Employee for any reasonable costs Employee incurs in providing such cooperation. 
 13. Governing Law. This Agreement is entered into in state and, except as provided in this section, shall be governed by substantive state law. 
 14. Arbitration of Disputes . If any dispute arises between Employee and the Company relating to this Agreement, including any dispute regarding the interpretation, enforceability, or validity of this Agreement Arbitrable Dispute ), the Partie s agree to resolve that Arbitrable Dispute through final and binding arbitration under this section. Employee also agrees to arbitrate any Arbitrable Dispute which also involves any other Company Releasee who offers or agrees to arbitrate the dispute under this section. 
 (q) Any Arbitrable Dispute will be decided by an arbitrator though individual arbitration, and Employee and the Company waive any right to a jury trial or a court bench trial . Employee and the Company also waive the right for any dispute to be brought, maintained, decided or arbitrated as a class and or collective action and the arbitrator shall have no authority to hear or preside over any such action Class Action Waiver ). Further, Arbitrable Disputes must be brought in the individual capacity of the party asserting the claim, Employee and the Company are waiving the right to pursue or have a dispute resolved as a plaintiff or class member in any purported class, collective or representative proceeding.

 A-5 

Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, to the fullest extent permitted by law, Employee and the Company (1) agree not to bring a representative action on behalf of others under the Private Attorneys General Act of 2004 PAGA ), California Labor Code 2698 et seq ., in any court or in arbitration, and (2) agree that, for any claim brought on a private attorney general basis, including under the California PAGA, any such dispute shall be resolved in arbitration on an individual basis only i.e ., to resolve whether Employee has personally been aggrieved or subject to any violations of law), and that such an action may not be used to resolve the claims or rights of other individuals in a single or collective proceeding (collectively, Representative PAGA Waiver ). Notwithstanding any other provision of this arbitration agreement or the JAMS Rules, the scope, applicability, enforceability, revocability or validity of this Representative PAGA Waiver may be resolved only by a court of competent jurisdiction and not by an arbitrator. If any provision of this representative PAGA Waiver is found to be unenforceable or unlawful for any reason, the unenforceable provision shall be severed from this Dispute Resolution provision, and any such representative PAGA claims or other representative private attorneys general act claims must be litigated in a court of competent jurisdiction and not in arbitration. To the extent that there are any Arbitrable Disputes to be litigated in a court of competent jurisdiction because a court determines that the representative PAGA Waiver is unenforceable with respect to those disputes, the Parties agree that litigation of those Arbitrable Disputes shall be stayed pending the outcome of any individual disputes in arbitration.

Each Party shall pay for its own costs and attorneys fees and pay any costs that are not unique to arbitration (i.e., cost that each party would incur if the claim(s) were litigated in a court, such as costs to subpoena witnesses and or documents, take depositions and purchase deposition transcripts, copy documents, etc.), if any. However if any party prevails on a statutory claim which affords the prevailing party attorneys fees and costs, or if there is a written agreement providing for attorneys fees and or costs, the Arbitrator may award reasonable attorney s fees and or costs to the prevailing party, applying the same standards a court would apply under the law applicable to the claim. 
 (t) The Arbitrator shall apply the Federal Rules of Evidence and shall have the authority to entertain a motion to dismiss or a motion for summary judgment by any party and shall apply the standards governing such motions under the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure. The Arbitrator is required to issue a written award and opinion setting forth the essential findings and conclusions on which the award is based, and any judgment or award issued by the Arbitrator may be entered in any court of competent jurisdiction. The Arbitrator does not have the authority to consider, certify, or hear an arbitration as a class action, collective action, or any other type of representative action. In addition, unless all parties agree in writing 
 A-6 

otherwise, the Arbitrator shall not consolidate or join the arbitrations of one or more than one individual. Neither party may seek, nor may the Arbitrator award, any relief that is not individualized to the claimant or that affects other individuals. The Arbitrator may award declaratory or injunctive relief only in favor of the individual party seeking relief and only to the extent necessary to provide relief warranted by that Party s individual claims. 
 (u) Employee and the Company recognize that this agreement to arbitrate arises out of or concerns interstate commerce and that the Federal Arbitration Act shall govern the arbitration and the interpretation or enforcement of this section or any arbitration award. If a court decides that applicable law does not permit the enforcement of any of this section s limitations as to a particular claim or any particular remedy for a claim, then that claim or particular remedy (and only that claim or particular remedy) must be severed from the arbitration and may be brought in court. To the extent that the Federal Arbitration Act is inapplicable, California law pertaining to arbitration agreements shall apply. Arbitration in this manner shall be the exclusive remedy for any Arbitrable Dispute. Except as prohibited by the Age Discrimination in Employment Act of 1967, as amended, should Employee or the Company attempt to resolve an Arbitrable Dispute by any method other than arbitration pursuant to this section, the responding party will be entitled to recover from the initiating party all damages, expenses, and attorneys fees incurred as a result of this breach. This Section 13 supersedes any existing arbitration agreement between the Company and Employee as to any Arbitrable Dispute (as defined herein). Notwithstanding anything in this Section 13 to the contrary, a claim for benefits under an Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, as amended, covered plan shall not be an Arbitrable Dispute. 
 15. Effective Date . The Parties understand and agree that this Agreement is final and binding eight (8) days after its execution and return (the Effective Date ). Should Employee nevertheless attempt to challenge the enforceability of this Agreement as provided in Section 13 or, in violation of that section, through litigation, as a further limitation on any right to make such a challenge, Employee shall initially tender to the Company, by certified check delivered to the Company, all monies received pursuant to Section 4 or 5 of the Severance Pay Agreement, as applicable, plus interest, and invite the Company to retain such monies and agree with Employee to cancel this Agreement and void the Company s obligations under the Severance Pay Agreement. In the event the Company accepts this offer, the Company shall retain such monies and this Agreement shall be canceled and the Company shall have no obligation under Section 14(e) of the Severance Pay Agreement. In the event the Company does not accept such offer, the Company shall so notify Employee and shall place such monies in an interest-bearing escrow account pending resolution of the dispute between Employee and the Company as to whether or not this Agreement and the Company s obligations under the Severance Pay Agreement shall be set aside and or otherwise rendered voidable or unenforceable. Additionally, any consulting agreement then in effect between Employee and the Company shall be immediately rescinded with no requirement of notice.

been aggrieved or subject to any violations of law), and that such an action may not be used to resolve the claims or rights of other individuals in a single or collective proceeding (collectively, Representative PAGA Waiver ). Notwithstanding any other provision of this agreement to arbitrate or the JAMS Rules, the scope, applicability, enforceability, revocability or validity of this Representative PAGA Waiver may be resolved only by a court of competent jurisdiction and not by an arbitrator. If any provision of this representative PAGA Waiver is found to be unenforceable or unlawful for any reason, the unenforceable provision shall be severed from this Dispute Resolution provision, and any such representative PAGA claims or other representative private attorneys general act claims must be litigated in a court of competent jurisdiction and not in arbitration. To the extent that there are any Arbitrable Disputes to be litigated in a court of competent jurisdiction because a court determines that the Representative PAGA Waiver is unenforceable with respect to those disputes, the Parties agree that litigation of those Arbitrable Disputes shall be stayed pending the outcome of any individual disputes in arbitration. 
 
 (c) Arbitration shall take place at the office of JAMS (or, if the Executive is employed outside of California, the American Arbitration Association AAA )) nearest to the location where the Executive last worked for the Company. Except to the extent it conflicts with the rules and procedures set forth in this Agreement, arbitration shall be conducted in accordance with the JAMS Employment Arbitration Rules & Procedures then in effect JAMS Rules (if the Executive is employed outside of California, the AAA Employment Arbitration Rules & Mediation Procedures AAA Rules )), copies of which are available at www.jamsadr.com tel 800.352.5267 and www.adr.org tel 800.778.7879, before a single experienced, neutral employment arbitrator selected in accordance with those rules. 
 (d) Sempra Energy will be responsible for paying any filing fee and the fees and costs of the arbitrator. However, the Executive will be responsible for contributing up to any amount equal to the filing fee that would be paid to initiate the claim in a court of general jurisdiction in the state in which the Executive is employed, unless a lower fee amount would be owed by the Executive pursuant to the JAMS Rules (or AAA rules, as applicable) or applicable law. Subject to Section 15 of this Agreement, each party shall pay its own attorneys fees and pay any costs that are not unique to arbitration (i.e., costs that each party would incur if the claim(s) were litigated in a court, such as costs to subpoena witnesses and or documents, take depositions and purchase deposition transcripts, copy documents, etc.). However, subject to Section 15 of this Agreement, if any party prevails on a statutory claim that authorizes an award of attorneys fees to the prevailing party, or if there is a written agreement providing for attorneys fees, the arbitrator may award reasonable attorneys fees to the prevailing party, applying the same standards a court would apply under the law applicable to the claim. 
 (e) The arbitrator shall apply the Federal Rules of Evidence, shall have the authority to entertain a motion to dismiss or a motion for summary judgment by any party, and shall apply the standards governing such motions under the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure. The arbitrator is required to issue a written award and opinion setting forth the essential findings and conclusions on which the award is based, and any judgment or award issued by an arbitrator may be entered in any court of competent jurisdiction. The arbitrator does not have the authority to consider, certify, or hear an arbitration as a class action, collective action, or any other type of representative action. In addition, unless all parties agree in writing otherwise, the arbitrator shall not consolidate or join the arbitrations of one or more than one individual. Neither party may seek, nor may the arbitrator award, any relief that is not individualized to the claimant or that affects other individuals. The arbitrator may award declaratory or injunctive relief only in favor of the individual party seeking relief and only to the extent necessary to provide relief warranted by that party s individual claims. Sempra Energy and the Executive recognize that this agreement to arbitrate arises out of or concerns interstate commerce and that the Federal Arbitration Act shall govern the arbitration and shall govern the interpretation or enforcement of this Agreement or any arbitration award. 
 18 

(f) If a court decides that applicable law does not permit the enforcement of any of this section s limitations as to a particular claim or any particular remedy for a claim, then that claim or particular remedy (and only that claim or particular remedy) must be severed from the arbitration and may be brought in court.

The Executive understands and agrees that all Proprietary Information has been divulged to the Executive in confidence and further understands and agrees to keep all Proprietary Information secret and confidential (except for such information which is or becomes publicly available other than as a result of a breach by the Executive of this provision or information the Executive is required by law or any governmental, administrative or court order to disclose) without limitation in time.

Inquiries regarding whether specific information constitutes Proprietary Information shall be directed to the Company s most senior officer of Human Resources (or, if such position is vacant, the Company s then Chief Executive Officer) provided , that the Company shall not unreasonably classify information as Proprietary Information. 
 (b) Governmental Reporting . Nothing in this Agreement is intended to interfere with or discourage the Executive s good faith disclosure related to a suspected violation of federal or state law or regulation to any governmental agency or entity or making other disclosures that are protected under the whistleblower provisions of federal or state law or regulation. The Executive cannot and will not be held criminally or civilly liable under any federal or state trade secret law for disclosing otherwise protected trade secrets and or confidential or proprietary information so long as the disclosure is made in (i) confidence to a federal, state, or local government official, directly or indirectly, or to an attorney and solely for the purpose of reporting or investigating a suspected violation of law or (ii) a complaint or other document filed in a lawsuit or other proceeding, so long as such filing is made under seal. The Company will not retaliate against the Executive in any way for a disclosure made pursuant to this Section 14(b). Further, in the event the Executive makes such a disclosure, and files a lawsuit against the Company alleging that the Company retaliated against the Executive because of the disclosure, the Executive may disclose the relevant trade secret or confidential information to the Executive s attorney, and may use the same in the court proceeding only if (X) the Executive ensures that any court filing that includes the trade secret or confidential information at issue is made under seal and (Y) the Executive does not otherwise disclose the trade secret or confidential information except as required by court order. 
 (c) Non-Solicitation of Employees . The Executive recognizes that the Executive possesses and will possess confidential information about other employees of Sempra Energy and its Affiliates relating to their education, experience, skills, abilities, compensation

The Executive recognizes that the information the Executive possesses and will possess about these other employees is not generally known, is of substantial value to Sempra Energy and its Affiliates in developing their business and in securing and retaining customers, and has been and will be acquired by the Executive because of the Executive s business position with Sempra Energy and its Affiliates. The Executive agrees that at all times during the Executive s employment with the Company and for a period of one (1) year thereafter, the Executive will not use such information to directly or indirectly solicit or recruit any employee of the Company or its Affiliates for the purpose of being employed by the Executive or by any competitor of the Company or its Affiliates on whose behalf the Executive is acting as an agent, representative or employee and that the Executive will not convey any such confidential information or trade secrets about other employees of Sempra Energy and its Affiliates to any other Person provided, however , that it shall not constitute a solicitation or recruitment of employment in violation of this Section 14(c) to discuss employment opportunities with any employee of the Company or its Affiliates who has either first contacted the Executive or regarding whose employment the Executive has discussed with and received the written approval of the Company s most senior officer of Human Resources (or, if such position is vacant, the Company s then Chief Executive Officer), prior to making such solicitation or recruitment. In view of the nature of the Executive s employment with the Company, the Executive likewise agrees that Sempra Energy and its Affiliates would be irreparably harmed by any solicitation or recruitment in violation of the terms of this Section 14(c) and that Sempra Energy and its Affiliates shall therefore be entitled to preliminary and or permanent injunctive relief prohibiting the Executive from engaging in any activity or threatened activity in violation of the terms of this Section 14(c) and to any other relief available to them. 
 (d) Survival of Provisions . The obligations contained in Section 14(a), (b) and (c) above shall survive the termination of the Executive s employment within the Company and shall be fully enforceable thereafter to the same extent that it was enforceable prior to such termination. If it is determined by a court of competent jurisdiction in any state that any restriction in Section 14(a) or (c) above is excessive in duration or scope or is unreasonable or unenforceable under the laws of that state, it is the intention of the parties that such restriction may be modified or amended by the court to render it enforceable to the maximum extent permitted by the law of that state.

This release does not extend to claims for workers compensation or other claims which by law may not be waived or released by this Agreement, nor does it limit Employee s right to receive any vested payments or benefits to which he she is entitled under any Company (including its affiliates) benefit plan (including, without limitation, any of the Company s (including its affiliates) qualified retirement plans or non-qualified deferred compensation plan), which payments or benefits will be paid or provided pursuant to the terms of the applicable governing documents. 
 5. Release of Unknown Claims. Employee expressly waives and relinquishes all rights and benefits afforded by any statute (including, but not limited to, Section 1542 of the Civil Code of the State of California and analogous laws of other states), which limits the effect of a release with respect to unknown claims. Employee does so understanding and acknowledging the significance of the release of unknown claims and the waiver of statutory protection against a release of unknown claims (including, but not limited to, Section 1542). Section 1542 of the Civil Code of the State of California states as follows 
 A GENERAL RELEASE DOES NOT EXTEND TO CLAIMS WHICH THE CREDITOR OR RELEASING PARTY DOES NOT KNOW OR SUSPECT TO EXIST IN HIS OR HER FAVOR AT THE TIME OF EXECUTING THE RELEASE AND THAT, IF KNOWN BY HIM OR HER, WOULD HAVE MATERIALLY AFFECTED HIS OR HER SETTLEMENT WITH THE DEBTOR OR RELEASED PARTY. 
 Thus, notwithstanding the provisions of Section 1542 or of any similar statute, and for the purpose of implementing a full and complete release and discharge of the Company Releasees, Employee expressly acknowledges that this Agreement is intended to include in its effect, without limitation, all Claims which are known and all Claims which Employee does not know or suspect to exist in Employee s favor at the time of execution of this Agreement and that this Agreement contemplates the extinguishment of all such Claims. Employee acknowledges that he she might hereafter discover facts different from, or in addition to, those Employee now knows or believes to be true with respect to a Claim or Claims released herein, and they expressly agree to assume the risk of possible discovery of additional or different facts, and agree that this Agreement shall be and remain effective, in all respects, regardless of such additional or different discovered facts. 
 6. Covenant Not to Sue . Employee agrees that Employee will not file any suit, claim, proceeding or complaint against any Company Releasees arising out of or in connection with any Claims released herein, except as required to enforce the terms of this Agreement. Employee s right to file or participate in an administrative claim or investigation by the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission, or any other local, state, or federal administrative body or government agency against the Company, which is guaranteed by law, cannot be and is not waived. However, to the extent permitted by law, and except as to Securities and Exchange Commission whistleblower awards, Employee agrees that if such an administrative claim is made against any Company Releasee(s) on Employee s behalf, Employee shall not be entitled to recover any individual monetary relief or other individual remedies beyond the separation benefits identified in this Agreement. 
 A-3 

7. No Pending Lawsuits . Employee represents and warrants that Employee does not have any lawsuits, charges, claims, grievances, or actions of any kind pending against any Company Releasees arising out of or in connection with any Claims released herein, by or on behalf of Employee or on behalf of any other person or entity, and that, to the best of Employee s knowledge, Employee possess no such claims (including, but not limited to, under the Family and Medical Leave Act, the Age Discrimination in Employment Act, the California Family Rights Act, the Fair Labor Standards Act, the California Labor Code and or workers compensation claims). Employee further acknowledges that he she is not aware of, or has fully disclosed to the Company, any information that could reasonably give rise to such a claim, cause of action, lawsuit or proceeding against any Company Releasee(s). 
 8. No Cooperation . Employee agrees that he she will not knowingly encourage, counsel, or assist any attorneys or their clients in the presentation or prosecution of any disputes, differences, grievances, claims, charges, or complaints by any third party against any Company Releasee(s) arising out or in connection with any Claims released herein, unless under a subpoena or other court order to do so. Employee agrees to immediately notify the Company upon receipt of any such subpoena or court order, and to furnish to the Company, within three (3) business days of its receipt, a copy of such subpoena or other court order. 
 9. Payment of Salary and Receipt of All Benefits . Employee acknowledges and represents that, except as provided in this Agreement, the Company has fully paid or provided Employee all salary, wages, bonuses, accrued vacation paid time off, premiums, leaves, housing allowances, relocation costs, interest, severance, outplacement costs, fees, reimbursable expenses, commissions or other incentive compensation, stock, stock options, vesting, and any and all other benefits and compensation due to Employee. Employee specifically represents that Employee is not owed any further sum by way of reimbursement from the Company or any of its affiliates. To the extent Employee claims that additional wages are or may become owed to Employee, there is a good faith dispute based in law and fact over whether any wages in excess of the wages already paid to Employee are or will be due, and thus California Labor Code Section 206.5 is inapplicable. 
 10. Indemnification . 
 (a) As a further material inducement to the Company to enter into this Agreement, Employee hereby agrees to indemnify and hold each of the Company Releasees harmless from all loss, costs, damages, or expenses, including without limitation, reasonable attorneys fees incurred by the Company Releasees, arising out of any breach of this Agreement by Employee or the fact that any representation made in this Agreement by Employee was false when made. As a further material inducement to Employee to enter into this Agreement, the Company hereby agrees to indemnify and hold each of the Company Releasees harmless from all loss, costs, damages, or expenses, including without limitation, reasonable attorneys fees incurred by the Company Releasees, arising out of any breach of this Agreement by the Company or the fact that any representation made in this Agreement by the Company was knowingly false when made. 
 (b) If Employee is a party or is threatened to be made a party to any proceeding by reason of the fact that Employee was an employee, officer or director of the Company or any of its affiliates, the Company shall indemnify and hold harmless Employee against any expenses (including reasonable attorneys fees, provided , that counsel has been approved by the Company, which approval shall not be unreasonably withheld), judgments, fines, settlements and other amounts actually or reasonably incurred by Employee in connection with that proceeding, and provided, that Employee acted in good faith and in a manner Employee reasonably believed to be in the best interest of the Company. The limitations of Section 317 of the Corporations Code of the State of California shall apply to this assurance of indemnification. 
 A-4

 11. No Admission of Liability . 
 The Parties understand and acknowledge that no action taken by either Party in connection hereto, either previously or in connection with this Agreement, shall be deemed or construed to be (i) an admission of the truth or falsity of any actual or potential claims, or (ii) an acknowledgement or admission by either Party of any fault or liability whatsoever to the other Party or to any third party. This Agreement shall not in any way be construed as an admission by the Company that it has acted wrongfully with respect to Employee or any other person or entity, or that Employee has any rights whatsoever against the Company, and the Company specifically disclaims any liability to or wrongful acts against Employee or any other person or entity, on the part of itself, its employees or its agents. This Agreement shall not in any way be construed as an admission by Employee that Employee has acted wrongfully with respect to the Company, or that Employee failed to perform Employee s duties or negligently performed or breached Employee s duties, or that the Company had good cause to terminate Employee s employment. 
 12. Cooperation in Litigation . Employee agrees to cooperate with the Company and its affiliates and their respective designated attorneys, representatives and agents in connection with any actual or threatened judicial, administrative or other legal or equitable proceeding in which the Company or any of the Company s affiliates is or may become involved. Upon reasonable notice, Employee agrees to meet with and provide to the Company and its affiliates and their respective designated attorneys, representatives or agents all information and knowledge Employee has relating to the subject matter of any such proceeding. The Company agrees to reimburse Employee for any reasonable costs Employee incurs in providing such cooperation. 
 13. Governing Law. This Agreement is entered into in state and, except as provided in this section, shall be governed by substantive state law . 
 14. Arbitration of Disputes . If any dispute arises between Employee and the Company relating to this Agreement, including any dispute regarding the interpretation, enforceability, or validity of this Agreement Arbitrable Dispute ), the Parties agree to resolve that Arbitrable Dispute through final and binding arbitration under this section. Employee also agrees to arbitrate any Arbitrable Dispute which also involves any other Company Releasee who offers or agrees to arbitrate the dispute under this section. 
 (a) Any Arbitrable Dispute will be decided by an arbitrator though individual arbitration, and Employee and the Company waive any right to a jury trial or a court bench trial . Employee and the Company also waive the right for any dispute to be brought, maintained, decided or arbitrated as a class and or collective action and the arbitrator shall have no authority to hear or preside over any such action Class Action Waiver ). Further, Arbitrable Disputes must be brought in the individual capacity of the party asserting the claim, Employee and the Company are waiving the right to pursue or have a dispute resolved as a plaintiff or class member in any purported class, collective or representative proceeding. To the extent the Class Action Waiver is determined to be invalid, unenforceable, or void, any class and or collective action must proceed in a court of law and not in arbitration. 
 A-5 

Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, to the fullest extent permitted by law, Employee and the Company (1) agree not to bring a representative action on behalf of others under the Private Attorneys General Act of 2004 PAGA ), California Labor Code 2698 et seq ., in any court or in arbitration, and (2) agree that, for any claim brought on a private attorney general basis, including under the California PAGA, any such dispute shall be resolved in arbitration on an individual basis only i.e ., to resolve whether Employee has personally been aggrieved or subject to any violations of law), and that such an action may not be used to resolve the claims or rights of other individuals in a single or collective proceeding (collectively, Representative PAGA Waiver ). Notwithstanding any other provision of this arbitration agreement or the JAMS Rules, the scope, applicability, enforceability, revocability or validity of this Representative PAGA Waiver may be resolved only by a court of competent jurisdiction and not by an arbitrator. If any provision of this representative PAGA Waiver is found to be unenforceable or unlawful for any reason, the unenforceable provision shall be severed from this Dispute Resolution provision, and any such representative PAGA claims or other representative private attorneys general act claims must be litigated in a court of competent jurisdiction and not in arbitration. To the extent that there are any Arbitrable Disputes to be litigated in a court of competent jurisdiction because a court determines that the representative PAGA Waiver is unenforceable with respect to those disputes, the Parties agree that litigation of those Arbitrable Disputes shall be stayed pending the outcome of any individual disputes in arbitration. 
 (b) The Arbitration shall take place at the office of JAMS that is nearest to the location where Employee last worked for the Company in accordance with the JAMS Employment Arbitration Rules & Procedures then in effect JAMS Rules (or, if Employee is employed outside of California at the time of the termination of Employee s employment, at the nearest location of the American Arbitration Association AAA and in accordance with the AAA Employment Arbitration Rules and Mediation Procedures then in effect AAA Rules )), copies of which are available at www.jamsadr.com tel 800.352.5267 and www.adr.org tel 800.778.7879, before a single experienced employment arbitrator selected in accordance with those rules. 
 (c) The Arbitrator may not modify or change this Agreement in any way. The Company will be responsible for paying any filing fee and the fees and costs of the Arbitrator provided, however, that if Employee is the party initiating the claim, Employee will contribute an amount equal to the filing fee that would be paid to initiate a claim in the court of general jurisdiction in the state in which Employee is employed by the Company, unless a lower fee amount would be owed by Employee pursuant to the JAMS Rules (or AAA Rules, as applicable) or applicable law. Each Party shall pay for its own costs and attorneys fees and pay any costs that are not unique to arbitration (i.e., cost that each party would incur if the claim(s) were litigated in a court, such as costs to subpoena witnesses and or documents, take depositions and purchase deposition transcripts, copy documents, etc.), if any. However if any party prevails on a statutory claim which affords the prevailing party attorneys fees and costs, or if there is a written agreement providing for attorneys fees and or costs, the Arbitrator may award reasonable attorney s fees and or costs to the prevailing party, applying the same standards a court would apply under the law applicable to the claim. 
 (d) The Arbitrator shall apply the Federal Rules of Evidence and shall have the authority to entertain a motion to dismiss or a motion for summary judgment by any party and shall apply the standards governing such motions under the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure. The Arbitrator is required to issue a written award and opinion setting forth the essential findings and conclusions on which the award is based, and any judgment or award issued by the Arbitrator may be entered in any court of competent jurisdiction. The Arbitrator does not have the authority to consider, certify, or hear an arbitration as a class action, collective action, or any other type of representative action. In addition, unless all parties agree in writing 
 A-6 

otherwise, the Arbitrator shall not consolidate or join the arbitrations of one or more than one individual. Neither party may seek, nor may the Arbitrator award, any relief that is not individualized to the claimant or that affects other individuals. The Arbitrator may award declaratory or injunctive relief only in favor of the individual party seeking relief and only to the extent necessary to provide relief warranted by that Party s individual claims. 
 (e) Employee and the Company recognize that this agreement to arbitrate arises out of or concerns interstate commerce and that the Federal Arbitration Act shall govern the arbitration and the interpretation or enforcement of this section or any arbitration award. If a court decides that applicable law does not permit the enforcement of any of this section s limitations as to a particular claim or any particular remedy for a claim, then that claim or particular remedy (and only that claim or particular remedy) must be severed from the arbitration and may be brought in court. To the extent that the Federal Arbitration Act is inapplicable, California law pertaining to arbitration agreements shall apply. Arbitration in this manner shall be the exclusive remedy for any Arbitrable Dispute. Except as prohibited by the Age Discrimination in Employment Act of 1967, as amended, should Employee or the Company attempt to resolve an Arbitrable Dispute by any method other than arbitration pursuant to this section, the responding party will be entitled to recover from the initiating party all damages, expenses, and attorneys fees incurred as a result of this breach. This Section 13 supersedes any existing arbitration agreement between the Company and Employee as to any Arbitrable Dispute (as defined herein). Notwithstanding anything in this Section 13 to the contrary, a claim for benefits under an Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, as amended, covered plan shall not be an Arbitrable Dispute. 
 15. Effective Date . The Parties understand and agree that this Agreement is final and binding eight (8) days after its execution and return (the Effective Date ). Should Employee nevertheless attempt to challenge the enforceability of this Agreement as provided in Section 13 or, in violation of that section, through litigation, as a further limitation on any right to make such a challenge, Employee shall initially tender to the Company, by certified check delivered to the Company, all monies received pursuant to Section 4 or 5 of the Severance Pay Agreement, as applicable, plus interest, and invite the Company to retain such monies and agree with Employee to cancel this Agreement and void the Company s obligations under the Severance Pay Agreement. In the event the Company accepts this offer, the Company shall retain such monies and this Agreement shall be canceled and the Company shall have no obligation under Section 14(e) of the Severance Pay Agreement. In the event the Company does not accept such offer, the Company shall so notify Employee and shall place such monies in an interest-bearing escrow account pending resolution of the dispute between Employee and the Company as to whether or not this Agreement and the Company s obligations under the Severance Pay Agreement shall be set aside and or otherwise rendered voidable or unenforceable. Additionally, any consulting agreement then in effect between Employee and the Company shall be immediately rescinded with no requirement of notice.

Notwithstanding any other provision of this agreement to arbitrate or the JAMS Rules, the scope, applicability, enforceability, revocability or validity of this Representative PAGA Waiver may be resolved only by a court of competent jurisdiction and not by an arbitrator. If any provision of this representative PAGA Waiver is found to be unenforceable or unlawful for any reason, the unenforceable provision shall be severed from this Dispute Resolution provision, and any such representative PAGA claims or other representative private attorneys general act claims must be litigated in a court of competent jurisdiction and not in arbitration. To the extent that there are any Arbitrable Disputes to be litigated in a court of competent jurisdiction because a court determines that the Representative PAGA Waiver is unenforceable with respect to those disputes, the Parties agree that litigation of those Arbitrable Disputes shall be stayed pending the outcome of any individual disputes in arbitration.

Subject to Section 15 of this Agreement, each party shall pay its own attorneys fees and pay any costs that are not unique to arbitration (i.e., costs that each party would incur if the claim(s) were litigated in a court, such as costs to subpoena witnesses and or documents, take depositions and purchase deposition transcripts, copy documents, etc.). However, subject to Section 15 of this Agreement, if any party prevails on a statutory claim that authorizes an award of attorneys fees to the prevailing party, or if there is a written agreement providing for attorneys fees, the arbitrator may award reasonable attorneys fees to the prevailing party, applying the same standards a court would apply under the law applicable to the claim. 
 (e) The arbitrator shall apply the Federal Rules of Evidence, shall have the authority to entertain a motion to dismiss or a motion for summary judgment by any party, and shall apply the standards governing such motions under the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure.

The arbitrator does not have the authority to consider, certify, or hear an arbitration as a class action, collective action, or any other type of representative action. In addition, unless all parties agree in writing otherwise, the arbitrator shall not consolidate or join the arbitrations of one or more than one individual. Neither party may seek, nor may the arbitrator award, any relief that is not individualized to the claimant or that affects other individuals.

The Company will not retaliate against the Executive in any way for a disclosure made pursuant to this Section 14(b). Further, in the event the Executive makes such a disclosure, and files a lawsuit against the Company alleging that the Company retaliated against the Executive because of the disclosure, the Executive may disclose the relevant trade secret or confidential information to the Executive s attorney, and may use the same in the court proceeding only if (X) the Executive ensures that any court filing that includes the trade secret or confidential information at issue is made under seal and (Y) the Executive does not otherwise disclose the trade secret or confidential information except as required by court order. 
 (c) Non-Solicitation of Employees .

The Executive agrees that at all times during the Executive s employment with the Company and for a period of one (1) year thereafter, the Executive will not use such information to directly or indirectly solicit or recruit any employee of the Company or its Affiliates for the purpose of being employed by the Executive or by any competitor of the Company or its Affiliates on whose behalf the Executive is acting as an agent, representative or employee and that the Executive will not convey any such confidential information or trade secrets about other employees of Sempra Energy and its Affiliates to any other Person provided, however , that it shall not constitute a solicitation or recruitment of employment in violation of this Section 14(c) to discuss employment opportunities with any employee of the Company or its Affiliates who has either first contacted the Executive or regarding whose employment the Executive has discussed with and received the written approval of the Company s most senior officer of Human Resources (or, if such position is vacant, the Company s then Chief Executive Officer), prior to making such solicitation or recruitment. In view of the nature of the Executive s employment with the Company, the Executive likewise agrees that Sempra Energy and its Affiliates would be irreparably harmed by any solicitation or recruitment in violation of the terms of this Section 14(c) and that Sempra Energy and its Affiliates shall therefore be entitled to preliminary and or permanent injunctive relief prohibiting the Executive from engaging in any activity or threatened activity in violation of the terms of this Section 14(c) and to any other relief available to them. 
 (d) Survival of Provisions . The obligations contained in Section 14(a), (b) and (c) above shall survive the termination of the Executive s employment within the Company and shall be fully enforceable thereafter to the same extent that it was enforceable prior to such termination.

 1. Separation Date . Employee s employment with the Company terminated at the close of business on ____________ (the Separation Date ). Employee has received his her final wages through the Separation Date, less deductions required by law, including any accrued but unused vacation, in accordance with applicable law.

The term affiliate as used herein shall include, without limitation, such Person s parent companies, divisions and subsidiaries, whether or not specified. 
 2. Severance Benefits . In exchange for Employee entering into this Agreement and not revoking it, and for the covenants and releases contained herein, the Company will provide Employee with the severance benefits described below. Employee acknowledges that the amounts and benefits set forth in this Section 2 as well as any benefits and claims not released under Section 4(b), fully satisfy any entitlement Employee may have to any payments or benefits from the Company through the Separation Date, including under the Severance Pay Agreement. Employee further acknowledges that no part of the severance payments described in this Section 2 consist of wages owed to Employee for his her employment through the Separation Date. 

(a) The Company will pay Employee a lump sum payment of ______________________ , less applicable withholdings, pursuant to Section 4 5 of the Severance Pay Agreement. Pursuant to Section 409A of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the Code ), payment will be made on the earlier of (i) the date that is six (6) months and one (1) day after the Separation Date and (ii) the date of Employee s death. 
 (b) The Company will pay Employee a lump sum payment of ___________ , less applicable withholdings, which is equal to the Consulting Payment set forth in Section 14(e) of the Severance Pay Agreement. Such payment will be made during the thirty (30) day period commencing on the earlier of (i) a date that is six (6) months and one (1) day after the Separation Date and (ii) the date of Employee s death 
 (c) The Company will also provide Employee with the severance benefits set forth in Sections 4(c), (d) and (e) of the Severance Pay Agreement. For the avoidance of doubt, the value of the services set forth in Sections 4(c), (d) and (e) of the Severance Pay Agreement shall not be subject to liquidation or exchange for any other benefit. 
 3. Tax Consequences . The Company makes no representations or warranties with respect to the tax consequences of the payments and any other consideration provided to Employee or made on Employee s behalf under the terms of this Agreement. Employee agrees and understands that Employee is responsible for payment, if any, of local, state, and or federal taxes on the payments and any other consideration provided hereunder by the Company and any penalties or assessments thereon. Employee further agrees to indemnify and hold the Company and its affiliates harmless from any claims, demands, deficiencies, penalties, interest, assessments, executions, judgments, or recoveries by any government agency against the Company or any of its affiliates for any amounts claimed due on account of (a) Employee s failure to pay or delayed payment of federal or state taxes, or (b) damages sustained by the Company or any of its affiliates by reason of any such claims, including reasonable attorneys fees and costs 
 4. Release of Claims . As a material inducement for the payment of the severance and benefits of the Severance Pay Agreement, and except as otherwise provided in this Agreement, Employee, on behalf of him herself and on behalf of his her heirs, family members, executors, agents and assigns, hereby irrevocably and unconditionally releases, acquits and forever discharges the Company Releasees from any and all Claims he she has or may have. For purposes of this Agreement and the preceding sentence, the words Releasee or Releasees and Claim or Claims shall have the meanings set forth below 
 (a) Company Releasees shall refer to (i) the Company, (ii) each of the Company s owners, stockholders, predecessors, successors, assigns, agents, directors, officers, employees, representatives, attorneys, advisors, and affiliates (including parent companies, divisions, and subsidiaries), (iii) agents, directors, officers, employees, representatives, attorneys and advisors of such affiliates (including parent companies, divisions, and subsidiaries), and (iv) all persons and entities acting by, through, under or in concert with any of them 
 (b) The words Claim or Claims shall refer to any charges, complaints, claims, liabilities, obligations, promises, agreements, controversies, damages, actions, causes of action, suits, rights, demands, costs, losses, debts and expenses (including attorneys fees and costs actually incurred) of any nature whatsoever, known or unknown, suspected or unsuspected, which Employee had or may have, own or hold against any of the Company Releasees through and including the Effective Date that in any way arise out of, relate to, or are in connection with Employee s employment relationship with the Company and its affiliates and the termination of that relationship, including, without limitation, all rights arising out of alleged violations of any contracts, express or implied, including the Severance Pay Agreement any tort claim any legal 
 A-2 

restrictions on the Company s right to terminate employment relationships and any federal, state or other governmental statute, regulation, law or ordinance, including common law principles, governing the employment relationship including, without limitation, all laws and regulations prohibiting discrimination or harassment based on protected categories, and all laws and regulations prohibiting retaliation against employees, including retaliation for engaging in protected activity or legal off-duty conduct. This release does not extend to claims for workers compensation or other claims which by law may not be waived or released by this Agreement, nor does it limit Employee s right to receive any vested payments or benefits to which he she is entitled under any Company (including its affiliates) benefit plan (including, without limitation, any of the Company s (including its affiliates) qualified retirement plans or non-qualified deferred compensation plan), which payments or benefits will be paid or provided pursuant to the terms of the applicable governing documents. 
 5. Release of Unknown Claims. Employee expressly waives and relinquishes all rights and benefits afforded by any statute (including, but not limited to, Section 1542 of the Civil Code of the State of California and analogous laws of other states), which limits the effect of a release with respect to unknown claims. Employee does so understanding and acknowledging the significance of the release of unknown claims and the waiver of statutory protection against a release of unknown claims (including, but not limited to, Section 1542). Section 1542 of the Civil Code of the State of California states as follows 
 A GENERAL RELEASE DOES NOT EXTEND TO CLAIMS WHICH THE CREDITOR OR RELEASING PARTY DOES NOT KNOW OR SUSPECT TO EXIST IN HIS OR HER FAVOR AT THE TIME OF EXECUTING THE RELEASE AND THAT, IF KNOWN BY HIM OR HER, WOULD HAVE MATERIALLY AFFECTED HIS OR HER SETTLEMENT WITH THE DEBTOR OR RELEASED PARTY. 
 Thus, notwithstanding the provisions of Section 1542 or of any similar statute, and for the purpose of implementing a full and complete release and discharge of the Company Releasees, Employee expressly acknowledges that this Agreement is intended to include in its effect, without limitation, all Claims which are known and all Claims which Employee does not know or suspect to exist in Employee s favor at the time of execution of this Agreement and that this Agreement contemplates the extinguishment of all such Claims. Employee acknowledges that he she might hereafter discover facts different from, or in addition to, those Employee now knows or believes to be true with respect to a Claim or Claims released herein, and they expressly agree to assume the risk of possible discovery of additional or different facts, and agree that this Agreement shall be and remain effective, in all respects, regardless of such additional or different discovered facts. 
 6. Covenant Not to Sue . Employee agrees that Employee will not file any suit, claim, proceeding or complaint against any Company Releasees arising out of or in connection with any Claims released herein, except as required to enforce the terms of this Agreement. Employee s right to file or participate in an administrative claim or investigation by the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission, or any other local, state, or federal administrative body or government agency against the Company, which is guaranteed by law, cannot be and is not waived. However, to the extent permitted by law, and except as to Securities and Exchange Commission whistleblower awards, Employee agrees that if such an administrative claim is made against any Company Releasee(s) on Employee s behalf, Employee shall not be entitled to recover any individual monetary relief or other individual remedies beyond the separation benefits identified in this Agreement. 
 A-3 

7. No Pending Lawsuits . Employee represents and warrants that Employee does not have any lawsuits, charges, claims, grievances, or actions of any kind pending against any Company Releasees arising out of or in connection with any Claims released herein, by or on behalf of Employee or on behalf of any other person or entity, and that, to the best of Employee s knowledge, Employee possess no such claims (including, but not limited to, under the Family and Medical Leave Act, the Age Discrimination in Employment Act, the California Family Rights Act, the Fair Labor Standards Act, the California Labor Code and or workers compensation claims). Employee further acknowledges that he she is not aware of, or has fully disclosed to the Company, any information that could reasonably give rise to such a claim, cause of action, lawsuit or proceeding against any Company Releasee(s). 
 8. No Cooperation . Employee agrees that he she will not knowingly encourage, counsel, or assist any attorneys or their clients in the presentation or prosecution of any disputes, differences, grievances, claims, charges, or complaints by any third party against any Company Releasee(s) arising out or in connection with any Claims released herein, unless under a subpoena or other court order to do so. Employee agrees to immediately notify the Company upon receipt of any such subpoena or court order, and to furnish to the Company, within three (3) business days of its receipt, a copy of such subpoena or other court order. 
 9. Payment of Salary and Receipt of All Benefits . Employee acknowledges and represents that, except as provided in this Agreement, the Company has fully paid or provided Employee all salary, wages, bonuses, accrued vacation paid time off, premiums, leaves, housing allowances, relocation costs, interest, severance, outplacement costs, fees, reimbursable expenses, commissions or other incentive compensation, stock, stock options, vesting, and any and all other benefits and compensation due to Employee. Employee specifically represents that Employee is not owed any further sum by way of reimbursement from the Company or any of its affiliates. To the extent Employee claims that additional wages are or may become owed to Employee, there is a good faith dispute based in law and fact over whether any wages in excess of the wages already paid to Employee are or will be due, and thus California Labor Code Section 206.5 is inapplicable. 
 10. Indemnification . 
 (a) As a further material inducement to the Company to enter into this Agreement, Employee hereby agrees to indemnify and hold each of the Company Releasees harmless from all loss, costs, damages, or expenses, including without limitation, reasonable attorneys fees incurred by the Company Releasees, arising out of any breach of this Agreement by Employee or the fact that any representation made in this Agreement by Employee was false when made. As a further material inducement to Employee to enter into this Agreement, the Company hereby agrees to indemnify and hold each of the Company Releasees harmless from all loss, costs, damages, or expenses, including without limitation, reasonable attorneys fees incurred by the Company Releasees, arising out of any breach of this Agreement by the Company or the fact that any representation made in this Agreement by the Company was knowingly false when made. 
 (b) If Employee is a party or is threatened to be made a party to any proceeding by reason of the fact that Employee was an employee, officer or director of the Company or any of its affiliates, the Company shall indemnify and hold harmless Employee against any expenses (including reasonable attorneys fees, provided , that counsel has been approved by the Company, which approval shall not be unreasonably withheld), judgments, fines, settlements and other amounts actually or reasonably incurred by Employee in connection with that proceeding, and provided, that Employee acted in good faith and in a manner Employee reasonably believed to be in the best interest of the Company. The limitations of Section 317 of the Corporations Code of the State of California shall apply to this assurance of indemnification. 
 A-4 

Notwithstanding the foregoing or any other provision contained herein, this Agreement shall not supersede or in any way limit any (i) indemnification arrangements in favor of the Employee under the Company s or any of its affiliates charter documents or bylaws or pursuant to any agreement between the Employee and the Company or any of the Company s affiliates or (ii) the provision of insurance against insurable events which occurred while the Executive was a director or officer of the Company, in each as provided by and subject to the limitations set forth in Section 10 of the Severance Pay Agreement. 
 11. No Admission of Liability . 
 The Parties understand and acknowledge that no action taken by either Party in connection hereto, either previously or in connection with this Agreement, shall be deemed or construed to be (i) an admission of the truth or falsity of any actual or potential claims, or (ii) an acknowledgement or admission by either Party of any fault or liability whatsoever to the other Party or to any third party. This Agreement shall not in any way be construed as an admission by the Company that it has acted wrongfully with respect to Employee or any other person or entity, or that Employee has any rights whatsoever against the Company, and the Company specifically disclaims any liability to or wrongful acts against Employee or any other person or entity, on the part of itself, its employees or its agents. This Agreement shall not in any way be construed as an admission by Employee that Employee has acted wrongfully with respect to the Company, or that Employee failed to perform Employee s duties or negligently performed or breached Employee s duties, or that the Company had good cause to terminate Employee s employment. 
 12. Cooperation in Litigation . Employee agrees to cooperate with the Company and its affiliates and their respective designated attorneys, representatives and agents in connection with any actual or threatened judicial, administrative or other legal or equitable proceeding in which the Company or any of the Company s affiliates is or may become involved. Upon reasonable notice, Employee agrees to meet with and provide to the Company and its affiliates and their respective designated attorneys, representatives or agents all information and knowledge Employee has relating to the subject matter of any such proceeding. The Company agrees to reimburse Employee for any reasonable costs Employee incurs in providing such cooperation. 
 13. Governing Law. This Agreement is entered into in state and, except as provided in this section, shall be governed by substantive state law. 
 14. Arbitration of Disputes . If any dispute arises between Employee and the Company relating to this Agreement, including any dispute regarding the interpretation, enforceability, or validity of this Agreement Arbitrable Dispute ), the Parties agree to resolve that Arbitrable Dispute through final and binding arbitration under this section. Employee also agrees to arbitrate any Arbitrable Dispute which also involves any other Company Releasee who offers or agrees to arbitrate the dispute under this section. 
 (a) Any Arbitrable Dispute will be decided by an arbitrator though individual arbitration, and Employee and the Company waive any right to a jury trial or a court bench trial . Employee and the Company also waive the right for any dispute to be brought, maintained, decided or arbitrated as a class and or collective action and the arbitrator shall have no authority to hear or preside over any such action Class Action Waiver ). Further, Arbitrable Disputes must be brought in the individual capacity of the party asserting the claim, Employee and the Company are waiving the right to pursue or have a dispute resolved as a plaintiff or class member in any purported class, collective or representative proceeding. To the extent the Class Action Waiver is determined to be invalid, unenforceable, or void, any class and or collective action must proceed in a court of law and not in arbitration. 
 A-5 

Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, to the fullest extent permitted by law, Employee and the Company (1) agree not to bring a representative action on behalf of others under the Private Attorneys General Act of 2004 PAGA ), California Labor Code 2698 et seq ., in any court or in arbitration, and (2) agree that, for any claim brought on a private attorney general basis, including under the California PAGA, any such dispute shall be resolved in arbitration on an individual basis only i.e ., to resolve whether Employee has personally been aggrieved or subject to any violations of law), and that such an action may not be used to resolve the claims or rights of other individuals in a single or collective proceeding (collectively, Representative PAGA Waiver ). Notwithstanding any other provision of this arbitration agreement or the JAMS Rules, the scope, applicability, enforceability, revocability or validity of this Representative PAGA Waiver may be resolved only by a court of competent jurisdiction and not by an arbitrator. If any provision of this representative PAGA Waiver is found to be unenforceable or unlawful for any reason, the unenforceable provision shall be severed from this Dispute Resolution provision, and any such representative PAGA claims or other representative private attorneys general act claims must be litigated in a court of competent jurisdiction and not in arbitration. To the extent that there are any Arbitrable Disputes to be litigated in a court of competent jurisdiction because a court determines that the representative PAGA Waiver is unenforceable with respect to those disputes, the Parties agree that litigation of those Arbitrable Disputes shall be stayed pending the outcome of any individual disputes in arbitration. 
 (b) The Arbitration shall take place at the office of JAMS that is nearest to the location where Employee last worked for the Company in accordance with the JAMS Employment Arbitration Rules & Procedures then in effect JAMS Rules (or, if Employee is employed outside of California at the time of the termination of Employee s employment, at the nearest location of the American Arbitration Association AAA and in accordance with the AAA Employment Arbitration Rules and Mediation Procedures then in effect AAA Rules )), copies of which are available at www.jamsadr.com tel 800.352.5267 and www.adr.org tel 800.778.7879, before a single experienced employment arbitrator selected in accordance with those rules. 
 (c) The Arbitrator may not modify or change this Agreement in any way. The Company will be responsible for paying any filing fee and the fees and costs of the Arbitrator provided, however, that if Employee is the party initiating the claim, Employee will contribute an amount equal to the filing fee that would be paid to initiate a claim in the court of general jurisdiction in the state in which Employee is employed by the Company, unless a lower fee amount would be owed by Employee pursuant to the JAMS Rules (or AAA Rules, as applicable) or applicable law. Each Party shall pay for its own costs and attorneys fees and pay any costs that are not unique to arbitration (i.e., cost that each party would incur if the claim(s) were litigated in a court, such as costs to subpoena witnesses and or documents, take depositions and purchase deposition transcripts, copy documents, etc.), if any. However if any party prevails on a statutory claim which affords the prevailing party attorneys fees and costs, or if there is a written agreement providing for attorneys fees and or costs, the Arbitrator may award reasonable attorney s fees and or costs to the prevailing party, applying the same standards a court would apply under the law applicable to the claim. 
 (d) The Arbitrator shall apply the Federal Rules of Evidence and shall have the authority to entertain a motion to dismiss or a motion for summary judgment by any party and shall apply the standards governing such motions under the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure. The Arbitrator is required to issue a written award and opinion setting forth the essential findings and conclusions on which the award is based, and any judgment or award issued by the Arbitrator may be entered in any court of competent jurisdiction. The Arbitrator does not have the authority to consider, certify, or hear an arbitration as a class action, collective action, or any other type of representative action. In addition, unless all parties agree in writing 
 A-6 

otherwise, the Arbitrator shall not consolidate or join the arbitrations of one or more than one individual. Neither party may seek, nor may the Arbitrator award, any relief that is not individualized to the claimant or that affects other individuals. The Arbitrator may award declaratory or injunctive relief only in favor of the individual party seeking relief and only to the extent necessary to provide relief warranted by that Party s individual claims. 
 (e) Employee and the Company recognize that this agreement to arbitrate arises out of or concerns interstate commerce and that the Federal Arbitration Act shall govern the arbitration and the interpretation or enforcement of this section or any arbitration award. If a court decides that applicable law does not permit the enforcement of any of this section s limitations as to a particular claim or any particular remedy for a claim, then that claim or particular remedy (and only that claim or particular remedy) must be severed from the arbitration and may be brought in court. To the extent that the Federal Arbitration Act is inapplicable, California law pertaining to arbitration agreements shall apply. Arbitration in this manner shall be the exclusive remedy for any Arbitrable Dispute. Except as prohibited by the Age Discrimination in Employment Act of 1967, as amended, should Employee or the Company attempt to resolve an Arbitrable Dispute by any method other than arbitration pursuant to this section, the responding party will be entitled to recover from the initiating party all damages, expenses, and attorneys fees incurred as a result of this breach. This Section 13 supersedes any existing arbitration agreement between the Company and Employee as to any Arbitrable Dispute (as defined herein). Notwithstanding anything in this Section 13 to the contrary, a claim for benefits under an Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, as amended, covered plan shall not be an Arbitrable Dispute. 
 15. Effective Date . The Parties understand and agree that this Agreement is final and binding eight (8) days after its execution and return (the Effective Date ). Should Employee nevertheless attempt to challenge the enforceability of this Agreement as provided in Section 13 or, in violation of that section, through litigation, as a further limitation on any right to make such a challenge, Employee shall initially tender to the Company, by certified check delivered to the Company, all monies received pursuant to Section 4 or 5 of the Severance Pay Agreement, as applicable, plus interest, and invite the Company to retain such monies and agree with Employee to cancel this Agreement and void the Company s obligations under the Severance Pay Agreement. In the event the Company accepts this offer, the Company shall retain such monies and this Agreement shall be canceled and the Company shall have no obligation under Section 14(e) of the Severance Pay Agreement. In the event the Company does not accept such offer, the Company shall so notify Employee and shall place such monies in an interest-bearing escrow account pending resolution of the dispute between Employee and the Company as to whether or not this Agreement and the Company s obligations under the Severance Pay Agreement shall be set aside and or otherwise rendered voidable or unenforceable. Additionally, any consulting agreement then in effect between Employee and the Company shall be immediately rescinded with no requirement of notice. 
 16. Notices . Any notices required to be given under this Agreement shall be delivered either personally or by first class United States mail, postage prepaid, addressed to the respective parties and shall be effective upon receipt as follows

For such Payment payable under this Agreement, the Reduced Payment shall be the amount equal to the greatest portion of the Payment (which may be zero 0)) that, if paid, would result in no portion of any Payment being subject to the Excise Tax. 
 (b) The Pre-Change in Control Severance Payment or the Post-Change in Control Severance Payment (whichever is applicable) payable under this Agreement shall not be reduced under Section 8(a) if 
 (i) such reduction in such Payment is not sufficient to cause no portion of any Payment to be subject to the Excise Tax, or 
 (ii) the Net After-Tax Unreduced Payments (as defined below) would equal or exceed one hundred five percent (105 of the Net After-Tax Reduced Payments (as defined below). 
 For purposes of determining the amount of any Reduced Payment under Section 8(a), and the Net-After Tax Reduced Payments and the Net After-Tax Unreduced Payments, the Executive shall be considered to pay federal, state and local income and employment taxes at the Executive s applicable marginal rates taking into consideration any reduction in federal income taxes which could be obtained from the deduction of state and local income taxes, and any 
 13 

reduction or disallowance of itemized deductions and personal exemptions under applicable tax law). The applicable federal, state and local income and employment taxes and the Excise Tax (to the extent applicable) are collectively referred to as the Taxes . 
 (c) For purposes of determining the amount of any Reduced Payment under this Section 8, the amount of any Payment shall be reduced in the following order 
 (i) first, by reducing the amounts of parachute payments that would not constitute deferred compensation subject to Section 409A of the Code 
 (ii) next, if after the reduction described in Section 8(c)(i), additional reductions are required, then by reducing the cash portion of the Payment that constitutes deferred compensation (within the meaning of Section 409A) subject to Section 409A, with the reductions to be applied first to the portion of the Payment scheduled for the latest distribution date, and then applied to distributions scheduled for progressively earlier distribution dates, to the extent necessary to decrease the Payment as required under this Section 8 and 
 (iii) next, if after the reduction described in Section 8(c)(ii), additional reductions are required, then, by reducing the non-cash portion of the Payment that constitutes deferred compensation (within the meaning of Section 409A) subject to Section 409A, with the reductions to be applied first to the portion of the Payment scheduled for the latest distribution date, and then applied to distributions scheduled for progressively earlier distribution dates, to the extent necessary to decrease the Payment as required under this Section 8. 
 (d) The following definitions shall apply for purposes of this Section 8 
 (i) Net After-Tax Reduced Payments shall mean the total amount of all Payments that the Executive would retain, on a Net After-Tax Basis, in the event that the Payments payable under this Agreement are reduced pursuant to Section 8(a). 
 (ii) Net After-Tax Unreduced Payments shall mean the total amount of all Payments that the Executive would retain, on a Net After-Tax Basis, in the event that the Payments payable under this Agreement are not reduced pursuant to Section 8(a). 
 (iii) Net After-Tax Basis shall mean, with respect to the Payments, either with or without reduction under Section 8(a) (as applicable), the amount that would be retained by the Executive from such Payments after the payment of all Taxes. 
 (e) All determinations required to be made under this Section 8 and the assumptions to be utilized in arriving at such determinations, shall be made by a nationally recognized accounting firm as may be agreed by the Company and the Executive (the Accounting Firm provided , that the Accounting Firm s determination shall be made based upon substantial authority within the meaning of Section 6662 of the Code. The Accounting Firm shall provide detailed supporting calculations to both the Company and the Executive within fifteen (15) business days of the receipt of notice from the Executive that there has been a Payment or such earlier time as is requested by the Company. All fees and expenses of the Accounting Firm shall be borne solely by the Company. Any determination by the Accounting Firm shall be binding upon the Company and the Executive. For purposes of determining whether and the extent to which the Payments will be subject to the Excise Tax, (i) no portion of the Payments the receipt or enjoyment of which the Executive shall have waived at such time and in such manner as not to constitute a payment within the meaning of Section 280G(b) of the Code shall be taken into account, (ii) no portion of the Payments shall be taken into account 
 14 

which, in the written opinion of the Accounting Firm, does not constitute a parachute payment within the meaning of Section 280G(b)(2) of the Code (including by reason of Section 280G(b)(4)(A) of the Code) and, in calculating the Excise Tax, no portion of such Payments shall be taken into account which, in the opinion of the Accounting Firm, constitutes reasonable compensation for services actually rendered, within the meaning of Section 280G(b)(4)(B) of the Code, in excess of the base amount (as defined in Section 280G(b)(3) of the Code) allocable to such reasonable compensation, and (iii) the value of any non-cash benefit or any deferred payment or benefit included in the Payments shall be determined by the Accounting Firm in accordance with the principles of Section 280G(d)(3) and (4) of the Code.

Upon the expiration of the applicable six (6) month period, all payments deferred pursuant to this Section 9 (excluding in-kind benefits) shall be paid in a lump sum payment to the Executive, plus interest thereon from the date of the Executive s Involuntary Termination through the payment date at an annual rate equal to Moody s Rate. The Moody s Rate shall mean the average of the daily Moody s Corporate Bond Yield Average Monthly Average Corporates as published by Moody s Investors Service, Inc.

the Company under the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 or pursuant to the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act or any other law or listing standards of the national securities exchange that maintains the principal listing for any class of Sempra Energy s common equity or pursuant to any formal policy of Sempra Energy, or (b) if an arbitrator or court determines following a Change in Control that the Executive is required to forfeit or to make any repayment of any compensation or benefit(s) to the Company under the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 or pursuant to the Dodd Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act or any other law or listing standards of the national securities exchange that maintains the principal listing for any class of Sempra Energy s common equity, such forfeiture or repayment shall not constitute Good Reason. 
 Section 12. Full Settlement Mitigation . The Company s obligation to make the payments provided for in this Agreement and otherwise to perform its obligations hereunder shall not be affected by any set-off, counterclaim, recoupment, defense or other claim, right or action which the Company may have against the Executive or others, provided that nothing herein shall preclude the Company from separately pursuing recovery from the Executive based on any such claim. In no event shall the Executive be obligated to seek other employment or take any other action by way of mitigation of the amounts (including amounts for damages for breach) payable to the Executive under any of the provisions of this Agreement, and such amounts shall not be reduced whether or not the Executive obtains other employment. 
 Section 13. Dispute Resolution and Arbitration . 
 (a) If any dispute arises between the Executive and Sempra Energy or any of its Affiliates, including, but not limited to, disputes relating to or arising out of this Agreement, disputes relating to or arising out of the Executive s employment and or the termination thereof, and or disputes regarding the interpretation, enforceability, or validity of this Agreement Arbitrable Dispute ), the Executive and Sempra Energy mutually agree to waive their respective rights to resolution of disputes through litigation in a judicial forum and agree to resolve any Arbitrable Dispute through final and binding arbitration as set forth below, except as prohibited by law. Arbitration shall be the exclusive remedy for any Arbitrable Dispute. Accordingly, this agreement to arbitrate applies with respect to all Arbitrable Disputes, whether initiated by Executive or Sempra Energy. Any Arbitrable Dispute will be decided by an arbitrator through individual arbitration and not by way of court or jury trial. Sempra Energy and the Executive waive any right to a jury trial or a court bench trial . 
 (b) Sempra Energy and the Executive agree to bring any dispute in arbitration in an individual capacity only 
 Sempra Energy and the Executive hereby waive any right for any dispute to be brought, maintained, heard, decided or arbitrated as a class and or collective action and the arbitrator will have no authority to hear or preside over any such action Class Action Waiver ). The Executive understands and agrees that the Executive and Sempra Energy are waiving the right to pursue or have a dispute resolved as a plaintiff or class member in any purported class, collective or representative proceeding. To the extent the Class Action Waiver is determined to be invalid, unenforceable, or void, any class and or collective action must proceed in a court of law and not in arbitration.

 16 

been aggrieved or subject to any violations of law), and that such an action may not be used to resolve the claims or rights of other individuals in a single or collective proceeding (collectively, Representative PAGA Waiver ). Notwithstanding any other provision of this agreement to arbitrate or the JAMS Rules, the scope, applicability, enforceability, revocability or validity of this Representative PAGA Waiver may be resolved only by a court of competent jurisdiction and not by an arbitrator. If any provision of this representative PAGA Waiver is found to be unenforceable or unlawful for any reason, the unenforceable provision shall be severed from this Dispute Resolution provision, and any such representative PAGA claims or other representative private attorneys general act claims must be litigated in a court of competent jurisdiction and not in arbitration. To the extent that there are any Arbitrable Disputes to be litigated in a court of competent jurisdiction because a court determines that the Representative PAGA Waiver is unenforceable with respect to those disputes, the Parties agree that litigation of those Arbitrable Disputes shall be stayed pending the outcome of any individual disputes in arbitration. 
 
 (c) Arbitration shall take place at the office of JAMS (or, if the Executive is employed outside of California, the American Arbitration Association AAA )) nearest to the location where the Executive last worked for the Company.

However, the Executive will be responsible for contributing up to any amount equal to the filing fee that would be paid to initiate the claim in a court of general jurisdiction in the state in which the Executive is employed, unless a lower fee amount would be owed by the Executive pursuant to the JAMS Rules (or AAA rules, as applicable) or applicable law. Subject to Section 15 of this Agreement, each party shall pay its own attorneys fees and pay any costs that are not unique to arbitration (i.e., costs that each party would incur if the claim(s) were litigated in a court, such as costs to subpoena witnesses and or documents, take depositions and purchase deposition transcripts, copy documents, etc.). However, subject to Section 15 of this Agreement, if any party prevails on a statutory claim that authorizes an award of attorneys fees to the prevailing party, or if there is a written agreement providing for attorneys fees, the arbitrator may award reasonable attorneys fees to the prevailing party, applying the same standards a court would apply under the law applicable to the claim. 
 (e) The arbitrator shall apply the Federal Rules of Evidence, shall have the authority to entertain a motion to dismiss or a motion for summary judgment by any party, and shall apply the standards governing such motions under the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure. The arbitrator is required to issue a written award and opinion setting forth the essential findings and conclusions on which the award is based, and any judgment or award issued by an arbitrator may be entered in any court of competent jurisdiction. The arbitrator does not have the authority to consider, certify, or hear an arbitration as a class action, collective action, or any other type of representative action. In addition, unless all parties agree in writing otherwise, the arbitrator shall not consolidate or join the arbitrations of one or more than one individual. Neither party may seek, nor may the arbitrator award, any relief that is not individualized to the claimant or that affects other individuals. The arbitrator may award declaratory or injunctive relief only in favor of the individual party seeking relief and only to the extent necessary to provide relief warranted by that party s individual claims. Sempra Energy and the Executive recognize that this agreement to arbitrate arises out of or concerns interstate commerce and that the Federal Arbitration Act shall govern the arbitration and shall govern the interpretation or enforcement of this Agreement or any arbitration award. 
 17 

(f) If a court decides that applicable law does not permit the enforcement of any of this section s limitations as to a particular claim or any particular remedy for a claim, then that claim or particular remedy (and only that claim or particular remedy) must be severed from the arbitration and may be brought in court. 
 Section 14. Executive s Covenants . 
 (a) Confidentiality . The Executive acknowledges that in the course of the Executive s employment with the Company, the Executive has acquired non-public privileged or confidential information and trade secrets concerning the operations, future plans and methods of doing business Proprietary Information of Sempra Energy and its Affiliates and the Executive agrees that it would be extremely damaging to Sempra Energy and its Affiliates if such Proprietary Information were disclosed to a competitor of Sempra Energy and its Affiliates or to any other Person. The Executive understands and agrees that all Proprietary Information has been divulged to the Executive in confidence and further understands and agrees to keep all Proprietary Information secret and confidential (except for such information which is or becomes publicly available other than as a result of a breach by the Executive of this provision or information the Executive is required by law or any governmental, administrative or court order to disclose) without limitation in time. In view of the nature of the Executive s employment and the Proprietary Information the Executive has acquired during the course of such employment, the Executive likewise agrees that Sempra Energy and its Affiliates would be irreparably harmed by any disclosure of Proprietary Information in violation of the terms of this Section 14(a) and that Sempra Energy and its Affiliates shall therefore be entitled to preliminary and or permanent injunctive relief prohibiting the Executive from engaging in any activity or threatened activity in violation of the terms of this Section 14(a) and to any other relief available to them. Inquiries regarding whether specific information constitutes Proprietary Information shall be directed to the Company s most senior officer of Human Resources (or, if such position is vacant, the Company s then Chief Executive Officer) provided , that the Company shall not unreasonably classify information as Proprietary Information. 
 (b) Governmental Reporting . Nothing in this Agreement is intended to interfere with or discourage the Executive s good faith disclosure related to a suspected violation of federal or state law or regulation to any governmental agency or entity or making other disclosures that are protected under the whistleblower provisions of federal or state law or regulation. The Executive cannot and will not be held criminally or civilly liable under any federal or state trade secret law for disclosing otherwise protected trade secrets and or confidential or proprietary information so long as the disclosure is made in (i) confidence to a federal, state, or local government official, directly or indirectly, or to an attorney and solely for the purpose of reporting or investigating a suspected violation of law or (ii) a complaint or other document filed in a lawsuit or other proceeding, so long as such filing is made under seal. The Company will not retaliate against the Executive in any way for a disclosure made pursuant to this Section 14(b). Further, in the event the Executive makes such a disclosure, and files a lawsuit against the Company alleging that the Company retaliated against the Executive because of the disclosure, the Executive may disclose the relevant trade secret or confidential information to the Executive s attorney, and may use the same in the court proceeding only if (X) the Executive ensures that any court filing that includes the trade secret or confidential information at issue is made under seal and (Y) the Executive does not otherwise disclose the trade secret or confidential information except as required by court order. 
 (c) Non-Solicitation of Employees . The Executive recognizes that the Executive possesses and will possess confidential information about other employees of Sempra Energy and its Affiliates relating to their education, experience, skills, abilities, compensation and benefits, and inter-personal relationships with customers of Sempra Energy and its Affiliates. The Executive recognizes that the information the Executive possesses and will possess about 
 18 

these other employees is not generally known, is of substantial value to Sempra Energy and its Affiliates in developing their business and in securing and retaining customers, and has been and will be acquired by the Executive because of the Executive s business position with Sempra Energy and its Affiliates. The Executive agrees that at all times during the Executive s employment with the Company and for a period of one (1) year thereafter, the Executive will not use such information to directly or indirectly solicit or recruit any employee of the Company or its Affiliates for the purpose of being employed by the Executive or by any competitor of the Company or its Affiliates on whose behalf the Executive is acting as an agent, representative or employee and that the Executive will not convey any such confidential information or trade secrets about other employees of Sempra Energy and its Affiliates to any other Person provided, however , that it shall not constitute a solicitation or recruitment of employment in violation of this Section 14(c) to discuss employment opportunities with any employee of the Company or its Affiliates who has either first contacted the Executive or regarding whose employment the Executive has discussed with and received the written approval of the Company s most senior officer of Human Resources (or, if such position is vacant, the Company s then Chief Executive Officer), prior to making such solicitation or recruitment. In view of the nature of the Executive s employment with the Company, the Executive likewise agrees that Sempra Energy and its Affiliates would be irreparably harmed by any solicitation or recruitment in violation of the terms of this Section 14(c) and that Sempra Energy and its Affiliates shall therefore be entitled to preliminary and or permanent injunctive relief prohibiting the Executive from engaging in any activity or threatened activity in violation of the terms of this Section 14(c) and to any other relief available to them. 
 (d) Survival of Provisions . The obligations contained in Section 14(a), (b) and (c) above shall survive the termination of the Executive s employment within the Company and shall be fully enforceable thereafter to the same extent that it was enforceable prior to such termination. If it is determined by a court of competent jurisdiction in any state that any restriction in Section 14(a) or (c) above is excessive in duration or scope or is unreasonable or unenforceable under the laws of that state, it is the intention of the parties that such restriction may be modified or amended by the court to render it enforceable to the maximum extent permitted by the law of that state.

 NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the promises and mutual covenants contained herein, the adequacy of which is hereby acknowledged, the Parties hereby agree as follows 
 1. Separation Date . Employee s employment with the Company terminated at the close of business on ____________ (the Separation Date ). Employee has received his her final wages through the Separation Date, less deductions required by law, including any accrued but unused vacation, in accordance with applicable law. Employee has also been reimbursed for any outstanding employment-related expenses that were incurred and submitted consistent with Company policy. This Agreement is not a condition of employment or continued employment or a condition of receiving a raise or a bonus. On the Separation Date, Employee will be deemed to have resigned from all positions that he she holds with the Company and its affiliates, and Employee will promptly execute any instrument reasonably requested by the Company or any of its affiliates to effectuate or commemorate such resignation. The term affiliate as used herein shall include, without limitation, such Person s parent companies, divisions and subsidiaries, whether or not specified. 
 2. Severance Benefits . In exchange for Employee entering into this Agreement and not revoking it, and for the covenants and releases contained herein, the Company will provide Employee with the severance benefits described below. Employee acknowledges that the amounts and benefits set forth in this Section 2 as well as any benefits and claims not released under Section 4(b), fully satisfy any entitlement Employee may have to any payments or benefits from the Company through the Separation Date, including under the Severance Pay Agreement. Employee further acknowledges that no part of the severance payments described in this Section 2 consist of wages owed to Employee for his her employment through the Separation Date. 

(a) The Company will pay Employee a lump sum payment of ______________________ , less applicable withholdings, pursuant to Section 4 5 of the Severance Pay Agreement. Pursuant to Section 409A of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the Code ), payment will be made on the earlier of (i) the date that is six (6) months and one (1) day after the Separation Date and (ii) the date of Employee s death. 
 (b) The Company will pay Employee a lump sum payment of ___________ , less applicable withholdings, which is equal to the Consulting Payment set forth in Section 14(e) of the Severance Pay Agreement. Such payment will be made during the thirty (30) day period commencing on the earlier of (i) a date that is six (6) months and one (1) day after the Separation Date and (ii) the date of Employee s death 
 (c) The Company will also provide Employee with the severance benefits set forth in Sections 4(c), (d) and (e) of the Severance Pay Agreement. For the avoidance of doubt, the value of the services set forth in Sections 4(c), (d) and (e) of the Severance Pay Agreement shall not be subject to liquidation or exchange for any other benefit. 
 3. Tax Consequences . The Company makes no representations or warranties with respect to the tax consequences of the payments and any other consideration provided to Employee or made on Employee s behalf under the terms of this Agreement. Employee agrees and understands that Employee is responsible for payment, if any, of local, state, and or federal taxes on the payments and any other consideration provided hereunder by the Company and any penalties or assessments thereon. Employee further agrees to indemnify and hold the Company and its affiliates harmless from any claims, demands, deficiencies, penalties, interest, assessments, executions, judgments, or recoveries by any government agency against the Company or any of its affiliates for any amounts claimed due on account of (a) Employee s failure to pay or delayed payment of federal or state taxes, or (b) damages sustained by the Company or any of its affiliates by reason of any such claims, including reasonable attorneys fees and costs 
 4. Release of Claims . As a material inducement for the payment of the severance and benefits of the Severance Pay Agreement, and except as otherwise provided in this Agreement, Employee, on behalf of him herself and on behalf of his her heirs, family members, executors, agents and assigns, hereby irrevocably and unconditionally releases, acquits and forever discharges the Company Releasees from any and all Claims he she has or may have. For purposes of this Agreement and the preceding sentence, the words Releasee or Releasees and Claim or Claims shall have the meanings set forth below 
 (a) Company Releasees shall refer to (i) the Company, (ii) each of the Company s owners, stockholders, predecessors, successors, assigns, agents, directors, officers, employees, representatives, attorneys, advisors, and affiliates (including parent companies, divisions, and subsidiaries), (iii) agents, directors, officers, employees, representatives, attorneys and advisors of such affiliates (including parent companies, divisions, and subsidiaries), and (iv) all persons and entities acting by, through, under or in concert with any of them 
 (b) The words Claim or Claims shall refer to any charges, complaints, claims, liabilities, obligations, promises, agreements, controversies, damages, actions, causes of action, suits, rights, demands, costs, losses, debts and expenses (including attorneys fees and costs actually incurred) of any nature whatsoever, known or unknown, suspected or unsuspected, which Employee had or may have, own or hold against any of the Company Releasees through and including the Effective Date that in any way arise out of, relate to, or are in connection with Employee s employment relationship with the Company and its affiliates and the termination of that relationship, including, without limitation, all rights arising out of alleged violations of any contracts, express or implied, including the Severance Pay Agreement any tort claim any legal 
 A-2 

restrictions on the Company s right to terminate employment relationships and any federal, state or other governmental statute, regulation, law or ordinance, including common law principles, governing the employment relationship including, without limitation, all laws and regulations prohibiting discrimination or harassment based on protected categories, and all laws and regulations prohibiting retaliation against employees, including retaliation for engaging in protected activity or legal off-duty conduct. This release does not extend to claims for workers compensation or other claims which by law may not be waived or released by this Agreement, nor does it limit Employee s right to receive any vested payments or benefits to which he she is entitled under any Company (including its affiliates) benefit plan (including, without limitation, any of the Company s (including its affiliates) qualified retirement plans or non-qualified deferred compensation plan), which payments or benefits will be paid or provided pursuant to the terms of the applicable governing documents. 
 5. Release of Unknown Claims. Employee expressly waives and relinquishes all rights and benefits afforded by any statute (including, but not limited to, Section 1542 of the Civil Code of the State of California and analogous laws of other states), which limits the effect of a release with respect to unknown claims. Employee does so understanding and acknowledging the significance of the release of unknown claims and the waiver of statutory protection against a release of unknown claims (including, but not limited to, Section 1542). Section 1542 of the Civil Code of the State of California states as follows 
 A GENERAL RELEASE DOES NOT EXTEND TO CLAIMS WHICH THE CREDITOR OR RELEASING PARTY DOES NOT KNOW OR SUSPECT TO EXIST IN HIS OR HER FAVOR AT THE TIME OF EXECUTING THE RELEASE AND THAT, IF KNOWN BY HIM OR HER, WOULD HAVE MATERIALLY AFFECTED HIS OR HER SETTLEMENT WITH THE DEBTOR OR RELEASED PARTY. 
 Thus, notwithstanding the provisions of Section 1542 or of any similar statute, and for the purpose of implementing a full and complete release and discharge of the Company Releasees, Employee expressly acknowledges that this Agreement is intended to include in its effect, without limitation, all Claims which are known and all Claims which Employee does not know or suspect to exist in Employee s favor at the time of execution of this Agreement and that this Agreement contemplates the extinguishment of all such Claims. Employee acknowledges that he she might hereafter discover facts different from, or in addition to, those Employee now knows or believes to be true with respect to a Claim or Claims released herein, and they expressly agree to assume the risk of possible discovery of additional or different facts, and agree that this Agreement shall be and remain effective, in all respects, regardless of such additional or different discovered facts. 
 6. Covenant Not to Sue . Employee agrees that Employee will not file any suit, claim, proceeding or complaint against any Company Releasees arising out of or in connection with any Claims released herein, except as required to enforce the terms of this Agreement. Employee s right to file or participate in an administrative claim or investigation by the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission, or any other local, state, or federal administrative body or government agency against the Company, which is guaranteed by law, cannot be and is not waived. However, to the extent permitted by law, and except as to Securities and Exchange Commission whistleblower awards, Employee agrees that if such an administrative claim is made against any Company Releasee(s) on Employee s behalf, Employee shall not be entitled to recover any individual monetary relief or other individual remedies beyond the separation benefits identified in this Agreement. 
 A-3 

7. No Pending Lawsuits . Employee represents and warrants that Employee does not have any lawsuits, charges, claims, grievances, or actions of any kind pending against any Company Releasees arising out of or in connection with any Claims released herein, by or on behalf of Employee or on behalf of any other person or entity, and that, to the best of Employee s knowledge, Employee possess no such claims (including, but not limited to, under the Family and Medical Leave Act, the Age Discrimination in Employment Act, the California Family Rights Act, the Fair Labor Standards Act, the California Labor Code and or workers compensation claims). Employee further acknowledges that he she is not aware of, or has fully disclosed to the Company, any information that could reasonably give rise to such a claim, cause of action, lawsuit or proceeding against any Company Releasee(s). 
 8. No Cooperation . Employee agrees that he she will not knowingly encourage, counsel, or assist any attorneys or their clients in the presentation or prosecution of any disputes, differences, grievances, claims, charges, or complaints by any third party against any Company Releasee(s) arising out or in connection with any Claims released herein, unless under a subpoena or other court order to do so. Employee agrees to immediately notify the Company upon receipt of any such subpoena or court order, and to furnish to the Company, within three (3) business days of its receipt, a copy of such subpoena or other court order. 
 9. Payment of Salary and Receipt of All Benefits . Employee acknowledges and represents that, except as provided in this Agreement, the Company has fully paid or provided Employee all salary, wages, bonuses, accrued vacation paid time off, premiums, leaves, housing allowances, relocation costs, interest, severance, outplacement costs, fees, reimbursable expenses, commissions or other incentive compensation, stock, stock options, vesting, and any and all other benefits and compensation due to Employee. Employee specifically represents that Employee is not owed any further sum by way of reimbursement from the Company or any of its affiliates. To the extent Employee claims that additional wages are or may become owed to Employee, there is a good faith dispute based in law and fact over whether any wages in excess of the wages already paid to Employee are or will be due, and thus California Labor Code Section 206.5 is inapplicable. 
 10. Indemnification . 
 (a) As a further material inducement to the Company to enter into this Agreement, Employee hereby agrees to indemnify and hold each of the Company Releasees harmless from all loss, costs, damages, or expenses, including without limitation, reasonable attorneys fees incurred by the Company Releasees, arising out of any breach of this Agreement by Employee or the fact that any representation made in this Agreement by Employee was false when made. As a further material inducement to Employee to enter into this Agreement, the Company hereby agrees to indemnify and hold each of the Company Releasees harmless from all loss, costs, damages, or expenses, including without limitation, reasonable attorneys fees incurred by the Company Releasees, arising out of any breach of this Agreement by the Company or the fact that any representation made in this Agreement by the Company was knowingly false when made. 
 (b) If Employee is a party or is threatened to be made a party to any proceeding by reason of the fact that Employee was an employee, officer or director of the Company or any of its affiliates, the Company shall indemnify and hold harmless Employee against any expenses (including reasonable attorneys fees, provided , that counsel has been approved by the Company, which approval shall not be unreasonably withheld), judgments, fines, settlements and other amounts actually or reasonably incurred by Employee in connection with that proceeding, and provided, that Employee acted in good faith and in a manner Employee reasonably believed to be in the best interest of the Company. The limitations of Section 317 of the Corporations Code of the State of California shall apply to this assurance of indemnification. 
 A-4 

Notwithstanding the foregoing or any other provision contained herein, this Agreement shall not supersede or in any way limit any (i) indemnification arrangements in favor of the Employee under the Company s or any of its affiliates charter documents or bylaws or pursuant to any agreement between the Employee and the Company or any of the Company s affiliates or (ii) the provision of insurance against insurable events which occurred while the Executive was a director or officer of the Company, in each as provided by and subject to the limitations set forth in Section 10 of the Severance Pay Agreement. 
 11. No Admission of Liability . 
 The Parties understand and acknowledge that no action taken by either Party in connection hereto, either previously or in connection with this Agreement, shall be deemed or construed to be (i) an admission of the truth or falsity of any actual or potential claims, or (ii) an acknowledgement or admission by either Party of any fault or liability whatsoever to the other Party or to any third party. This Agreement shall not in any way be construed as an admission by the Company that it has acted wrongfully with respect to Employee or any other person or entity, or that Employee has any rights whatsoever against the Company, and the Company specifically disclaims any liability to or wrongful acts against Employee or any other person or entity, on the part of itself, its employees or its agents. This Agreement shall not in any way be construed as an admission by Employee that Employee has acted wrongfully with respect to the Company, or that Employee failed to perform Employee s duties or negligently performed or breached Employee s duties, or that the Company had good cause to terminate Employee s employment. 
 12. Cooperation in Litigation . Employee agrees to cooperate with the Company and its affiliates and their respective designated attorneys, representatives and agents in connection with any actual or threatened judicial, administrative or other legal or equitable proceeding in which the Company or any of the Company s affiliates is or may become involved. Upon reasonable notice, Employee agrees to meet with and provide to the Company and its affiliates and their respective designated attorneys, representatives or agents all information and knowledge Employee has relating to the subject matter of any such proceeding. The Company agrees to reimburse Employee for any reasonable costs Employee incurs in providing such cooperation. 
 13. Governing Law. This Agreement is entered into in state and, except as provided in this section, shall be governed by substantive state law. 
 14. Arbitration of Disputes . If any dispute arises between Employee and the Company relating to this Agreement, including any dispute regarding the interpretation, enforceability, or validity of this Agreement Arbitrable Dispute ), the Parties agree to resolve that Arbitrable Dispute through final and binding arbitration under this section. Employee also agrees to arbitrate any Arbitrable Dispute which also involves any other Company Releasee who offers or agrees to arbitrate the dispute under this section. 
 (a) Any Arbitrable Dispute will be decided by an arbitrator though individual arbitration, and Employee and the Company waive any right to a jury trial or a court bench trial . Employee and the Company also waive the right for any dispute to be brought, maintained, decided or arbitrated as a class and or collective action and the arbitrator shall have no authority to hear or preside over any such action Class Action Waiver ). Further, Arbitrable Disputes must be brought in the individual capacity of the party asserting the claim, Employee and the Company are waiving the right to pursue or have a dispute resolved as a plaintiff or class member in any purported class, collective or representative proceeding. To the extent the Class Action Waiver is determined to be invalid, unenforceable, or void, any class and or collective action must proceed in a court of law and not in arbitration. 
 A-5 

Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, to the fullest extent permitted by law, Employee and the Company (1) agree not to bring a representative action on behalf of others under the Private Attorneys General Act of 2004 PAGA ), California Labor Code 2698 et seq ., in any court or in arbitration, and (2) agree that, for any claim brought on a private attorney general basis, including under the California PAGA, any such dispute shall be resolved in arbitration on an individual basis only i.e ., to resolve whether Employee has personally been aggrieved or subject to any violations of law), and that such an action may not be used to resolve the claims or rights of other individuals in a single or collective proceeding (collectively, Representative PAGA Waiver ). Notwithstanding any other provision of this arbitration agreement or the JAMS Rules, the scope, applicability, enforceability, revocability or validity of this Representative PAGA Waiver may be resolved only by a court of competent jurisdiction and not by an arbitrator. If any provision of this representative PAGA Waiver is found to be unenforceable or unlawful for any reason, the unenforceable provision shall be severed from this Dispute Resolution provision, and any such representative PAGA claims or other representative private attorneys general act claims must be litigated in a court of competent jurisdiction and not in arbitration. To the extent that there are any Arbitrable Disputes to be litigated in a court of competent jurisdiction because a court determines that the representative PAGA Waiver is unenforceable with respect to those disputes, the Parties agree that litigation of those Arbitrable Disputes shall be stayed pending the outcome of any individual disputes in arbitration. 
 (b) The Arbitration shall take place at the office of JAMS that is nearest to the location where Employee last worked for the Company in accordance with the JAMS Employment Arbitration Rules & Procedures then in effect JAMS Rules (or, if Employee is employed outside of California at the time of the termination of Employee s employment, at the nearest location of the American Arbitration Association AAA and in accordance with the AAA Employment Arbitration Rules and Mediation Procedures then in effect AAA Rules )), copies of which are available at www.jamsadr.com tel 800.352.5267 and www.adr.org tel 800.778.7879, before a single experienced employment arbitrator selected in accordance with those rules. 
 (c) The Arbitrator may not modify or change this Agreement in any way. The Company will be responsible for paying any filing fee and the fees and costs of the Arbitrator provided, however, that if Employee is the party initiating the claim, Employee will contribute an amount equal to the filing fee that would be paid to initiate a claim in the court of general jurisdiction in the state in which Employee is employed by the Company, unless a lower fee amount would be owed by Employee pursuant to the JAMS Rules (or AAA Rules, as applicable) or applicable law. Each Party shall pay for its own costs and attorneys fees and pay any costs that are not unique to arbitration (i.e., cost that each party would incur if the claim(s) were litigated in a court, such as costs to subpoena witnesses and or documents, take depositions and purchase deposition transcripts, copy documents, etc.), if any. However if any party prevails on a statutory claim which affords the prevailing party attorneys fees and costs, or if there is a written agreement providing for attorneys fees and or costs, the Arbitrator may award reasonable attorney s fees and or costs to the prevailing party, applying the same standards a court would apply under the law applicable to the claim. 
 (d) The Arbitrator shall apply the Federal Rules of Evidence and shall have the authority to entertain a motion to dismiss or a motion for summary judgment by any party and shall apply the standards governing such motions under the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure. The Arbitrator is required to issue a written award and opinion setting forth the essential findings and conclusions on which the award is based, and any judgment or award issued by the Arbitrator may be entered in any court of competent jurisdiction. The Arbitrator does not have the authority to consider, certify, or hear an arbitration as a class action, collective action, or any other type of representative action. In addition, unless all parties agree in writing 
 A-6 

otherwise, the Arbitrator shall not consolidate or join the arbitrations of one or more than one individual. Neither party may seek, nor may the Arbitrator award, any relief that is not individualized to the claimant or that affects other individuals. The Arbitrator may award declaratory or injunctive relief only in favor of the individual party seeking relief and only to the extent necessary to provide relief warranted by that Party s individual claims. 
 (e) Employee and the Company recognize that this agreement to arbitrate arises out of or concerns interstate commerce and that the Federal Arbitration Act shall govern the arbitration and the interpretation or enforcement of this section or any arbitration award. If a court decides that applicable law does not permit the enforcement of any of this section s limitations as to a particular claim or any particular remedy for a claim, then that claim or particular remedy (and only that claim or particular remedy) must be severed from the arbitration and may be brought in court. To the extent that the Federal Arbitration Act is inapplicable, California law pertaining to arbitration agreements shall apply. Arbitration in this manner shall be the exclusive remedy for any Arbitrable Dispute. Except as prohibited by the Age Discrimination in Employment Act of 1967, as amended, should Employee or the Company attempt to resolve an Arbitrable Dispute by any method other than arbitration pursuant to this section, the responding party will be entitled to recover from the initiating party all damages, expenses, and attorneys fees incurred as a result of this breach. This Section 13 supersedes any existing arbitration agreement between the Company and Employee as to any Arbitrable Dispute (as defined herein). Notwithstanding anything in this Section 13 to the contrary, a claim for benefits under an Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, as amended, covered plan shall not be an Arbitrable Dispute.

In the event that (i) the Executive is employed by a direct or indirect subsidiary of Sempra Energy that is a member of the Sempra Energy Control Group, (ii) Sempra Energy, directly or indirectly through one or more intermediaries, sells or otherwise disposes of such subsidiary, and (iii) such subsidiary ceases to be a member of the Sempra Energy Control Group, then if, on the date such subsidiary ceases to be a member of the Sempra Energy Control Group, the Executive continues in employment with such subsidiary and the Executive does not have a Separation from Service, Sempra Energy shall require such subsidiary or any successor (whether direct or indirect, by purchase merger, consolidation or 
 18 

otherwise) to such subsidiary, or the parent thereof, to assume expressly and agree to perform the obligations and satisfy and discharge the liabilities under this Agreement in the same manner and to the same extent that Sempra Energy would have been required to perform the obligations and satisfy and discharge the liabilities under this Agreement, if such subsidiary had not ceased to be part of the Sempra Energy Control Group, and, upon such assumption, Sempra Energy shall have no further obligations and liabilities under the Agreement. Upon such assumption, (i) references to Sempra Energy in this Agreement shall be replaced with references to such subsidiary, or such successor or parent thereof, assuming this Agreement, and (ii) subsection (b) of the definition of Cause and subsection (b) of the definition of Good Reason shall apply thereafter, as if a Change in Control had occurred on the date of such cessation. 
 (e) Sale of Assets of Subsidiary . In the event that (i) the Executive is employed by a direct or indirect subsidiary of Sempra Energy, and (ii) such subsidiary sells or otherwise disposes of substantial assets of such subsidiary to an unrelated service recipient, as determined under Treasury Regulation Section 1.409A-1(f)(2)(ii) (the Asset Purchaser ), in a transaction described in Treasury Regulation Section 1.409A-1(h)(4) (an Asset Sale ), then if, on the date of such Asset Sale, the Executive becomes employed by the Asset Purchaser, Sempra Energy and the Asset Purchaser may specify, in accordance with Treasury Regulation Section 1.409A-1(h)(4), that the Executive shall not be treated as having a Separation from Service, and in such event, Sempra Energy may require such Asset Purchaser, or the parent thereof, to assume expressly and agree to perform the obligations and satisfy and discharge the liabilities under this Agreement in the same manner and to the same extent that the Company would have been required to perform the obligations and satisfy and discharge the liabilities under this Agreement, if the Asset Sale had not taken place, and, upon such assumption, Sempra Energy shall have no further obligations and liabilities under the Agreement. Upon such assumption, (i) references to Sempra Energy in this Agreement shall be replaced with references to the Asset Purchaser or the parent thereof, as applicable, and (ii) subsection (b) of the definition of Cause and subsection (b) of the definition of Good Reason shall apply thereafter, as if a Change in Control had occurred on the date of the Asset Sale. 
 Section 17. Administration Prior to Change in Control . Prior to a Change in Control, the Compensation Committee shall have full and complete authority to construe and interpret the provisions of this Agreement, to determine an individual s entitlement to benefits under this Agreement, to make in its sole and absolute discretion all determinations contemplated under this Agreement, to investigate and make factual determinations necessary or advisable to administer or implement this Agreement, and to adopt such rules and procedures as it deems necessary or advisable for the administration or implementation of this Agreement. All determinations made under this Agreement by the Compensation Committee shall be final, conclusive and binding on all interested persons. Prior to a Change in Control, the Compensation Committee may delegate responsibilities for the operation and administration of this Agreement to one or more officers or employees of the Company.

 19 

that any compensation, benefits or other payments that are payable under this Agreement and intended to comply with Sections 409A(a)(2), (3) and (4) of the Code do not comply with Section 409A of the Code, the Treasury Regulations thereunder and other applicable authority issued by the Internal Revenue Service, to the extent permitted under Section 409A of the Code, the Treasury Regulations thereunder and any applicable authority issued by the Internal Revenue Service, the Company and the Executive agree to amend this Agreement, or take such other actions as the Company and the Executive deem reasonably necessary or appropriate, to cause such compensation, benefits and other payments to comply with the requirements of Section 409A of the Code, the Treasury Regulations thereunder and other applicable authority issued by the Internal Revenue Service, while providing compensation, benefits and other payments that are, in the aggregate, no less favorable than the compensation, benefits and other payments provided under this Agreement. In the case of any compensation, benefits or other payments that are payable under this Agreement and intended to comply with Sections 409A(a)(2), (3) and (4) of the Code, if any provision of the Agreement would cause such compensation, benefits or other payments to fail to so comply, such provision shall not be effective and shall be null and void with respect to such compensation, benefits or other payments to the extent such provision would cause a failure to comply, and such provision shall otherwise remain in full force and effect.

 GENERAL RELEASE 
 This GENERAL RELEASE (the Agreement ), dated ___________, is made by and between ______________________________, a California corporation (the Company and ___________________________ you or your ). 
 WHEREAS, you and the Company have previously entered into that certain Severance Pay Agreement dated ____________, 20___ (the Severance Pay Agreement and 
 WHEREAS, your right to receive certain severance pay and benefits pursuant to the terms of Section 4 or Section 5 of the Severance Pay Agreement, as applicable, are subject to and conditioned upon your execution and non-revocation of a general release of claims by you against the Company and its subsidiaries and affiliates. 
 WHEREAS, your right to receive the Consulting Payment provided pursuant to Section 14(e) of the Severance Pay Agreement is subject to and conditioned upon your execution and non-revocation of a general release of claims by you against the Company and its subsidiaries and affiliates and your adherence to the covenants described under Section 14 of the Severance Pay Agreement. 
 NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the premises and the mutual covenants herein contained, you and the Company hereby agree as follows 
 ONE Your signing of this Agreement confirms that your employment with the Company shall terminate at the close of business on ____________, or earlier upon our mutual agreement. 
 TWO As a material inducement for the payment of the severance and benefits of the Severance Pay Agreement, and except as otherwise provided in this Agreement, you and the Company hereby irrevocably and unconditionally release, acquit and forever discharge the other from any and all Claims either may have against the other. For purposes of this Agreement and the preceding sentence, the words Releasee or Releasees and Claim or Claims shall have the meanings set forth below 
 (a) The words Releasee or Releasees shall refer to you and to the Company and each of the Company s owners, stockholders, predecessors, successors, assigns, agents, directors, officers, employees, representatives, attorneys, advisors, parent companies, divisions, subsidiaries, affiliates (and agents, directors, officers, employees, representatives, attorneys and advisors of such parent companies, divisions, subsidiaries and affiliates) and all persons acting by, through, under or in concert with any of them. 
 (b) The words Claim or Claims shall refer to any charges, complaints, claims, liabilities, obligations, promises, agreements, controversies, damages, actions, causes of action, suits, rights, demands, costs, losses, debts and expenses (including attorneys fees and costs actually incurred) of any nature whatsoever, known or unknown, suspected or unsuspected, which you or the Company now, in the past or, in the future may have, own or hold against any of the Releasees provided, however , that the word Claim or Claims shall not refer to any charges, complaints, claims, liabilities, obligations, promises, agreements, controversies, damages, actions, causes of action, suits, rights, demands, costs, losses, debts and expenses (including attorneys fees and costs actually incurred) arising under identify severance, employee benefits, stock option, indemnification and D&O and other agreements containing duties, rights obligations etc. of either party that are to remain operative . Claims released 

pursuant to this Agreement by you and the Company include, but are not limited to, rights arising out of alleged violations of any contracts, express or implied, any tort, claim, any claim that you failed to perform or negligently performed or breached your duties during employment at the Company, any legal restrictions on the Company s right to terminate employment relationships and any federal, state or other governmental statute, regulation, or ordinance, governing the employment relationship including, without limitation, all state and federal laws and regulations prohibiting discrimination based on protected categories, and all state and federal laws and regulations prohibiting retaliation against employees for engaging in protected activity or legal off-duty conduct. This release does not extend to claims for workers compensation or other claims which by law may not be waived or released by this Agreement. 
 THREE You and the Company expressly waive and relinquish all rights and benefits afforded by any statute (including but not limited to Section 1542 of the Civil Code of the State of California and analogous laws of other states) which limits the effect of a release with respect to unknown claims. You and the Company do so understanding and acknowledging the significance of the release of unknown claims and the waiver of statutory protection against a release of unknown claims (including but not limited to Section 1542). Section 1542 of the Civil Code of the State of California states as follows 
 A GENERAL RELEASE DOES NOT EXTEND TO CLAIMS WHICH THE CREDITOR DOES NOT KNOW OR SUSPECT TO EXIST IN HIS OR HER FAVOR AT THE TIME OF EXECUTING THE RELEASE, WHICH IF KNOWN BY HIM OR HER MUST HAVE MATERIALLY AFFECTED HIS OR HER SETTLEMENT WITH THE DEBTOR. 
 Thus, notwithstanding the provisions of Section 1542 or of any similar statute, and for the purpose of implementing a full and complete release and discharge of the Releasees, you and the Company expressly acknowledge that this Agreement is intended to include in its effect, without limitation, all Claims which are known and all Claims which you or the Company do not know or suspect to exist in your or the Company s favor at the time of execution of this Agreement and that this Agreement contemplates the extinguishment of all such Claims. 
 FOUR The parties acknowledge that they might hereafter discover facts different from, or in addition to, those they now know or believe to be true with respect to a Claim or Claims released herein, and they expressly agree to assume the risk of possible discovery of additional or different facts, and agree that this Agreement shall be and remain effective, in all respects, regardless of such additional or different discovered facts. 
 FIVE As a further material inducement to the Company to enter into this Agreement, you hereby agree to indemnify and hold each of the Releasees harmless from all loss, costs, damages, or expenses, including without limitation, attorneys fees incurred by the Releasees, arising out of any breach of this Agreement by you or the fact that any representation made in this Agreement by you was false when made. 
 As a further material inducement to you to enter into this Agreement, the Company hereby agrees to indemnify and hold each of the Releasees harmless from all loss, costs, damages, or expenses, including without limitation, attorneys fees incurred by the Releasees, arising out of any breach of this Agreement by it or the fact that any representation made in this Agreement by it was knowingly false when made. 
 SIX You and the Company represent and acknowledge that in executing this Agreement, neither is relying upon any representation or statement not set forth in this Agreement or the Severance Agreement. 
 A-2 

SEVEN (a) This Agreement shall not in any way be construed as an admission by the Company that it has acted wrongfully with respect to you or any other person, or that you have any rights whatsoever against the Company, and the Company specifically disclaims any liability to or wrongful acts against you or any other person, on the part of itself, its employees or its agents. This Agreement shall not in any way be construed as an admission by you that you have acted wrongfully with respect to the Company, or that you failed to perform your duties or negligently performed or breached your duties, or that the Company had good cause to terminate your employment. 
 (b) If you are a party or are threatened to be made a party to any proceeding by reason of the fact that you were an officer or director of the Company, the Company shall indemnify you against any expenses (including reasonable attorneys fees provided , that counsel has been approved by the Company prior to retention, which approval shall not be unreasonably withheld), judgments, fines, settlements and other amounts actually or reasonably incurred by you in connection with that proceeding provided , that you acted in good faith and in a manner you reasonably believed to be in the best interest of the Company. The limitations of California Corporations Code Section 317 shall apply to this assurance of indemnification. 
 (c) You agree to cooperate with the Company and its designated attorneys, representatives and agents in connection with any actual or threatened judicial, administrative or other legal or equitable proceeding in which the Company is or may become involved. Upon reasonable notice, you agree to meet with and provide to the Company or its designated attorneys, representatives or agents all information and knowledge you have relating to the subject matter of any such proceeding. The Company agrees to reimburse you for any reasonable costs you incur in providing such cooperation. 
 EIGHT This Agreement is entered into in California and shall be governed by substantive California law, except as provided in this section. If any dispute arises between you and the Company, including but not limited to, disputes relating to this Agreement, or if you prosecute a claim you purported to release by means of this Agreement Arbitrable Dispute ), you and the Company agree to resolve that Arbitrable Dispute through final and binding arbitration under this section. You also agree to arbitrate any Arbitrable Dispute which also involves any other released party who offers or agrees to arbitrate the dispute under this section. Your agreement to arbitrate applies, for example, to disputes about the validity, interpretation, or effect of this Agreement or alleged violations of it, claims of discrimination under federal or state law, or other statutory violation claims. 
 As to any Arbitrable Dispute, you and the Company waive any right to a jury trial or a court bench trial. You and the Company also waive the right to bring, maintain, or participate in any class, collective, or representative proceeding, whether in arbitration or otherwise. Further, Arbitrable Disputes must be brought in the individual capacity of the party asserting the claim, and cannot be maintained on a class, collective, or representative basis. 
 Arbitration shall take place in San Diego, California under the employment dispute resolution rules of the Judicial Arbitration and Mediation Service JAMS ), (or, if you are employed outside of California at the time of the termination of your employment, at the nearest location of the American Arbitration Association and in accordance with the AAA rules), before an experienced employment arbitrator selected in accordance with those rules. The arbitrator may not modify or change this Agreement in any way. The Company will be responsible for paying any filing fee and the fees and costs of the Arbitrator provided, however, that if you are the party initiating the claim, you will contribute an amount equal to the filing fee to initiate a claim in the court of general jurisdiction in the state in which you are employed by the Company. Each party shall pay for its own costs and attorneys fees, if any. However if any party prevails on a statutory claim which affords the prevailing party attorneys fees and costs, or 
 A-3 

if there is a written agreement providing for attorneys fees and or costs, the Arbitrator may award reasonable attorney s fees and or costs to the prevailing party, applying the same standards a court would apply under the law applicable to the claim. The Arbitrator shall apply the Federal Rules of Evidence and shall have the authority to entertain a motion to dismiss or a motion for summary judgment by any party and shall apply the standards governing such motions under the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure. The Federal Arbitration Act shall govern the arbitration and shall govern the interpretation or enforcement of this section or any arbitration award. The arbitrator will not have the authority to consider, certify, or hear an arbitration as a class action, collective action, or any other type of representative action. 
 To the extent that the Federal Arbitration Act is inapplicable, California law pertaining to arbitration agreements shall apply. Arbitration in this manner shall be the exclusive remedy for any Arbitrable Dispute. Except as prohibited by the ADEA, should you or the Company attempt to resolve an Arbitrable Dispute by any method other than arbitration pursuant to this section, the responding party will be entitled to recover from the initiating party all damages, expenses, and attorneys fees incurred as a result of this breach. This Section TEN supersedes any existing arbitration agreement between the Company and me as to any Arbitrable Dispute. Notwithstanding anything in this Section TEN to the contrary, a claim for benefits under an ERISA-covered plan shall not be an Arbitrable Dispute. 
 NINE Both you and the Company understand that this Agreement is final and binding eight (8) days after its execution and return. Should you nevertheless attempt to challenge the enforceability of this Agreement as provided in Paragraph EIGHT or, in violation of that Paragraph, through litigation, as a further limitation on any right to make such a challenge, you shall initially tender to the Company, by certified check delivered to the Company, all monies received pursuant to Sections 4 or 5 of the Severance Pay Agreement, as applicable, plus interest, and invite the Company to retain such monies and agree with you to cancel this Agreement and void the Company s obligations under the Severance Pay Agreement. In the event the Company accepts this offer, the Company shall retain such monies and this Agreement shall be canceled and the Company shall have no obligation under Section 14(e) of the Severance Pay Agreement. In the event the Company does not accept such offer, the Company shall so notify you and shall place such monies in an interest-bearing escrow account pending resolution of the dispute between you and the Company as to whether or not this Agreement and the Company s obligations under the Severance Pay Agreement shall be set aside and or otherwise rendered voidable or unenforceable. Additionally, any consulting agreement then in effect between you and the Company shall be immediately rescinded with no requirement of notice. 
 TEN Any notices required to be given under this Agreement shall be delivered either personally or by first class United States mail, postage prepaid, addressed to the respective parties as follows

 We conducted our audits in accordance with auditing standards generally accepted in the United States of America (GAAS). Our responsibilities under those standards are further described in the Auditor s Responsibilities for the Audit of the Financial Statements section of our report. We are required to be independent of the Company and to meet our other ethical responsibilities, in accordance with the relevant ethical requirements relating to our audits. We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our audit opinion. 
 Responsibilities of Management for the Financial Statements 
 Management is responsible for the preparation and fair presentation of the financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America, and for the design, implementation, and maintenance of internal control relevant to the preparation and fair presentation of financial statements that are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error. 
 In preparing the financial statements, management is required to evaluate whether there are conditions or events, considered in the aggregate, that raise substantial doubt about the Company s ability to continue as a going concern for one year after the date that the financial statements are issued 
 
 Auditor s Responsibilities for the Audit of the Financial Statements 
 Our objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements as a whole are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and to issue an auditor s report that includes our opinion. Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance but is not absolute assurance and therefore is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with GAAS will always detect a material misstatement when it exists. The risk of not detecting a material misstatement resulting from fraud is higher than for one resulting from error, as fraud may involve collusion, forgery, intentional omissions, misrepresentations, or the override of internal control. Misstatements are considered material if there is a substantial likelihood that, individually or in the aggregate, they would influence the judgment made by a reasonable user based on the financial statements. 
 In performing an audit in accordance with GAAS, we 
 Exercise professional judgment and maintain professional skepticism throughout the audit. 
 Identify and assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to fraud or error, and design and perform audit procedures responsive to those risks. Such procedures include examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. 
 Obtain an understanding of internal control relevant to the audit in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Company s internal control. Accordingly, no such opinion is expressed. 
 5 

Exhibit 99.1 

 Evaluate the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of significant accounting estimates made by management, as well as evaluate the overall presentation of the financial statements. 
 Conclude whether, in our judgment, there are conditions or events, considered in the aggregate, that raise substantial doubt about the Company s ability to continue as a going concern for a reasonable period of time. 
 We are required to communicate with those charged with governance regarding, among other matters, the planned scope and timing of the audit, significant audit findings, and certain internal control-related matters that we identified during the audit.

 ONCOR ELECTRIC DELIVERY HOLDINGS COMPANY LLC 
 NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 
 
 1. DESCRIPTION OF BUSINESS AND SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES 
 
 Description of Business 
 
 References in this report to we, our, us and the company are to Oncor Holdings and or its direct or indirect subsidiaries as apparent in the context. See Glossary for the definition of terms and abbreviations. 
 
 We are a Dallas, Texas-based holding company whose financial statements are comprised almost entirely of the operations of our direct, majority (80.25 owned subsidiary, Oncor. Oncor is a regulated electricity transmission and distribution company that provides the essential service of delivering electricity safely, reliably and economically to end-use consumers through its electrical systems, as well as providing transmission grid connections to merchant generation facilities and interconnections to other transmission grids in Texas. Oncor s transmission and distribution rates are regulated by the PUCT and certain cities, and in certain limited instances, by the FERC. Oncor is not a seller of electricity, nor does Oncor purchase electricity for resale. Oncor Holdings is indirectly and wholly owned by Sempra. We are managed as an integrated business consequently, there are no separate reportable business segments. 
 
 Ring-Fencing Measures 
 
 Since 2007, various ring-fencing measures have been taken to enhance the credit quality of Oncor and Oncor Holdings and the separateness between the Oncor Ring-Fenced Entities and entities with ownership interests in Oncor or Oncor Holdings. These ring-fencing measures serve to mitigate the Oncor Ring-Fenced Entities credit exposure to owners of Oncor and Oncor Holdings, and to reduce the risk that the assets and liabilities of the Oncor Ring-Fenced Entities would be substantively consolidated with the assets and liabilities of any direct or indirect owners of Oncor and Oncor Holdings in connection with a bankruptcy of any such entities. These measures include the November 2008 sale of 19.75 of Oncor s equity interests to Texas Transmission. 
 
 In March 2018, Sempra indirectly acquired Oncor Holdings after obtaining various approvals, including PUCT approval through the Sempra Order, which outlines certain ring-fencing measures, governance mechanisms and restrictions that apply after the Sempra Acquisition. As a result of these ring-fencing measures, Sempra does not control Oncor or Oncor Holdings, and the ring-fencing measures limit Sempra s ability to direct the management, policies and operations of Oncor and Oncor Holdings, including the deployment or disposition of Oncor s assets, declarations of dividends, strategic planning and other important corporate issues and actions. 
 
 None of the assets of the Oncor Ring-Fenced Entities are available to satisfy the debt or obligations of any Sempra entity or any other direct or indirect owner of Oncor or Oncor Holdings. The assets and liabilities of the Oncor Ring-Fenced Entities are separate and distinct from those of any Sempra entities and any other direct or indirect owner of Oncor or Oncor Holdings. We do not bear any liability for debt or contractual obligations of Sempra and its affiliates or any other direct or indirect owner of Oncor or Oncor Holdings, and vice versa. Accordingly, our operations are conducted, and our cash flows are managed, independently from Sempra and its affiliates and any other direct or indirect owner of Oncor or Oncor Holdings. 
 
 Oncor and Oncor Holdings are each a limited liability company governed by a board of directors, not its members. The Sempra Order and Oncor s limited liability company agreement require that the board of directors of Oncor consist of thirteen members, constituted as follows 
 
 seven Disinterested Directors, who (i) shall be independent directors in all material respects under the rules of the New York Stock Exchange in relation to Sempra or its subsidiaries and affiliated entities and any entity with a direct or indirect ownership interest in Oncor or Oncor Holdings, and (ii) shall have no material relationship with Sempra or its subsidiaries or affiliated entities or any entity with a direct or indirect ownership interest in Oncor or Oncor Holdings, currently or within the previous ten years 
 two members designated by Sempra (through Oncor Holdings) 
 two members designated by Texas Transmission and 
 two current or former officers of Oncor (each, an Oncor Officer Director), currently Robert S. Shapard and E. Allen Nye, Jr., who are Oncor s Chairman of the board of directors and Chief Executive, respectively. 
 
 11 

Exhibit 99.1 

 Until March 9, 2028, in order for a current or former officer of Oncor to be eligible to serve as an Oncor Officer Director, the officer cannot have worked for Sempra or any of its subsidiaries or affiliated entities (excluding Oncor Holdings and Oncor) or any other entity with a direct or indirect ownership interest in Oncor or Oncor Holdings in the ten-year period prior to the date on which the officer first became employed by Oncor. Oncor Holdings, at the direction of STIH, has the right to nominate and or seek the removal of the Oncor Officer Directors, subject to approval by a majority of the Oncor board of directors. 
 
 The Sempra Order and our limited liability company agreement require that the board of directors of Oncor Holdings consist of eleven members, made up of six Disinterested Directors, two current or former officers of Oncor Holdings (currently Mr. Shapard and Mr. Nye) and two members designated by Sempra (through STIH). 
 
 In addition, the Sempra Order provides that the boards of directors of each of Oncor and Oncor Holdings cannot be overruled by the board of directors of Sempra or any of its subsidiaries on dividend policy, the issuance of dividends or other distributions (except for contractual tax payments), debt issuance, capital expenditures, operation and maintenance expenditures, management and service fees, and appointment or removal of members of the board of directors, provided that certain actions may also require the additional approval of the Oncor Holdings board of directors. The Sempra Order also provides that any changes to the size, composition, structure or rights of the boards of directors of each of Oncor and Oncor Holdings must first be approved by the PUCT. In addition, if Sempra acquires Texas Transmission s interest in Oncor, the two board of director positions on Oncor s board of directors that Texas Transmission is entitled to appoint will be eliminated and the size of Oncor s board of directors will be reduced by two. 
 
 Additional regulatory commitments, governance mechanisms and restrictions provided in the Sempra Order and the limited liability company agreements of Oncor and Oncor Holdings to ring-fence Oncor and Oncor Holdings from their owners include, among others 
 
 A majority of the Disinterested Directors of Oncor and the directors designated by Texas Transmission that are present and voting (of which at least one must be present and voting) must approve any Oncor annual or multi-year budget if the aggregate amount of capital expenditures or operating and maintenance expenditures in such budget is more than a 10 increase or decrease from the corresponding amounts of such expenditures in the budget for the preceding fiscal year or multi-year period, as applicable 
 Oncor and Oncor Holdings may not pay any dividends or make any other distributions (except for contractual tax payments) if a majority of its Disinterested Directors determines that it is in the best interests of Oncor and Oncor Holdings, as applicable, to retain such amounts to meet expected future requirements 
 At all times, Oncor will remain in compliance with the debt-to-equity ratio established by the PUCT from time to time for ratemaking purposes, and Oncor will not pay dividends or other distributions (except for contractual tax payments), if that payment would cause its debt-to-equity ratio to exceed the debt-to-equity ratio approved by the PUCT 
 If the credit rating on Oncor s senior secured debt by any of the three major rating agencies falls below BBB (or the equivalent), Oncor will suspend dividends and other distributions (except for contractual tax payments), unless otherwise allowed by the PUCT 
 Without the prior approval of the PUCT, neither Sempra nor any of its affiliates (excluding Oncor) will incur, guaranty or pledge assets in respect of any indebtedness that is dependent on the revenues of Oncor in more than a proportionate degree than the other revenues of Sempra or on the membership interests of Oncor, and there will be no debt at STH or STIH at any time following the closing of the Sempra Acquisition 
 Neither Oncor nor Oncor Holdings will lend money to, borrow money from or share credit facilities with Sempra or any of its affiliates (other than Oncor subsidiaries), or any entity with a direct or indirect ownership interest in Oncor or Oncor Holdings 
 There must be maintained certain separateness measures that reinforce the legal and financial separation of Oncor and Oncor Holdings from their owners, including a requirement that dealings between Oncor, Oncor Holdings and their subsidiaries with Sempra, any of Sempra s other affiliates or any entity with a direct or indirect ownership interest in Oncor or Oncor Holdings, must be on an arm s-length basis, limitations on affiliate transactions, separate recordkeeping requirements and a prohibition on Sempra or its affiliates or any entity with a direct or indirect ownership interest in Oncor or Oncor Holdings pledging Oncor assets or membership interests for any entity other than Oncor and 
 Until March 9, 2023, Sempra must hold indirectly at least 51 of the ownership interests in Oncor and Oncor Holdings, unless otherwise specifically authorized by the PUCT. 
 
 12 

Exhibit 99.1 

 Basis of Presentation 
 
 Our consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with GAAP governing rate-regulated operations. All dollar amounts in the financial statements and tables in the notes are stated in U.S. dollars in millions unless otherwise indicated. Subsequent events have been evaluated through the date these consolidated financial statements were issued. 
 
 Use of Estimates 
 
 Preparation of our financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions about future events that affect the reporting of assets and liabilities at the balance sheet dates and the reported amounts of revenue and expense, including fair value measurements. In the event estimates and or assumptions prove to be different from actual amounts, adjustments are made in subsequent periods to reflect more current information. No material adjustments were made to previous estimates or assumptions during the current year. 
 
 Revenue Recognition 
 
 Oncor s revenue is billed under tariffs approved by the PUCT and the majority of revenues are related to providing electric delivery service to consumers. Tariff rates are designed to recover the cost of providing electric delivery service including a reasonable rate of return on invested capital. Revenues are generally recognized when the underlying service has been provided in an amount prescribed by the related tariff. See Note 3 for additional information regarding revenues. 
 
 Interest Rate Derivatives, Hedge Accounting and Mark-to-Market Accounting 
 
 Oncor is exposed to interest rates primarily as a result of its current and expected use of financing. Oncor may, from time to time, utilize interest rate derivative instruments typically designated as cash flow hedges, to lock in interest rates in anticipation of future financings. Oncor may designate an interest rate derivative instrument as a cash flow hedge if it effectively converts anticipated cash flows associated with interest payments to a fixed dollar amount. Designating interest rate derivative instruments as cash flow hedges is dependent on the business context in which the instrument is being used, the effectiveness of the instrument in offsetting the risk that the future cash flows of interest payments may vary, and other criteria. In accounting for cash flow hedges, derivative assets and liabilities are recorded on the balance sheet at fair value with an offset to other comprehensive income (loss). Amounts remain in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) and are reclassified into net income as the interest expense on the related debt affects net income. 
 
 The fair value of an interest rate derivative instrument is recognized on the balance sheet as a derivative asset or liability and changes in the fair value are recognized in net income if the criteria for cash flow hedge accounting are not met or if the instrument is not designated as a cash flow hedge. This recognition is referred to as mark-to-market accounting. 
 
 Impairment of Long-Lived Assets and Goodwill 
 
 We evaluate long-lived assets (including intangible assets with finite lives) for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable. 
 
 We also evaluate goodwill for impairment annually on October 1 and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that an impairment may exist. The determination of the existence of these and other indications of impairment involves judgments that are subjective in nature and may require the use of estimates in forecasting future results and cash flows. 
 
 For our annual goodwill impairment testing, we generally have the option to directly perform a quantitative assessment or first make a qualitative assessment of whether it is more likely than not that our enterprise fair value is less than our enterprise carrying book value before applying the quantitative assessment. If we elect to perform the qualitative assessment, we evaluate relevant events and circumstances, including but not limited to, macroeconomic conditions, industry and market considerations, cost factors and our overall financial performance. If, after assessing these qualitative factors, we determine that it is more-likely-than-not that our estimated enterprise fair value is less than our enterprise carrying book value, then we perform a quantitative assessment. If, after performing the quantitative assessment, we determine that goodwill is impaired, we record the amount of goodwill impairment as the excess of enterprise carrying book value over estimated enterprise fair value, not to exceed the carrying amount of goodwill. 
 
 13 

Exhibit 99.1 

 For our annual goodwill impairment testing in 2022, we elected to perform a quantitative assessment of goodwill as of October 1, 2022. We estimated our enterprise fair value by weighting results from a market-based approach and an income-based approach. Key assumptions in the valuation methodologies for goodwill included terminal value, discount rates, and comparable multiples from publicly traded companies in our industry. Based on our analysis, we determined that our estimated enterprise fair value was in excess of our enterprise carrying book value, indicating none of our goodwill was impaired and no impairment was recognized in 2022. For our annual goodwill impairment testing in 2021, we elected to perform a qualitative assessment of goodwill as of October 1, 2021 and concluded that an estimated enterprise fair value was more likely than not greater than our enterprise carrying book value. As a result, no additional testing for impairment was required and no impairment was recognized in 2021. 
 
 Goodwill totaling 4.628 billion was reported on our balance sheet at both December 31, 2022 and 2021. 
 
 Income Taxes 
 
 Oncor is a partnership for US federal income tax purposes. Our tax sharing agreement with Oncor and STH, as successor to EFH Corp., includes Texas Transmission. The tax sharing agreement provides for the calculation of tax liability substantially as if we and Oncor file our own income tax returns, and requires tax payments to members determined on that basis (without duplication for any income taxes paid by our subsidiaries). Deferred income taxes are provided for temporary differences between our book and tax bases of assets and liabilities. 
 
 Amounts of deferred income tax assets and liabilities, as well as current and noncurrent accruals, are determined in accordance with the provisions of accounting guidance for income taxes and for uncertainty in income taxes. The accounting guidance for rate-regulated enterprises requires the recognition of regulatory assets or liabilities if it is probable such deferred tax amounts will be recovered from, or returned to customers in future rates. Investment tax credits are amortized to income over the estimated lives of the related properties. 
 
 We classify any interest and penalties expense related to uncertain tax positions as current income taxes as discussed in Note 4. 
 
 Defined Benefit Pension Plans and OPEB Plans 
 
 Oncor has liabilities under pension plans that offer benefits based on either a traditional defined benefit formula or a cash balance formula and OPEB Plans that offer certain health care and life insurance benefits to eligible employees and their eligible dependents upon the retirement of such employees. Costs of pension and OPEB Plans are dependent on numerous factors, assumptions and estimates. See Note 10 for additional information regarding pension and OPEB Plans. 
 
 System of Accounts 
 
 Our accounting records have been maintained in accordance with the FERC Uniform System of Accounts as adopted by the PUCT. 
 
 Property, Plant and Equipment 
 
 Property, plant and equipment is stated at original cost. The cost of self-constructed property additions includes materials and both direct and indirect labor and applicable overhead and AFUDC. 
 
 Depreciation of property, plant and equipment is calculated on a straight-line basis over the estimated service lives of the properties based on depreciation rates approved by the PUCT. As is common in the industry, depreciation expense is recorded using composite depreciation rates that reflect blended estimates of the lives of major asset groups as compared to depreciation expense calculated on a component asset-by-asset basis. Depreciation rates include plant removal costs as a component of depreciation expense, consistent with regulatory treatment. Actual removal costs incurred are charged to accumulated depreciation. Accrued removal costs in excess of incurred removal costs are reclassified as a regulatory liability to retire assets in the future. 
 
 Regulatory Assets and Liabilities 
 
 Oncor is subject to rate regulation and Oncor s financial statements reflect regulatory assets and liabilities in accordance with accounting standards related to the effect of certain types of regulation. Regulatory assets and liabilities represent probable future revenues that will be recovered from or refunded to customers through the ratemaking process based on PURA and or the PUCT s orders, precedents or substantive rules. Rate regulation is premised on the full recovery of prudently incurred costs and a reasonable rate of return on invested capital subject 
 14 

Exhibit 99.1 

 to PUCT review for reasonableness. Regulatory decisions can have an impact on the recovery of costs, the rate earned on invested capital and the timing and amount of assets to be recovered by rates. See Note 2 for more information regarding regulatory assets and liabilities. 
 
 Franchise Taxes 
 
 Franchise taxes are assessed to Oncor by local governmental bodies, based on kWh delivered and are a principal component of taxes other than amounts related to income taxes as reported in the income statement. Franchise taxes are not a pass through item. The rates Oncor charges customers are intended to recover the franchise taxes, but Oncor is not acting as an agent to collect the taxes from customers. 
 
 Allowance for Funds Used During Construction 
 
 AFUDC is a regulatory cost accounting procedure whereby both interest charges on borrowed funds and a return on equity capital used to finance construction are included in the recorded cost of utility plant and equipment being constructed. AFUDC is capitalized on all projects involving construction periods lasting greater than thirty days. The interest portion of capitalized AFUDC is accounted for as a reduction to interest expense and the equity portion of capitalized AFUDC is accounted for as other income. See Note 12 for detail of amounts reducing interest expense and increasing other income. 
 
 Cash, Cash Equivalents and Restricted Cash 
 
 For purposes of reporting cash and cash equivalents, highly liquid investments with original maturities of three months or less at the date of purchase are considered to be cash equivalents. 
 
 The following table provides a reconciliation of cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash reported on the Consolidated Balance Sheets to the sum of such amounts reported on the Statements of Consolidated Cash Flows

 (a) Restricted cash represents amounts deposited with Oncor for customer advances for construction that are subject to return in accordance with PUCT rules, ERCOT requirements or Oncor s tariffs relating to generation interconnection and construction and or extension of electric delivery system facilities. Oncor maintains these amounts in a separate escrow account. 
 
 Fair Value of Nonderivative Financial Instruments 
 
 The carrying amounts for financial assets classified as current assets and the carrying amounts for financial liabilities classified as current liabilities approximate fair value due to the short maturity of such instruments. The fair values of other financial instruments, for which carrying amounts and fair values have not been presented, are not materially different than their related carrying amounts. The following discussion of fair value accounting standards applies primarily to our determination of the fair value of assets in the pension plans and OPEB Plans trusts (see Note 10) and long-term debt (see Note 6). 
 
 Accounting standards related to the determination of fair value define fair value as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. We use a mid-market valuation convention (the mid-point price between bid and ask prices) as a practical expedient to measure fair value for the majority of our assets and liabilities subject to fair value measurement on a recurring basis. We primarily use the market approach for recurring fair value measurements and use valuation techniques to maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs. 

15 

Exhibit 99.1 

 We categorize our assets and liabilities recorded at fair value based upon the following fair value hierarchy 
 
 Level 1 valuations use quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities that are accessible at the measurement date. An active market is a market in which transactions for the asset or liability occur with sufficient frequency and volume to provide pricing information on an ongoing basis. 
 Level 2 valuations use inputs that, in the absence of actively quoted market prices, are observable for the asset or liability, either directly or indirectly. Level 2 inputs include (a) quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities in active markets, (b) quoted prices for identical or similar assets or liabilities in markets that are not active, (c) inputs other than quoted prices that are observable for the asset or liability such as interest rates and yield curves observable at commonly quoted intervals and (d) inputs that are derived principally from or corroborated by observable market data by correlation or other means. Our Level 2 valuations utilize over-the-counter broker quotes, quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities that are corroborated by correlations or other mathematical means and other valuation inputs. 
 Level 3 valuations use unobservable inputs for the asset or liability. Unobservable inputs are used to the extent observable inputs are not available, thereby allowing for situations in which there is little, if any, market activity for the asset or liability at the measurement date. We use the most meaningful information available from the market combined with internally developed valuation methodologies to develop our best estimate of fair value. 
 
 We utilize several different valuation techniques to measure the fair value of assets and liabilities, relying primarily on the market approach of using prices and other market information for identical and or comparable assets and liabilities for those items that are measured on a recurring basis. 
 
 The fair value of certain investments is measured using the NAV per share as a practical expedient. Such investments measured at NAV are not required to be categorized within the fair value hierarchy. 
 
 Contingencies 
 
 Our financial results may be affected by judgments and estimates related to contingencies. For loss contingencies, we accrue the loss if an event has occurred on or before the balance sheet date, and 
 
 information available through the date we file our financial statements indicates it is probable that a loss has been incurred, given the likelihood of uncertain future events and 
 the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated. 
 
 We do not accrue contingencies that might result in gains. We continuously assess contingencies for litigation claims, environmental remediation and other events. See Note 7 for a discussion of contingencies.

Exhibit 99.1 

 2. REGULATORY MATTERS 
 
 Regulatory Assets and Liabilities 
 
 Oncor is subject to rate regulation and its financial statements reflect regulatory assets and liabilities in accordance with accounting standards related to the effect of certain types of regulation. Regulatory assets and liabilities represent probable future revenues that will be recovered from or refunded to customers through the ratemaking process based on PURA and or the PUCT s orders, precedents or substantive rules. Rate regulation is premised on the full recovery of prudently incurred costs and a reasonable rate of return on invested capital subject to PUCT review for reasonableness. Regulatory decisions can have an impact on the recovery of costs, the rate earned on invested capital and the timing and amount of assets to be recovered by rates. 
 
 Components of Oncor s regulatory assets and liabilities and their remaining recovery periods as of December 31, 2022 are provided in the table below. Amounts not earning a return through rate regulation are noted.

 Base Rate Review (PUCT Docket No. 53601) 
 
 In May 2022, following an extension approved by the PUCT, Oncor filed a request for a base rate review with the PUCT and the 209 cities in Oncor s service territory that have retained original jurisdiction over rates. The base rate review test year is based on calendar year 2021 results with certain adjustments. The base rate review includes a request for an average increase over test year adjusted annualized revenue of 4.5 , and, if approved as requested, would result in an aggregate annualized revenue increase of approximately 251 million. The base rate review also requests a revised regulatory capital structure ratio of 55 debt to 45 equity and an authorized return on equity of 10.3 . Oncor s current authorized regulatory capital structure ratio is 57.5 debt to 42.5 equity and Oncor s current authorized return on equity is 9.8 . 
 
 A hearing on the merits was held before SOAH from September 26, 2022 to October 4, 2022, and a PFD was issued by the SOAH administrative law judges to the PUCT for its consideration on December 28, 2022. The PFD initially recommended a 397 million reduction to Oncor s requested annualized base rate revenue requirement, which would be a 146 million reduction to test year adjusted annualized revenue. The PFD also included recommendations for a return on equity of 9.3 , continuation of Oncor s existing 57.5 debt to 42.5 equity capital structure, disallowances of various items included in rate base, as well as other modifications to Oncor s base rate review requests. On January 19, 2023, PUCT Staff filed an errata memorandum indicating that the number run model relied upon by the PFD included a 680 million accumulated depreciation reallocation error. On February 9, 2023, the administrative law judges filed an exceptions letter indicating that they agreed that this and certain other number-running corrections and any associated flow-through adjustments should be adopted. Oncor believes the impact of the number-running errors results in an unwarranted reduction to Oncor's rate base that drives 51 million of the proposed annualized revenue decrease reflected in the PFD. Oncor further believes that the correction of the accumulated depreciation reallocation number running error will revise the PFD s recommendation to a 346 million reduction to Oncor s requested annualized base rate revenue, which would be a 95 million decrease to Oncor s test year adjusted annualized revenue. 
 
 On January 24, 2023, Oncor filed Exceptions to the Proposal for Decision (Exceptions) explaining why Oncor disagree with certain recommendations of the SOAH administrative law judges in the PFD. Other intervening parties in the proceeding filed Exceptions as well, and on February 1, 2023, Oncor filed a Reply to Exceptions addressing points in those intervenor Exceptions. Resolution of the base rate review requires issuance of a final order by the PUCT, which is expected around the end of the first quarter of 2023, with new rates going into effect following approval of tariffs reflecting that order. We cannot predict whether or to what extent Oncor s requests in the base rate review will be approved or what the ultimate impact of the proceeding will be on Oncor s or our results of operations, financial condition, liquidity, or cash flows. 
 
 DCRF Good Cause Exception Request (PUCT Docket No. 54648) 
 
 On February 13, 2023, Oncor filed an application with the PUCT requesting that it grant certain exceptions to the DCRF application filing requirements, including extending the filing deadline, due to the timing of Oncor s pending base rate review. Oncor requested that Oncor s April 8, 2023 deadline for filing a DCRF application for eligible distribution investments placed into service during 2022 be extended until at least May 31, 2023. 
 
 3. REVENUES 
 
 General 
 
 Oncor s revenue is billed monthly under tariffs approved by the PUCT and the majority of revenues are related to providing electric delivery service to consumers. Tariff rates are designed to recover the cost of providing electric delivery service to customers including a reasonable rate of return on invested capital. As the volumes delivered can be directly measured, Oncor revenues are recognized when the underlying service has been provided in an amount prescribed by the related tariff. Oncor recognizes revenue in the amount that it has the right to invoice. Substantially all of Oncor s revenues are from contracts with customers except for alternative revenue program revenues discussed below. 
 
 18 

Exhibit 99.1 

 Reconcilable Tariffs 
 
 The PUCT has designated certain tariffs (primarily TCRF and EECRF) as reconcilable, which means the differences between amounts billed under these tariffs and the related incurred costs are deferred as either regulatory assets or regulatory liabilities. Accordingly, at prescribed intervals, future tariffs are adjusted to either repay regulatory liabilities or collect regulatory assets. 
 
 Alternative Revenue Program 
 
 The PUCT has implemented an incentive program allowing Oncor to earn energy efficiency program performance bonuses by exceeding PURA-mandated energy efficiency program targets. This incentive program and the related performance bonus revenues are considered an alternative revenue program under GAAP. Annual performance bonuses are recognized as revenue when approved by the PUCT, typically in the third or fourth quarter each year. The PUCT approved annual energy efficiency program performance bonuses for Oncor of 28 million and 31 million that Oncor recognized in revenues in 2022 and 2021, respectively. 
 
 Disaggregation of Revenues 
 
 The following table reflects electric delivery revenues disaggregated by tariff

 Customers 
 
 At December 31, 2022, Oncor s distribution business customers primarily consist of over 100 REPs that sell the electricity that Oncor distributes to consumers in Oncor s certificated service area. The consumers of the electricity that Oncor delivers (other than ultimate end-use customers served by an electric cooperative or a municipally-owned utility) are free to choose their electricity supplier from REPs who compete for their business. Oncor s transmission base revenues are collected from load serving entities benefitting from Oncor s transmission system. Oncor s transmission business customers consist of municipally-owned utilities, electric cooperatives and other distribution companies. Revenues from REP subsidiaries of Oncor s two largest customers collectively represented 26 and 24 , respectively, of its total operating revenues for the year ended 2022, 25 and 23 , respectively, of Oncor s total operating revenues for the year ended 2021 and 25 and 18 , respectively, of its total operating revenues for the year ended 2020. No other customer represented more than 10 of Oncor s total operating revenues. 
 19 

Exhibit 99.1 

Variability 
 
 Our revenues and cash flows are subject to seasonality, timing of customer billings, weather conditions and other electricity usage drivers, with revenues being highest in the summer. Payment of customer billings is due 35 days after invoicing. Under a PUCT rule relating to the Certification of Retail Electric Providers, write-offs of uncollectible amounts owed by REPs are recoverable as a regulatory asset. 
 
 Pass-through Expenses 
 
 Revenue equal to expenses that are allowed to be passed-through to customers (primarily third-party wholesale transmission service and energy efficiency program costs) are recognized at the time the expense is recognized. Franchise taxes are assessed by local governmental bodies, based on kWh delivered and are not a pass-through item. The rates Oncor charges customers are intended to recover the franchise taxes, but Oncor is not acting as an agent to collect the taxes from customers therefore, franchise taxes are reported as a principal component of taxes other than amounts related to income taxes instead of a reduction to revenues in the income statement.

At December 31, 2022 and 2021, net amounts of 1.517 billion and 1.429 billion, respectively, were reported in the balance sheets as accumulated deferred income taxes. These amounts include 1.667 billion and 1.567 billion, respectively, related to our investment in Oncor. Additionally, we had net deferred tax assets of 150 million and 138 million, related to our outside basis differences in Oncor at December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively, and none related to our other temporary differences. 
 
 Accounting For Uncertainty in Income Taxes 
 
 The statute of limitations is open for the Oncor partnership tax returns for the years beginning after December 31, 2018. Oncor filed a refund claim for the tax year ending December 31, 2018, but the tax year is closed for new issues. Texas margin tax returns are still open for examination for tax years beginning after 2017. Oncor is not a member of any consolidated federal tax group and assess Oncor s liability for uncertain tax positions in Oncor s partnership returns. 
 
 Oncor had approximately 1 million and 495,000 of uncertain tax positions at December 31, 2022 and December 31, 2021, respectively. Noncurrent liabilities included negligible amounts of accrued interest related to uncertain tax positions at December 31, 2022 and December 31, 2021. There were negligible amounts recorded related to interest and penalties in the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively, and none in the year ended December 31, 2020. The federal income tax benefit on the interest accrued on uncertain tax positions, if any, is recorded as liability in lieu of deferred income taxes.

Exhibit 99.1 

 5. SHORT-TERM BORROWINGS 
 
 Oncor Holdings (parent) is prohibited in its limited liability company agreement from directly incurring indebtedness for borrowed money. The following table reflects Oncor s outstanding short-term borrowings and available unused credit under the Credit Facility and CP Program at December 31, 2022 and 2021 
 
 At December 31, 2022 2021 Total credit facility borrowing capacity 2,000 2,000 Credit facility outstanding borrowings Commercial paper outstanding (a) (198) 
 (215) 
 Letters of credit outstanding (b) (8) 
 Available unused credit 1,802 1,777 
 ____________ 
 (a) The weighted average interest rates for commercial paper were 4.58 and 0.30 at December 31, 2022 and December 31, 2021, respectively. All outstanding CP Notes at December 31, 2022 and December 31, 2021 had maturity dates of less than one year. 
 (b) The interest rate on the outstanding letters of credit at December 31, 2021 was 1.20 based on Oncor s credit ratings. 
 
 Credit Facility 
 
 At December 31, 2022, Oncor had a 2.0 billion unsecured Credit Facility that may be used for working capital and other general corporate purposes, and issuances of letters of credit. Oncor s CP Program obtains liquidity support from the Credit Facility. The Credit Facility, which was entered into in November 2021 and extended in November 2022 by amendment, has a maturity date of November 9, 2027. Oncor has the option to request one additional 1-year extension. Oncor also has the option to request an increase in Oncor s borrowing capacity of up to 400 million in 100 million minimum increments, provided certain conditions set forth in the Credit Facility are met, including lender approvals. Borrowings under the Credit Facility, if any, are classified as short-term on the balance sheet. 
 
 The amendment to the Credit Facility in November 2022 also replaced the LIBOR-based interest rates with interest rates based on SOFR, subject to adjustments as specified therein. Borrowings under the Credit Facility bear interest at a per annum rate equal to, at Oncor s option, (i) term SOFR for the interest period relevant to such borrowing plus an adjustment of 0.10 (the SOFR Adjustment) plus an applicable margin of between 0.875 and 1.50 , depending on certain credit ratings assigned to Oncor, or (ii) an alternate base rate (equal to the greatest of (1) the prime rate as quoted by The Wall Street Journal on such date, (2) the greater of the federal funds effective rate or the overnight bank funding rate, plus 0.50 , and (3) term SOFR for a one month interest period on such date, plus the SOFR Adjustment plus 1.0 plus, in each case, an applicable margin of between 0.00 and 0.50 , depending on certain credit ratings assigned to Oncor s debt. The Credit Facility also provides for an alternative rate of interest upon the occurrence of certain events related to the current benchmark. 
 
 A commitment fee is payable quarterly in arrears and upon termination or commitment reduction at a rate per annum equal to between 0.075 and 0.225 , depending on certain credit ratings assigned to Oncor, of the commitments under the Credit Facility. Letter of credit fees under the Credit Facility are payable quarterly in arrears and upon termination at a rate per annum equal to the applicable margin for adjusted term SOFR under the Credit Facility. Fronting fees in an amount as separately agreed by Oncor and any fronting bank that issues a letter of credit are also payable quarterly in arrears and upon termination to each such fronting bank. 
 
 The Credit Facility includes sustainability-linked pricing metrics related to specific environmental and employee health and safety sustainability objectives. The Credit Facility provides that the applicable margin and commitment fee may be increased, decreased or have no change depending on Oncor s annual performance on the two sustainability-linked pricing metrics set forth in the Credit Facility. The maximum pricing adjustment in any given year is + - 0.01 on the commitment fee and + - 0.05 on the applicable margin. 
 
 The Credit Facility requires that Oncor maintain a maximum consolidated senior debt to consolidated total capitalization ratio of 0.65 to 1.00 and observe certain customary reporting requirements and other affirmative covenants. At December 31, 2022, Oncor was in compliance with these covenants. 
 
 The Credit Facility also contains customary events of default for facilities of this type, the occurrence of which would allow the lenders to accelerate all outstanding loans and terminate their commitments, including certain changes in control of Oncor that are not permitted transactions under the Credit Facility and cross-default provisions in the event Oncor or any of its subsidiaries defaults on indebtedness in a principal amount in excess of 
 23 

Exhibit 99.1 

 100 million or receives judgments for the payment of money in excess of 100 million that are not discharged or stayed within 60 days. 
 
 CP Program 
 
 Oncor maintains the CP Program, under which it may issue unsecured CP Notes (with a maturity date not exceeding 397 days from the date of issue) on a private placement basis up to a maximum aggregate face or principal amount outstanding at any time of 2.0 billion. The proceeds of CP Notes issued under the CP Program are used for working capital and general corporate purposes. In November 2022, Oncor amended the CP Program to provide for, among other things, an extension of the maximum maturity date for CP Notes. As amended, the CP Program now provides that CP Notes may be issued with maturity dates not exceeding 397 days from the date of issuance. The CP Program obtains liquidity support from Oncor s Credit Facility discussed above. Oncor may utilize either the CP Program or the Credit Facility at its option, to meet funding needs.

 6. LONG-TERM DEBT 
 
 Oncor Holdings (parent) is prohibited in its limited liability company agreement from directly incurring indebtedness for borrowed money. Oncor s long-term debt at December 31, 2022 consisted of fixed rate secured debt and variable rate unsecured debt. Oncor s secured debt is secured equally and ratably by a first priority lien on certain transmission and distribution assets. See Deed of Trust below for additional information. 
 
 At December 31, 2022 and 2021, Oncor s long-term debt consisted of the following

Exhibit 99.1 

 On May 20, 2022, Oncor issued 400 million aggregate principal amount of 4.15 senior secured notes due June 1, 2032 (4.15 2032 Notes) and 400 million aggregate principal amount of 4.60 senior secured notes due June 1, 2052 (4.60 2052 Notes). 
 
 Oncor intends to allocate disburse the proceeds from the sale of the 4.15 2032 Notes (net of the discounts and fees to the initial purchasers and the estimated pro rata expenses related to the offering of the 4.15 2032 Notes) of approximately 395 million, or an amount equal to the net proceeds from the sale of the 4.15 2032 Notes, to finance and or refinance, in whole or in part, investments in or expenditures on one or more new and or existing eligible green projects in accordance with Oncor s sustainable financing framework. Eligible green projects include transmission and distribution projects connecting renewable energy sources to the ERCOT grid, customer energy efficiency programs, and deployment of automated metering infrastructure and smart grid technology.

Prior to June 15, 2032, in the case of the 4.55 2032 Notes and March 15, 2052 in the case of the 4.95 2052 Notes, Oncor may redeem such notes at any time, in whole or in part, at a price equal to 100 of their principal amount, plus accrued and unpaid interest and a make-whole premium. On and after June 15, 2032 in the case of the 4.55 2032 Notes and March 15, 2052 in the case of the 4.95 2052 Notes, Oncor may redeem such notes at any time, in whole or in part, at a redemption price equal to 100 of the principal amount of such notes, plus accrued and unpaid interest.

The fair value is estimated using observable market data, representing Level 2 valuations under accounting standards related to the determination of fair value. 

7. COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES 
 
 Leases 
 
 General 
 
 A lease exists when a contract conveys the right to control the use of an identified asset for a period of time in exchange for consideration. As lessee, Oncor s leased assets primarily consist of Oncor s vehicle fleet and real estate leased for company offices and service centers. Oncor s leases are accounted for as operating leases for GAAP purposes. At December 31, 2022 and 2021, Oncor had 5 million and 3 million, respectively, in GAAP operating leases that are treated as capital leases solely for rate-making purposes. Oncor generally recognizes operating lease costs on a straight-line basis over the lease term in operating expenses. Oncor is not a lessor to any material lease contracts. 
 
 As of the lease commencement date, Oncor recognizes a lease liability for Oncor s obligation to make lease payments, which is initially measured at present value using Oncor s incremental borrowing rate at the date of lease commencement, unless the rate implicit in the lease is readily determinable. Oncor determines its incremental borrowing rate based on the rate of interest that it would have to pay to borrow an amount equal to the lease payments on a collateralized basis over a similar term in a similar economic environment. Oncor also records a ROU asset for its right to use the underlying asset, which is initially equal to the lease liability and adjusted for any lease payments made at or before lease commencement, lease incentives and any initial direct costs. 
 
 Some of Oncor s lease agreements contain nonlease components, which represent items or activities that transfer a good or service. Oncor separates lease components from nonlease components, if any, for Oncor s fleet vehicle and real estate leases for purposes of calculating the related lease liability and ROU asset. 
 
 Certain of Oncor s leases include options to extend the lease terms for up to 20 years, while others include options to terminate early. Oncor s lease liabilities and ROU assets are based on lease terms that may include such options to extend or terminate the lease when it is reasonably certain that Oncor will exercise that option. 
 
 28 

Exhibit 99.1 

 Short-term Leases 
 
 Some of Oncor s contracts are short-term leases, which have a lease term of 12 months or less at lease commencement. As allowed by GAAP, Oncor does not recognize a lease liability or ROU asset arising from short-term leases for all existing classes of underlying assets. Oncor recognizes short-term lease costs on a straight-line basis over the lease term.

 Capital Expenditures 
 
 As part of the Sempra Acquisition, Oncor committed to make minimum aggregate capital expenditures equal to at least 7.5 billion from January 1, 2018 to December 31, 2022. Oncor s actual capital expenditures from January 1, 2018 to December 31, 2022 totaled 11.9 billion. 
 
 Sales and Use Tax Audits 
 
 Oncor is subject to sales and use tax audits in the normal course of business. Currently, the Texas State Comptroller s office is conducting sales and use tax audits for audit periods January 2010 through June 2013, July 2013 through December 2017, and January 2018 through December 2022, respectively. No audit reports have been issued for these audits. While the outcome is uncertain, based on Oncor s analysis, Oncor does not expect the ultimate resolution of these audits will have a material adverse effect on Oncor s financial position, results of operations, or cash flows. 
 
 Energy Efficiency Spending 
 
 Oncor is required to annually invest in programs designed to improve customer electricity demand and consumption efficiencies to satisfy ongoing regulatory requirements. The requirement for the year 2023 is 52 million, which is recoverable through EECRF rates. 
 
 Legal Regulatory Proceedings 
 In May 2022, Oncor filed a base rate review with the PUCT and the cities in Oncor s service territory that have retained original jurisdiction over rates. In addition, in February 2023, Oncor filed an application with the PUCT requesting that it grant certain exceptions to the DCRF filing application requirements, including extending the filing deadline. See Note 2 above for additional information regarding these proceedings. Oncor is also involved in other legal and administrative proceedings in the normal course of business, the ultimate resolution of which, in the opinion of management, should not have a material effect upon Oncor s financial position, results of operations, or cash flows. 
 
 Labor Contracts 
 
 At December 31, 2022, approximately 17 of Oncor s full time employees were represented by a labor union and covered by a collective bargaining agreement that expires in October 2026. 
 
 Environmental Contingencies 
 
 Oncor must comply with environmental laws and regulations applicable to the handling and disposal of hazardous waste. Oncor is in compliance with all current laws and regulations however, the impact, if any, of changes to existing regulations or the implementation of new regulations is not determinable. The costs to comply with environmental regulations can be significantly affected by the following external events or conditions 
 
 changes to existing state or federal regulation by governmental authorities having jurisdiction over control of toxic substances and hazardous and solid wastes, and other environmental matters, and 
 the identification of additional sites requiring clean-up or the filing of other complaints in which Oncor may be asserted to be a potential responsible party. 
 30 

Exhibit 99.1 

Oncor has not identified any significant potential environmental liabilities at this time. 
 
 8. MEMBERSHIP INTERESTS - ONCOR HOLDINGS 
 
 Contributions 

On February 13, 2023, Oncor Holdings received cash capital contributions from its member totaling 85 million. During 2022, Oncor Holdings received the following cash capital contributions from its member, each of which it subsequently contributed to Oncor. 
 
 Receipt Dates Amounts February 17, 2022 85 April 26, 2022 85 July 26, 2022 85 October 24, 2022 85 

Distributions 
 
 While there are no direct restrictions on our ability to distribute our net income that are currently material, substantially all of our net income is derived from Oncor. Our board of directors or a majority of the Disinterested Directors, can withhold distributions (other than contractual tax payments) to the extent they determine that it is necessary to retain such amounts to meet the company s expected future requirements. 
 
 Oncor s distributions are limited by the requirement to maintain its regulatory capital structure at or below the debt-to-equity ratio established periodically by the PUCT for ratemaking purposes. The PUCT has the authority to determine what types of debt and equity are included in a utility s debt-to-equity ratio. For purposes of this ratio, debt is calculated as long-term debt including any finance leases plus unamortized gains on reacquired debt less unamortized issuance expenses, premiums and losses on reacquired debt. Equity is calculated as membership interests determined in accordance with GAAP, excluding accumulated other comprehensive loss and the effects of acquisition accounting from a 2007 transaction. 
 
 The Sempra Order and the limited liability company agreement for Oncor sets forth various restrictions on distributions to members. Among those restrictions is the commitment that Oncor will make no distributions (other than contractual tax payments) to its members that would cause Oncor to exceed the PUCT s authorized debt-to-equity ratio. Oncor s current authorized regulatory capital structure is 57.5 debt to 42.5 equity. The distribution restrictions also include the ability of a majority of Oncor s Disinterested Directors, or either of the two member directors designated by Texas Transmission, to limit distributions to the extent each determines it is necessary to meet expected future requirements of Oncor (including continuing compliance with the PUCT debt-to-equity ratio commitment). At December 31, 2022, Oncor s regulatory capitalization was 53.5 debt to 46.5 equity, and as a result Oncor had 1.479 billion available to distribute to its members. 
 
 On February 14, 2023, our board of directors declared a cash distribution of 85 million, which was paid to our member on February 15, 2023. During 2022, our board of directors declared, and we paid, the following cash distributions to our member 
 Declaration Dates Payment Dates Amounts February 18, 2022 February 18, 2022 85 April 27, 2022 April 28, 2022 85 July 27, 2022 July 28, 2022 85 October 25, 2022 October 26, 2022 85

10 . EMPLOYEE BENEFIT PLANS 
 
 Regulatory Recovery of Pension and OPEB Costs 
 
 PURA provides for Oncor s recovery of pension and OPEB costs applicable to services of its active and retired employees, as well as services of certain EFH Corp. Vistra active and retired employees for periods prior to the deregulation and disaggregation of EFH Corp. s electric utility businesses effective January 1, 2002 (recoverable service). Accordingly, in 2005, Oncor entered into an agreement with a predecessor of EFH Corp. whereby it assumed responsibility for applicable pension and OPEB costs related to those personnel s recoverable service. Oncor subsequently entered into agreements with EFH Corp. and a Vistra affiliate regarding provision of these benefits. Pursuant to the agreement with the Vistra affiliate, Oncor sponsors an OPEB plan that provides certain retirement healthcare and life insurance benefits to eligible former Oncor, EFH Corp. and Vistra employees for whom both Oncor and Vistra bear a portion of the benefit responsibility. See OPEB Plans below for more information. 
 
 Oncor is authorized to establish a regulatory asset or liability for the difference between the amounts of pension and OPEB costs approved in current billing rates and the actual amounts that would otherwise have been recorded as charges or credits to earnings related to recoverable service. Amounts deferred are ultimately subject to regulatory approval. At December 31, 2022 and 2021, Oncor had recorded net regulatory assets totaling 346 million and 581 million, respectively, related to pension and OPEB costs, including amounts related to deferred expenses as well as amounts related to unfunded liabilities that otherwise would be recorded as other comprehensive income. 
 
 Oncor also assumed primary responsibility for pension benefits of a closed group of retired and terminated vested plan participants not related to Oncor s regulated utility business (non-recoverable service) in a 2012 transaction. Any retirement costs associated with non-recoverable service are not recoverable through rates. 
 
 Pension Plans 
 
 Oncor sponsors the Oncor Retirement Plan and also has liabilities related to the Vistra Retirement Plan, both of which are qualified pension plans under Section 401(a) of the Code, and are subject to the provisions of ERISA. Employees do not contribute to either plan. These pension plans provide benefits to participants under one of two formulas (i) a Cash Balance Formula under which participants earn monthly contribution credits based on their compensation and a combination of their age and years of service, plus monthly interest credits or (ii) a Traditional Retirement Plan Formula based on years of service and the average earnings of the three years of highest earnings. The interest component of the Cash Balance Formula is variable and is determined using the yield on 30-year Treasury bonds. The weighted-average interest crediting rate assumption for the Cash Balance Formula was 3.0 for 2022. Under the Cash Balance Formula, future increases in earnings will not apply to prior service costs. 
 
 All eligible employees hired after January 1, 2001 participate under the Cash Balance Formula. Certain employees, who, prior to January 1, 2002, participated under the Traditional Retirement Plan Formula, continue their participation under that formula. It is Oncor s policy to fund its plans on a current basis to the extent required under existing federal tax and ERISA regulations. 
 
 Oncor also has the Supplemental Retirement Plan for certain employees whose retirement benefits cannot be fully earned under the qualified retirement plan. Supplemental Retirement Plan amounts are included in the reported pension amounts below. 
 
 33 

Exhibit 99.1 

 At December 31, 2022, the pension plans projected benefit obligation included a net actuarial gain of 662 million for 2022 attributable primarily to an increase in the discount rate due to changes in the corporate bond markets, partially offset by losses associated with economic assumption updates and plan experience different than expected. 
 
 OPEB Plans 
 
 Oncor currently sponsors two OPEB Plans. One plan covers Oncor s eligible current and future retirees whose services are 100 attributed to the regulated business. Effective January 1, 2018, Oncor established a second plan to cover eligible retirees of Oncor and EFH Corp. Vistra whose employment services were assigned to both Oncor (or a predecessor regulated utility business) and the non-regulated business of EFH Corp. Vistra. Vistra is solely responsible for its portion of the liability for retiree benefits related to those retirees. 
 
 Oncor s contribution policy for the OPEB Plans is to place in irrevocable external trusts dedicated to the payment of OPEB expenses an amount at least equal to the OPEB expense recovered in rates. 
 
 At December 31, 2022, the OPEB Plans projected benefit obligation included a net actuarial gain of 190 million for 2022 attributable primarily to an increase in the discount rate due to changes in the corporate bond markets. 
 
 Pension and OPEB Costs Recognized as Expense 
 
 Pension and OPEB amounts provided herein include amounts related only to Oncor s obligations with respect to the various plans based on actuarial computations and reflect Oncor s employee and retiree demographics as described above. 
 
 The calculated value method is used to determine the market-related value of the assets held in the trust for purposes of calculating pension costs. Realized and unrealized gains or losses in the market-related value of assets are included over a rolling four-year period. Each year, 25 of such gains and losses for the current year and for each of the preceding three years is included in the market-related value. Each year, the market-related value of assets is increased for contributions to the plan and investment income and is decreased for benefit payments and expenses for that year. 
 
 The fair value method is used to determine the market-related value of the assets held in the trust for purposes of calculating OPEB cost.

Pension Plans and OPEB Plans Investment Strategy and Asset Allocations 
 
 Oncor s investment objective for the retirement plans is to invest in a suitable mix of assets to meet the future benefit obligations at an acceptable level of risk, while minimizing the volatility of contributions. Equity securities are held to achieve returns in excess of passive indexes by participating in a wide range of investment opportunities. International equity, real estate securities and credit strategies (high yield bonds, emerging market debt and bank loans) are used to further diversify the equity portfolio. International equity securities may include investments in both developed and emerging international markets. Fixed income securities include primarily corporate bonds from a diversified range of companies, U.S. Treasuries and agency securities and money market instruments. The investment strategy for fixed income investments is to maintain a high grade portfolio of securities, which assists Oncor in managing the volatility and magnitude of plan contributions and expense while maintaining sufficient cash and short-term investments to pay near-term benefits and expenses. 
 
 The Oncor Retirement Plan s investments are managed in two pools one pool associated with the recoverable service portion of plan obligations related to Oncor s regulated utility business, and a second pool associated with the non-recoverable service portion of plan obligations not related to Oncor s regulated utility business. Each pool is invested in a broadly diversified portfolio as shown below. The second pool represents 25 of total investments at December 31, 2022. 
 
 The target asset allocation ranges of the pension plans investments by asset category are as follows 

Target Allocation Ranges Asset Category Recoverable Non-recoverable International equities 8 - 16 5 - 11 U.S. equities 17 - 25 11 - 17 Real estate 7 - 11 3 - 7 Credit strategies 3 - 7 3 - 7 Fixed income 48 - 58 65 - 75 
 
 The investment objective for the OPEB Plans primarily follows the objectives of the pension plans discussed above, while maintaining sufficient cash and short-term investments to pay near-term benefits and expenses. The actual amounts at December 31, 2022 provided below are consistent with the asset allocation targets.

 Expected Long-Term Rate of Return on Assets Assumption 
 
 The retirement plans strategic asset allocation is determined in conjunction with the plans advisors and utilizes a comprehensive Asset-Liability modeling approach to evaluate potential long-term outcomes of various investment strategies. The modeling incorporates long-term rate of return assumptions for each asset class based on historical and future expected asset class returns, current market conditions, rate of inflation, current prospects for economic growth, and taking into account the diversification benefits of investing in multiple asset classes and potential benefits of employing active investment management.

 _____________ 
 (a) The 2023 expected long-term rate of return for the nonregulated portion of the Oncor Retirement Plan is 5.83 , and for Oncor s obligations with respect to the Vistra Retirement Plan is 6.47 . 
 
 Significant Concentrations of Risk 
 
 The plans investments are exposed to risks such as interest rate, capital market and credit risks. Oncor seeks to optimize return on investment consistent with levels of liquidity and investment risk which are prudent and reasonable, given prevailing capital market conditions and other factors specific to participating employers. While Oncor recognizes the importance of return, investments will be diversified in order to minimize the risk of large losses unless, under the circumstances, it is clearly prudent not to do so. There are also various restrictions and guidelines in place including limitations on types of investments allowed and portfolio weightings for certain investment securities to assist in the mitigation of the risk of large losses. 
 
 Assumed Discount Rate 
 
 For the Oncor Retirement Plan at December 31, 2022, we selected the assumed discount rate using the Aon AA-AAA Bond Universe yield curve, which is based on corporate bond yields and at December 31, 2022 consisted of 1,138 corporate bonds with an average rating of AA and AAA using Moody s, S&P and Fitch ratings. For Oncor s obligations with respect to the Vistra Retirement Plan and the OPEB Plans at December 31, 2022, we selected the assumed discount rate using the Aon AA Above Median yield curve, which is based on corporate bond yields and at December 31, 2022 consisted of 504 corporate bonds with an average rating of AA using Moody s, S&P and Fitch ratings. 
 
 Future Pension Plans and OPEB Plans Cash Contributions 
 
 Based on applicable minimum funding requirements and the latest actuarial projections, Oncor s future funding for the pension plans and the OPEB Plans, is expected to total 5 million and 22 million, respectively, in 2023 and approximately 356 million and 126 million, respectively, in the five-year period 2023 to 2027. Oncor may also elect to make additional discretionary contributions based on market and or business conditions. 
 
 Future Benefit Payments 
 
 Estimated future benefit payments to participants are as follows 
 
 2023 2024 2025 2026 2027 2028-32 Pension plans 176 180 184 186 186 925 OPEB Plans 45 47 48 48 49 242 
 
 Thrift Plan 
 
 Oncor s employees are eligible to participate in a qualified savings plan, the Oncor Thrift Plan, which is a participant-directed defined contribution plan subject to the provisions of ERISA and intended to qualify under Section 401(a) of the Code, and to meet the requirements of Code Sections 401(k) and 401(m). Under the plan, Oncor s employees may contribute, through pre-tax salary deferrals and or after-tax applicable payroll deductions, a portion of their regular salary or wages as permitted under law. Employer matching contributions are made in an amount equal to 100 of the first 6 of employee contributions for employees who are covered under the Cash 
 41 

Exhibit 99.1 

 Balance Formula of the Oncor Retirement Plan, and 75 of the first 6 of employee contributions for employees who are covered under the Traditional Retirement Plan Formula of the Oncor Retirement Plan. Employer matching contributions are made in cash and may be allocated by participants to any of the plan s investment options. Oncor s contributions to the Oncor Thrift Plan totaled 26 million, 24 million and 23 million for the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively. 
 
 11. RELATED-PARTY TRANSACTIONS 
 
 The following represent our significant related-party transactions and related matters. 
 
 We are a member of Sempra s federal consolidated tax group and therefore Sempra s federal consolidated income tax return includes our results. Included in our results as reported in Sempra s federal consolidated tax return is our portion of Oncor s taxable income. Under the terms of a tax sharing agreement, we are obligated to make payments to STH in an aggregate amount that is substantially equal to the amount of federal income taxes that we would have been required to pay if we were filing our own corporate income tax return. Also under the terms of the tax sharing agreement, Oncor makes similar payments to Texas Transmission, pro rata in accordance with its respective membership interest in Oncor, in an aggregate amount that is substantially equal to the amount of federal income taxes that Oncor would have been required to pay if it were filing its own corporate income tax return. STH also includes Oncor s results in its combined Texas state margin tax return, and consistent with the tax sharing agreement, Oncor remits to STH Texas margin tax payments, which are accounted for as income taxes and calculated as if Oncor was filing its own return. See discussion in Note 1 to Financial Statements under Income Taxes.

 CONDENSED FINANCIAL INFORMATION 
 NOTES TO CONDENSED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 
 
 Basis of Presentation 
 
 References herein to we, our, us and the company are to Oncor Holdings (Parent Co.) and or its direct or indirect subsidiaries as apparent in the context. 
 
 The accompanying condensed balance sheets are presented at December 31, 2022 and 2021, and the accompanying condensed statements of income and cash flows are presented for the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020. We are a Delaware limited liability company indirectly wholly owned by Sempra. As of December 31, 2022, we own 80.25 of the membership interests in Oncor. Certain information and footnote disclosures normally included in financial statements prepared in accordance with GAAP have been omitted pursuant to the rules of the SEC. Because the condensed financial statements do not include all of the information and footnotes required by GAAP, they should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and Notes 1 through 13. Our interest in our subsidiary Oncor has been accounted for under the equity method in this condensed financial information. All dollar amounts in the financial statements are stated in millions of US dollars unless otherwise indicated. 
 
 Distribution Restrictions 
 
 While there are no direct restrictions on our ability to distribute our net income that are currently material, substantially all of our net income is derived from Oncor. Our board of directors and Oncor s board of directors, which are each composed of a majority of Disinterested Directors, can withhold distributions to the extent such board determines that it is necessary to retain such amounts to meet our expected future requirements. In addition, we and Oncor cannot make distributions (except for contractual tax payments) of amounts to the extent a majority of the Disinterested Directors on the respective board determines that such amounts are necessary to meet expected future requirements of the company. At Oncor, either of the two directors designated to serve on the Oncor board of directors by Texas Transmission could also prevent Oncor from making distributions (other than contractual tax payments) to the extent such director determines it is in the best interests of Oncor to retain such amounts to meet expected future requirements, including continuing compliance with the debt-to-equity ratio established from time to time by the PUCT for rate-making purposes. The PUCT has the authority to determine what types of debt and equity are included in a utility s debt-to-equity ratio. For purposes of this ratio, debt is calculated as long-term debt including finance leases plus unamortized gains on reacquired debt less unamortized issuance expenses, premiums and losses on reacquired debt. Equity is calculated as membership interests determined in accordance with GAAP, excluding accumulated other comprehensive loss and the effects of acquisition accounting from a 2007 transaction. 
 
 Oncor s distributions are limited by the requirement to maintain its regulatory capital structure at or below the debt-to-equity ratio established periodically by the PUCT for ratemaking purposes. Oncor s current authorized regulatory capital structure set by the PUCT is 57.5 debt to 42.5 equity. At December 31, 2022, Oncor s regulatory capitalization was 53.5 debt to 46.5 equity. 
 
 During 2022, 2021 and 2020, Oncor s board of directors declared, and Oncor paid to us the following cash distributions 
 Years Ended December 31, 2022 2021 2020 (dollars in millions) Distributions received, subsequently paid as a distribution recognized as financing activities 340 673 286 Total distributions from Oncor 340 673 286
