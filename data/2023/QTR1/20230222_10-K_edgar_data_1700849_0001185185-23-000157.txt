Cautionary Note Regarding Forward Looking Statements 

This Report contains forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, including statements regarding our anticipated acquisition of a digital marketing and services company, future trends of such business, the need for and use of proceeds from one or more financings for strategic arrangements and partnerships, our future capital needs and ability to obtain financings and liquidity. All statements other than statements of historical facts contained in this report, including statements regarding our future financial position, liquidity, business strategy and plans and objectives of management for future operations, are forward-looking statements. The words believe, may, estimate, continue, anticipate, intend, should, plan, could, target, potential, is likely, will, expect and similar expressions, as they relate to us, are intended to identify forward-looking statements. We have based these forward-looking statements largely on our current expectations and projections about future events and financial trends that we believe may affect our financial condition, results of operations, business strategy and financial needs. 

The results anticipated by any or all of these forward-looking statements might not occur. Important factors, uncertainties and risks that may cause actual results to differ materially from these forward-looking statements include those described in Item 1A. Risk Factors and in Item 1 - Business under aX Risk Factors , particularly with respect to risks and uncertainties based on the possibility that the acquisition of the digital marketing and services company under the Exchange Agreement (as defined below) does not close, the lack of any post-acquisition operating history or financial metrics through which to evaluate us on a post-acquisition basis if the transaction does close, as well as the fact that investors do not have access to information concerning the acquisition target, including material information and risk factors applicable to it, as of the date of this Report, any inability to successfully integrate the management and business of the target entity with the new post-transaction operations, our need for and challenges we may face in obtaining the necessary financing to execute our business plan on favorable terms or at all, national and local economic factors, unfavorable regulatory or consumer spending developments, and our ability to scale operations and expand into the new sectors. We undertake no obligation to publicly update or revise any forward-looking statements, whether as the result of new information, future events or otherwise. 

Description of Business 

Vado Corp. was incorporated in the State of Nevada on February 10, 2017 and established a fiscal year end of November 30. We have not generated material revenues, have minimal assets and have incurred losses since inception. We were formed to engage in the embroidery business, but in May 2020 when David Lelong obtained control of the Company as described elsewhere in this Report, the Company terminated its plans in the embroidery business and wrote off its assets. Since the change of control, we have been seeking new business opportunities in the United States and abroad. Among other things, we may acquire an ongoing business in a reverse merger. 

The evaluation and selection of a business opportunity is a complex and uncertain process. While as discussed further below we have identified and executed a Share Exchange Agreement with what management believes is a viable operating business to acquire, there can be no assurance that we will be able to close the transaction. Moreover, due to changes in the Rules of OTC Markets, which operates the Pink Open Market where our common stock trades, we must complete a merger with or acquisition of an operating company by March 28, 2023 or our common stock will effectively cease trading. See Item 1A - Risk Factors.

Potential Acquisition of aX 

In the furtherance of our search for an acquisition target, on January 30, 2023 we entered into a Share Exchange Agreement (the Exchange Agreement with Socialcom, Inc, d/b/a AudienceX, a California corporation aX and the shareholders of aX signatory thereto who collectively own 19,363,959 shares of aX common stock, or approximately 96.6 of the outstanding shares of aX common stock. On February 17, 2023, we amended and restated the Exchange Agreement. The Exchange Agreement as amended and restated provides that, upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth therein, the Company will issue the aX shareholders signatory thereto a total of 169,434,641 shares of the Company s common stock, representing approximately 96 of the shares of the Company s common stock to be outstanding after giving effect to such issuance, in exchange for all of the shares of aX common stock held by such aX shareholders (the Exchange ). The closing of the Exchange (the Closing is conditioned upon aX shareholders collectively owning at least 19,363,959 shares of aX common stock executing the Exchange Agreement. 

Under the Exchange Agreement, in connection with and subject to the Exchange, the Company agreed, among other things, to the following covenants and closing conditions: (i) enter into an agreement with David Lelong, the sole officer and director and majority shareholder of the Company, for the cancellation of 93 million shares of common stock held by him at the Closing, (ii) issue 22,793,540 options to purchase common stock of the Company to aX directors, officers, employees and consultants under a newly adopted equity incentive plan of the Company in exchange for the cancellation of 2,604,976 outstanding aX stock options held by such persons, and (iii) execute a binding agreement for a financing resulting in gross proceeds to the Company of 1,500,000. In the furtherance of the foregoing, Mr. Lelong, in his capacity as the sole member of the Board of Directors and majority shareholder of the Company, approved and adopted the 2023 Equity Incentive Plan of the Company, under which the Company is authorized to grant and issue up to 30 million shares of common stock and common stock equivalents to the Company s directors, officers, employees and consultants for services rendered or to be rendered by such persons. 

In addition, on January 30, 2023 in connection with the Exchange Agreement, the Company entered into a Stock Purchase Agreement (the SPA and an Investor Rights Agreement IRA with an accredited investor (the Investor ), which is also an aX shareholder, and amended and restated those agreements on February 17, 2023, pursuant to which the Company agreed to sell the Investor up to 50,000 shares of the Company s Series A Convertible Preferred Stock (the Series A ), which subject to beneficial ownership limitations is convertible into up to 1,000,000 shares of the Company s common stock, at a purchase price of 30 per share of Series A in two equal tranches, with the first tranche closing simultaneously with the Closing of the Exchange and the second tranche closing on the 90th day after the Closing. Under the IRA the Company agreed to register for resale by the Investor the shares of the Company s common stock issued or issuable to the Investor under the Series A and the Exchange Agreement on a registration statement to be filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the SEC ). Under the IRA, at any time after 180 days following the Closing, the Investor may request the Company to prepare a registration statement on Form S-1 (or Form S-3, if available to the Company at such time) and the Company will be obligated to file such registration statement with the SEC within 120 days after such request, and to use its commercially reasonable efforts to cause the registration statement to be declared effective by the SEC as soon as practicable thereafter, subject to certain exceptions and limitations. 

Subject to the terms of the Exchange Agreement, the Closing of the Exchange is scheduled to take place on or before February 24, 2023, subject to the satisfaction or waiver of the conditions to Closing set forth in the Exchange Agreement. If the conditions to Closing have not been satisfied by that deadline, the Company and aX may extend the Closing to a later date by mutual agreement. Effective at the Closing, the number of directors of the Company will be fixed at three, and Jason Wulfsohn and Reeve Benaron will be appointed to serve on the Board of Directors. Upon or immediately prior to the Closing, David Lelong shall have tendered his resignation as the sole officer of the Company, and the Company s Board of Directors will appoint Jason Wulfsohn and Ryan Carhart as the Company s Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, respectively, effective upon the Closing. Immediately following the Closing, the aX shareholders who executed the Exchange Agreement as of that time will collectively own approximately 96 of the issued and outstanding shares of the Company s common stock, and aX will continue as a subsidiary of the Company. aX is a digital marketing and services company, as more particularly described in the summary that follows. 

Summary of the aX Business 

Overview 

Advertising technology company aX was incorporated in the State of California on March 8, 2013, for the purpose of delivering end-to-end performance solutions to independent agencies and brands. 

2

Table of Contents 

The aX platform, both self-service and managed service, is built to drive integrated omni channel performance, including advertising technology, data-driven campaign optimization, analytics and insights and creative services. Since its inception the strategic focus of aX has been oriented toward middle-market businesses, a significant and generally underserved segment of the larger U.S. economy, especially with respect to their need for powerful enterprise advertising technology solutions to drive improved business outcomes and level the playing field against often larger, better-funded competitors. 

aX operates aX, an omnichannel trading desk platform, providing unified buy-side access to the full-breadth of available performance channels and relating technologies, including 24 platforms across programmatic, display, Connected Television (CTV), digital out-of-home (DOOH), and audio, along with search and social. Taken together tdX represents a holistic performance solution, unified by aX s robust data infrastructure, delivering powerful real-time campaign learnings and cross-channel performance insights, along with sophisticated analytics designed to deliver scalable and sustainable campaign outcomes. 

The aX business model and strategic plan envisions embracing future-first solutions, recognizing ongoing changes and opportunities in the ad tech landscape, from data deployment and usage, to emerging technologies across creative, analytics, and optimization, to new performance platforms. 

aX Risk Factors 

aX and its operations and prospects are subject to a variety of risks and uncertainties, and investors do not have access to information about aX as would be sufficient to enable investors to make an informed decision on investing in aX. The risks related to aX are anticipated to include, among other things, risks and uncertainties related its business, operating results, financial condition, and role within and challenges posed by its participation in the digital marketing industry, including the competitive, regulatory and technological landscapes characterized by that industry. These risks could be material and adverse to aX, such that if we acquire aX as contemplated by the Exchange Agreement, substantial and unquantifiable risks and liabilities could arise, as well as other matters that are or may be deemed to be material under the federal and state securities laws. Investors should be aware that the lack of this information could materially adversely affect an investment in us. If the Exchange closes, the Company intends to file a registration statement on Form 10 (the Form 10 disclosing the aforementioned information as to aX as well as such other information as is required by such Form 10. Investors are urged to not invest in the Company s common stock or common stock equivalents on the basis of our potential acquisition of aX before such acquisition closes and the Form 10 is filed as necessary to provide investors the opportunity to review more robust information and disclosure about aX, and the risks and uncertainties inherent in an investment in the combined Company following the Exchange. 

ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS 

Risks Related to Our Acquisition Efforts 

If we are unable to close the acquisition of aX under the Exchange Agreement described elsewhere in this Report, the Company and its shareholders will not receive the anticipated and intended benefits of such acquisition, and the Company will lose eligibility for quotation on the OTC Pink Market due its shell status. 

As disclosed elsewhere in this Report, we recently executed the Exchange Agreement with aX, a digital marketing company, and a majority of the aX shareholders which contemplates us acquiring aX to operate as our subsidiary in exchange for the issuance of at least 96 of our common stock outstanding post-transaction. While the closing of the acquisition would result in us becoming the parent holding company of an operating company, the closing may not occur, including due to closing conditions and/or other developments that are beyond our control. The closing conditions and other requirements under the Exchange Agreement that are necessary for the Exchange to occur include a requirement that we execute a binding agreement for a financing resulting in gross proceeds to the Company of 1,500,000. 

If we do not close the Exchange and/or file the Form 10 by the March 28, 2023, it will result in our common stock ceasing to be quoted on the OTC Pink Market, which will result in us becoming a private shell company, eliminate two-way trading in our common stock and reduce shareholders ability to liquidate their investment. While it is unclear exactly how long it would take to resume two-way quotations, it could take as long as six months and would be subject in any event to approval from the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority. Such an event will in turn hinder our prospects of acquiring an operating entity, because a primary benefit for target prospects to engage in a reverse merger or similar transaction with us is to become an OTC Pink Market traded company that files reports with the SEC. Therefore, a failure to close by the deadline will materially adversely impact us, and therefore our shareholders investment in us.

Table of Contents 

We will need significant additional capital, which may not be available to us on acceptable terms, or at all. 

We will require additional capital to achieve our operational and acquisition goals during the next 12 months and for general corporate purposes. We may issue common stock or securities convertible or exercisable into common stock, which would have a dilutive effect on our existing shareholders. In addition to having a dilutive effect, the issuance of additional shares by us, or the possibility of such issuance, may cause the market price of our shares to decline. In addition, any debt or preferred stock financing secured by us in the future could involve restrictive covenants relating to our capital-raising activities and other financial and operational matters, which may make it more difficult for us to obtain additional capital and to pursue business opportunities. If we are unable to raise additional capital sufficient to meet our current growth goals, we may have to abandon our plans in certain regions or with respect to certain target companies, partnerships or contracts. There can be no assurance that such funding will be available to the Company in the amount required at any time or, if available, that it can be obtained on terms satisfactory to the Company. 

We may expend significant time and capital on a prospective business combination that is not ultimately consummated. 

If the Exchange does not close, all of the time and capital resources expended by the Company in such a pursuit may be lost and unrecoverable by the Company or its shareholders. Unanticipated issues which may be beyond our control or that of the seller of the applicable business may arise that force us to suspend our pursuit of the target, such as the target s failure or inability to provide adequate documentation to assist in our investigation, a party s failure to obtain required waivers or consents to consummate the transaction as required by the inability to obtain the required audits, applicable laws, charter documents and agreements, the appearance of a competitive bid from another prospective purchaser, or the seller s inability to maintain its operations for a sufficient time to allow the transaction to close. Such risks are inherent in any search for a new business and investors should be aware of them before investing in an enterprise such as ours. 

Past performance by our management and their affiliates may not be indicative of future performance of an investment in us. 

While our Chief Executive Officer has prior experience as an executive and in advising businesses, his past performance, the performance of other entities or persons with which he is involved, or the performance of any other personnel we may retain in the future will not necessarily be an indication of either (i) that we will be able to locate a suitable candidate for our initial business combination or (ii) the future operating results of the Company including with respect to any business combination we may consummate. You should not rely on the historical record of him or any other of our personnel or their affiliates performance as indicative of our future performance or that an investment in us will be profitable. In addition, an investment in the Company is not an investment in any entities affiliated with our management or other personnel. While management has endeavored to locate a viable business opportunity and generate shareholder value, there can be no assurance that we will succeed in completing this endeavor. 

Changes in laws or regulations, or a failure to comply with the laws and regulations applicable to us, may adversely affect our business, ability to negotiate and complete a business combination, and results of operations. 

We are subject to laws and regulations enacted by federal, state and local governments. In addition to SEC regulations, any business we acquire in the future, including aX, may be subject to substantial legal or regulatory oversight and restrictions, which could hinder our growth and expend material amounts on compliance. Compliance with, and monitoring of, applicable laws and regulations may be difficult, time consuming and costly. Those laws and regulations and their interpretation and application by courts and administrative judges may also change from time to time, and any such changes could be unfavorable to us and could have a material adverse effect on our business, investments and results of operations. In addition, a failure to comply with applicable laws or regulations, as interpreted and applied, could result in material defense or remedial costs and/or damages have a material adverse effect on our financial condition. 

Risks Relating to Our Business and Financial Condition 

Our independent auditors have expressed doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern. 

The independent registered public accounting firm auditors report accompanying our November 30, 2022 financial statements contained an explanatory paragraph expressing substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern. We had an accumulated deficit of 360,168 as of November 30, 2022. This factor creates an uncertainty as to our ability to continue as a going concern. Our ability to continue as a going concern would be subject to our ability to acquire a business and generate revenue therefrom and/or obtain necessary funding from outside sources. Since our independent auditors have expressed doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern, such doubts could have a negative impact on our ability to obtain needed financing, and, as a result, your investment in us could become worthless.

Table of Contents 

We currently have no operations, and investors therefore have no basis on which to evaluate the Company s future prospects. 

We currently have no operations and will be reliant upon a merger with or acquisition of an operating business to commence operations and generate revenue. Because we have no operations and have not generated revenues since prior to the change of control in May 2020, investors have no basis upon which to evaluate our ability to achieve our business objective of completing a business combination with a target business. While we have entered into a Exchange Agreement to acquire aX, if we fail to complete the Exchange, you could lose your entire investment. 

If we cannot manage our growth effectively, we may not become profitable. 

Businesses, including development stage companies such as ours and/or any operating business or businesses we may acquire, often grow rapidly and tend to have difficulty managing their growth. If we are able to acquire an operating business, we will likely need to expand our management team and other key personnel by recruiting and employing experienced executives and key employees and/or consultants capable of providing the necessary support. 

We cannot assure you that our management will be able to manage our growth effectively or successfully. Our failure to meet these challenges could cause us to lose money, and your investment could be lost. 

Risks Related to Our Common Stock 

Because our common stock rarely trades, investors should not rely upon the prices at which our Common Stock may be or have been sold. 

Our common stock trades sporadically on the OTC Pink Market. Accordingly, the market price of our common stock at any given time may not be representative of its intrinsic value, and investors should not rely upon the public prices in deciding whether to buy our shares. The lack of liquidity may also result in an investor seeking to purchase our common stock in paying more than the reported price. 

Due to factors beyond our control, our stock price may be volatile. 

There is currently a limited market for our common stock, and there can be no guarantee that an active market for our common stock will develop, even if we are successful in consummating a business combination. Further, even if an active market for our common stock develops, it will likely be subject to significant price volatility when compared to more seasoned issuers. We expect that the price of our common stock will continue to be more volatile than more seasoned issuers for the foreseeable future. Fluctuations in the price of our common stock can be based on various factors in addition to those otherwise described in this Report, including: 

A prospective business combination and the terms and conditions thereof; 

Any delay or failure to close such and acquisition which among other things could result in our loss of OTC Pink quotation and eliminate investors ability to trade our shares; 

The operating performance of any business we acquire, including any failure to achieve material revenues therefrom; 

The performance of our competitors in the marketplace following the closing of a business combination; 

The public s reaction to our press releases, SEC filings, website content and other public announcements and information; 

Changes in earnings estimates of any business that we acquire or recommendations by any research analysts who may follow us or other companies in the industry of a business that we acquire; 

Variations in general economic conditions, including as may be caused by uncontrollable events such as inflation and any resulting decline in the economy; 

The public disclosure of the terms of any financing we disclose in the future; 

The number of shares of our common stock that are publicly traded in the future; 

5

Table of Contents 

Actions of our existing shareholders, including sales of common stock by our then directors and then executive officers or by significant investors; and 

The employment or termination of key personnel. 

Many of these factors are beyond our control and may decrease the market price of our common stock, regardless of whether we can consummate a business combination and of our current or subsequent operating performance and financial condition. In the past, following periods of volatility in the market price of a company s securities, securities class action litigation has often been instituted. A securities class action suit against us could result in substantial costs and divert our management s time and attention, which would otherwise be used to benefit our business. 

Because this Report describes very little or nothing about aX, it s business, management, stock ownership, related party transactions and financial condition, investors should not buy our common stock until either we acquire aX and file a Form 10 with the SEC or we publicly announce that the acquisition did not close. 

Because trading in our common stock is so limited, investors who purchase our common stock may depress the market if they sell common stock. 

Our common stock trades on the OTC Pink Market, the successor to the pink sheets. The OTC Pink Market generally is illiquid and most stocks traded there are of companies that are not required to file reports with the SEC under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the Exchange Act ). While we voluntarily file Forms 10-Q and 10-K with the SEC, we are a voluntary filer and not required to file reports with the SEC. Our common stock itself infrequently trades. Accordingly, any sales may depress the trading price. 

The market price of our common stock may decline if a substantial number of shares of our common stock are sold at once or in large blocks. 

Presently the market for our common stock is limited. If an active market for our shares develops in the future, some or all of our shareholders may sell their shares of our common stock which may depress the market price. Further, Rule 144 will not be available since we are a shell company, unless an exemption from the definition applies. Any sale of a substantial number of these shares in the public market, or the perception that such a sale could occur, could cause the market price of our common stock to decline, which could reduce the value of the shares held by our other shareholders. 

Future issuance of our common stock could dilute the interests of our existing shareholders, particularly in connection with an acquisition and any resulting financing. 

We may issue additional shares of our common stock in the future. The issuance of a substantial amount of our common stock could substantially dilute the interests of our shareholders. In addition, the sale of a substantial amount of common stock in the public market, either in the initial issuance or in a subsequent resale by the target company in a business combination which received our common stock as consideration or by investors who has previously acquired such common stock could have an adverse effect on the market price of our common stock. 

Because we may issue preferred stock without the approval of our shareholders and have other anti-takeover defenses, and the vast majority of our commons stock outstanding is held by our Chief Executive Officer and sole director, it may be more difficult for a third-party to acquire us and could depress our stock price . 

Our Board may issue, without a vote of our shareholders, one or more series of preferred stock that have voting rights, liquidation preferences, dividend rights and other rights that are superior to those of our common stock. Any issuance of preferred stock could adversely affect the rights of holders of our common stock in that such preferred stock could have priority over the common stock with respect to voting, dividend or liquidation rights. For example, the Series A as amended, of which we have agreed to issue 50,000 shares to the Investor under the SPA in addition to the 170,000 shares of Series A already outstanding, provide the holders with a liquidation preference in the event of the merger or consolidation of the Company in which the Company is not the surviving entity, the sale of all of the assets of the Company in a transaction which requires shareholder approval or the dissolution or winding up of the Company. Further, because we can issue preferred stock having voting rights per share that are greater than the equivalent of one share of our common stock, our Board could issue preferred stock to investors who support us and our management and give effective control of our business to our management. Even absent such an issuance of preferred stock, the vast majority of our common stock outstanding is held by David Lelong, who controls the Company as its Chief Executive Officer and director. Additionally, issuance of preferred stock could block an acquisition resulting in both a drop in our stock price and a decline in interest of our common stock. This could make it more difficult for shareholders to sell their common stock and/or cause the market price of our common stock shares to drop significantly, even if our business is performing well.

You may experience dilution upon the conversion of the Series A. 

We had 170,000 shares of Series A, outstanding at November 30, 2022. Further, as disclosed above, we anticipate issuing additional shares of Series A in the secondary financing contemplating as a closing condition to the Exchange. Each share of the Series A is convertible into 20 shares of our common stock or a total of 4,400,000 shares assuming we close the Exchange and the new 1,500,000 investment is fully funded. In the event that the holders of the Series A convert their shares into our common stock, the existing holders of our common stock will be diluted. However, because we are a shell issuer not subject to filing reports with the SEC, the holders of the Series A as well as our current principal shareholder and new aX shareholders cannot use the Rule 144 safe harbor to sell their common stock and must wait 12 months to able to begin to use Rule 144.

Table of Contents 

ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULT OF OPERATIONS 

The Company has no operations or revenue as of the date of this Report. We are a shell company and seeking to acquire another business. Management is exploring and seeking to identify viable business opportunities within the U.S. including seeking to acquire a business in a reverse merger. Our Chief Executive Officer has a history of successfully achieving that goal, although no assurances can be given that he can achieve this. 

In the furtherance of our acquisition efforts, on January 30, 2023, we entered into the Exchange Agreement, which we subsequently amended and restated on February 17, 2023, with aX and certain aX shareholders to acquire approximately 96.6 of the outstanding common stock of aX in exchange for shares common stock collectively representing approximately 96 of our common stock. The closing is subject to certain closing conditions, and no assurance can be given that the transaction will close. See above under Potential Acquisition of aX for more information about the Exchange Agreement and aX s business. 

Plan of Operation 

The Company has no operations from a continuing business in 2022 other than the expenditures related to running the Company, and has no revenue from continuing operations as of the date of this Report. We are currently in the process of working with aX in an effort to close the Exchange in order to maintain OTC Pink Market quotation for our common stock and continue as an operating business. As more fully described above, aX is a digital advertising company with a focus on operating tdX, a digital ad trading and analytics platform that enables uses to determine and execute marketing campaigns designed to access their target audience using channels that are customized to result in an optimal marketing campaign. aX also offers adjacent services in this regard, including creative ad preparation and data analytics, with personnel and software for such purposes. 

Results of Operations For the Fiscal Year ended November 30, 2022 compared with the Fiscal Year ended November 30, 2021 

The following overview of our results of operations should be read in light of the fact that we have no operations pending management s determination of the future direction of the Company, be it by reverse merger or similar business combination or otherwise. The only operations that existed in 2022 related to continuing operations relates to the business of running the Company and include mostly professional fees related to the Company s Exchange Act filings as well as general business expenditures related to finding an acquisition candidate. 

Revenue, Cost of Revenue and Gross Profit 

We had no revenue for the fiscal years ended November 30, 2022 or 2021. We expect this trend to persist until we can acquire an operating business. Management has not determined how the Company will proceed in the event it is unable to close the acquisition of aX by the March 28, 2023 OTC Markets deadline. 

Operating Expenses 

The Company incurred operating expenses of 73,581 and 135,556 during the fiscal years ended November 30, 2022 and 2021, respectively. The operating expenses in 2022 were mainly due to the professional fees related to the Company s Exchange Act filings and general operating expenditures of running the Company. 

Other Income and Expenses 

The Company recorded interest expense in the amount of 0 and 1,125 during the years ended November 30, 2022 and 2021, respectively. The 2021 interest expenses were incurred in connection with the 2020 and 2021 Accelerated Online Agreements described in Note 5 to the financial statements contained in this report. The 2020 Accelerated Online Agreement was terminated effective January 4, 2021, and the 2021 Accelerated Online Agreement was terminated effective June 1, 2021. During the year ended November 30, 2022, consulting fees due to Accelerated Online in the amount of 37,500 and accrued interest of 1,125 were forgiven, resulting in a gain on forgiveness of debt in the amount of 38,625, compare to 0 in the prior year.

Net Loss 

During the fiscal years ended November 30, 2022 and 2021, the Company recorded a net loss of 34,956 and 136,681, respectively. The decrease was due to the gain on forgiveness of debt in the amount of 38,625 during the year ended November 30, 2022. 

Preferred Stock Dividend 

The Company recorded non-cash dividends on its Series A in the amounts of 100,000 during the fiscal year ended November 30, 2021, in connection with a beneficial conversion feature. There was no dividend recorded during the current period because the Company changed its accounting policy for beneficial conversion features with the adoption of ASU 2020-06 effective December 1, 2021. 

Liquidity and Capital Resources 

Cash Flows used by Operating Activities: 

For the fiscal year ended November 30, 2022, net cash flows used in operating activities was 65,133. Net cash flows used in operating activities was 108,553 for the year ended November 30, 2021. As of November 30, 2022, we had 48,154 in cash as compared to 73,287 in cash as of November 30, 2021. 

For the fiscal year ended November 30, 2022, net cash flows from financing activities were 40,000, before deducting legal fees and related offering expenses, consisting of proceeds from the sale of 20,000 shares of Series A on November 2, 2022. For the fiscal year ended November 30, 2021, net cash flows from financing activities was 100,000, before deducting legal fees and related offering expenses, consisting of proceeds from the sale of 50,000 shares of Series A on September 28, 2021. 

Each share of the Series A is convertible into 20 shares of the Company s common stock, par value 0.001 per share. 

For the year ended November 30, 2021, the beneficial conversion feature associated with the Series A was considered a dividend to the Series A shareholders. The Company utilized the intrinsic value method to determine the fair value of the beneficial conversion feature associated with this transaction. The value of the beneficial conversion features was capped at the amount of proceeds received, or 100,000; the Company recorded a dividend on the Series A in the amount of 100,000 during the year ended November 30, 2021. There was no dividend recorded during the current period because the Company changed its accounting for beneficial conversion features with the adoption of ASU 2020-06 effective December 1, 2021. 

Once we have developed and begun to implement our business plan, management intends to fund our working capital requirements through a combination of our existing funds and future issuances of debt or equity securities. Our working capital requirements are expected to increase in line with the implementation of a business plan and commencement of operations. 

Based upon our current operations, we do not have sufficient working capital to fund our operations over the next 12 months. A closing condition under the Exchange Agreement is that we enter into the Series A SPA to receive 750,000 at closing and the balance 90 days later. Such capital will be deployed to fund the operations and business objectives of aX on a post-transaction basis, as the aX management, who following the closing will become the Company s management, may determine. 

Following the Exchange, we expect we will need to raise additional capital in the future. Additional issuances of equity or convertible debt securities will result in dilution to our current shareholders. Further, such securities might have rights, preferences or privileges senior to our common stock. Additional financing may not be available upon acceptable terms, or at all. If adequate funds are not available or are not available on acceptable terms, we may not be able to take advantage of prospective new business endeavors or opportunities, which could significantly and materially restrict our business operations. 

Unless the aX Exchange or another acquisition transaction closes, we anticipate that we will incur operating losses in the next 12 months. Our prospects must be considered in light of the risks, expenses and difficulties frequently encountered by companies in their early stage of development. Such risks for us include, but are not limited to, an evolving and unpredictable business model, recognition of revenue sources, and the management of growth. To address these risks, we must, among other things, develop, implement and successfully execute our business and marketing strategy, respond to competitive developments, and attract, retain and motivate qualified personnel. There can be no assurance that we will be successful in addressing such risks, and the failure to do so could have a material adverse effect on our business prospects, financial condition and results of operations.

Off Balance Sheet Arrangements 

As of the date of this Report, we do not have any off-balance sheet arrangements that have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on our financial condition, changes in financial condition, revenues or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources that are material to investors. 

Going Concern 

The independent registered public accounting firm auditors report accompanying our November 30, 2022 financial statements contained an explanatory paragraph expressing substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern. The financial statements have been prepared assuming that we will continue as a going concern, which contemplates that we will realize our assets and satisfy our liabilities and commitments in the ordinary course of business. See Risk Factors- Our independent auditors have expressed doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern for more information.

Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm 

The Stockholders and the Board of Directors of 

Vado Corp. 

Opinion on the Financial Statements 

We have audited the accompanying balance sheets of Vado Corp. (collectively, the Company as of November 30, 2022 and 2021, and the related statements of operations, changes in stockholders deficit and statements of cash flows for the years ended November 30, 2022 and 2021, and the related notes (collectively referred to as the financial statements ). In our opinion, the financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company at November 30, 2022, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for the ended November 30, 2022, in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. 

The Company's Ability to Continue as a Going Concern 

The accompanying financial statements have been prepared assuming that the Company will continue as a going concern. As discussed in Note 2 to the financial statements, the Company has suffered recurring losses from operations and will require additional capital to fund its current operating plan. This raises substantial doubt about the Company s ability to continue as a going concern. Management s plans regarding these matters are also described in Note 2. The financial statements do not include any adjustments to reflect the possible future effects on the recoverability and classification of assets or the amounts and classification of liabilities that may result from the outcome of this uncertainty. 

Basis for Opinion 

These financial statements are the responsibility of the Company's management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company s financial statements based on our audit. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB) and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. 

We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. The Company is not required to have, nor were we engaged to perform, an audit of its internal control over financial reporting. As part of our audit we are required to obtain an understanding of internal control over financial reporting but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Company's internal control over financial reporting. Accordingly, we express no such opinion. 

Our audit included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audit also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe that our audit provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.

ITEM 9. CHANGES IN AND DISAGREEMENTS WITH ACCOUNTANTS ON ACCOUNTING AND FINANCIAL DISCLOSURE 

Not applicable. 

ITEM 9A. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES 

Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures. 

Our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining a system of disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act) that is designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by us in the reports that we file or submit under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported, within the time periods specified in the SEC s rules and forms. Disclosure controls and procedures include, without limitation, controls and procedures designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by an issuer in the reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to the issuer s management, including its principal executive officer or officers and principal financial officer or officers, or persons performing similar functions, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. 

Management s Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting . 

Our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Exchange Act. Our internal control over financial reporting is designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. Our internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that: 

pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of our assets; 

provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that our receipts and expenditures are being made only in accordance with authorizations of our management and directors; and 

provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of our assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements. 

Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with policies or procedures may deteriorate. 

Our management assessed the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting based on the parameters set forth above and has concluded that as of November 30, 2022, our internal control over financial reporting was not effective to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles as a result of the following material weaknesses: 

The Company does not have sufficient segregation of duties within accounting functions due to only having one consultant and its limited nature and resources. 

The Company does not have an independent board of directors or audit committee. 

The Company does not have written documentation of our internal control policies and procedures. 

All of the Company s financial reporting is carried out by a financial consultant. 

We plan to rectify these weaknesses by implementing an independent board of directors, establishing written policies and procedures for our internal control of financial reporting, and hiring additional accounting personnel at such time as we complete a reverse merger or similar business acquisition. 

13

Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting. 

There have been no change in our internal control over financial reporting during the year November 30, 2022 that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting. 

ITEM 9B. OTHER INFORMATION. 

On February 21, 2023, the Company filed a Certificate of Amendment to the Certificate of Designations of the Series A with the Secretary of State of the State of Nevada, which amended the Series A by: (i) providing the holders with senior ranking with respect to the Company s capital stock upon the occurrence of a liquidation, dissolution or winding up, (ii) providing the holders with a liquidation preference in the event of the merger or consolidation of the Company in which the Company is not the surviving entity, the sale of all of the assets of the Company in a transaction which requires shareholder approval or the dissolution or winding up of the Company, and (iii) clarifying the adjustment provisions of the conversion ratio of the Series A upon the occurrence of certain corporate events.

Applicable percentages are based on 99,985,500 shares of common stock outstanding as of February 21, 2023.

Under SEC rules, a person is considered a beneficial owner of a security if that person has or shares power to vote or direct the voting of such security or the power to dispose of such security.
