Item 1117 of Regulation AB. Legal Proceedings. 

Volkswagen Aktiengesellschaft Volkswagen AG and affiliates
of Volkswagen AG (collectively, Volkswagen Group Companies ), including VW Credit, Inc. VW Credit ), have
been the subject of intense scrutiny, ongoing investigations (civil and criminal) and civil litigation relating to TDI diesel engines.
Volkswagen AG and other Volkswagen Group Companies have received subpoenas and inquiries from state attorneys general and other governmental
and regulatory authorities and are responding to such investigations and inquiries, including in areas relating to securities, financing
and tax. 

One such legal action to which VW Credit was subject, or to which certain
other Volkswagen Group Companies are still subject, is a civil action brought by the SEC pursuant to a complaint filed in the U.S. District
Court for the Northern District of California on March 14, 2019. The complaint alleged that VW Credit, its indirect 100 parent,
Volkswagen AG, an affiliate, Volkswagen Group of America Finance, LLC, and the former Chief Executive Officer of Volkswagen AG, Martin
Winterkorn, violated certain provisions of the U.S. federal securities laws by selling certain bonds and asset-based securities without
disclosure concerning the existence of defeat devices, as defined under U.S. law, in certain diesel vehicles, and related exposures. 

On August 20, 2020, the U.S. District Court for the Northern District
of California granted in part the Volkswagen defendants motion to dismiss the complaint, dismissing all claims against VW Credit
related to its issuance of automotive asset-backed securities ABS ). With respect to VW Credit, the court held that the
SEC s claims had already been released by virtue of Volkswagen AG, Volkswagen Group of America Finance, LLC and VW Credit s
settlement with the U.S. Department of Justice for claims made under the Financial Institutions Reform, Recovery and Enforcement Act,
12 U.S.C. 1833a, related to VW Credit and the ABS. 

On September 4, 2020, the SEC filed an amended complaint and removed
its claims against VW Credit. On December 7, 2020, the Volkswagen Group Companies entities named in the amended complaint filed an
answer to the operative complaint denying liability for the claims asserted by the SEC and raising affirmative defenses. To date, the
SEC has not sought to pursue a direct appeal as to the claims against VW Credit; however, the SEC may attempt to appeal after the resolution
of all remaining claims in the amended complaint. The other Volkswagen Group Companies named in the amended complaint intend to continue
to contest the claims asserted in the SEC s amended complaint and the relief sought by the SEC. 

Indenture Trustee Litigation 

Deutsche Bank Trust Company Americas, as the Indenture Trustee, has
provided the following information for inclusion in this report on Form 10-K: 

Deutsche Bank Trust Company Americas DBTCA and Deutsche
Bank National Trust Company DBNTC have been sued by investors in civil litigation concerning their role as trustees of
certain residential mortgage-backed securities RMBS trusts. 

On June 18, 2014, a group of investors, including funds managed
by Blackrock Advisors, LLC, PIMCO-Advisors, L.P., and others, filed an action against DBNTC and DBTCA in New York State Supreme Court
alleging that DBNTC and DBTCA failed to perform purported duties, as trustees for 544 private-label RMBS trusts, to enforce breaches of
representations and warranties as to mortgage loans held by the trusts and to enforce breaches by servicers of their mortgage loan servicing
obligations for the trusts. During the course of the litigation, plaintiffs dismissed the case from New York State Supreme Court and refiled
two separate cases, one in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York (the BlackRock SDNY Case and the
other in the Superior Court of California, Orange County (the BlackRock California Case ). Pursuant to a settlement among
the parties, the BlackRock SDNY Case was dismissed on December 6, 2018, and the BlackRock California Case was dismissed on January 11,
2019. 

On September 27, 2017, DBTCA was added as a defendant to a case
brought by certain special purpose entities including Phoenix Light SF Limited in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of
New York, in which the plaintiffs previously alleged incorrectly that DBNTC served as trustee for all 43 of the trusts at issue. On September 27,
2017, plaintiffs filed a third amended complaint that names DBTCA as a defendant in addition to DBNTC. DBTCA serves as trustee for one
of the 43 trusts at issue. DBNTC serves as trustee for the other 42 trusts at issue. Plaintiffs third amended complaint brings
claims for violation of the U.S. Trust Indenture Act of 1939 TIA ); breach of contract; breach of fiduciary duty; negligence
and gross negligence; violation of New York s Streit Act; and breach of the covenant of good faith. However, in the third amended
complaint, plaintiffs acknowledge that, before DBTCA was added to the case, the court dismissed plaintiffs TIA Act claims, negligence
and gross negligence claims, Streit Act claims, claims for breach of the covenant of good faith, and certain theories of plaintiffs 
breach of contract claims, and plaintiffs only include these claims to preserve any rights on appeal. Plaintiffs allege damages of hundreds
of millions of dollars. On November 13, 2017, DBNTC and DBTCA filed an answer to the third amended complaint. On December 7,
2018, DBNTC and DBTCA filed a motion for summary judgment. Also on December 7, 2018, plaintiffs, jointly with Commerzbank AG (see
description of Commerzbank case below), filed a motion for partial summary judgment. On October 27, 2021, DBNTC and DBTCA filed a
supplemental motion for summary judgment relating to plaintiffs standing. On February 8, 2022, the court issued an order in
which it granted DBNTC and DBTCA s supplemental motion for summary judgment, granted in part DBNTC and DBTCA s initial motion
for summary judgment, and denied plaintiffs motion for partial summary judgment. As a result of that order, all of plaintiffs 
claims were dismissed with prejudice. On March 10, 2022, plaintiffs filed a notice of appeal to the United States Court of Appeals
for the Second Circuit with respect to the court s orders on the motions to dismiss and for summary judgment. 

On November 30, 2017, DBTCA was added as a defendant to a case
brought by Commerzbank AG Commerzbank in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York, in which Commerzbank
previously alleged incorrectly that DBNTC served as trustee for all 50 of the trusts at issue. On November 30, 2017, Commerzbank
filed a second amended complaint that names DBTCA as a defendant in addition to DBNTC. DBTCA serves as trustee for 1 of the 50 trusts
at issue. DBNTC serves as trustee for the other 49 trusts at issue. Commerzbank s second amended complaint brings claims for violation
of the TIA; breach of contract; breach of fiduciary duty; negligence; violation of the Streit Act; and breach of the covenant of good
faith. However, in the second amended complaint, Commerzbank acknowledges that, before DBTCA was added to the case, the court dismissed
Commerzbank s TIA claims for the trusts governed by pooling and servicing agreements, as well as its Streit Act claims and claims
for breach of the covenant of good faith, and Commerzbank only includes these claims to preserve any rights on appeal. The second amended
complaint alleges that DBNTC and DBTCA caused Commerzbank to suffer hundreds of millions of dollars in losses, but the complaint
does not include a demand for money damages in a sum certain. On January 29, 2018, DBNTC and DBTCA filed an answer to the second
amended complaint. On December 7, 2018, DBNTC and DBTCA filed a motion for summary judgment. Also on December 7, 2018, Commerzbank,
jointly with the Phoenix Light plaintiffs, filed a motion for partial summary judgment. On February 8, 2022, the court issued an
order in which it granted in part DBNTC and DBTCA s motion for summary judgment and denied plaintiffs motion for partial
summary judgment. As a result of that order, many of plaintiffs claims and theories were dismissed with prejudice. Discovery is
ongoing. 

On December 30, 2015, IKB International, S.A. in Liquidation
and IKB Deutsche Industriebank A.G. (collectively, IKB ), as an investor in 37 RMBS trusts, filed a summons with notice in
the Supreme Court of the State of New York, New York County, against DBNTC and DBTCA as trustees of the trusts. On May 27, 2016, IKB
served its complaint asserting claims for breach of contract, breach of fiduciary duty, breach of duty to avoid conflicts of interest,
violation of the Streit Act, violation of the TIA, violation of Regulation AB, and violation of Section 9 of the Uniform Commercial
Code. IKB alleges that DBNTC and DBTCA are liable for over U.S. 268 million in damages. On October 5, 2016, DBNTC and DBTCA, together
with several other trustees defending lawsuits by IKB, filed a joint motion to dismiss. On January 6, 2017 and June 20, 2017, IKB
voluntarily dismissed with prejudice all claims as to seven trusts. On January 27, 2021, the court granted in part and denied in
part DBNTC and DBTCA s motion to dismiss. The court granted the motion to dismiss with respect to IKB s claims for violations
of the Streit Act, Regulation AB, and Section 9 of the Uniform Commercial Code, as well as certain aspects of IKB s claims
for breach of contract, breach of fiduciary duty, and violation of the TIA. The court denied the remainder of the motion to dismiss. IKB s
remaining claims for breach of contract, breach of fiduciary duty, breach of duty to avoid conflicts of interest, and violation of the
TIA will proceed. On May 10, 2021, DBNTC and DBTCA filed a notice of appeal with the New York Supreme Court Appellate Division, First
Department, regarding certain aspects of the court s order on the motion to dismiss. On May 20, 2021, IKB filed a notice
of cross appeal with respect to other aspects of that order. On August 30, 2022, the New York Supreme Court, Appellate Division,
First Department affirmed in part and reversed in part the court s order on the motion to dismiss. On November 10, 2022, the
First Department granted DBNTC and DBTCA s motion for leave to appeal to the Court of Appeals, and denied IKB s separate motion
for reargument and leave to appeal. On June 2, 2021, IKB filed a motion for re-argument regarding certain aspects of the court s
order on the motion to dismiss, which the court denied on August 3, 2021. On May 13, 2021, DBNTC and DBTCA filed an answer to
the complaint. On October 28, 2021, the parties filed a stipulation, voluntarily dismissing with prejudice all claims as to seven
additional trusts. On December 29, 2021, the parties filed a stipulation, voluntarily dismissing with prejudice all claims as to
one additional trust. On April 22, 2022, the parties filed a stipulation, voluntarily dismissing with prejudice all claims as to
17 certificates at issue, including all claims as to 5 trusts. On February 28, 2023, the parties filed a stipulation, voluntarily
dismissing with prejudice all claims as to two trusts, leaving 15 trusts at issue. Discovery is ongoing. 

It is DBTCA s belief that it has no pending legal proceedings
(including, based on DBTCA s present evaluation, the litigation disclosed in the foregoing paragraphs) that would materially affect
its ability to perform its duties under the related servicing agreement for this transaction. 

Except as described above, no legal proceedings are pending against
any of VW Credit, Inc. (in its capacity as the sponsor (the Sponsor ), in its capacity as an originator contemplated
by Item 1110(b) of Regulation AB (the Originator ), in its capacity as servicer (the Servicer and in
its capacity as administrator of Volkswagen Auto Loan Enhanced Trust 2020-1 (the Issuing Entity )), Volkswagen Auto Lease/Loan

the activities the Company performs related to the mathematically accurate aggregation of information received from servicers and the
accurate conveyance of such information within reports to investors. The Company s management has determined that servicing criterion
1122(d)(4)(iii) is applicable to the activities the Company performs with respect to the Platform only as it relates to the Company s

Exhibit 34.1 

Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting
Firm 

To the Board of Directors of 
VW Credit, Inc. 

We have examined management's assertion, included in the accompanying
Report on Assessment of Compliance with Applicable Servicing Criteria, that VW Credit, Inc. (the Company) complied with the servicing criteria
set forth in Title 17, Section 229.1122(d) of the Securities and Exchange Commission's Regulation AB (the Servicing Criteria)
for the asset-backed securities transactions involving retail automotive loans registered with the Securities Exchange Commission for
which the Company acted as servicer (the Regulation AB Platform), as of December 31, 2022, as well as the period ended December 31,
2022 for Volkswagen Auto Loan Enhanced Trust 2021-1, Volkswagen Auto Loan Enhanced Trust 2020-1, and for the period from June 14,
2022 (the date of issuance) through December 31, 2022 for Volkswagen Auto Lease Trust 2022-A except for the servicing criteria set
forth in Sections 229.1122(d)(1)(iv), 229.1122(d)(2)(vi), 229.1122(d)(3)(ii) with respect to remittances, 229.1122(d)(3)(iii)-(iv),
229.1122(d)(4)(ix)-(xiii) and 229.112(d)(4)(xv), which the Company has determined are not applicable to the activities it performs
with respect to the Regulation AB Platform. With respect to applicable servicing criteria 1122(d)(2)(iii), the Company has determined
that there were no activities performed during the year ended December 31, 2022 with the respect to the Regulation AB Platform, because
there were no occurrences of events that would require the Company to perform such activities. Appendix A to the Report on Assessment
of Compliance with Applicable Servicing Criteria identifies the individual asset-backed transactions and securities defined by management
as constituting the Regulation AB Platform. Management of VW Credit, Inc. is responsible for its assertion and for the Company's
compliance with the Servicing Criteria. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on management s assertion about the Company's
compliance with the Servicing Criteria based on our examination. 

Our examination was conducted in accordance with attestation standards
of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) and in accordance with the attestation standards established by the
American Institute of Certified Public Accountants. Those standards require that we plan and perform the examination to obtain reasonable
assurance about whether management's assertion regarding the Company's compliance with the Servicing Criteria is fairly stated, in all
material respects, and, accordingly, included examining, on a test basis, evidence about the Company's compliance with the applicable
servicing criteria and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. Our examination included
testing of selected asset-backed transactions and securities that comprise the Regulation AB Platform, testing selected servicing
activities related to the Regulation AB Platform, and determining whether the Company processed those selected transactions and performed
those selected activities in compliance with the Servicing Criteria. Our procedures were limited to the selected transactions and servicing
activities performed by the Company during the periods covered by this report. Our procedures were not designed to detect noncompliance
arising from errors that may have occurred either prior to or subsequent to our tests that may have affected the balances or amounts calculated
or reported by the Company during the period covered by this report for the selected transactions or any other transactions. We believe
that our examination provides, and that the evidence we obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide, a reasonable basis for our
opinion. Our examination does not provide a legal determination on the Company's compliance with the Servicing Criteria. 

As described in the accompanying Report on Assessment of Compliance
with Applicable Servicing Criteria, for servicing criteria 1122(d)(2)(i) and 1122(d)(4)(iv), the Company has engaged various vendors
to perform the activities required by theses servicing criteria. The Company has determined that none of these vendors are considered
a servicer as defined in Item 1101(j) of Regulation AB, and the Company has elected to take responsibility for assessing
compliance with the servicing criteria applicable to each vendor as permitted by the SEC s Compliance and Disclosure Interpretation
(C DI) 200.06, Vendors Engaged by Servicers C DI 200.06). As permitted by C DI 200.06, the Company has asserted that
it has policies and procedures in place designed to provide reasonable assurance that the vendors activities comply in all material
respects with the servicing criteria applicable to each vendor. The Company is solely responsible for determining that it meets the SEC
requirements to apply C DI 200-06 for the vendors and related servicing criteria as described in its assertion, and we performed no
procedures with respect to the Company s eligibility to apply C DI 200.06. 

Our examination does not provide a legal determination on the Company s
compliance with the Servicing Criteria. 

In our opinion, management's assertion that VW Credit, Inc. complied
with the aforementioned Servicing Criteria as of December 31, 2022 and for the year ended December 31, 2022 noted above, for asset-backed
securities transactions involving automotive loan transactions completed and registered with the Securities Exchange Commission for
which the Company acted as servicer is fairly stated, in all material respects.

Exhibit 34.2 

Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting
Firm 

Deutsche Bank National Trust Company and Deutsche Bank Trust Company
Americas 

We have examined management s assertion, included in the accompanying
Management s Assertion of Compliance, that Trust Agency Services department of Deutsche Bank National Trust Company
and Deutsche Bank Trust Company Americas (collectively the Company complied with the servicing criteria set forth in Item
1122(d) of the Securities and Exchange Commission s Regulation AB for the publicly-issued (i.e., transaction-level reporting
required under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended) and certain privately-issued (i.e., for which transaction-level reporting
is required pursuant to contractual obligation) residential mortgage-backed securities, commercial mortgage-backed securities and other
asset- backed securities issued on or after January 1, 2006, for which the Company provides trustee, certificate administrator,
securities administration, paying agent or custodian services, as defined in the transaction agreements, excluding publicly-issued securities
sponsored or issued by any government sponsored entity (the Platform ), as of and for the year ended December 31, 2022,
except for criteria 1122(d)(4)(iv) 1122(d)(4)(xiv), which the Company has determined are not applicable to the activities
it performs with respect to the servicing platform covered by this report. Refer to Appendix A of Management s Assertion of Compliance
for the asset backed transactions covered by this platform. Management is responsible for the Company s compliance with those servicing
criteria. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on management s assertion about the Company s compliance with the servicing
criteria based on our examination. 

Our examination was conducted in accordance with attestation standards
established by the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants and the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States)
and, accordingly, included examining, on a test basis, evidence about the Company s compliance with the applicable servicing criteria
and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. Our examination included testing of less than all
of the individual asset backed transactions and securities that comprise the platform, testing of less than all of the servicing activities
related to the Platform and determining whether the Company processed those selected transactions and performed those selected activities
in compliance with the servicing criteria. Furthermore, our procedures were limited to the selected transactions and servicing activities
performed by the Company during the period covered by this report. Our procedures were not designed to determine whether errors may have
occurred either prior to or subsequent to our tests that may have affected the balances or amounts calculated or reported by the Company
during the period covered by this report for the selected transactions or any other transactions. Although the Company is responsible
for assessing compliance with criteria 1122(d)(1)(ii), 1122(d)(1)(iii), 1122(d)(2)(iii) and 1122(d)(4)(iii) of Regulation AB,
there were no occurrences of events that would require the Company to perform such activities during the year ended December 31,
2022. We believe that the evidence we obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a reasonable basis for our opinion. 

We are required to be independent of the Company and to meet our ethical
responsibilities, in accordance with the relevant ethical requirements related to our examination engagement. 

Our examination does not provide a legal determination on the Company s
compliance with the servicing criteria. 

In our opinion, management s assertion that the Company complied
