 Part I Item 1. Business BUSINESS Overview We are an innovative life sciences technology company delivering spatial biology solutions focused on transforming discovery and clinical research. Our mission is to deliver a revolutionary new class of spatially derived biomarkers that empower life sciences researchers to better understand disease and clinicians to improve patient outcomes. Spatial biology refers to a rapidly evolving technology that enables academic and biopharma scientists to detect and map the distribution of cell types and biomarkers across whole tissue samples at single-cell resolution, enabling advancements in their understanding of disease progression and patient response to therapy. Through our PhenoCycler (formerly CODEX and PhenoImager (formerly Phenoptics platforms, reagents, software and services, we offer end-to-end solutions to perform tissue analysis and spatial phenotyping across the full continuum from discovery through translational and clinical research. Our spatial biology solutions measure cells and proteins by providing biomarker data in its spatial context while preserving tissue integrity. Biomarkers are objective measures that capture what is happening in a cell or tissue at a given moment. Current genomic and proteomic methods, such as next-generation sequencing (NGS), single-cell analysis, flow cytometry and mass spectrometry, are providing meaningful data but require the destruction of the tissue sample for analysis. While valuable and broadly adopted, these approaches allow scientists to analyze the biomarkers and cells that comprise the tissue but do not provide the fundamental information about tissue structure, cellular interactions and the localized measurements of key biomarkers. Furthermore, current non-destructive tissue analysis and histological methods provide some limited spatial information, but they only measure a minimal number of biomarkers at a time and require expert pathologist interpretation. Our platforms address these limitations by providing end-to -end solutions that enable researchers to quantitatively interrogate a large number of biomarkers and cell types across a tissue section at single-cell resolution. The result is a detailed and computable map of the tissue sample that thoroughly captures the underlying tissue dynamics and interactions between key cell types and biomarkers, a process now referred to as spatial phenotyping. We believe that we are the only business with the breadth of platform capabilities that enable researchers to do a deep exploratory and discovery study, and then further advance and scale their research through the translational and clinical phases, leading to a better understanding of human biology, disease progression and response to therapy. We offer complete end-to-end solutions for spatial phenotyping, designed to serve the unique needs of our customers in the discovery, translational and clinical markets. The PhenoCycler (formerly CODEX), is an ultra-high parameter and cost-effective platform ideally suited for discovery high-plex research. The PhenoImager platforms (formerly Phenoptics), which includes the newly introduced Fusion instrument and HT instrument (formerly Vectra Polaris), provide high-throughput with the automation and robustness needed for translational and clinical applications. Furthermore, the PhenoCycler and the PhenoImager Fusion can be integrated into a combined system, the PhenoCycler-Fusion System, to enable spatial discovery at scale by providing significant improvements in the speed of the workflow. Together the systems offer seamless and integrated workflow solutions for our customers, including important benefits such as flexible sample types, automated sample processing, scalability, comprehensive data analysis and software solutions and dedicated field and applications support. With these platforms, our customers are performing spatial

 phenotyping to further advance their understanding of diseases such as cancer, neurological and autoimmune disorders, and many other therapeutic areas. Our co-founder and director, Dr. Garry Nolan, originally developed our CODEX technology (now rebranded as PhenoCycler) to better identify biomarkers in discovery research while leading a team at Stanford. We license certain patents, know-how and proprietary technology utilized in our PhenoCycler instrument from Stanford. In order to expand our offerings to the translational and clinical markets, we acquired our Phenoptics (now rebranded as PhenoImager) platform in 2018 from Perkin Elmer, Inc. PKI ), from whom we license certain patents incorporated into our PhenoImager instruments. As of December 31, 2022, we have 934 instruments installed across a broad group of customers throughout North America, Asia-Pacific APAC ), and Europe-Middle East-Africa EMEA ), reflecting an increase of 261 in the number of instrument placements over 2021. Our full set of proprietary reagents, software and services allows us to drive a stream of attractive, recurring and high margin revenue through our installed base, which will grow as we continue to expand our instrument base and implement workflow advancements. We generated total revenue of 74.9 million in the year ended December 31, 2022, and 54.9 million in the year ended December 31, 2021. We incurred net losses of 70.6 million in the year ended December 31, 2022, and 42.9 million in the year ended December 31, 2021.

 Industry and Market Opportunity Genomic analysis techniques have evolved from bulk genomics to single-cell analysis, and proteomic techniques such as mass spectrometry are advancing to provide cutting-edge unbiased approaches. In parallel, there is a growing need in areas such as immuno-oncology for more predictive biomarkers that can accurately predict a patient s response to therapy. Spatial biology has emerged as a potential answer to these needs and represents one of the next major frontiers in life sciences research. It has become a key area of focus for researchers and clinicians alike as spatial phenotyping is able to measure protein and cellular interactions, while maintaining spatial context within a selected tissue sample. The result is a visual and computable measurement of histological patterns and an in-depth understanding of disease pathology, adding a new dimension of insights from discovery through clinical and translational research. By providing single-cell and subcellular resolution with spatial context within a single platform, researchers are able to achieve an understanding of how even small subpopulations of cells can play pivotal roles in disease pathology and patient outcome. In addition, recent innovations within proteomics have enabled unprecedented identification of novel proteins, expanding the need for spatial biology platforms that can functionally characterize these newly discovered proteins. While spatial biology has many applications, spanning from early discovery through clinical research, the leading applications today include: Immuno-oncology: profiling of a tumor and its microenvironment. Immunology: supporting sub-specialties such as autoimmune disorders and transplant medicine. Neuroscience: characterizing neuroinflammation and neurodegeneration. Infectious disease : understanding the underlying biology of infectious diseases and immune response. Developmental biology: understanding tissue differentiation and stem cell biology to inform cell therapy development. Dermatology: immunophenotyping atopic dermatitis, psoriasis and similar dermatological conditions. Other notable applications: immunology research and broader disease pathology. 
 The spatial biology market sits within a larger life sciences technology market. Within this market, spatial biology is currently estimated to be over 14 billion across the discovery, translational and clinical markets with immediate applications in cancer especially immuno-oncology as well as immunology, neurobiology, autoimmune disorders, infectious disease, and more. Each of these specific market segments have unique application and workflow needs and require fit for purpose product offerings. Today, our products and solutions are primarily sold into the cancer discovery and translational markets, representing a 7 billion addressable market. We believe that our offerings can be readily extended to serve adjacent application areas, including immunology and neurobiology, as well as applications in clinical markets, certain of which may require obtaining FDA approval for our products. We currently estimate that within the spatial biology market, half of the opportunity is in the discovery and translational research markets and the other half is in the clinical market. With the growing adoption and innovation of spatial biology solutions and as spatial phenotyping is further validated through rapid acceleration of peer-reviewed publications, we believe the global TAM will continue to grow over the near and long-term horizon. Given the critical need for spatial biology, we believe our products are uniquely suited to address the specific needs of researchers across the continuum from discovery through translational and clinical markets.

 Single-Cell with Spatial Context Single-cell analysis enables the unbiased discovery of known and unknown cell types within a sample; it measures gene and protein expression on a cell-by-cell basis by preserving information about the cell of origin for each analyte measured. Adding spatial context to single-cell analysis provides a wealth of information to visualize tissue organization and disease pathology on a molecular level. Spatial phenotyping using multiplex immunofluorescence mIF allows for efficient mapping of cell-to-cell interactions and expression of key biomarkers across an entire tissue. Therefore, by integrating single-cell (and subcellular) resolution into a spatial context within a single solution, we provide both the what and where that can lead to critical insights that would otherwise be unattainable. Pressing Need for more Predictive Biomarkers in Immuno-Oncology Over the last several years, immuno-oncology has been among the most active therapeutic areas at large pharmaceutical companies with an estimated market size of 60 billion in 2021 and over 5,000 active clinical trials. As a result, there has been a heightened focus and significant investment dedicated to the discovery of predictive biomarkers in immuno-oncology that provide more predictable measures of disease progression and response to therapy in the clinical setting. A recent research study, published in JAMA Oncology in 2019, assessed the probability of current biomarker technologies such as NGS, RNA analysis, standard histology and spatial phenotyping to predict patient response to immuno-therapies and found spatial phenotyping to be the superior method for biomarker analysis. In addition, the technology s ability to monitor the physiological states of tumor cells over time, while maintaining integrity of the tissue, enables researchers to find correlations to drug resistance and tumor mutations, which could meaningfully facilitate the discovery and development of the next generation of cancer diagnostics and therapies. Market needs While NGS and single-cell analysis have led to paramount scientific advances in de-mystifying the genome, and flow cytometry and mass spectrometry have enabled researchers to gain valuable data troves used for improved biomarker analysis, these technologies fail to provide any spatial context to the genes, proteins and cells measured. As a result, there is a clear and unmet need for spatial biology tools in the life sciences research market, from discovery through translational and clinical research. We view the emergence of spatial analysis as largely complementary to current technologies by offering deeper and more contextual insights into the genome, proteome and cellular activity. Discovery researchers are limited by the tools available within their arsenal. In recent years, the research community has fully embraced single-cell solutions as they have delivered unprecedented insights and facilitated novel medical breakthroughs. However, while single-cell technologies continue to evolve and improve, providing greater insights into cellular makeup and biomarker expression, existing technologies require the full destruction of the tissue and sacrifice all spatial information. Thus, while significant value has been realized from single -cell analysis, spatial phenotyping

 promises to be the next-generation biomarker solution aiming to provide an in-depth understanding of biological function and disease pathology through a visual and computable map of histological patterns. Clinical researchers are facing a lack of predictive biomarkers, particularly in immuno-oncology, which limit successful patient outcomes and efficiency in clinical development and deployment of novel therapies. Although targeted therapies have enjoyed many notable successes to which NGS has been a key driver of this innovation there remains a critical need for validated predictive biomarkers in immuno-oncology, which could disrupt the current paradigm for patient care and drug development. While significant efforts are being made in the discovery of more predictive biomarkers in immuno-oncology, there is still an ongoing and recognized unmet need. Just as NGS did for targeted cancer therapeutics, we believe spatial biology solutions will provide the necessary biological understanding and predictive power to further accelerate the field of immuno-oncology. All of our products and solutions sold today are for research use only. For future applications in clinical markets, our products may require FDA approval.

 Not only is PhenoCycler a powerful tool for discovery, it is also highly intuitive and appeals to both novice and experts in the field of tissue analysis. The experimental workflow for PhenoCycler is summarized below. PhenoImager For a deeper understanding of disease and patient response to therapy in large scale studies, translational and clinical researchers need a robust and automated spatial biology solutions. Our PhenoImager (formerly Phenoptics) platform enables researchers to visualize, analyze, quantify and phenotype cells in situ, in fresh frozen or formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded FFPE tissue sections, and tissue microarrays TMAs utilizing an automated and high-throughput workflow. Proprietary multispectral imaging removes autofluorescence background and precisely measures fluorescent values for each biomarker with subcellular resolution, enabling researchers to capture the multiple interactions occurring between key biomarkers and cells. In contrast, inferior solutions on the market lack the necessary ability to precisely isolate and measure the different fluorescence channels due to color bleed. Users of our platform have confidence in the accuracy of the quantified interactions occurring in the biology of the cell. In addition, just as with PhenoCycler

 Suppliers and Manufacturing We outsource the manufacturing and distribution of our instruments and reagents. We use one contract manufacturer to produce our PhenoImager (formerly Phenoptics) instruments, another to produce our PhenoCycler (formerly CODEX) instruments, and a third to produce all reagent kits. The manufacturers procure the majority of materials needed for the finished good production from many different suppliers, with some of those suppliers located in the US and others located outside the U.S. See Risks Related to Our Business and Strategy Our third-party manufacturers are dependent upon third-party suppliers, including single source suppliers, making us vulnerable to supply shortages and price fluctuations, which could harm our business. Distribution to customers generally occurs from the manufacturing location. We manufacture one sub-assembly related to the Phenoptics (now rebranded as PhenoImager) instruments in our Marlborough, MA facility. Inventory is generally held at the contract manufacturer locations, at a third-party warehouse in Massachusetts, or at our warehouse in Marlborough . Employees As of December 31, 2022, we had 369 employees, including 107 in research and development, 151 in sales, marketing, support, business development, and field service support, 76 in general and administrative and 35 in contract research and manufacturing. None of our United States employees are represented by a labor union or covered under a collective bargaining agreement and we consider our relationship with our employees to be positive. Facilities Our corporate headquarters, research and development facilities and manufacturing and distribution centers are located in Marlborough, Massachusetts and Menlo Park, California, where we lease in aggregate approximately 80,968 and 20,675 square feet of space, respectively, under leases expiring between December 31, 2023 and March 1, 2030. We do not own any real property and believe that our current facilities, together with our global headquarters and research and development center, are sufficient to meet our ongoing needs and that, if we require additional space, we will be able to obtain additional facilities on commercially reasonable terms. Competition The life sciences market is highly competitive. There are other companies, both established and early-stage, that have indicated that they are designing, manufacturing and marketing products for, among other things, tissue analysis, single-cell analysis and spatial analysis. These companies include 10x Genomics, Nanostring Technologies and Fluidigm, each of which has products that compete to varying degrees with some but not all of our product solutions, as well as a number of other emerging and established companies. Some of these companies may have substantially greater financial and other resources than us, including larger research and development staff or more established marketing and sales forces. Other competitors are in the process of developing novel technologies for the life sciences market which may lead to products that rival or replace our products. However, we believe we are substantially differentiated from our competitors for many reasons, including our position as a leader in a large and growing market, proprietary technologies, rigorous product development processes, scalable infrastructure and positive customer experience. We believe our customers favor our products and company because of these differentiators. For further discussion of the risks we face relating to competition, see the section titled Risk Factors Risks Related to our Business and Industry Our market is highly competitive, and if we cannot compete successfully with our competitors, we may be unable to increase or sustain our revenue, or achieve and sustain profitability.

 Government Regulation We do not currently offer any products or services intended to provide clinical diagnostic or health assessment information in relation to individual patients, for use by those patients or their healthcare providers in connection with treatment. We offer technology, products, and services directly to our customers or on a contractual basis to a broad range of customers in the life sciences industry. Our customers may themselves be directly regulated by the FDA, the Centers for Medicare Medicaid Services under CLIA, or similar foreign or state regulatory authorities. We market certain of our products under the FDA exemptions applicable to RUO IVD products. To qualify for this exemption from the otherwise applicable FDA medical device requirements, IVDs must either themselves be in the laboratory research stage of development; or be instruments, systems, or reagents that are labeled for RUO and intended for use in the conduct of nonclinical laboratory research with goals other than the development of a commercial IVD product, i.e., these products are used to carry out research and are not themselves the object of the research. To make clear that these products are exclusively for research purposes, the FDA requires them to include labeling that is prominently placed to state: For Research Use Only. Not for use in diagnostic procedures. RUO products include those intended for use in discovering and developing medical knowledge related to human disease and conditions. For example, instruments and reagents intended for use in research attempting to isolate a gene linked with a particular disease may be labeled for RUO when such instruments and reagents are not intended to produce results for clinical use. FDA guidance describes the agency s position on RUOs, including labeling and distribution expectations to remain consistent with RUO status. FDA has advised that it will evaluate the totality of the circumstances to determine if it agrees a product is RUO. In addition, customers may impose contractual requirements relating to, or we may otherwise determine that it is commercially beneficial for us to voluntarily follow, certain regulatory and industry standards such as FDA good manufacturing practices and International Standards Organization ISO quality or other standards. In the future we may pursue or play a role in the development of companion diagnostics, or perform clinical testing using companion diagnostics. A companion diagnostic is a medical device, often an in vitro diagnostic device, which provides information that is essential for the safe and effective use of a corresponding drug or biological product. The test helps a health care professional determine whether a particular therapeutic product s benefits to patients will outweigh any potential serious side effects or risks. Companion diagnostics would be subject to a much more significant degree of potential FDA and CMS/CLIA and state laboratory regulation than our current product and service offerings. Our ABS laboratory located in Marlborough, Massachusetts is CLIA certified. CLIA establishes rigorous quality standards for all laboratories that perform testing on specimens derived from humans for the purpose of providing information for the diagnosis, prevention or treatment of disease, or the impairment of, or assessment of health. Clinical laboratories must obtain a CLIA certificate based on the complexity of testing performed at the laboratory, such as a Certificate of Compliance for high-complexity testing. CLIA also mandates compliance with various operational, personnel, facilities administration, quality and proficiency requirements, intended to ensure that their clinical laboratory testing services are accurate, reliable and timely. Compliance is subject to verification through inspections and audits. CLIA provides that a state may adopt laboratory regulations that are more stringent than those under federal law, and a number of states have implemented their own more stringent laboratory regulatory requirements. Several states additionally require the licensure of out-of-state laboratories that accept specimens from those states. If a clinical laboratory is found to be out of compliance with CLIA certification or a state license or permit, the applicable regulatory agency may, among other things, suspend, restrict or revoke the certification, accreditation, license or permit to operate the clinical laboratory, assess civil monetary penalties and impose specific corrective action plans, among other sanctions.

In September 2018, in connection with the acquisition of the Quantitative Pathology Solutions QPS technology from PKI, we entered into a license and royalty agreement with PKI, Cambridge Research, and VisEn Medical Inc., or, collectively, the Licensor, pursuant to which the Licensor granted us an exclusive, nontransferable, sublicensable (subject to certain conditions), worldwide license within certain fields of use under certain patent rights and know-how owned by the Licensor to make, use, and sell products within such fields of use, as well as a similar, non-exclusive license under certain other patent rights. The licensed patents relate to methods and systems for analyzing biological samples, and in particular, slide-mounted tissue samples. We agreed to pay the Licensor royalties ranging from 1.0 to 7.0 on net sales of products covered by either license on a decreasing schedule that ends upon the expiration of the last valid claim of the licensed patents, at which point the agreement shall terminate and our rights and licenses thereunder shall survive on a fully-paid up, royalty-free basis. The last licensed patent is set to expire in 2036. Neither we nor the Licensor has the right to terminate the agreement prior to such expiration. The Licensor has the first right to control the prosecution, maintenance and defense of the licensed patents. We have the first right to enforce any exclusively licensed patent with respect to third -party infringement occurring solely within our licensed field of use, and Licensor has the first right to enforce the license patents with respect to any other third-party infringement. If any exclusively licensed patent is believed to be infringed by the development, manufacture, use, offer for sale, sale or importation of a product by the third-party solely inside field of use worldwide, the Licensor has the first right to institute, prosecute and control any action or proceeding with respect to such infringement of such patent. University of Washington In June 2018, we entered into an exclusive patent license agreement with the University of Washington, or the University, pursuant to which the University granted us an exclusive, sublicensable (subject to certain conditions), worldwide license in certain fields of use under certain patent rights owned by the University relating to technology for molecular profiling of cells and tissue specimens, to make, use and sell products that are covered by such patent rights, or the Washington Licensed Products. The licensed patents are related to the detection of biomolecules, particularly proteins and nucleic acids, in biological samples. We made an upfront payment of 15,000 following execution of the agreement, and we are obligated to pay the University a low single-digit percentage running royalty on net sales of Washington Licensed Products, subject to certain minimum annual royalty payments and potential reductions based on a royalty-stacking allowance for certain third -party rights that are required to be obtained to make, use, sell or import Washington Licensed Products. We are also obligated to make cumulative one-time payments to the University of 100,000 upon the achievement of certain commercial milestones, as well as sharing a portion of any of our non-royalty sublicensing income.

 We are obligated to use commercially reasonable efforts to commercialize the inventions covered by the licensed patent rights and to make and sell Washington Licensed Products as soon as practicable and maximize sales thereof, including with respect to accomplishing specific goals with specific deadlines set forth in the agreement. The University must conduct the prosecution of the licensed patents per our instructions and at our expense, subject to certain exceptions. We have the first right to defend and enforce the licensed patents at our expense. The agreement shall expire when all licensed patent rights have terminated, unless terminated earlier in accordance with the terms thereof. The last licensed patent is set to expire in 2032. We may terminate the agreement at any time by providing advance written notice of at least 60 days. The University may terminate the agreement if we violate or fail to perform any material term thereof and fail to cure such violation or failure within 60 days of written notice from the University. In addition, the University may terminate the exclusive license agreement upon 10 days prior written notice upon certain insolvency-related events involving us or should we challenge the validity of the licensed patents. Legal Proceedings From time to time, we may become involved in legal proceedings or be subject to claims arising in the ordinary course of our business. We are not presently a party to any legal proceedings that we believe, if determined adversely to us, would have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, operating results, or cash flows. Regardless of the outcome, litigation can have an adverse impact on us because of defense and settlement costs, diversion of management resources, and other factors. Item 1A. Risk Factors Investing in our common stock involves a high degree of risk. You should consider carefully the risks and uncertainties described below, together with all of the other information in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, including the section titled Management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations and our consolidated financial statements and related notes, before making a decision to invest in our common stock. Our business, results of operations, financial condition and prospects could also be harmed by risks and uncertainties that are not presently known to us or that we currently believe are not material. If any of the risks actually occur, our business, platform, reputation, brand, results of operations, financial condition and prospects could be materially and adversely affected. In such event, the market price of our common stock could decline, and you could lose all or part of your investment. Risks Related to Our Business and Strategy We have incurred significant losses since inception, we expect to incur losses in the future and we may not be able to generate sufficient revenue to achieve and maintain profitability. We have incurred significant losses since our inception. For the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, we incurred net losses of 70.6 million and 42.9 million, respectively. As of December 31, 2022, we had an accumulated deficit of 166.7 million. We expect that our operating expenses will continue to increase as we grow our business and will also increase as a result of our becoming a public company. Since our inception, we have financed our operations primarily from private placements of our convertible preferred stock, the incurrence of indebtedness, the sale of our common stock in our IPO, and to a lesser extent, revenue derived from our PhenoCycler (formerly CODEX) and PhenoImager (formerly Phenoptics) platforms. We have devoted substantially all of our resources to the development and commercialization of our PhenoCycler and PhenoImager platforms and to research and development activities related to advancing and expanding our scientific and technological capabilities. We will need to generate significant additional revenue to achieve and sustain profitability, and even if we achieve profitability, we cannot be sure that we will remain profitable for any substantial period of time. We may never be able to generate sufficient revenue to achieve or sustain profitability and our recent and historical growth should not be considered indicative of our future performance.

 Our success depends on our ability to drive adoption of our PhenoCycler and PhenoImager platforms. Our ability to market and sell our PhenoCycler and PhenoImager platforms and increase awareness of spatial biology technology will depend on a number of factors, including: our ability to drive adoption of our platforms and complementary products by academic, government, biopharmaceutical, biotechnology and other institutions; our ability to increase awareness of the capabilities of our technology and solutions; whether our platforms reliably provide advantages over legacy and other alternative technologies and are perceived by customers to be cost effective; prices we charge for a direct purchase of, or other access to, our platforms and complementary products; the relative reliability and robustness of our platforms and complementary products as a whole and the components of both; our ability to develop new workflows, products, services and solutions for customers; the impact of our investments in product innovation and commercial growth; negative publicity regarding our or our competitors products resulting from defects or errors; and our ability to further validate our technology through research and accompanyin g publications. 
 We cannot assure you that we will be successful in addressing each of these criteria or other criteria that might affect the adoption of our solutions. If we are unsuccessful in achieving and maintaining market acceptance of our solutions and spatial biology technology, our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects could be adversely affected. Our revenue has been primarily generated from sales of our PhenoCycler and PhenoImager platforms and reagents. If our products do not continue to gain market acceptance, our revenue could be materially and adversely impacted. We made our first commercial sale of PhenoCycler in the United States in January 2019, and we began selling PhenoImager instruments in October 2018 following our acquisition of this product line from PKI. We currently generate the majority of our revenue from the sale of our PhenoCycler and PhenoImager platforms, reagents and instrument services. Direct sales of PhenoCycler and PhenoImager platforms and consumables together accounted for 76 and 78 of our revenue for the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. We expect that, for at least the foreseeable future, direct sales of our PhenoCycler and PhenoImager platforms and consumables will continue to account for a substantial portion of our revenue while we develop additional products for our spatial biology platforms. As technologies change in the future for research equipment in general and in spatial biology specifically, we will be expected to upgrade or adapt our products in order to keep up with the latest technology and there can be no assurance we will be able to do so. Our sales expectations are based in part on the assumption that our platforms will continue to gain market acceptance as spatial biology becomes more accepted which in turn will increase the associated purchases of our consumables. If sales of our platforms fail to materialize so will the related consumable sales and associated revenue. If our PhenoCycler and PhenoImager platforms fail to achieve sufficient market acceptance or sales of our consumables decrease, our revenue could be materially and adversely impacted.

 If we fail to enter into new customer relationships or maintain and expand existing relationships, our future operating results would be adversely affected as a general matter. Our customer base includes academic, government, biopharmaceutical, biotechnology and other institutions. Our success will depend upon our ability to increase our market penetration among these customers and to expand our market by developing and marketing new products and new applications for existing products. As we continue to scale our business, we may find that certain of our products, certain customers or certain markets, including the biopharmaceutical market, may require a dedicated sales force or personnel with different experience than those we currently employ. Identifying, recruiting and training additional qualified personnel would require significant time, expense and attention. Our ability to grow our market penetration in existing markets will also depend on our ability to attract new customers by increasing awareness of the capabilities of our spatial biology technology and solutions. Future revenue growth will also depend on our ability to develop and market new workflows, technologies and solutions to meet our existing customers evolving needs, as well as our ability to identify new applications and customers for our technology in additional markets. If we are unable to drive new customer conversion to our PhenoCycler and PhenoImager platforms, expand adoption of spatial biology technology into new industries and markets, expand the application of workflows across our customers value chains, increase the usage and value of our workflows to our customers or develop and monetize proprietary biological assets, then our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects could be adversely affected. We cannot assure investors that we will be able to further penetrate our existing market or that the market will be able to sustain our current and future product offerings. Any failure to increase penetration in our existing markets would adversely affect our ability to improve our operating results. Our operating results have fluctuated significantly in the past and may fluctuate significantly in the future, which makes our future operating results difficult to predict and could cause our operating results to fall below expectations. Our quarterly and annual operating results have fluctuated significantly in the past and may fluctuate significantly in the future, which makes it difficult for us to predict our future operating results. These fluctuations may occur due to a variety of factors, many of which are outside of our control, including, but not limited to: the level of demand for our platforms, consumables and technologies, which may vary significantly; the length of time of the sales cycle for purchases of our systems, including lead time needed to develop custom workflows or to manufacture component parts; the timing and cost of, and level of investment in, research, development, regulatory approval and commercialization activities relating to our products, which may change from time to time; the start and completion of projects in which our solutions are utilized; the relative reliability and robustness of our platforms, including our technologies; the introduction of new products or product enhancements by us or others in our industry; expenditures that we may incur to acquire, develop or commercialize additional products and technologies; changes in governmental regulations or in the status of our regulatory approvals or applications; future accounting pronouncements or changes in our accounting policies; and

 general market conditions and other factors, including factors unrelated to our operating performance or the operating performance of our competitors. 
 The effect of one of the factors discussed above, or the cumulative effects of a combination of factors discussed above, could result in large fluctuations and unpredictability in our quarterly and annual operating results. As a result, comparing our operating results on a period-to-period basis may not be meaningful. Stockholders should not rely on our past results as an indication of our future performance. Our limited operating history makes it difficult to evaluate our future prospects and the risks and challenges we may encounter. We completed our first commercial PhenoImager sale in October 2018 and PhenoCycler sale in January 2019. Our limited operating history and evolving business make it difficult to evaluate our future prospects and the risks and challenges we may encounter and may increase the risk that we will not grow at or near our expected rates. In addition, we operate in highly competitive markets characterized by rapid technological advances and our business has, and we expect it to continue, to evolve over time to remain competitive. If we fail to address the risks and difficulties that we face, including those described elsewhere in this Risk Factors section, our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects could be adversely affected. We have encountered in the past, and will encounter in the future, risks and uncertainties frequently experienced by growing companies with limited operating histories in rapidly changing industries. If our assumptions regarding these risks and uncertainties, which we use to plan and operate our business, are incorrect or change, or if we do not address these risks successfully, our results of operations could differ materially from our expectations and our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects could be adversely affected. Acquisitions could disrupt our business, cause dilution to our stockholders and otherwise harm our business. We have and may continue to acquire other businesses or assets to add products or technologies as well as pursue technology licenses or investments in complementary businesses. In 2018, we acquired our PhenoImager platform from PKI. We believe we are successfully integrating the technologies acquired from PKI into our business, but the long-term success of the acquisition is not guaranteed. This transaction and any future transactions could be material to our financial condition and operating results and expose us to many risks, including: disruption in our relationships with customers, distributors, manufacturers or suppliers as a result of such a transaction; unanticipated liabilities related to acquired companies, including liabilities related to acquired intellectual property or litigation relating thereto; difficulties integrating acquired personnel, technologies and operations into our existing business; diversion of management time and focus from operating our business; failure to realize anticipated benefits or synergies from such a transaction; increases in our expenses and reductions in our cash available for operations and other uses; and possible write-offs or impairment charges relating to acquired businesses. 
 Even if we identify a strategic transaction that we wish to pursue, we may be prohibited from consummating such transaction due to the terms of our existing or any future indebtedness. If we were to pursue an acquisition that is not permitted by our existing indebtedness, we would be required to seek a waiver from the lender and we cannot assure our stockholders that the lender would grant such a waiver.

 Future acquisitions or dispositions could result in potentially dilutive issuances of our equity securities, the incurrence of debt, contingent liabilities, amortization expenses or write-offs of goodwill, any of which could materially impact our financial results or operations. If our existing and new products fail to achieve and sustain sufficient scientific acceptance, we will not generate expected revenue and our prospects may be harmed. The life sciences community is comprised of a small number of early adopters and key opinion leaders who significantly influence the rest of the community. The success of life sciences products is due, in large part, to acceptance by the scientific community and their adoption of certain products as best practice in the applicable field of research. The current system of academic and scientific research views publishing in a peer-reviewed journal as a measure of success. In such journal publications, the researchers will describe, not only their discoveries, but also the methods and typically the products used to fuel such discoveries. Mentions in peer-reviewed journal publications is a good barometer for the general acceptance of our products as best practices. Ensuring that early adopters and key opinion leaders publish research involving the use of our products is critical to ensuring our products gain widespread acceptance and market growth. Continuing to maintain good relationships with such key opinion leaders is vital to growing our market. The number of times our products were mentioned in peer-reviewed publications has increased significantly in the last two years. During this time our revenue has also increased significantly. We cannot assure our stockholders that our products will continue to be mentioned in peer-reviewed articles with any frequency or that any new products that we introduce in the future will be mentioned in peer-reviewed articles. If too few researchers describe the use of our products, too many researchers shift to a competing product and publish research outlining their use of that product or too many researchers negatively describe the use of our products in publications, it may drive existing and potential customers away from our products, which could harm our operating results. We generally recognize revenue from first-year warranty, extended warranty and service contracts over the contract term, and changes in sales of such contracts may not be immediately reflected in our operating results. Our instruments are sold with a twelve-month warranty. We offer our customers the option to purchase extended warranty and service programs for regular system maintenance and system optimization on a fixed fee basis. We generally recognize revenue from our first-year warranty, extended warranty and service contracts ratably over the contract term, which is typically twelve months, which could in some cases be subject to an early termination right. Revenue from our first-year warranty, extended warranty and service contracts accounted for 11 and 12 of our revenue for the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. A portion of the revenue we report in each quarter is derived from the recognition of deferred revenue relating to extended warranty and service contracts entered into during previous quarters. Consequently, a decline in new or renewed extended warranty and service contracts by our customers in any one quarter may not be immediately reflected in our revenue for that quarter. Such a decline, however, will negatively affect our revenue in future quarters. Accordingly, the effect of significant downturns in sales and market acceptance of our services and potential changes in our rate of renewals may not be fully reflected in our operating results until future periods. If we were to be sued for product liability, we could face substantial liabilities that exceed our resources. The marketing, sale and use of our products could lead to the filing of product liability claims were someone to allege that our products identified inaccurate or incomplete information regarding the tissues analyzed or otherwise failed to perform as designed. We may also be subject to liability for errors in a misunderstanding of or inappropriate reliance upon the information we provide in the ordinary course of our business activities. A product liability claim could result in substantial damages and be costly and time-consuming for us to defend. We maintain product liability insurance, but this insurance may not fully protect us from the financial impact of defending against product liability claims. Any product liability claim brought against us, with or without merit, could increase our insurance rates or prevent us from securing insurance coverage in the future. Additionally, any product liability lawsuit could damage our reputation, or cause current customers to terminate existing agreements and potential clinical partners to seek other partners, any of which could impact our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects.

 Our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects may be harmed if our customers discontinue or spend less on research, development and production and other scientific endeavors. Our customers include biopharmaceutical companies and academic and clinical institutions. Many factors, including public policy spending priorities, available resources and internal budgets and product and economic cycles, including inflationary pressures, have a significant effect on the capital spending policies of these entities. Fluctuations in the research and development budgets of our customers could have a significant effect on the demand for our products. Our customers determine their research and development budgets based on several factors, including the need to develop new products, continued availability of governmental and other funding, competition and the general availability of resources. If their research and development budgets are reduced, the impact could adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects. If we are unable to support demand for the PhenoCycler and PhenoImager platforms and consumables, and for our future product offerings, including ensuring that we have adequate capacity to meet increased demand, or if we are unable to successfully manage our anticipated growth, our business could suffer. As the number of customers using our PhenoCycler and PhenoImager platforms and consumables grows and our volume of installed instruments increases, we will need to continue to increase our capacity for customer service and support and for billing and general process improvements and to expand our internal quality assurance programs. We will also need to purchase additional equipment, some of which can take several months or more to procure, setup and validate, and increase our personnel levels to meet increased demand. There is no assurance that any of these increases in scale, expansion of personnel, equipment, software and computing capacities or process enhancements will be successfully implemented, or that we will have adequate space, including in our laboratory facility, to accommodate such required expansion. As we commercialize additional products, we will need to incorporate new equipment, implement new technology systems and laboratory processes, and hire new personnel, possibly with supplemental or different qualifications as compared to our current personnel. Failure to manage this growth or transition could result in turnaround time delays, higher product costs, declining product quality, deteriorating customer service and slower responses to competitive challenges. A failure in any one of these areas could make it difficult for us to meet market expectations for our products and could damage our reputation and the prospects for our business. The sizes of the markets for our solutions may be smaller than estimated and new market opportunities may not develop as quickly as we expect, or at all, limiting our ability to successfully sell our solutions. The market for spatial biology products is new and evolving, making it difficult to predict with any accuracy the sizes of the markets for our current and future solutions. Our estimates of the annual TAM for our current and future solutions are based on a number of internal and third- party estimates and assumptions. In particular, our estimates are based on our expectations that: (a) researchers in the market for certain life sciences research tools and technologies will view our solutions as competitive alternatives to, or better options than, such existing tools and technologies; and (b) researchers who already own such existing tools and technologies will recognize the ability of our solutions to complement, enhance and enable new applications of their current tools and technologies and find the value proposition offered by our solutions convincing enough to purchase our solutions in addition to the tools and technologies they already own. Underlying each of these expectations are a number of estimates and assumptions, including the assumption that government or other sources of funding will continue to be available to life sciences researchers at times and in amounts necessary to allow them to purchase our solutions. In addition, our growth strategy involves launching new products and expanding sales of existing products into new markets in which we have limited or no experience. Sales of new or existing products into new market opportunities may take several years to develop and mature and we cannot be certain that these market opportunities will develop as we expect. For example, new life sciences technology is often not adopted by the relevant market until a sufficient amount of research conducted using such technology has been published in peer-reviewed publications. Because there can be a considerable delay between the launch of a new life sciences product and publication of research using such product, new life sciences products do not generally contribute a meaningful amount of revenue in the year they are introduced. 
 28 

Table of Contents 
 In certain markets, such as the biopharmaceutical market, new life sciences technology, even if sufficiently covered in peer-reviewed publications, may not be adopted until the consistency and accuracy of such technology, method or device has been proven. As a result, the sizes of the annual TAM for new markets and new products are even more difficult to predict. While we believe our assumptions and the data underlying our estimates of the total annual addressable market for our solutions are reasonable, these assumptions and estimates may not be correct and the conditions supporting our assumptions or estimates, or those underlying the third-party data we have used, may change at any time, thereby reducing the accuracy of our estimates. As a result, our estimates of the annual TAM for our solutions may be incorrect. The future growth of the market for our current and future products depends on many factors beyond our control, including recognition and acceptance of our instruments and products by the scientific community as best practice and the growth, prevalence and costs of competing products and solutions. Such recognition and acceptance may not occur in the near term, or at all. If the markets for our current and future solutions are smaller than estimated or do not develop as we expect, our growth may be limited and our business, financial condition and operational results may be adversely affected. If we fail to offer high quality customer service, our business and reputation could suffer. We differentiate ourselves from our competition through our commitment to an exceptional customer experience. Accordingly, high quality customer service is important for the growth of our business and any failure to maintain such standards of customer service, or a related market perception, could affect our ability to sell products to existing and prospective customers. Additionally, we believe our customer service team has a positive influence on recurring consumables revenue. Providing an exceptional customer experience requires significant time and resources from our customer service team. Therefore, failure to scale our customer service organization adequately may adversely impact our business results and financial condition. The number of our customers has grown significantly and such growth, as well as any future growth, will put additional pressure on our customer service organization. We may be unable to hire qualified staff quickly enough or to the extent necessary to accommodate increases in demand. In addition, as we continue to grow our operations and reach a global customer base, we need to be able to provide efficient customer service that meets our customers needs globally at scale. In geographies where we sell through distributors, we rely on those distributors to provide customer service. If these third-party distributors do not provide a high-quality customer experience, our business operations and reputation may suffer. Our management uses certain key business metrics to evaluate our business, measure our performance, identify trends affecting our business, formulate financial projections and make strategic decisions and such metrics may not accurately reflect all of the aspects of our business needed to make such evaluations and decisions, in particular as our business continues to grow. In addition to our consolidated financial results, our management regularly reviews a number of operating and financial metrics, including various revenue metrics and cash flows to evaluate our business, measure our performance, identify trends affecting our business, formulate financial projections and make strategic decisions. We believe that these metrics are representative of our current business; however, these metrics may not accurately reflect all aspects of our business and we anticipate that these metrics may change or may be substituted for additional or different metrics as our business grows and as we introduce new products. For example, we expect that our expansion into new markets and adoption by new customers who may not have the same financial resources to devote to consumable purchases as our existing customer base could adversely impact our revenue metrics. If our management fails to review other relevant information or change or substitute the key business metrics they review as our business grows and we introduce new products, their ability to accurately formulate financial projections and make strategic decisions may be compromised and our business, financial results and future growth prospects may be adversely impacted.

 We may need to raise additional capital to fund our existing operations, improve our platform or develop and commercialize new products and technologies, or expand our operations. Based on our current business plan, we believe our current cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities will be sufficient to meet our anticipated cash requirements for at least the next 12 months. If our available cash resources and anticipated cash flow from operations are insufficient to satisfy our liquidity requirements including because of lower demand for our products or the realization of other risks described in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, we may be required to raise additional capital prior to such time through issuances of equity or convertible debt securities, entrance into a credit facility or another form of third-party funding or seek other debt financing. In any event, we may consider raising additional capital in the future to expand our business, to pursue strategic investments, to take advantage of financing opportunities or for other reasons, including to: increase our sales and marketing efforts to drive market adoption of our PhenoCycler and PhenoImager platforms and consumables and address competitive developments; fund development and marketing efforts of products from our programs or any other future products; expand our technologies into additional markets; acquire, license or invest in additional intellectual property and technologies; acquire or invest in complementary businesses or assets; and finance capital expenditures and general and administrative expenses. 
 Our present and future funding requirements will depend on many factors, including: our ability to achieve revenue growth; our rate of progress in launching and commercializing new products, and the cost of the sales and marketing activities associated with, establishing adoption of our PhenoCycler and PhenoImager platforms and consumables; our rate of progress in, and cost of research and development activities associated with, products in research and development; the effect of competing technological and market developments; costs related to domestic and international expansion; and the potential cost of and delays in product development as a result of any regulatory oversight applicable to our products. 
 The various ways we could raise additional capital carry potential risks. If we raise funds by issuing equity securities, dilution to our stockholders could result. Any preferred equity securities issued also could provide for rights, preferences or privileges senior to those of holders of our common stock. If we raise funds by issuing debt securities, those debt securities would have rights, preferences and privileges senior to those of holders of our common stock. The terms of debt securities issued or borrowings pursuant to a credit agreement could impose significant restrictions on our operations. If we raise funds through collaborations or licensing arrangements, we might be required to relinquish significant rights to our platform technologies or products or grant licenses on terms that are not favorable to us.

 If we are unable to obtain adequate financing or financing on terms satisfactory to us, if we require it, our ability to continue to pursue our business objectives and to respond to business opportunities, challenges, or unforeseen circumstances could be significantly limited, and could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects. Our Midcap Trust Term Loan contains covenants, which restrict our operating activities, and we may be required to repay the outstanding indebtedness in an event of default, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects. In October 2020, we entered into a credit and security agreement with Midcap Financial Trust, (the Lender pursuant to which the Lender agreed to provide us a 37.5 million credit facility (the Midcap Trust Term Loan ). On March 21, 2022, we entered into Amendment No. 1 to the Midcap Trust Term Loan, which amended certain provisions to permit certain additional debt and capital leases. On June 1, 2022, we entered into Amendment No. 2 Amendment No. 2 to the Midcap Trust Term Loan, which permitted the draw of a second tranche of 10.0 million, which was drawn on June 1, 2022. Additionally, the amendment provides us with a new third tranche pursuant to which we may draw 10.0 million any time after September 30, 2022 until September 30, 2023. The amendment also delayed the amortization start dates for the outstanding loan amounts from November 1, 2023 until April 1, 2025, at which point we will repay the principal amounts in seven equal monthly installments until the maturity date. Finally, Amendment No. 2 amended the interest rate payable on the term loan to apply an interest rate equal to the Secured Overnight Financing Rate SOFR rate (with a floor of 1.61448 plus 6.35 . Substantially all other terms and conditions, and covenants of the credit agreement remain unchanged. In connection with Amendment No. 2, the Company agreed to pay a 75.0 thousand commitment fee as well as a 0.25 fee upon the funding of each of the second tranche and third tranche amounts. On September 30, 2022, the Company drew the third tranche of 10.0 million related to Amendment No. 2. On November 7, 2022, we entered into Amendment No. 3 Amendment No. 3 to the Midcap Trust Term Loan, which permitted the draw of two additional tranches, each totaling 11.25 million, the first of which was drawn on November 7, 2022. The remaining tranche will become available for draw after June 30, 2023 but before December 31, 2023, and is subject to us achieving certain trailing twelve month revenue targets. The amendment also delayed the amortization start dates for the outstanding loan amounts from April 1, 2025 until December 1, 2025 (subject to further extension upon certain conditions), at which point we will repay the principal amounts in equal monthly installments until the new maturity date of November 1, 2027, which was extended pursuant to Amendment No. 3. In addition, Amendment No. 3 amended the interest rate payable on the term loan to apply an interest rate equal to the SOFR rate (with a floor of 2.50 plus 6.80 , and reset the call protection to begin as of November 7, 2025. Finally, Amendment No. 3 provides for a commitment fee of 74 thousand payable on November 7, 2022 on the new tranche amounts and an exit fee of 4.75 . Substantially all other terms and conditions, and covenants of the credit agreement remain unchanged. We have drawn 63.75 million as of December 31, 2022, subject to our compliance with the covenants contained in the Midcap Trust Term Loan. Until we have repaid such indebtedness, the Midcap Trust Term Loan subjects us to various customary covenants, including requirements as to financial reporting, liquidity ratios and insurance and restrictions on our ability to dispose of our business or property, to change our line of business, to liquidate or dissolve, to enter into any change in control transaction, to merge or consolidate with any other entity or to acquire all or substantially all the capital stock or property of another entity, to incur additional indebtedness, to incur liens on our property, to pay any dividends or make other distributions on capital stock other than dividends payable solely in capital stock, to redeem capital stock, to enter into certain in- bound licensing agreements, to engage in transactions with affiliates, and to encumber our intellectual property. In particular, we are subject to a minimum revenue financial covenant measuring our last twelve months trailing revenue, tested on a monthly basis. Our business may be adversely affected by these restrictions.

 We are permitted to make interest only payments on the Midcap Trust Term Loan through November 2025, at which time principal payments begin. However, we may be required to repay the outstanding indebtedness if an event of default occurs under the Midcap Trust Term Loan. An event of default will occur if, among other things, we fail to make required payments under the Midcap Trust Term Loan; we breach any of our covenants under the credit and security agreement, subject to specified cure periods with respect to certain breaches; the Lender determines that a material adverse change (as defined in the credit and security agreement) has occurred; we or our assets become subject to certain legal proceedings, such as bankruptcy proceedings; we are unable to pay our debts as they become due; or we default on contracts with third parties which would permit the third-party to accelerate the maturity of such indebtedness or that could have a material adverse change on us. We may not have enough available cash or be able to raise additional funds through equity or debt financings to repay such indebtedness at the time any such event of default occurs. In such a case, we may be required to delay, limit, reduce or terminate our product development or operations or grant to others rights to develop and market products that we would otherwise prefer to develop and market ourselves. The Lender could also exercise its rights as secured lender to take possession of and to dispose of the collateral securing the Midcap Trust Term Loan, which collateral includes substantially all of our property. Our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects could be materially adversely affected as a result of any of these events. Our actual operating results may differ significantly from any operating guidance we may provide. From time to time, we may release guidance in our quarterly or annual earnings conference calls, quarterly or annual earnings releases, or otherwise, regarding our future performance that represents our management s estimates as of the date of release. This guidance, which will include forward-looking statements, will be based on projections prepared by our management. These projections may not be prepared with a view toward compliance with published guidelines of the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants, (the AICPA ), and neither our registered public accountants nor any other independent expert or outside party compiles or examines the projections. Accordingly, no such person will express any opinion or any other form of assurance with respect to the projections. Projections are based upon a number of assumptions and estimates that, while presented with numerical specificity, are inherently subject to significant business, economic and competitive uncertainties and contingencies, many of which are beyond our control and are based upon specific assumptions with respect to future business decisions, some of which will change. The principal reason that we may release guidance is to provide a basis for our management to discuss our business outlook with analysts and investors. We do not accept any responsibility for any projections or reports published by any such third parties. Guidance is necessarily speculative in nature, and it can be expected that some or all of the assumptions underlying the guidance furnished by us will not materialize or will vary significantly from actual results. Accordingly, our guidance is only an estimate of what management believes is realizable as of the date of release. Actual results may vary from our guidance and the variations may be material. Any failure to successfully implement our operating strategy or the occurrence of any of the events or circumstances set forth in this Risk Factors section in this Annual Report on Form 10-K could result in actual operating results being different from our guidance, and the differences may be adverse and material. Our market is highly competitive, and if we cannot compete successfully with our competitors, we may be unable to increase or sustain our revenue, or achieve and sustain profitability. We face significant competition in our market. We currently compete with both established and early stage life sciences technology companies that design, manufacture and market products and software for, among other applications, genomics, tissue analysis, spatial analysis and immunology, and/or provide services related to the same. Growing understanding of the importance of spatial biology information is leading to more companies offering services related to collecting such information. Potential competitors within our space include 10x Genomics, Nanostring Technologies and Fluidigm, among others. In addition, our customers may also elect to develop their workflows on legacy systems rather than our platforms and may decide to stop using our platforms.

Table of Contents 
 Our competitors and potential competitors may enjoy a number of competitive advantages over us, including: longer operating histories; larger customer bases; greater brand recognition and market penetration; greater financial resources; greater technological and research and development resources; more expansive intellectual property and proprietary rights; and larger commercial organizations and manufacturing organizations. 
 As a result, our competitors and potential competitors may be able to respond more quickly to changes in customer requirements, devote greater resources to the development, promotion and sale of their products than we can or sell their products, or offer services competitive with our platforms, consumables and services at prices designed to win significant levels of market share. We may not be able to compete effectively against these organizations. In addition, competitors may be acquired by, receive investments from or enter into other commercial relationships with larger, well-established and well-financed companies. Certain of our competitors may be able to secure key inputs from vendors on more favorable terms, devote greater resources to marketing and promotional campaigns, adopt more aggressive pricing policies and devote substantially more resources to product development than we can. If we are unable to compete successfully against current and future competitors, we may be unable to increase market adoption and sales of our platform, which could prevent us from increasing our revenue or achieving profitability. We must develop new products, adapt to rapid and significant technological change and respond to introductions of new products by competitors to remain competitive. We sell our products in industries that are characterized by significant enhancements and evolving industry standards. As a result, our customers needs are rapidly evolving. If we do not appropriately innovate and invest in new products and technologies, our offerings may become less desirable in the markets we serve, and our customers could move to new technologies offered by our competitors or make products themselves. Though we believe customers in our markets display a significant amount of loyalty to their supplier of a particular product, we also believe that because of the initial time investment required by many of our customers to reach a purchasing decision for a new product, it may be difficult to regain that customer once the customer purchases a product from a competitor. Without the timely introduction of new products, services and enhancements, our offerings will likely become less competitive over time, in which case our competitive position and operating results could suffer. Accordingly, we focus significant efforts and resources on the development and identification of new technologies, products and markets to further broaden our offerings. To the extent we fail to timely introduce new and innovative products or services, adequately predict our customers needs or fail to obtain desired levels of market acceptance, our business may suffer and our operating results could be adversely affected. We may be unable to manage our future growth effectively, which could make it difficult to execute our business strategy. Since our inception in 2015, we have experienced rapid growth and anticipate further growth in our business operations. Our growth between 2015 and 2022 has required significant time and attention from our management, and placed strains on our operational and manufacturing systems and processes, financial systems and internal controls and other aspects of our business. We expect to continue to increase headcount and to hire more specialized personnel in the future as we grow our business. We will need to continue to hire, train and manage additional qualified scientists, 
 33 

Table of Contents 
 engineers, laboratory personnel, client and account services personnel and sales and marketing staff and improve and maintain our technology to properly manage our growth. We may also need to hire, train and manage individuals with expertise that is separate, supplemental or different from expertise that we currently have, and accordingly we may not be successful in hiring, training and managing such individuals. If our new hires perform poorly, if we are unsuccessful in hiring, training, managing and integrating these new employees, or if we are not successful in retaining our existing employees, our business may be harmed. Developing and launching new products and innovating and improving our existing products have required us to hire and retain additional scientific, engineering, sales and marketing, software, manufacturing, distribution and quality assurance personnel. As a result, we have experienced rapid headcount growth since our inception in 2015 with 369 employees as of December 31, 2022. As we have grown, our employees have become more geographically dispersed. We currently serve customers located in more than 35 countries and plan to continue to expand to new international jurisdictions as part of our growth strategy, which will lead to increased dispersion of our employees, including sales employees and employees who are in our service and support groups. Our management and other personnel devote a substantial amount of time towards maintaining compliance with the requirements of being a public company. We may also face challenges integrating, developing and motivating our rapidly growing and increasingly dispersed employee base. We may not be able to maintain the quality, reliability or robustness of our platform, or the expected turnaround times of our services and support, or to satisfy customer demand as it grows. Our ability to manage our growth properly will require us to continue to improve our operational, financial and management controls, as well as our reporting systems and procedures. To effectively manage our growth, we must continue to improve our operational and manufacturing systems and processes, our financial systems and internal controls and other aspects of our business and continue to effectively expand, train and manage our personnel. The time and resources required to improve our existing systems and procedures, implement new systems and procedures and to adequately staff such existing and new systems and procedures is uncertain, and failure to complete this in a timely and efficient manner could adversely affect our operations and negatively impact our business and financial results. We have limited experience in marketing and sales, and if we are unable to expand our marketing and sales organization to adequately address our customers needs, our business may be adversely affected. We have limited experience in marketing and selling our products. We may not be able to market, sell or distribute our current products, or future products that we may develop, effectively enough to support our planned growth. Competition for employees capable of selling expensive instruments within the pharmaceutical and biotechnology industries is intense. We may not be able to attract and retain personnel or be able to build an efficient and effective sales organization, which could negatively impact sales and market acceptance of our products and limit our revenue growth and potential profitability. In addition, the time and cost of establishing a specialized sales, marketing and service force for a particular product or service may be difficult to justify in light of the revenue generated or projected. Our expected future growth will impose significant added responsibilities on members of management, including the need to identify, recruit, maintain and integrate additional employees. Our future financial performance and our ability to commercialize our products and to compete effectively will depend, in part, on our ability to manage this potential future growth effectively, without compromising quality. We rely on distributors for the sale of our products in certain countries outside of the United States, in some cases, in addition to direct sales in such countries. We exert limited control over these distributors under our agreements with them, and if their sales and marketing efforts for our products in the region are not successful, our business would be materially and adversely affected. Locating, qualifying and engaging distribution partners with local industry experience and knowledge will be necessary in at least the short to mid-term to effectively market and sell our platform in certain countries outside the United States. We may not be successful in finding, attracting and retaining distribution partners, or we may not be able to enter into such arrangements on favorable terms. Even if we are successful in identifying distributors, such distributors may engage in sales practices that violate local laws or our internal policies. Furthermore, sales practices utilized by any such distribution parties that are locally acceptable may not comply with sales practices 
 34 

Table of Contents 
 standards required under U.S. laws that apply to us, which could create additional compliance risk. If our sales and marketing efforts by us or our distributors are not successful outside the United States, we may not achieve significant market acceptance for our products outside the United States, which would materially and adversely impact our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects. The loss of any member of our senior management team or our inability to attract and retain highly skilled scientists, engineers and salespeople could adversely affect our business. Our success depends on the skills, experience and performance of key members of our senior management team, including Brian McKelligon, our Chief Executive Officer. The individual and collective efforts of these employees will be important as we continue to develop our platforms and additional products, and as we expand our commercial activities. The loss or incapacity of existing members of our executive management team could adversely affect our operations if we experience difficulties in hiring qualified successors. Our executive officers are at-will employees, and we cannot guarantee their retention for any period of time. We do not maintain key person insurance on any of our employees. Our research and development programs and laboratory operations depend on our ability to attract and retain highly skilled scientists and engineers. We may not be able to attract or retain qualified scientists and engineers in the future due to the competition for qualified personnel among life sciences businesses. We also face competition from universities and public and private research institutions in recruiting and retaining highly qualified scientific and engineering personnel. We may have difficulties locating, recruiting or retaining qualified salespeople. Recruiting and retention difficulties can limit our ability to support our research and development and sales programs. All of our employees are at-will, which means that either we or the employee may terminate their employment at any time. Due to the significant resources required to enable access in new markets, we must make strategic and operational decisions to prioritize certain markets, technology offerings or partnerships. We may expend our resources to access markets, develop technologies or form certain partnerships that do not yield meaningful revenue, or we may fail to capitalize on markets, technologies or partnerships that may be more profitable or with a greater potential for success. We believe our platforms have potential applications across a wide range of markets and we have targeted certain markets in which we believe our technology has significant advantages, or for which we believe we have a higher probability of success or revenue opportunity or for which the path to commercialize products and realizing or achieving revenue is shorter. We seek to maintain a process of prioritization and resource allocation among our programs to maintain a balance between advancing near-term opportunities and exploring additional markets for our technology. However, due to the significant resources required for the development of workflows for new markets, we must make decisions on which markets to pursue and the amount of resources to allocate to each. Our decisions concerning the allocation of research, development, collaboration, management and financial resources toward particular markets or workflows may not lead to the development of any viable product and may divert resources away from better opportunities. Similarly, our potential decisions to delay, terminate or collaborate with third parties in respect of certain markets may subsequently also prove to be suboptimal and could cause us to miss valuable opportunities. In particular, if we are unable to develop additional relevant workflows for markets such as antibody therapeutics, cell therapy or the synthetic biology market it could slow or stop our business growth and negatively impact our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects. If our operating facilities, including those of our third-party manufacturers, become damaged or inoperable, our ability to conduct and pursue our research and development efforts and manufacture our products may be jeopardized. We currently derive the majority of our revenue based upon scientific and engineering research and development conducted at two facilities located in California and Massachusetts and from products manufactured by our third-party manufacturers. Our facilities and equipment, and that of our third-party manufacturers, could be harmed or rendered inoperable or inaccessible by natural or man-made disasters or other circumstances beyond our control, including fire, earthquake, power loss, communications failure, war or terrorism, or another catastrophic event, such as a pandemic or 
 35 

Table of Contents 
 similar outbreak or public health crisis, which may render it difficult or impossible for us to support our customers and develop updates, upgrades and other improvements to our PhenoCycler and PhenoImager platforms, and workflow software for some period of time. The inability to address system issues or manufacture our products could develop if our facilities, or those of our third-party manufacturers, are inoperable or suffer a loss of utilization for even a short period of time, may result in the loss of customers or harm to our reputation, and we may be unable to regain those customers or repair our reputation in the future. Furthermore, our facilities and the equipment we use to perform our research and development work could be unavailable or costly and time-consuming to repair or replace. It would be difficult, time-consuming and expensive to rebuild either of our facilities, to locate and qualify a new facility or license or transfer our proprietary technology to a third-party. Even in the event we are able to find a third-party to assist in research and development efforts, we may be unable to negotiate commercially reasonable terms to engage with the third-party. We carry insurance for damage to our property and the disruption of our business, but this insurance may not cover all of the risks associated with damage or disruption to our business, may not provide coverage in amounts sufficient to cover our potential losses and may not continue to be available to us on acceptable terms, if at all. Our insurance policies are expensive and protect us only from some business risks, which leaves us exposed to significant uninsured liabilities. We do not carry insurance for all categories of risk that our business may encounter and our policies have limits and significant deductibles. Some of the policies we currently maintain include general liability, property, umbrella and directors and officers insurance. Any additional product liability insurance coverage we acquire in the future, may not be sufficient to reimburse us for any expenses or losses we may suffer. Moreover, insurance coverage is becoming increasingly expensive and in the future we may not be able to maintain insurance coverage at a reasonable cost or in sufficient amounts to protect us against losses. A successful product liability claim or series of claims in which judgments exceed our insurance coverage could adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects, including preventing or limiting the commercialization of any products we develop. In addition, our director and officer liability insurance includes policy limits which may not provide sufficient coverage in the event of a successful claim or series of claims. Any significant uninsured liability may require us to pay substantial amounts, which would adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects. Security incidents, loss of data or modification of information, and other disruptions could compromise information related to our business or prevent us from accessing critical information, result in a significant disruption of our activities and expose us to liability, which could adversely affect our business and our reputation. In the ordinary course of our business, we collect and store information, including personal information, intellectual property and proprietary business information that we own or control or have an obligation to protect. For example, we collect and store research and development information, employee data, commercial information, customer information, business and financial information, and payment card data. We and our service providers, including security and infrastructure vendors, manage and maintain our applications and data using a combination of on-site systems and cloud-based data centers. We face a number of risks related to protecting critical information and our applications, including inappropriate use or disclosure, unauthorized access or acquisition, or inappropriate modification of, critical information. We also face the risk of being unable to access our critical information, applications, or systems due to actual or threats of ransomware, unauthorized encryption, or other malicious activity. We face the risk of our being unable to adequately monitor and audit and modify our controls over our critical information and applications. These risks extend to third-party service providers and subcontractors we use to assist us in managing our information or otherwise process it on our behalf. The secure processing, storage, maintenance and transmission of our critical information are vital to our operations and business strategy, and we devote significant resources to protecting such information. 
 36 

Table of Contents 
 Although we take reasonable measures to protect critical information and other data from unauthorized access, acquisition, use or disclosure, our information technology and infrastructure and that of our service providers handling and storing information on our behalf may be vulnerable to a variety of disruptions, including data breaches, attacks by hackers and other malicious third parties (including the deployment of computer viruses, malware, ransomware, denial-of-service attacks, social engineering, and other events that affect service reliability and threaten the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of information), unauthorized access, natural disasters, fires, terrorism, war, telecommunications or electrical interruptions or failures, employee error or malfeasance or other malicious or inadvertent disruptions. In particular, the risk of a security breach or disruption, particularly through cyber-attacks or cyber intrusion, has generally increased as the number, intensity, and sophistication of attempted attacks and intrusions from around the world have increased. We have in the past, and may in the future, experience such cybersecurity threats. We may not be able to anticipate all types of security threats, and we may not be able to implement preventive measures effective against all such security threats. Because the techniques used by cyber criminals change frequently, may not be recognized until launched, and can originate from a wide variety of sources, including outside groups such as external service providers, organized crime affiliates or terrorist organizations, we and our services providers and other partners may be unable to anticipate these techniques or implement adequate preventative measures. Further, we do not have any control over the operations of the facilities or technology of third parties that collect, process and store sensitive information on our behalf. Any unauthorized access or acquisition, breach, or other loss, of information could result in legal claims or proceedings, and liability under U.S. federal or state, or non-U.S., laws regarding the privacy and protection of information, including personal information, and could disrupt our operations and harm our reputation. In addition, notice of breaches may be required to affected individuals, regulators, credit reporting agencies or the media. Any such publication or notice could harm our reputation and our ability to compete. The financial exposure from the events referenced above could either not be insured against or not be fully covered through any insurance that we may maintain, and there can be no assurance that the limitations of liability in any of our contracts would be enforceable or adequate or would otherwise protect us from liabilities or damages as a result of the events referenced above. Seasonality may cause fluctuations in our revenue and results of operations. We operate on a December 31st year end and believe that there are seasonal factors which may cause sales of our products to vary on a quarterly or yearly basis and increase the magnitude of quarterly or annual fluctuations in our operating results. We believe that this seasonality results from a number of factors, including the procurement and budgeting cycles of many of our customers, especially government- or grant-funded customers, whose cycles often coincide with government fiscal year ends. For example, the United States government s fiscal year end occurs in our third quarter and may result in increased sales of our products during this quarter if government- funded customers have unused funds that may be forfeited, or future budgets that may be reduced, if such funds remain unspent at such fiscal year end. Furthermore, the academic budgetary cycle similarly requires grantees to use or lose their grant funding, which seems to be tied disproportionately to the end of the calendar year, driving sales higher during the fourth quarter. Similarly, our biopharmaceutical customers typically have calendar year fiscal years which also result in a disproportionate amount of their purchasing activity occurring during our fourth quarter. These factors have contributed, and may contribute in the future, to fluctuations in our quarterly operating results. Because of these fluctuations, it is possible that in some quarters our operating results will fall below the expectations of securities analysts or investors. If that happens, the market price of our common stock would likely decrease. These fluctuations, among other factors, also mean that our operating results in any particular period may not be relied upon as an indication of future performance. Seasonal or cyclical variations in our sales have in the past, and may in the future, become more or less pronounced over time, and have in the past materially affected, and may in the future materially affect, our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects. Public health crises such as COVID-19 and similar pandemics or outbreaks have caused and could cause disruptions of the development of our platform technologies and products, and adversely impact our business, financial condition and results of operations. The COVID-19 pandemic, including the spread of variants, continues to evolve, and to date has led to the implementation of various containment efforts. While conditions have improved, the impact of this pandemic has been and may continue to be extensive in many aspects of society. In the event that government authorities were to further modify current restrictions, our employees conducting research and development or manufacturing activities may not be 
 37 

Table of Contents 
 able to access our laboratory or manufacturing space, and our core activities may be significantly limited or curtailed, possibly for an extended period of time. The COVID-19 pandemic created many negative headwinds that presented risks to our business and results of operations. For example, the COVID-19 pandemic generally disrupted the operations of our customers and prospective customers, and a resurgence of the COVID-19 pandemic, or a similar public health crises, may in the future disrupt their operations, including as a result of laboratory closures, travel restrictions and/or business shutdowns, uncertainty in the financial markets or other harm to their business and financial results. These disruptions have in the past and could in the future cause reduced capital spend by our existing customers and potential new customers, which has in the past and could in the future negatively impact our instrument and consumables sales. Disruptions from public health crises like COVID-19 could result in further reductions to capital expenditure budgets, delayed purchasing decisions, longer sales cycles, extended payment terms or missed payments, and postponed or canceled projects, any of which would negatively impact our business and operating results, including sales and cash flows. We do not yet know the net impact that the COVID-19 pandemic may have on our business and cannot guarantee that it will not be materially negative. The future development of the COVID-19 pandemic, or similar public health crises, could also exacerbate the severity of the other risks disclosed herein. Risks Related to Manufacturing and Supply Our third-party manufacturers are dependent upon third-party suppliers, including single source suppliers, making us vulnerable to supply shortages and price fluctuations, which could harm our business. Our instruments and reagents contain components that are currently manufactured by a single supplier or a limited number of suppliers. In many of these cases, we and our third-party manufacturers have not yet engaged alternate suppliers and rely upon purchase orders, rather than long-term supply agreements. A supply interruption or an increase in demand beyond our current suppliers capabilities could harm our ability to manufacture our systems unless and until new sources of supply are identified and qualified. Our reliance on these suppliers subjects us to a number of risks that could harm our business, including: interruption of supply resulting from modifications to or discontinuation of a supplier s operations; trade disputes or other political or economic conditions, including any global macroeconomic impact resulting from the Russia-Ukraine conflict; interruption of or insufficient supply resulting from labor strikes, work stoppages, infectious disease, epidemics or pandemics, political or regulatory prohibition, unrest, acts of terrorism or other interruptions in production and transportation systems; delays in product shipments resulting from uncorrected defects, reliability issues, or a supplier s variation in a component; a lack of long-term supply arrangements for key components with our suppliers; inability to obtain adequate supply in a timely manner, or to obtain adequate supply on commercially reasonable terms; difficulty and cost associated with locating and qualifying alternative suppliers for our components in a timely manner; a modification or change in a manufacturing process or part that unknowingly or unintentionally negatively impacts the operation of our systems; 
 38 

Table of Contents 
 production delays related to the evaluation and testing of products from alternative suppliers, and corresponding regulatory qualifications; delay in delivery due to our suppliers prioritizing other customer orders over ours; damage to our brand reputation caused by defective components produced by our suppliers; increased cost of our warranty program due to product repair or replacement based upon defects in components produced by our suppliers; and fluctuation in delivery by our suppliers due to changes in demand from us or their other customers. 
 Any interruption in the supply of components or materials, or our inability to obtain substitute components or materials from alternate sources at acceptable prices in a timely manner, could impair our ability to meet the demand of our customers, which would have an adverse effect on our business. We outsource the manufacturing of our instruments and reagents to third-party manufacturers. The failure of these manufacturers to manufacture finished goods on a timely basis could adversely affect our business. We have engaged with three different third parties to manufacture our instruments and reagents. One such third-party manufacturer manufactures PhenoCycler instruments, a second manufactures PhenoImager instruments, and the other third-party manufactures our reagent kits. In addition, the third parties we rely on source certain key parts of our instruments from other various parties. We do not have any control over the process or timing of the acquisition or manufacture of materials by our third-party manufacturers, and cannot ensure that they will deliver to us the finished goods we order on time, or at all. If the operations of our third-party manufacturers are interrupted, cease, or if they are unable to meet our delivery requirements due to capacity limitations or other constraints, we may be limited in our ability to fulfill new customer orders or to service or repair instruments at current customer sites. Any change to another contract manufacturer, even if ultimately consummated, would likely entail significant delay, require us to devote substantial time and resources, result in additional costs, and could involve a period in which our systems could not be produced in a timely or consistently high-quality manner, any of which could harm our reputation and business, and frustrate our customers and cause them to turn to our competitors. Additionally, we may be unable to enter into agreements with another contract manufacturer on commercially reasonable terms or at all, which could have a material adverse impact on our business. We forecast sales to determine requirements for components and materials used in our systems, and if our forecasts are incorrect, we may experience delays in shipments or increased inventory costs. We and our third-party manufacturers keep limited materials, components and finished products on hand. To manage our operations with our third-party manufacturers and suppliers, we forecast anticipated product orders and material requirements to predict our inventory needs and enter into purchase orders on the basis of these requirements. Several components of our instruments and reagent kits have long lead times. Our limited historical commercial experience and rapid growth may not provide us with enough data to consistently and accurately predict future demand. If our business expands and our demand for components and materials increase beyond our estimates, our manufacturers and suppliers may be unable to meet our demand. In addition, if we or our third-party manufacturers underestimate our component and material requirements, we may have inadequate inventory, which could interrupt, delay, or prevent delivery of our systems to our customers. By contrast, if we overestimate our component and material requirements, we may have excess inventory, which would increase our working capital and decrease our cash. Any of these occurrences would negatively affect our financial performance and business results.

 Risks Related to Government Regulation We market certain of our products as Research Use Only, or RUO, in the United States. Our RUO products support the research and development conducted at institutions and biopharmaceutical companies of potential diagnostic and therapeutic products and services for which they may later pursue investigation and clearance, authorization or approval from regulatory authorities, such as the FDA. RUO products belong to a separate regulatory classification under a long-standing FDA regulation. From an FDA perspective, products that are intended for research use only and are labeled as RUO are not regulated by the FDA as in vitro diagnostic devices for clinical use, and are therefore not subject to those specific regulatory requirements. RUO products may be used or distributed for research use without first obtaining FDA clearance, authorization or approval. The products must bear the statement: For Research Use Only. Not for Use in Diagnostic Procedures. RUO products cannot make any claims related to safety, effectiveness or diagnostic utility, and they cannot be intended for human clinical diagnostic use. Accordingly, a product labeled RUO but intended or promoted for clinical diagnostic use may be viewed by the FDA as adulterated and misbranded under the FDCA and subject to FDA enforcement action. The FDA will consider the totality of the circumstances surrounding distribution and use of an RUO product, including how the product is marketed and to whom, when determining its intended use. If the FDA disagrees with our RUO status for our product, we may be subject to FDA enforcement activities, including, without limitation, requiring us to seek clearance, authorization or approval for our products. We are currently subject to, and may in the future become subject to additional, U.S. state and federal, and non-U.S. laws and regulations, industry guidelines, and contracts, imposing obligations on how we collect, store, use and process personal information. Our actual or perceived failure to comply with such obligations could harm our business. Ensuring compliance with such laws could also impair our efforts to maintain and expand our customer base, and thereby decrease our revenue. We are, and may increasingly become, subject to various laws and regulations, as well as contractual obligations and mandatory industry standards relating to data privacy and security in the jurisdictions in which we operate. The regulatory environment related to data privacy and security is increasingly rigorous, with new and constantly changing requirements applicable to our business, and enforcement practices are likely to remain uncertain for the foreseeable future. These laws and regulations may be interpreted and applied differently over time and from jurisdiction to jurisdiction, and it is possible that they will be interpreted and applied in ways that may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects. We are not a business associate under the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996, or HIPAA, and do not receive, access, store, or transmit any individually identifiable health information of any patient; however, we are a covered entity under HIPAA as an employer that sponsors a group health plan for its employees. Therefore, the HIPAA Privacy, Security and Breach Notification Rules apply to our group health plan. We have appointed a HIPAA Privacy Officer and HIPAA Security Officer, train our group health plan employees on HIPAA compliance and ensure that individuals outside of the group health plan functions do not have access to protected health information of our employees. We have also entered into a business associate agreement with our third-party administrator to handle medical claims for our group health plan. The HIPAA privacy regulations govern the use and disclosure of protected health information by covered healthcare providers, as well as health insurance plans. They also set forth certain rights that an individual has with respect to his or her protected health information maintained by a covered plan, including the right to access or amend certain records containing protected health information or to request restrictions on the use or disclosure of protected health information. The HIPAA security regulations establish requirements for safeguarding the confidentiality, integrity and availability of protected health information that is electronically transmitted or electronically stored. A covered entity must also notify HHS and each affected individual of a breach of unsecured protected health information as well as the media if the breach involves more than 500 individuals in a particular jurisdiction. HIPAA violations are subject to civil and criminal penalties. Despite the fact that we do not currently access, store, receive or transmit any protected health information on behalf of a covered entity which could qualify us as a business associate under HIPAA, from time to time we are asked by a customer to enter into a business associate agreement. To date, we have not entered into any business associate 
 40 

Table of Contents 
 agreements and do not intend to do so as a standard practice. The HIPAA Security Rule regulations establish requirements for safeguarding the confidentiality, integrity and availability of protected health information that is electronically transmitted or electronically stored or electronically stored by a business associate. Under the HIPAA Breach Notification Rule, a business associate must notify a covered entity, within certain required timeframes, of any breach of the security of an individual s protected health information by the business associate or any subcontractor of the business associate. In the United States, in addition to HIPAA, various federal and state regulators, including governmental agencies like the Federal Trade Commission, or the FTC, have adopted, or are considering adopting, laws and regulations concerning personal information and data security. According to the FTC, failing to take appropriate steps to keep consumers personal information secure or using or disclosing personal information in violation of a company s privacy notice may constitute unfair or deceptive acts or practices in or affecting commerce in violation of the Federal Trade Commission Act FTCA ). The FTC expects a company s data security measures to be reasonable and appropriate in light of the sensitivity and volume of consumer information it holds, the size and complexity of its business and the cost of available tools to improve security and reduce vulnerabilities. We may also become subject to additional data privacy and security laws and regulations in the future, and we anticipate that states and potentially, the federal government, may propose or enact legislation to strengthen data privacy and security standards, which may cause us to incur additional costs and expenses to maintain compliance and could subject us to fines, penalties and negative publicity in the event of a breach or violation under any such law or regulation. Certain state laws may be more stringent or broader in scope, or offer greater individual rights, with respect to personal information than federal, international or other state laws, and such laws may differ from each other, all of which may complicate compliance efforts. For example, the California Consumer Privacy Act of 2018, or CCPA, which increases privacy rights for California residents and imposes obligations on companies that process their personal information and meet certain revenue or volume processing thresholds, came into effect on January 1, 2020, and was further amended by the California Privacy Rights Act, or CPRA, on November 3, 2020. Among other things, the CCPA requires covered companies to provide new disclosures to California residents and provide such residents new data protection and privacy rights, including the ability to opt -out of certain sales of personal information. The CCPA provides for civil penalties for violations, as well as a private right of action for certain data breaches. The CPRA significantly modifies the CCPA by expanding residents rights with respect to certain personal information and creates a new state agency to oversee implementation and enforcement efforts. Many of the CPRA s provisions will become effective on January 1, 2023. This private right of action may increase the likelihood of, and risks associated with, data breach litigation, including class -action litigation. In addition, laws in all 50 U.S. states require businesses to provide notice to individuals if certain of their personal information has been disclosed as a result of a qualifying data breach. State laws are changing rapidly and there is discussion in the U.S. Congress of a new comprehensive federal data privacy law to which we may likely become subject, if enacted. Internationally, laws, regulations and standards in many jurisdictions apply broadly to the collection, use, retention, security, disclosure, transfer, marketing and other processing of personal information. For example, the EU General Data Protection Regulation, or GDPR, which became effective in May 2018, greatly increased the European Commission s jurisdictional reach of its data privacy and security laws and introduced a broad array of requirements for handling personal data. EU member states are tasked under the GDPR to enact, and have enacted, certain implementing legislation that adds to and/or further interprets the GDPR requirements and potentially extends our obligations and potential liability for failing to meet such obligations. The GDPR, together with national legislation, regulations and guidelines of the EU member states governing the processing of personal data, impose strict obligations and restrictions on the ability to collect, use, retain, protect, disclose, transfer and otherwise process personal data. In particular, the GDPR includes requirements to establish a legal basis for processing, higher standards for obtaining consent from individuals to process their personal data, more robust disclosures to individuals, a strengthened individual data rights regime, requirements to implement safeguards to protect the security and confidentiality of personal data, data breach notification obligations to appropriate data protection authorities or individuals, limitations on retention and secondary use of information, increased requirements pertaining to health data and additional obligations when entities contract with third-party processors to process personal data. The GDPR allows for fines for certain violations of up to 4 of global annual revenue or 20 million, whichever is greater, and other administrative penalties. Following the withdrawal of the United Kingdom from the European Union, data privacy and security laws that are substantially similar to the GDPR are in effect in the United Kingdom, which carry similar risks and authorize similar fines for certain violations.

 Certain legal regimes outside of the United States, including in the United Kingdom and under the GDPR, prohibit the transfer of personal data to the United States unless certain measures are in place, including, for example, executing Standard Contractual Clauses, or historically, relying on the receiving entity s certification under the EU-US and/or Swiss-US Privacy Shield Frameworks, or the Privacy Shield Frameworks. The Privacy Shield Frameworks were invalidated, and the adequacy of Standard Contractual Clauses is now in question, following the Court of Justice of the European Union s July 2020 decision in the so-called Schrems II case (Data Protection Commissioner v. Facebook Ireland Limited, Maximillian Schrems (Case C-311/18)). Due to this evolving regulatory guidance, we are continuing to evaluate the validity of the data transfer mechanisms upon which we rely and we may need to invest in additional technical, legal and organizational safeguards in the future to avoid disruptions to data flows within our business and to and from our customers and service providers. There is no guarantee that any transfer mechanism upon which we rely will be deemed to be valid by the relevant legal authorities, or that mechanisms that are currently deemed to be valid will remain valid in the future. This uncertainty, and its eventual resolution, may increase our costs of compliance, impede our ability to transfer data and conduct our business and harm our business or results of operations. We use third-party credit card processors to process payments from our customers. Through our agreements with our third-party credit card processors, we are subject to payment card association operating rules, including the Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard, or PCI-DSS, which governs a variety of areas, including how consumers and customers may use their cards, the security features of cards, security standards for processing, data security and allocation of liability for certain acts or omissions, including liability in the event of a data breach. Any change in these rules or standards and related requirements could make it difficult or impossible for us to comply. Additionally, any data breach or failure to hold certain information in accordance with PCI-DSS may have an adverse effect on our business and results of operations. All of these evolving compliance and operational requirements impose significant costs, such as costs related to organizational changes, implementing additional protection technologies, training employees and engaging consultants and legal advisors, which are likely to increase over time. In addition, such requirements may require us to modify our data processing practices and policies, utilize management s time or divert resources from other initiatives and projects, all of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects. Any failure or perceived failure by us to comply with any applicable federal, state or similar non-U.S. laws and regulations relating to data privacy and security could result in damage to our reputation, as well as proceedings or litigation by governmental agencies or other third parties, including class action privacy litigation in certain jurisdictions, which would subject us to significant fines, sanctions, awards, injunctions, penalties or judgments. Any of the foregoing could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects. As we continue to expand our product and technology offerings and the applications and uses of our products into new fields, we may become subject to government regulation, and the regulatory approval and maintenance process for such products may be expensive, time-consuming and uncertain both in timing and in outcome. As we continue to expand our product and technology offerings and the applications and uses of our existing products into new fields, certain of our current or future products could become subject to regulation by the FDA, or comparable regulatory authorities, including requirements for regulatory clearance or approval of such products before they can be marketed. Such regulatory approval processes or clearances may be expensive, time-consuming and uncertain, and our failure to obtain or comply with such approvals and clearances could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and operating results. The laws, regulations and policies governing the marketing of our products or future products, for example, RUO products, companion diagnostics, or other products and services are extremely complex and in many instances there may be no significant regulatory or judicial interpretations of these laws and regulations. These laws and regulations are subject to interpretation by the relevant regulatory and enforcement officials, and they may interpret them differently than we do. Furthermore, changes to the current regulatory framework, including the imposition of additional or new regulations, including regulation of our products, could arise at any time during the development or marketing of our products, which may negatively affect our ability to obtain or maintain FDA or comparable regulatory approval of our products, if required. Further, if we sell devices for diagnostic purposes, we may in turn be subject to additional healthcare regulation and enforcement by the applicable government agencies. Such laws and regulations include, without limitation, state and federal anti-kickback, fraud and abuse, false claims, data 
 42 

Table of Contents 
 privacy and security and transparency and reporting requirements for payments and transfers of value to physicians and certain other healthcare professionals. Diagnostic products are regulated as medical devices by the FDA and comparable international agencies and may require either clearance from the FDA following the 510(k) pre-market notification process or pre-market approval from the FDA, in each case prior to marketing. Obtaining the requisite regulatory clearances or approvals can be expensive and may involve considerable delay in our ability to commercialize our products. For example, we may in the future assist in the development of, or perform clinical testing relative to, companion diagnostics which would subject us to much more extensive regulation under FDA law, CMS/CLIA regulations and state laboratory requirements. None of our products are currently offered to customers as medical devices, however, if our products labeled as RUO are used, or could be used, for the diagnosis of disease, the regulatory requirements related to marketing, selling and supporting such products could change or be uncertain, even if such use by our customers is without our consent. If the FDA or other regulatory authorities assert that any of our products are subject to regulatory clearance or approval, our business, financial condition or results of operations could be adversely affected. International expansion of our business exposes us to business, regulatory, political, operational, financial and economic risks associated with doing business outside of the United States. We currently have limited international operations, and our business strategy incorporates potentially significant international expansion. We currently maintain relationships with distributors outside of the United States, and may in the future enter into new distributor relationships. We may also extend laboratory capabilities outside of the United States, both directly and possibly indirectly. Doing business internationally involves a number of risks, including: multiple, conflicting and changing laws and regulations such as data privacy and security regulations, tax laws, export and import restrictions, tariffs, economic sanctions and embargoes, employment laws, regulatory requirements and other governmental approvals, permits and licenses; failure by us or our distributors to obtain approvals to conduct our business in various countries; differing respect, and protection for, intellectual property rights in other jurisdictions; complexities and difficulties in obtaining intellectual property protection, maintaining, enforcing and defending our intellectual property and proprietary rights and defending against third-party intellectual property claims; difficulties in staffing and managing foreign operations; logistics and regulations associated with shipping systems and parts and components for systems, consumables and reagent kits, as well as transportation delays; travel restrictions that limit the ability of marketing, presales, sales, services and support teams to service customers; financial risks, such as longer payment cycles, difficulty collecting accounts receivable, the impact of local and regional financial crises on demand and payment for our products and exposure to foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations; international trade disputes that could result in tariffs and other protective measures; natural disasters, political and economic instability, including wars, terrorism and political unrest, outbreak of disease, boycotts, curtailment of trade and other business restrictions; and

Table of Contents 
 regulatory and compliance risks that relate to maintaining accurate information and control over sales and distributors activities that may fall within the purview of the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, or FCPA, its books and records provisions, or its anti-bribery provisions. 
 Any of these factors could significantly harm our future international expansion and operations and, consequently, our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects. In addition, certain international markets are subject to significant political and economic uncertainty, including for example the effect of the withdrawal of the United Kingdom from the European Union. Significant political and economic developments in international markets for which we intend to operate, or the perception that any of them could occur, creates further challenges for operating in these markets in addition to creating instability in global economic conditions. We could be adversely affected by violations of the FCPA and the anti-bribery and anti-corruption laws of the United States or other countries. We are subject to the FCPA, which among other things prohibits companies and their intermediaries from making payments in violation of law to non- U.S. government officials for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business or securing any other improper advantage. We have engaged independent distributors in the past and currently use independent distributors to sell our platforms and instruments outside of the United States. Our reliance on independent distributors to sell the PhenoCycler and PhenoImager platforms internationally demands a high degree of vigilance in maintaining our policy against participation in corrupt activity, because these distributors could be deemed to be our agents and we could be held responsible for their actions. Other U.S. companies in the biotechnology and biopharmaceutical field have faced criminal penalties under the FCPA for allowing their agents to deviate from appropriate practices in doing business with these individuals. We are also subject to similar anti-bribery laws in the jurisdictions in which we operate, including the United Kingdom s Bribery Act of 2010, which also prohibits commercial bribery and makes it a crime for companies to fail to prevent bribery, and the People s Republic of China anti -bribery laws, including the PRC Anti-Unfair Competition Law amended in 2017, the PRC Criminal Law amended in 2017. These laws are complex and far-reaching in nature, and, as a result, we cannot assure you that we would not be required in the future to alter one or more of our practices to be in compliance with these laws or any changes in these laws or the interpretation thereof. Any violations of these laws, or allegations of such violations, could disrupt our operations, involve significant management distraction, involve significant costs and expenses, including legal fees and could result in a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects. We could also suffer severe penalties, including criminal and civil penalties, disgorgement and other remedial measures. Unfavorable U.S. or global economic conditions could adversely affect our business, financial condition or results of operations. Our results of operations could be adversely affected by general conditions in the global economy and financial markets. Changes in these economic conditions can arise suddenly, such as in the case of the recent rise in inflation. A rise in inflation could result in higher cost of goods sold and higher operating expenses. A severe or prolonged economic downturn, as result of a global pandemic or otherwise, could result in a variety of risks to our business, including weakened demand for our products and services and our ability to raise additional capital when needed. A weak or declining economy could strain our customers and suppliers, possibly resulting in supply disruption, or cause delays in their payments to us. Any of the foregoing could harm our business and we cannot anticipate all of the ways in which the current economic climate and financial market conditions could adversely impact our business. Our employees, consultants, distributors and commercial partners may engage in misconduct or other improper activities, including non-compliance with regulatory standards and requirements, and insider trading. We are exposed to the risk of fraud or other misconduct by our employees, consultants, distributors and commercial partners. Misconduct by these parties could include intentional failures to comply with the applicable laws and regulations in the United States and abroad, report financial information or data accurately or disclose unauthorized activities to us. These laws and regulations may restrict or prohibit a wide range of pricing, discounting and other business arrangements. Such misconduct could result in legal or regulatory sanctions and cause serious harm to our 
 44 

Table of Contents 
 reputation. It is not always possible to identify and deter employee misconduct, and any other precautions we take to detect and prevent this activity may not be effective in controlling unknown or unmanaged risks or losses, or in protecting us from governmental investigations or other actions or lawsuits stemming from a failure to comply with these laws or regulations. If any such actions are instituted against us, and we are not successful in defending ourselves or asserting our rights, those actions could result in the imposition of significant civil, criminal and administrative penalties, which could have a significant impact on our business. Whether or not we are successful in defending against such actions or investigations, we could incur substantial costs, including legal fees and divert the attention of management in defending ourselves against any of these claims or investigations. We use biological and hazardous materials that require considerable expertise and expense for handling, storage and disposal and may result in claims against us. We work with materials, including chemicals, biological agents and compounds that could be hazardous to human health and safety or the environment. Our operations also produce hazardous and biological waste products. Federal, state and local laws and regulations govern the use, generation, manufacture, storage, handling and disposal of these materials and wastes. We are subject to periodic inspections by federal, state and local authorities to ensure compliance with applicable laws. Compliance with applicable environmental laws and regulations is expensive, and current or future environmental laws and regulations may restrict our operations. If we do not comply with applicable regulations, we may be subject to fines and penalties. In addition, we cannot eliminate the risk of accidental injury or contamination from these materials or wastes, which could cause an interruption of our commercialization efforts, research and development programs and business operations, as well as environmental damage resulting in costly clean-up and liabilities under applicable laws and regulations. In the event of contamination or injury, we could be liable for damages or penalized with fines in an amount exceeding our resources and our operations could be suspended or otherwise adversely affected. Furthermore, environmental laws and regulations are complex, change frequently and have tended to become more stringent. We cannot predict the impact of such changes and cannot be certain of our future compliance. Risks Related to Intellectual Property If we are unable to obtain and maintain sufficient patent or other intellectual property protection for our technology, including the PhenoCycler and PhenoImager platforms, or if the scope of the intellectual property protection obtained is not sufficiently broad, our competitors could develop and commercialize products and technology similar or identical to ours, and our ability to successfully commercialize our products and our technology may be impaired. We rely on patent protection as well as trademark, copyright, trade secret and other intellectual property rights protection and contractual restrictions to protect our proprietary technologies, all of which provide limited protection and may not adequately protect our rights or permit us to gain or keep any competitive advantage. If we fail to obtain or to protect our intellectual and proprietary property, third parties may be able to compete more effectively against us. In addition, we may incur substantial litigation costs in our attempts to recover or restrict use of our intellectual property. To the extent our intellectual property offers inadequate protection, is found to be invalid or unenforceable, or laws affecting the scope of intellectual property protection and remedial actions change, we would be exposed to a greater risk of direct competition. If our intellectual property does not provide adequate coverage of our own or our competitors products, our competitive position could be adversely affected, as could our business. Both the patent application process and the process of managing patent disputes can be time-consuming and expensive. As is the case with other life sciences and biotechnology companies, our success depends in large part on our ability to obtain and maintain protection of the intellectual property we may own solely and jointly with others, particularly patents, in the United States and other countries with respect to our products and technologies. We apply for patents covering our products and technologies and uses thereof, as we deem appropriate. However, obtaining and enforcing patents in our industry is costly, time-consuming and complex, and we may fail to apply for patents on important products, services and technologies in a timely fashion or at all, or we may fail to apply for patents in potentially relevant jurisdictions. We may not be able to file and prosecute all necessary or desirable patent applications, or maintain, enforce 
 45 

Table of Contents 
 and license any patents that may issue from such patent applications, at a reasonable cost or in a timely manner. It is also possible that we will fail to identify patentable aspects of our research and development output before it is too late to obtain patent protection. We may not have the right to control the preparation, filing and prosecution of patent applications, to maintain the rights to patents licensed to or from third parties, or to control enforcement of licensed patent rights. Therefore, these patents and applications may not be prosecuted and enforced in a manner consistent with the best interests of our business. We may not be able to control the extent of auxiliary rights licensed to other parties by entities from whom we license patent rights, which may affect our ability to exclude other parties from markets and jurisdictions based on those licensed patent rights. It is possible that none of our pending patent applications will result in issued patents in a timely fashion or at all, and even if patents are granted, they may not provide a basis for intellectual property protection of commercially viable products or services, may not provide us with any competitive advantages, or may be challenged and invalidated by third parties. It is possible that others will design around our current or future patented technologies or that our patents and patent applications may be challenged at the United States Patent and Trademark Office, or USPTO, or in proceedings before the patent offices of other jurisdictions. We may not be successful in defending any such challenges made against our patents or patent applications. We may not be able to intervene or participate in any challenge to patent rights that are licensed by us from another party. Any successful third- party challenge to our patents could result in the unenforceability or invalidity of such patents, in whole or in part, and increased competition to our business. We may have to challenge the patents or patent applications of third parties. The outcome of patent litigation or other proceedings can be uncertain, and any attempt by us to enforce our patent rights against others or to challenge the patent rights of others may not be successful, or, if successful, may take substantial time and result in substantial cost, and may divert our efforts and attention from other aspects of our business. Furthermore, our patents may be subject to a reservation of rights by one or more third parties. For example, the research resulting in certain of our in-licensed patent rights and technology was funded in part by the U.S. government. As a result, the government may have certain rights, or march-in rights, to such patent rights and technology. When new technologies are developed with government funding, the government generally obtains certain rights in any resulting patents, including a non-exclusive license authorizing the government to use the invention for non-commercial purposes. These rights may permit the government to disclose our confidential information to third parties and to exercise march-in rights to use or allow third parties to use our licensed technology. The government can exercise its march-in rights if it determines that action is necessary because we fail to achieve practical application of the government-funded technology, because action is necessary to alleviate health or safety needs, to meet requirements of federal regulations, or to give preference to U.S. industry. In addition, our rights in such inventions may be subject to certain requirements to manufacture products embodying such inventions in the United States. The patent positions of life sciences companies can be highly uncertain and involve complex legal and factual questions for which important legal principles remain unresolved. No consistent policy regarding the breadth of claims allowed in such companies patents has emerged to date in the United States or elsewhere. Courts frequently render opinions in the biotechnology field that may affect the patentability of certain inventions or discoveries. Further, codified patent laws, legal principles, the scope of damages, and remedies for patent infringement can vary widely among jurisdictions, and our business may be affected differentially among those jurisdictions by any verdict, judgment, administrative proceeding, or other decision relating to enforcement of patent rights. Moreover, the coverage claimed in a patent application can be significantly reduced before the patent is issued, and its scope can be reinterpreted after issuance. Even if patent applications we license or own, currently or in the future, issue as patents, they may not issue in a form that will provide us with any meaningful protection, prevent competitors or other third parties from competing with us, or otherwise provide us with any competitive advantage. Any patents that we own may be challenged, narrowed, circumvented or invalidated by third parties. Consequently, we do not know whether our products or other technologies will be protectable or remain protected by valid and enforceable patents. Our competitors or other third parties may be able to circumvent our patents by developing similar or alternative technologies or products in a non-infringing manner which could harm our business, financial condition and results of operations. Some of our patents and patent applications may in the future be co -owned with third parties. If we are unable to obtain an exclusive license to any such third-party co-owners interest in such patents or patent applications, such co- 
 46 

Table of Contents 
 owners may be able to license their rights to other third parties, including our competitors, and our competitors could market competing products and technology. In addition, we may need the cooperation of any such co-owners of our patents in order to enforce such patents against third parties, and such cooperation may not be provided to us. Any of the foregoing could harm our business, financial condition and results of operations. Additionally, we may find it necessary or prudent to acquire or obtain licenses from third-party intellectual property holders. However, we may be unable to acquire or secure such licenses to any intellectual property rights from third parties that we identify as necessary for our products or any future products we may develop. The acquisition or licensing of third-party intellectual property rights is a competitive area, and our competitors may pursue strategies to acquire or license third-party intellectual property rights that we may consider attractive or necessary. Our competitors may have a competitive advantage over us due to their size, capital resources and greater development and commercialization capabilities. In addition, companies that perceive us to be a competitor may be unwilling to assign or license rights to us. We also may be unable to acquire or license third-party intellectual property rights on terms that would allow us to make an appropriate return on our investment or at all. Any of the foregoing could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects. We heavily depend on intellectual property licensed from third parties, including our license agreements with Stanford for our PhenoCycler product, PKI, Cambridge Research and VisEn Medical Inc. for our PhenoImager product, and our licensors may not always act in our best interest. If such owners do not properly or successfully obtain, maintain or enforce the patents underlying such licenses, or if they retain or license to others any competing rights, our competitive position and business prospects may be adversely affected. We are dependent on patents, know-how and proprietary technology licensed from others. As a result, any termination of these licenses could result in the loss of significant rights and could harm our ability to commercialize our product candidates. For example, we are a party to an agreement with Stanford pursuant to which we in-license key patents and patent applications for our proprietary PhenoCycler product, as well as possible future product candidates and other technology used in our PhenoCycler product. We are also a party to license agreements with the University of Washington; Caliper Life Sciences, Inc.; and PKI, Cambridge Research, and VisEn Medical Inc., pursuant to in which we have in-licensed important patents that protect key aspects of our current and future technologies. Our current license agreements impose, and future agreements may impose, various diligence, commercialization, milestone payment, royalty, insurance and other obligations on us and require us to meet development timelines, or to exercise commercially reasonable efforts to develop and commercialize licensed products, in order to maintain the licenses. If we fail to comply with these obligations, our licensors may have the right to terminate our license, in which event we would not be able to further develop or market our PhenoCycler product. For example, our license agreement with Stanford imposes various due diligence, development and commercialization obligations, milestone payments, royalties and other obligations on us. Certain of our licenses, including certain licenses with Stanford may not provide us with exclusive rights to use the licensed intellectual property and technology, or may not provide us with exclusive rights to use such intellectual property and technology in all relevant fields of use and in all territories in which we may wish to develop or commercialize our technology and product candidates in the future. In addition, the intellectual property portfolio licensed to us by our licensors, including certain intellectual property licensed by Stanford, at least in some respects, may be used by such licensors or licensed to third parties, and such third parties may have certain enforcement rights with respect to such intellectual property. Thus, patents licensed to us could be put at risk of being invalidated or interpreted narrowly in litigation filed by or against our licensors or another licensee or in administrative proceedings brought by or against our licensors or another licensee in response to such litigation or for other reasons. As a result, we may not be able to prevent competitors or other third parties from developing and commercializing competitive products, including in territories covered by our licenses. In addition, we may need or desire to obtain additional licenses from our existing licensors and others to advance our research or allow commercialization of product candidates we may develop. In addition, third parties may allege that we require a license to their intellectual property rights to use our software and technology in connection with the exploitation of our products. It is possible that we may be unable to obtain needed or desired additional licenses at a 
 47 

Table of Contents 
 reasonable cost or on reasonable terms, if at all. In such an event, we may be required to expend significant time and resources to redesign our technology, product candidates, or the methods for manufacturing them or to develop or license replacement technology, all of which may not be feasible on a technical or commercial basis. If we are unable to do so, we may be liable for damages, which may be significant, and we may be unable to develop or commercialize the affected technology or product candidates, or face greater risk in the development or commercialization of such technologies and product candidates, which would significantly harm our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects significantly. We cannot provide any assurances that third-party patents and other intellectual property rights do not exist which might be enforced against our current technology, manufacturing methods, product candidates, or future methods or products resulting in either an injunction prohibiting our manufacture or future sales, or, with respect to our future sales, an obligation on our part to pay royalties and/or other forms of compensation to third parties, which could be significant. Even if we are able to obtain such additional licenses, they may be non-exclusive thereby giving our competitors and other third parties access to the same technology licensed to us. In addition, we may seek to obtain additional licenses from our licensors and, in connection with obtaining such licenses, we may agree to amend our existing licenses in a manner that may be more favorable to the licensors, including by agreeing to terms that could enable third parties, including our competitors, to receive licenses to a portion of the intellectual property that is subject to our existing licenses and to compete with our product candidates. For example, some of our future agreements with certain of our third-party research partners may provide that improvements developed in the course of our relationship may be owned solely by either us or our third-party research partner. If we determine that rights to such improvements owned solely by a third-party research partner or other third-party with whom we collaborate are necessary to commercialize our products or maintain our competitive advantage, we may need to obtain a license from such third-party in order to use the improvements and continue developing, manufacturing or marketing our products. We may not be able to obtain such a license on an exclusive basis, on commercially reasonable terms, or at all, which could prevent us from commercializing our product candidates or allow our competitors or others the chance to access technology that is important to our business. Our success will depend in part on the ability of our licensors to obtain, maintain, protect and enforce patent protection for our licensed intellectual property, in particular, those patents to which we have secured exclusive rights. Our licensors may not successfully prosecute the patent applications licensed to us. If we or our licensors fail to adequately protect our licensed intellectual property, our ability to commercialize our product candidates and technology could suffer. In addition, we may not have the right to control the maintenance, prosecution, preparation, filing, enforcement, defense and litigation of patents and patent applications that we license from other third parties. For example, in each of our agreements with Stanford; the University of Washington; and PKI, Cambridge Research and VisEn Medical Inc., we do not maintain control over the prosecution and maintenance of the licensed patents. We thus cannot be certain that activities such as the maintenance and prosecution by our licensors have been or will be conducted consistent with our best interests or in compliance with applicable laws and regulations, or will result in valid and enforceable patents and other intellectual property rights. It is possible that our licensors infringement proceedings or defense activities may be less vigorous than had we conducted them ourselves or may not be conducted in accordance with our best interests. If our licensors fail to maintain such patents or patent applications, determine not to pursue litigation against other companies that are infringing these patents, pursue litigation less aggressively than we would, or lose rights to those patents or patent applications, the rights we have licensed may be reduced or eliminated, and our right to develop and commercialize any of our product candidates that are the subject of such licensed rights and our right to exclude third parties from commercializing competing products could be adversely affected. Any of the foregoing could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects. We are generally also subject to all of the same risks with respect to protection of intellectual property that we license as we are for intellectual property that we own, which are described herein. If we or our licensors fail to adequately protect this intellectual property, our ability to commercialize products could suffer, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects.

Table of Contents 
 Our products are dependent on intellectual property we license from third parties. If we fail to comply with our obligations under our intellectual property licenses, if the licenses are terminated, or if disputes regarding these licenses arise, we could lose significant rights that are important to our business and could interfere with our ability to operate our business. Our instruments incorporate intellectual property we license from Stanford, with respect to PhenoCycler, and PKI, Cambridge Research and VisEn Medical Inc., with respect to PhenoImager. Disputes may arise regarding intellectual property subject to a license agreement, including those relating to: the scope of rights, if any, granted under the license agreement and other interpretation-related issues; our financial and other obligations under the license agreement; whether and the extent to which our technology and processes infringe, misappropriate or otherwise violate intellectual property of the licensor that is not subject to the licensing agreement; our right to sublicense patent and other rights to third parties under collaborative development relationships; our diligence obligations with respect to the use of the licensed technology in relation to our development and commercialization of our product candidates and what activities satisfy those diligence obligations; the inventorship or ownership of inventions and know-how resulting from the creation or use of intellectual property by our licensors and us and our partners; and the priority of invention of patented technology. 
 If disputes over intellectual property that we have licensed prevent or impair our ability to maintain our current licensing arrangements on acceptable terms, we may be unable to successfully develop and commercialize the affected technology or product candidates. Our license agreements are, and future license agreements are likely to be, complex, and certain provisions in such agreements may be susceptible to multiple interpretations. The resolution of any contract interpretation disagreement that may arise could narrow what we believe to be the scope of our rights to the relevant intellectual property or technology, or increase what we believe to be our financial or other obligations under the relevant agreement, either of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects. In spite of our efforts, our current and future licensors might conclude that we have materially breached our obligations under our license agreements and might therefore terminate such license agreements, thereby removing or limiting our ability to develop and commercialize products and technology covered by these license agreements. If these in-licenses are terminated, or if the underlying patents fail to provide the intended exclusivity, competitors would have the freedom to seek regulatory approval of, and to market, products identical or competitive to ours and we may be required to cease our development and commercialization of certain of our product candidates. Moreover, if disputes over intellectual property that we license prevent or impair our ability to maintain other licensing arrangements on commercially acceptable terms, we may be unable to successfully develop and commercialize the affected technology or product candidates. In addition, certain of these license agreements may not be assignable by us without the consent of the respective licensor, which may have an adverse effect on our ability to engage in certain transactions. As a result, any termination of or disputes over our intellectual property licenses could result in the loss of our ability to develop and commercialize our product candidates, or we could lose other significant rights, experience significant delays in the development and commercialization of our product candidates, or incur liability for damages, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, and prospects. In addition, a third-party may in the future bring claims that our performance under our license agreements, including our sponsoring of clinical trials, interferes with such third-party s rights under its agreement with one of our

 licensors. If any such claim were successful, it may adversely affect our rights and ability to advance our product candidates as clinical candidates or subject us to liability for monetary damages, any of which would have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects. Changes in patent law and its interpretation in the United States and other jurisdictions could diminish the value of patents in general, thereby impairing our ability to protect our products and technologies. Changes in either the patent laws or in interpretations of patent laws in the United States or other countries or regions may diminish the value of our intellectual property. We cannot predict the breadth of claims that may be allowed or enforced in our patents or in third-party patents. We may not develop additional proprietary products, methods and technologies that are patentable. Assuming that other requirements for patentability are met, prior to March 16, 2013, in the United States, the first to invent the claimed invention was entitled to the patent, while outside the United States, the first to file a patent application was entitled to the patent. On or after March 16, 2013, under the Leahy-Smith America Invents Act, or the America Invents Act, enacted in September 2011, the United States transitioned to a first-inventor-to-file system in which, assuming that other requirements for patentability are met, the first inventor to file a patent application will be entitled to the patent on an invention regardless of whether a third-party was the first to invent the claimed invention. A third-party that files a patent application in the USPTO on or after March 16, 2013, but before us could therefore be awarded a patent covering an invention of ours even if we had made the invention before it was made by such third-party. This will require us to be cognizant of the time from invention to filing of a patent application. Since patent applications in the United States and most other countries are confidential for a period of time after filing or until issuance, we cannot be certain that we or our licensors were the first to either file any patent application related to our products or technologies or invent any of the inventions claimed in our or our licensors patents or patent applications. The America Invents Act also included a number of significant changes that affect the way patent applications are prosecuted and also may affect patent litigation. These include allowing third-party submission of prior art to the USPTO during patent prosecution and additional procedures to attack the validity of a patent by USPTO-administered post-grant proceedings, including post-grant review, inter partes review and derivation proceedings. Because of a lower evidentiary standard in USPTO proceedings compared to the evidentiary standard in United States federal courts necessary to invalidate a patent claim, a third-party could potentially provide evidence in a USPTO proceeding sufficient for the USPTO to hold a claim invalid even though the same evidence would be insufficient to invalidate the claim if first presented in a district court action. Accordingly, a third-party may attempt to use the USPTO procedures to invalidate our patent claims that would not have been invalidated if first challenged by the third-party as a defendant in a district court action. Therefore, the America Invents Act and its implementation have increased the uncertainties and costs surrounding the prosecution of our owned or in-licensed patent applications and the enforcement or defense of our owned or in-licensed issued patents. In addition, the patent position of companies in the biotechnology field is particularly uncertain. Various courts, including the United States Supreme Court, have rendered decisions that affect the scope of patentability of certain inventions or discoveries relating to biotechnology. These decisions state, among other things, that a patent claim that recites an abstract idea, natural phenomenon or law of nature (for example, the relationship between particular genetic variants and cancer) are not themselves patentable. Precisely what constitutes a law of nature or abstract idea is uncertain and continues to evolve in the courts, and it is possible that certain aspects of our technology could be considered natural laws. Accordingly, the evolving statutory and case law in the United States may adversely affect our ability to obtain patents and may facilitate third-party challenges to any owned or licensed patents. Any of the foregoing could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects. Issued patents covering our products and technologies could be found invalid or unenforceable if challenged or unenforceable if challenged in court or before administrative bodies in the United States or abroad, which could harm our business, financial condition and results of operations. The issuance of a patent is not conclusive as to its inventorship, scope, validity or enforceability. Our patents or patent applications (including licensed patents) may be challenged at the USPTO or foreign patent offices in opposition, 
 50

 derivation, reexamination, inter partes review, post-grant review, interference or other proceedings. Any successful third-party challenge to our patents could result in the unenforceability or invalidity of such patents, in whole or in part, which may lead to increased competition to our business, which could harm our business. In addition, in patent litigation in the United States, defendant counterclaims alleging invalidity or unenforceability are commonplace. Grounds for a validity challenge could be an alleged failure to meet any of several statutory requirements, including lack of novelty, obviousness or non-enablement. Grounds for an unenforceability assertion could be an allegation that someone connected with prosecution of the patent withheld relevant information from the USPTO, or made a misleading statement, during prosecution. The outcome following legal assertions of invalidity and unenforceability during patent litigation is unpredictable. If a defendant were to prevail on a legal assertion of invalidity or unenforceability, we would lose at least part, and perhaps all, of the patent protection on certain aspects of our products and platform technologies. In addition, if the breadth or strength of protection provided by our patents and patent applications is threatened, regardless of the outcome, it could dissuade companies from collaborating with us to license, develop or commercialize current or future products. We may not be aware of all third-party intellectual property rights potentially relating to our products. Publications of discoveries in the scientific literature often lag behind the actual discoveries, and patent applications in the United States and other jurisdictions are typically not published until approximately 18 months after filing or, in some cases, not until such patent applications issue as patents. We might not have been the first to make the inventions covered by each of our pending patent applications and we might not have been the first to file patent applications for these inventions. To determine the priority of these inventions, we may have to participate in interference proceedings, derivation proceedings or other post-grant proceedings declared by the USPTO or foreign patent offices that could result in substantial cost to us. The outcome of such proceedings is uncertain. No assurance can be given that third-party patent applications will not have priority over our patent applications. In addition, changes to the patent laws of the United States allow for various post-grant opposition proceedings that have not been extensively tested, and their outcome is therefore uncertain. Furthermore, if third parties bring these proceedings against our patents, we could experience significant costs and management distraction. In addition, if we initiate legal proceedings against a third-party to enforce a patent covering our products, the defendant could counterclaim that such patent is invalid or unenforceable. In patent litigation in the United States, defendant counterclaims alleging invalidity or unenforceability are commonplace. Grounds for a validity challenge could be an alleged failure to meet any of several statutory requirements, including lack of novelty, obviousness or non-enablement. Grounds for an unenforceability assertion could be an allegation that someone connected with prosecution of the patent withheld relevant information from the USPTO or made a misleading statement during prosecution. Defenses of these types of claims, regardless of their merit, would involve substantial litigation expense and would be a substantial diversion of employee resources from our business. Third parties may also raise claims challenging the validity or enforceability of our patents before administrative bodies in the United States or abroad, even outside the context of litigation, including through re-examination, post-grant review, inter partes review, interference proceedings, derivation proceedings and equivalent proceedings in foreign jurisdictions (such as opposition proceedings). Such proceedings could result in the revocation of, cancellation of or amendment to our patents in such a way that they no longer cover our products or technologies. The outcome for any particular patent following legal assertions of invalidity and unenforceability is unpredictable. With respect to the validity question, for example, we cannot be certain that there is no invalidating prior art, of which we and the patent examiner were unaware during prosecution. If a defendant or other third-party were to prevail on a legal assertion of invalidity or unenforceability, we would lose at least part, and perhaps all, of the patent protection on our products and technology. Any of the foregoing could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects. Our rights to develop and commercialize our products and technologies are subject, in part, to the terms and conditions of licenses granted to us by others. We have in-licensed certain intellectual property rights from third parties, including Stanford and the University of Washington, with respect to our PhenoCycler platform, and PKI, Cambridge Research and VisEn Medical Inc. with respect to our PhenoImager platform, and we may license intellectual property rights from others in the future. See Business Licenses for more information regarding such agreements. If, for any reason, our license agreements are terminated or we otherwise lose the rights associated with such licenses, it could adversely affect our business. Our 
 51 

Table of Contents 
 current and any future license agreements may impose various development, commercialization, funding, diligence, sublicensing, insurance, patent prosecution and enforcement or other obligations on us, as well as milestone, royalty, annual maintenance and other payment obligations. If we breach any material obligations, or use the intellectual property licensed to us in an unauthorized manner, or if, in spite of our efforts, a collaborator or licensor concludes that we have materially breached our obligations under such agreement, we may be required to pay damages and the licensor may have the right to terminate the license, which could result in us being unable to develop, manufacture and commercialize products that are covered by the licensed technology or having to negotiate new or reinstated licenses on less favorable terms, or enable a competitor or other third-party to gain access to the licensed technology. Licensing of intellectual property is of high importance to our business and involves complex legal, business and scientific issues. Disputes may arise between us and our licensors regarding intellectual property subject to a license agreement, including: the scope of rights granted under the license agreement and other interpretation-related issues; our compliance with reporting and financial obligations under our license agreements; whether and the extent to which our products and technologies infringe on, misappropriate or otherwise violate intellectual property of the licensor that is not subject to the license agreement; our right to sublicense the applicable intellectual or proprietary rights to third parties; our diligence obligations with respect to the use of the licensed technology in relation to our development and commercialization of our products and technologies, and what activities satisfy those diligence obligations; our right to transfer or assign the license; the inventorship and/or ownership of patents, inventions, know-how and other intellectual property and proprietary rights resulting from activities performed by our licensors, us and our partners; and the priority of invention of patented technology. 
 These agreements may be complex, and certain provisions in such agreements may be susceptible to multiple interpretations. The resolution of any contract interpretation disagreement that may arise could narrow what we believe to be the scope of our rights to the relevant intellectual property or technology, or increase what we believe to be our financial or other obligations under the relevant agreement. Moreover, if disputes over intellectual property that we have licensed prevent or impair our ability to maintain our licensing arrangements on acceptable terms, we may not be able to successfully develop and commercialize the affected product candidates. In addition, certain of our agreements may limit or delay our ability to consummate certain transactions, may impact the value of those transactions, or may limit our ability to pursue certain activities. Any of the foregoing could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects. If we cannot acquire or license rights to use technologies on reasonable terms or at all, we may not be able to commercialize our current or any future products or technologies. In the future, we may identify third-party intellectual property and technology we may need to license in order to engage in our business, including to develop or commercialize new products or technologies, and the growth of our business may depend in part on our ability to acquire, in-license or use this technology. However, such licenses may not be available to us on acceptable terms or at all. The licensing or acquisition of third-party intellectual property rights is a competitive area, and several more established companies may pursue strategies to license or acquire third -party intellectual property rights that we may consider attractive or necessary. These established companies may have a competitive advantage over us due to their size, capital resources and greater development or commercialization capabilities. In addition, companies that perceive us to be a competitor may be unwilling to assign or license rights to us. 
 52 

Table of Contents 
 Even if such licenses are available, we may be required to pay the licensor in return for the use of such licensor s technology, including lump-sum payments, ongoing maintenance fees, payments based on certain milestones such as development and regulatory events and sales volumes, or royalties based on sales of our platform. In addition, such licenses may be non-exclusive, which could give our competitors and other third parties access to the same intellectual property licensed to us. We may also need to acquire or negotiate licenses to patents or patent applications before or after introducing a commercial product. The acquisition and licensing of third-party patent and other intellectual property and proprietary rights is a competitive area, and other companies may also be pursuing strategies to acquire or license such rights that we may consider attractive. Our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects could be materially and adversely affected if we are unable to enter into necessary agreements on acceptable terms or at all, if any necessary licenses are subsequently terminated, if the licensors fail to abide by the terms of the licenses or fail to prevent infringement, misappropriation or other violation by third parties, or if the acquired or licensed patents or other rights are found to be invalid or unenforceable. Moreover, we could encounter delays in the introduction of products or services while we attempt to develop alternatives. Defense of any lawsuit or failure to obtain any of these licenses on favorable terms could prevent us from commercializing our current and any future products and technologies. Any of the foregoing could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects. We have limited foreign intellectual property rights and we may not be able to protect our intellectual property rights throughout the world, which could harm our business, financial condition and results of operations. We have limited intellectual property rights outside the United States. Filing, prosecuting and defending patents on our products, technologies, instruments and workflows in all countries throughout the world would be prohibitively expensive, and our intellectual property rights in some countries outside the United States can be less extensive than those in the United States. In addition, the laws of some foreign countries do not protect intellectual property rights to the same extent as the laws of the United States, and we may encounter difficulties in protecting and defending such rights in foreign jurisdictions. Consequently, we may not be able to prevent third parties from practicing our inventions in some or all countries outside the United States, or from selling or importing products made using our inventions in and into the United States or other jurisdictions. Competitors or other third parties may use our technologies in jurisdictions where we have not obtained patent protection to develop their own products and may also export infringing products to territories where we have patent protection, but enforcement is not as strong as in the United States. These products may compete with our products. Our patents or other intellectual property rights may not be effective or sufficient to prevent them from competing. In addition, certain countries have compulsory licensing laws under which a patent owner may be compelled to grant licenses to other parties. Furthermore, many countries limit the enforceability of patents against other parties, including government agencies or government contractors. In these countries, the patent owner may have limited remedies, which could materially diminish the value of any patents. Many companies have encountered significant problems in protecting and defending intellectual property rights in foreign jurisdictions. The legal systems of many other countries do not favor the enforcement of patents and other intellectual property and proprietary protection, particularly those relating to biotechnology, which could make it difficult for us to stop the infringement, misappropriation or other violation of our intellectual property rights including infringement of our patents in such countries. Proceedings to enforce our patent rights in foreign jurisdictions could result in substantial cost and divert our efforts and attention from other aspects of our business, could put our patents at risk of being invalidated or interpreted narrowly and our patent applications at risk of not issuing, and could provoke third parties to assert claims against us. We may not prevail in any lawsuits that we initiate, or that are initiated against us, and the damages or other remedies awarded, if any, may not be commercially meaningful. In addition, changes in the law and legal decisions by courts in the United States and foreign countries may affect our ability to obtain adequate protection for our products, services and other technologies and the enforcement of intellectual property. Accordingly, our efforts to enforce our intellectual property rights around the world may be inadequate to obtain a significant commercial advantage from the intellectual property that we develop or license. Many countries have compulsory licensing laws under which a patent owner may be compelled to grant licenses to third parties. In addition, many countries limit the enforceability of patents against government agencies or government contractors. In these countries, the patent owner may have limited remedies, which could materially diminish the value of such patent. If we are forced to grant a license to third parties with respect to any patents relevant to our business, our competitive position may be impaired, and our business, financial condition and results of operations may be harmed.

 If we are unable to protect the confidentiality of our trade secrets, the value of our technology could be materially adversely affected and our business could be harmed. We rely on trade secrets and confidentiality agreements to protect our unpatented know-how, technology and other proprietary information, including parts of our technology platforms, and to maintain our competitive position. However, trade secrets and know -how can be difficult to protect. In addition to pursuing patents on our technology, we seek to protect our intellectual property and proprietary technology by entering into agreements, including confidentiality agreements, non-disclosure agreements and intellectual property assignment agreements, with our employees, consultants, academic institutions, corporate partners and, when needed, our advisors. However, we cannot be certain that such agreements have been entered into with all relevant parties. We therefore cannot be certain that our trade secrets and other confidential proprietary information will not be disclosed or that competitors or other third parties will not otherwise gain access to our trade secrets or independently develop substantially equivalent information and techniques. For example, any of these parties may breach the agreements and disclose our proprietary information, including our trade secrets, and we may not be able to obtain adequate remedies for such breaches. Such agreements may not be enforceable or may not provide meaningful protection for our trade secrets or other proprietary information in the event of unauthorized use or disclosure or other breaches of the agreements, and we may not be able to prevent such unauthorized disclosure, which could adversely impact our ability to establish or maintain a competitive advantage in the market. If we are required to assert our rights against such party, it could result in significant cost and distraction. Depending upon the parties involved in such a breach, the available remedies may not provide adequate compensation for the value of any proprietary information disclosed to a third-party. Monitoring unauthorized disclosure is difficult, and we do not know whether the steps we have taken to prevent such disclosure are, or will be, adequate. If we were to attempt to enforce a claim that a third-party had illegally obtained and was using our trade secrets, it would be expensive and time -consuming, and the outcome would be unpredictable. In addition, the scope of protection for trade secrets outside the United States varies widely and may be significantly less than in the United States, and damages and other remedies available for improper disclosure of proprietary information can differ substantially from those in the United States, and in some jurisdictions may not be available at all. We also seek to preserve the integrity and confidentiality of our confidential proprietary information by maintaining physical security of our premises and physical and electronic security of our information technology systems, but it is possible that these security measures could be breached. If any of our confidential proprietary information were to be lawfully obtained or independently developed by a competitor or other third-party, absent patent protection, we would have no right to prevent such competitor from using that technology or information to compete with us, which could harm our competitive position. If any of our trade secrets were to be disclosed to or independently discovered by a competitor or other third-party, it could harm our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects. We may be subject to claims that our employees, consultants or independent contractors have wrongfully used or disclosed trade secrets or other confidential information of their former employers or other third parties or claims asserting ownership of what we regard as our own intellectual property. We have employed and expect to employ individuals who were previously employed at universities or other companies, including our competitors or potential competitors. Although we try to ensure that our employees, consultants, advisors and independent contractors do not use the proprietary information or know-how of others in their work for us, we may be subject to claims that our employees, advisors, consultants or independent contractors have deliberately, inadvertently or otherwise used or disclosed intellectual property, including trade secrets or other proprietary information of their former employers or other third parties, or to claims that we have improperly used or obtained such trade secrets. Litigation may be necessary to defend against these claims. If we fail in defending such claims, in addition to paying monetary damages, we may lose valuable intellectual property rights and face increased competition to our business. A loss of key research personnel work product could hamper or prevent our ability to commercialize potential products, which could harm our business. Even if we are successful in defending against these claims, litigation could result in substantial costs and be a distraction to management. In addition, while it is our policy to require our employees and contractors who may be involved in the conception or development of intellectual property to execute agreements assigning such intellectual property to us, we may be 
 54 

Table of Contents 
 unsuccessful in executing such an agreement with each party who, in fact, conceives or develops intellectual property that we regard as our own. The assignment of intellectual property rights may not be self-executing, or the assignment agreements may be breached, and we may be forced to bring claims against third parties, or defend claims that they may bring against us, to determine the ownership of what we regard as our intellectual property. Any of the foregoing could harm our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects. We may not be able to protect and enforce our trademarks and trade names, or build name recognition in our markets of interest thereby harming our competitive position. The registered or unregistered trademarks or trade names that we own may be challenged, infringed, circumvented, declared generic, lapsed or determined to be infringing on or dilutive of other marks. We may not be able to protect our rights in these trademarks and trade names, which we need in order to build name recognition. In addition, third parties have filed, and may in the future file, for registration of trademarks similar or identical to our trademarks, thereby impeding our ability to build brand identity and possibly leading to market confusion. If they succeed in registering or developing common law rights in such trademarks, and if we are not successful in challenging such rights, we may not be able to use these trademarks to develop brand recognition of our technologies, products or services. In addition, there could be potential trade name or trademark infringement claims brought by owners of other registered trademarks or trademarks that incorporate variations of our registered or unregistered trademarks or trade names. Further, we may in the future be required to enter into agreements with owners of such third-party trade names or trademarks to avoid potential trademark litigation which may limit our ability to use our trade names or trademarks in certain fields of business. We have not yet registered certain of our trademarks in all of our potential markets, although we have registered 13 trademarks in the United States as well as certain of our trademarks outside of the United States. If we apply to register these trademarks in other countries, and/or other trademarks in the United States and other countries, our applications may not be allowed for registration in a timely fashion or at all; and further, our registered trademarks may not be maintained or enforced. In addition, opposition or cancellation proceedings have been, or may in the future be, filed against our trademark applications and registrations, and our trademarks may not survive such proceedings. In addition, third parties may file first for our trademarks in certain countries. If they succeed in registering such trademarks, and if we are not successful in challenging such third-party rights, we may not be able to use these trademarks to market our products and technologies in those countries. If we do not secure registrations for our trademarks, we may encounter more difficulty in enforcing them against third parties than we otherwise would. If we are unable to establish name recognition based on our trademarks and trade names, we may not be able to compete effectively, which could harm our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects. Over the long-term, if we are unable to establish name recognition based on our trademarks, then our marketing abilities may be materially adversely impacted. We may be subject to claims challenging the ownership or inventorship of our patents and other intellectual property and, if unsuccessful in any of these proceedings, we may be required to obtain licenses from third parties, which may not be available on commercially reasonable terms, or at all, or to cease the development, manufacture and commercialization of one or more of our products. We or our licensors may be subject to claims that former employees, collaborators or other third parties have an interest in our owned or in-licensed patents, trade secrets or other intellectual property as an inventor or co-inventor. For example, we or our licensors may have inventorship disputes arise from conflicting obligations of employees, consultants or others who are involved in developing our products. Litigation may be necessary to defend against these and other claims challenging inventorship of our or our licensors owned or in-licensed patents, trade secrets or other intellectual property. If we fail in defending any such claims, in addition to paying monetary damages, we may lose valuable intellectual property rights, such as exclusive ownership of, or right to use, intellectual property that is important to our systems, including our software, workflows, consumables and reagent kits. If we or our licensors were to lose exclusive ownership of such intellectual property, other owners may be able to license their rights to other third parties, including our competitors. We also may be required to obtain and maintain licenses from third parties, including parties involved in any such disputes. Such licenses may not be available on commercially reasonable terms, or at all, or may be non-exclusive. If we are unable to obtain and maintain 
 55 

Table of Contents 
 such licenses, we may need to cease the development, manufacture and commercialization of one or more of our products. The loss of exclusivity or the narrowing of our patent claims could limit our ability to stop others from using or commercializing similar or identical technology and products. Even if we are successful in defending against such claims, litigation could result in substantial costs and be a distraction to management and other employees. Any of the foregoing could harm our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects. We may become involved in litigation related to intellectual property, which could be time-intensive and costly and may adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects, and may require us to pay damages, or prevent us from making our existing or future products. In recent years, there has been significant litigation in the United States involving intellectual property rights. Our commercial success depends in part upon our ability and that of our contract manufacturers and suppliers to manufacture, market, and sell our products and to use our proprietary technologies without infringing, misappropriating or otherwise violating the proprietary rights or intellectual property of third parties. We may in the future be involved in litigation or actions at the USPTO with various third parties that claim we or our partners or customers using our solutions and services have infringed, misappropriated, misused or otherwise violated other parties intellectual property rights. We expect that the number of such claims may increase as the number of our products, instruments, workflows, and the level of competition in our industry segments, grow. Any claim of infringement, misappropriation or other violation, regardless of its validity, could harm our business by, among other things, resulting in time-consuming and costly litigation, diverting management s time and attention from the development of the business, requiring the payment of monetary damages (including treble damages and attorneys fees in circumstances where infringement of patent rights is deemed to be willful) or royalty payments, or result in potential or existing customers delaying purchases of our products or entering into engagements with us pending resolution of the dispute. As we move into new markets and applications for our platforms, incumbent participants in such markets may assert their patents and other intellectual property and proprietary rights against us as a means of slowing our entry into such markets or as a means to extract substantial license and royalty payments from us. Our competitors and others may now and, in the future, have significantly larger and more mature patent portfolios than we currently have. In addition, future litigation may involve patent holding companies or other adverse patent owners who have no relevant product or service revenue and against whom our own patents may provide little or no deterrence or protection. Therefore, our commercial success may depend in part on our ability to avoid infringing, misappropriating or otherwise violating the patents or other intellectual property and proprietary rights of third parties, or our ability to prove the invalidity or unenforceability of such rights. Our research, development and commercialization activities may in the future be subject to claims that we infringe, misappropriate or otherwise violate patents or other intellectual property or proprietary rights owned or controlled by third parties. There is a substantial amount of patent challenges and other litigation involving intellectual property and proprietary rights, both within and outside the United States, in the biotechnology industry, including patent infringement lawsuits, interferences, inter partes review, ex parte review, and post-grant review proceedings before the USPTO and corresponding proceedings (such as oppositions) in foreign patent offices. Numerous U.S. and foreign issued patents and pending patent applications owned by third parties exist in the fields in which we are developing products. As the biotechnology industry expands and more patents are issued, the risk increases that our products may be subject to claims of infringement of the patent rights of third parties. Numerous significant intellectual property issues have been litigated, are being litigated and will likely continue to be litigated, between existing and new participants in our existing and targeted markets, and one or more third parties may assert that our products or services infringe, misappropriate or otherwise violate their intellectual property or proprietary rights as part of a business strategy to impede our successful entry into or growth in those markets. Third parties may assert that we are employing their proprietary technology without authorization. In addition, we may in the future receive correspondence from third parties referring to the relevance of such third parties intellectual property to our technology, our workflows or our advanced automated systems. Because patent applications can take many years to issue, there may be currently pending patent applications which may later result in issued patents that our current or future products and services may be accused of infringing. In 
 56 

Table of Contents 
 addition, we expect our competitors and other third parties may have patents or other intellectual property rights or may in the future obtain patents or other intellectual property rights and allege that making, having made, using, selling, offering to sell or importing our platforms, or the systems, workflows, consumables and reagent kits that comprise our platforms, infringe, misappropriate or otherwise violate these patents and other intellectual property rights. Pending patent applications that may or may not have been published can, subject to certain limitations, be later amended in a manner that may be alleged to cover our platforms, including our products, instruments and workflows. Future patent applications that are related to currently pending patent applications filed by third parties may also be alleged to cover our products, instruments and workflows. Under the applicable laws of various jurisdictions, the scope of a patent claim is determined by a variety of factors which can include, but are not limited to, an interpretation of statutes, decisions of courts of competent jurisdiction, the written disclosure in a patent, the patent s prosecution history, and an understanding of the scope of knowledge available to a person of ordinary skill in the particular art to which the patent claim pertains at the earliest effective priority date of the patent claim. These various factors can be weighed differently in different jurisdictions, and some may not be taken into account at all. Our interpretation of the meaning or the scope of one or more claims of an issued patent or a pending application may be incorrect, which may negatively impact our ability to market our products. We may incorrectly determine that our products are not covered by third-party patent claims or may incorrectly predict whether a third-party s pending application will issue with claims of relevant scope. Our determination of the expiration date of any patent in the United States or abroad that we consider relevant may be incorrect, which may negatively impact our ability to develop and market our products. In order to successfully challenge the validity of a U.S. patent in federal court, we would need to overcome a presumption of validity. As this burden is a high one requiring us to present clear and convincing evidence as to the invalidity of any such U.S. patent claim, there is no assurance that a court of competent jurisdiction would invalidate the claims of any such U.S. patent. Even if we believe third-party intellectual property claims are without merit, there can be no assurance that we will prevail in any suit initiated against us by third parties, successfully reach a settlement, or otherwise resolve patent or other intellectual property-related claims. Third parties making claims against us may be able to obtain injunctive or other relief, which could block our ability to develop, commercialize and sell products or services, import or export products, components, reagents and other articles, and could result in the award of substantial damages against us, including treble damages and attorney s fees if we are found to have willfully infringed a patent. In the event of a successful claim of infringement, misappropriation or other violation against us, we may be required to pay damages and ongoing royalties, and obtain one or more licenses from third parties, or be prohibited from selling certain products or services. We may not be able to obtain these licenses on acceptable or commercially reasonable terms, if at all, or these licenses may be non-exclusive, which could result in our competitors or other third parties gaining access to the same intellectual property. In addition, we could encounter delays and incur significant costs in product or service introductions while we attempt to develop alternative products or services or redesign our products or services in order to avoid infringing, misappropriating or otherwise violating third-party patents or other intellectual property and proprietary rights. Defense of any lawsuit or failure to obtain any of these licenses or to develop a workaround could prevent us from commercializing our products and technologies, and the prohibition of sale or the threat of the prohibition of sale of any of our products or technologies could materially affect our business and our ability to gain market acceptance for our products and technologies. In addition, our agreements with some of our customers, suppliers or other entities with whom we do business require us to defend or indemnify these parties to the extent they become involved in infringement claims, including the types of claims described above. We could also voluntarily agree to defend or indemnify third parties in instances where we are not obligated to do so if we determine it would be important to our business relationships. If we are required or agree to defend or indemnify third parties in connection with any infringement claims, we could incur significant costs and expenses. Any of the foregoing could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects.

 Intellectual property litigation could cause us to spend substantial resources, distract our personnel from their normal responsibilities and result in negative publicity and other harms. Litigation or other legal proceedings relating to intellectual property claims, even if resolved in our favor, may cause us to incur substantial costs and divert the attention of our management and technical personnel from their normal responsibilities in defending against any of these claims. Parties making claims against us may be able to sustain the costs of complex patent litigation more effectively than we can because they have substantially greater resources. Such litigation or proceedings could substantially increase our operating costs and reduce the resources available for development activities or any future sales, marketing, or distribution activities. We may not have sufficient financial or other resources to conduct such litigation or proceedings adequately. Some of our competitors may be able to sustain the costs of such litigation or proceedings more effectively than we can because of their greater financial resources and more mature and developed intellectual property portfolios. Uncertainties resulting from the initiation and continuation of intellectual property proceedings could harm our ability to compete in the marketplace. In addition, because of the substantial amount of discovery required in connection with intellectual property litigation, there is a risk that some of our confidential information could be compromised by disclosure during this type of litigation. There also could be public announcements of the results of hearings, motions, or other interim proceedings or developments, and if securities analysts or investors perceive these results to be negative, it could have a substantial adverse effect on the price of our common stock. Any of the foregoing could harm our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects. We may become involved in lawsuits to protect or enforce our intellectual property, which could be expensive, time-consuming and unsuccessful. Third parties, including our competitors, could infringe, misappropriate or otherwise violate our intellectual property and proprietary rights. Monitoring unauthorized use of our intellectual property is difficult and costly. From time to time, we seek to analyze our competitors products and services, and may in the future seek to enforce our rights against potential infringement, misappropriation or violation of our intellectual property. However, the steps we have taken to protect our proprietary rights may not be adequate to enforce our rights as against such infringement, misappropriation or other violation of our intellectual property. We may not be able to detect unauthorized use of, or take appropriate steps to enforce, our intellectual property rights. Any inability to meaningfully enforce our intellectual property rights could harm our ability to compete and reduce demand for our products and services. Litigation may be necessary for us to enforce our patent and other proprietary rights or to determine the scope, coverage and validity of the proprietary rights of others. We are not currently engaged in any lawsuits based upon allegations of infringement, misappropriation or other violation of intellectual property or proprietary rights. If we become engaged in litigation related to intellectual property rights and we do not prevail in such legal proceedings, we may be required to pay damages and we may lose significant intellectual property protection for our products or services, such that competitors could copy our products or services. Any litigation that may be necessary in the future could result in substantial costs and diversion of resources and could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects. In any lawsuit we bring to enforce our intellectual property rights, a court may refuse to the stop the other party from using the technology at issue on grounds that our intellectual property rights do not cover the technology in question. Further, in such proceedings, the defendant could counterclaim that our intellectual property is invalid or unenforceable and the court may agree, in which case we could lose valuable intellectual property rights. The outcome in any such lawsuits are unpredictable. Even if we do prevail in any future litigation related to intellectual property rights, the cost and time requirements of the litigation could negatively impact our financial results. Obtaining and maintaining our patent protection depends on compliance with various required procedures, document submissions, fee payments and other requirements imposed by governmental patent agencies, and our patent protection could be reduced or eliminated for non-compliance with these requirements. Periodic maintenance fees, renewal fees, annuity fees and various other governmental fees on patents and/or applications will be due to be paid to the USPTO and various governmental patent agencies outside of the United States at several stages over the lifetime of our patents and/or applications. We have systems in place to remind us to pay these fees, and we engage an outside service and rely on our outside counsel to pay these fees due to non-U.S. patent agencies.

 The USPTO and various non-U.S. governmental patent agencies also require compliance with a number of procedural, documentary and other similar provisions during the patent application process. We employ reputable law firms and other professionals to help us comply, but we also may be dependent on our licensors to take the necessary action to comply with these requirements with respect to our licensed intellectual property. In many cases, an inadvertent lapse can be cured by payment of a late fee or by other means in accordance with the applicable rules. However, there are situations in which non-compliance can result in abandonment or lapse of the patent or patent application, resulting in partial or complete loss of patent rights in the relevant jurisdiction. In such an event, our competitors and other third parties may be able to enter the market without infringing our patents, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects. Patent terms may be inadequate to protect our competitive position on our products for an adequate amount of time. Patents have a limited lifespan. In the United States, if all maintenance fees are timely paid, the natural expiration of a patent is generally 20 years from its earliest claimed priority date. Modifications to this lifetime may occur, but the life of a patent, and the protection it affords, is limited. Even if patents covering our products are obtained, once the patent term has expired, we may be open to competition from competitive products. If one of our products requires extended development, testing and/or regulatory review, patents protecting such products might expire before or shortly after such products are commercialized. As a result, our owned and licensed patent portfolio may not provide us with sufficient rights to exclude others from commercializing products similar or identical to ours within a commercially meaningful window. Our use of open source software could adversely affect our ability to offer our products and technologies and subject us to possible litigation. We use open source software in connection with our products and technologies. Companies that incorporate open source software into their technologies have, from time to time, faced claims challenging the use of open source software and/or compliance with open source license terms. As a result, we could be subject to suits by parties claiming ownership of what we believe to be open source software or claiming non-compliance with open source licensing terms. Some open source software licenses require users who distribute software containing open source software to publicly disclose all or part of the source code to such software and/or make available any derivative works of the open source code, which could include valuable proprietary code of the user, on unfavorable terms or at no cost. While we monitor our use of open source software and try to ensure that none is used in a manner that would require us to disclose our internally developed source code or that would otherwise breach the terms of an open source agreement, such use could inadvertently occur, in part because open source license terms are often ambiguous. In addition to risks related to license requirements, use of certain open source software can lead to greater risks than use of third-party commercial software, as open source licensors generally do not provide warranties or controls on the origin of software which, thus, may contain security vulnerabilities or infringing or broken code. Any requirement to publicly disclose our internally developed source code or pay damages for breach of contract could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects and could help our competitors develop products and technologies that are similar to or better than ours. Intellectual property rights do not necessarily address all potential threats. The degree of future protection afforded by our intellectual property rights is uncertain because intellectual property rights have limitations and may not adequately protect our business or permit us to maintain our competitive advantage. For example: others may be able to make products and technologies that are similar to any products and technologies we may develop but that are not covered by the claims of the patents that we own or license; we, or our current or future license partners or collaborators, might not have been the first to make the inventions covered by our owned or licensed issued patents or pending patent applications; 
 59 

Table of Contents 
 we, or our current or future license partners or collaborators, might not have been the first to file patent applications covering certain of our or their inventions; others may independently develop similar or alternative technologies or duplicate any of our technologies without infringing our owned or licensed intellectual property rights; it is possible that our current and future owned or licensed pending patent applications will not lead to issued patents; it is possible that there are prior public disclosures that could invalidate our issued patents, or parts of our issued patents; it is possible that there are unpublished applications or patent applications maintained in secrecy that may later issue with claims covering our product candidates or technology similar to ours; the claims of our patent applications, if and when issued, may not cover our products or technologies; the laws of foreign countries may not protect our proprietary rights or the proprietary rights of license partners or current or future collaborators to the same extent as the laws of the United States; the inventors of our patent applications may become involved with competitors, develop products or processes that design around our patents, or become hostile to us or the patents or patent applications on which they are named as inventors; we engage in scientific collaborations and will continue to do so in the future, and our collaborators may develop adjacent or competing products that are outside the scope of our patents; any products or technologies we develop may be covered by third parties patents or other exclusive rights; issued patents that we hold rights to may be held invalid or unenforceable, including as a result of legal challenges by our competitors; our competitors might conduct research and development activities in countries where we do not have patent rights and then use the information learned from such activities to develop competitive products for sale in our major commercial markets; we may not develop additional proprietary technologies that are patentable; the patents of others may harm our business; and we may choose not to file a patent in order to maintain certain trade secrets or know-how, and a third-party may subsequently file a patent covering such intellectual property. 
 Should any of these events occur, they could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects.

 Risks Related to Ownership of Our Common Stock The market price of our common stock has been and is likely to continue to be volatile, and you may be unable to sell your shares at or above the price at which you purchased them. The market price of our common stock is highly volatile and may fluctuate substantially due to many factors, including: actual or anticipated fluctuations in our financial condition and operating results, including fluctuations in our quarterly and annual results; the introduction of new products or product enhancements by us or others in our industry; variances in our product and system reliability; overall conditions in our industry and the markets in which we operate; disputes or other developments with respect to our or others intellectual property or proprietary rights; actual or anticipated changes in our operating results or growth rate as a result of our competitors operating results; our ability to develop, obtain any required regulatory clearance or approval for, and market new and enhanced products on a timely basis; fluctuations in the valuation of companies perceived by investors to be comparable to us; product liability claims or other litigation; announcement or expectation of additional financing effort; sales of our common stock by us or our stockholders; share price and volume fluctuations attributable to inconsistent trading volume levels of our shares; media exposure of our products or of those of others in our industry; the COVID-19 pandemic and its impact on our ability to receive products and supplies from third parties and our ability to sell our products; changes in applicable governmental regulations or in the status of our regulatory approvals or applications; changes in earnings estimates or recommendations by securities analysts; and general market conditions and other factors, including factors unrelated to our operating performance or the operating performance of our competitors. 
 In recent years, the stock markets generally have experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations that have often been unrelated or disproportionate to the operating performance of listed companies. Broad market and industry factors may significantly affect the market price of our common stock, regardless of our actual operating performance. As a result, you may not realize any return on your investment in us and may lose some or all of your investment. 
 61 

Table of Contents 
 In addition, in the past, class action litigation has often been instituted against companies whose securities have experienced periods of volatility in market price. Securities litigation brought against us following volatility in our stock price, regardless of the merit or ultimate results of such litigation, could result in substantial costs, which would hurt our financial condition and operating results and divert management s attention and resources from our business. Securities analysts may not publish favorable research or reports about our business or may publish no information at all, which could cause our stock price or trading volume to decline. The trading market for our common stock is influenced to some extent by the research and reports that industry or financial analysts publish about us and our business. We do not control these analysts. As a newly public company, we may be slow to attract research coverage and the analysts who publish information about our common stock will have had relatively little experience with us or our industry, which could affect their ability to accurately forecast our results and could make it more likely that we fail to meet their estimates. If any of the analysts who cover us provide inaccurate or unfavorable research or issue an adverse opinion regarding our stock price, our stock price could decline. If one or more of these analysts cease coverage of us or fail to publish reports covering us regularly, we could lose visibility in the market, which in turn could cause our stock price or trading volume to decline. We are an emerging growth company and a smaller reporting company and the reduced disclosure requirements applicable to emerging growth companies and smaller reporting companies may make our common stock less attractive to investors. We are an emerging growth company, as defined in the JOBS Act, and we may take advantage of certain exemptions and relief from various reporting requirements that are applicable to other public companies that are not emerging growth companies. In particular, while we are an emerging growth company, we will not be required to comply with the auditor attestation requirements of Section 404(b) of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, or the Sarbanes-Oxley Act; we will be exempt from any rules that could be adopted by the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board requiring mandatory audit firm rotations or a supplement to the auditor s report on financial statements; we will be subject to reduced disclosure obligations regarding executive compensation in our periodic reports and proxy statements; and we will not be required to hold nonbinding advisory votes on executive compensation or stockholder approval of any golden parachute payments not previously approved. In addition, the JOBS Act provides that an emerging growth company can take advantage of an extended transition period for complying with new or revised accounting standards. This allows an emerging growth company to delay the adoption of certain accounting standards until those standards would otherwise apply to private companies. We have elected to avail ourselves of this extended transition period and, as a result, we will not be required to adopt new or revised accounting standards on the relevant dates on which adoption of such standards is required for other public companies. We may remain an emerging growth company until the fiscal year-end following the fifth anniversary of the completion of our initial public offering, though we may cease to be an emerging growth company earlier under certain circumstances, including if (i) we have more than 1.235 billion in annual revenue in any fiscal year, (ii) the date on which we are deemed to be a large accelerated filer under the rules of the SEC or (iii) we issue more than 1.0 billion of non-convertible debt over a three-year period. The exact implications of the JOBS Act are subject to interpretations and guidance by the SEC and other regulatory agencies, and we cannot assure you that we will be able to take advantage of all of the benefits of the JOBS Act. In addition, investors may find our common stock less attractive to the extent we rely on the exemptions and relief granted by the JOBS Act. If some investors find our common stock less attractive as a result, there may be a less active trading market for our common stock and our stock price may decline or become more volatile. We are also a smaller reporting company, meaning that the market value of our stock held by non-affiliates is less than 700 million as of the last trading day of our second quarter and our annual revenue is less than 100 million during the most recently completed fiscal year. We may continue to be a smaller reporting company if either (i) the market value of our stock held by non-affiliates is less than 250 million or (ii) our annual revenue is less than 100 million

 during the most recently completed fiscal year and the market value of our stock held by non-affiliates is less than 700 million. If we are a smaller reporting company at the time we cease to be an emerging growth company, we may continue to rely on exemptions from certain disclosure requirements that are available to smaller reporting companies. Specifically, as a smaller reporting company we may choose to present only the two most recent fiscal years of audited financial statements in our Annual Report on Form 10-K and, similar to emerging growth companies, smaller reporting companies have reduced disclosure obligations regarding executive compensation. If our estimates or judgments relating to our critical accounting policies are based on assumptions that change or prove to be incorrect, our operating results could fall below our publicly announced guidance or the expectations of securities analysts and investors, resulting in a decline in the market price of our common stock. The preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles, or GAAP, requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in our consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes. We base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets, liabilities, equity, revenue and expenses that are not readily apparent from other sources. If our assumptions change or if actual circumstances differ from our assumptions, our operating results may be adversely affected and could fall below our publicly announced guidance or the expectations of securities analysts and investors, resulting in a decline in the market price of our common stock. Future sales and issuances of our common stock or rights to purchase our common stock, including pursuant to our equity incentive plans, or other equity securities or securities convertible into our common stock, could result in additional dilution of the percentage ownership of our stockholders and could cause the stock price of our common stock to decline. In the future, we may sell common stock, other series of common stock, convertible securities, or other equity securities, including preferred securities, in one or more transactions at prices and in a manner we determine from time to time. We also expect to continue to issue common stock to employees, consultants, and directors pursuant to our equity incentive plans. If we sell common stock, other series of common stock, convertible securities, or other equity securities in subsequent transactions, or common stock is issued pursuant to equity incentive plans, stockholders may be materially diluted. New investors in subsequent transactions could gain rights, preferences, and privileges senior to those of holders of our common stock. We do not intend to pay dividends for the foreseeable future. Consequently, any gains from an investment in our common stock will likely depend on whether the price of our common stock increases. We have not and do not intend to pay any dividends on our common stock in the foreseeable future. We anticipate that we will retain all of our future earnings for use in the operation and growth of our business and for general corporate purposes. Any determination to pay dividends in the future will be at the discretion of our board of directors. Accordingly, stockholders must rely on sales of their common stock after price appreciation, which may never occur, as the only way to realize any future gains on their investments. Furthermore, our Midcap Trust Term Loan contain negative covenants that limit our ability to pay dividends. For more information, see the section titled Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Liquidity and Capital Resources. Our directors, officers and principal stockholders have significant voting power and may take actions that may not be in the best interests of our other stockholders. Our officers, directors and principal stockholders each holding more than 10 of our common stock, collectively control approximately 53.7 of our outstanding common stock as of December 31, 2022. As a result, these stockholders, if acting together, have significant influence over the outcome of corporate actions requiring stockholder approval, including the election of directors, amendment of our organizational documents, any merger, consolidation or sale of all or substantially all of our assets and any other significant corporate transaction. The interests of these stockholders may not be the same as or may even conflict with your interests. For example, these stockholders could delay or prevent a change of control of our company, even if such a change of control would benefit our other 
 63 

Table of Contents 
 stockholders, which could deprive our stockholders of an opportunity to receive a premium for their common stock as part of a sale of our company or our assets and might affect the prevailing market price of our common stock. The significant concentration of stock ownership may adversely affect the trading price of our common stock due to investors perception that conflicts of interest may exist or arise. We will incur increased costs as a result of operating as a public company, and our management will be required to devote substantial time to new compliance initiatives and corporate governance practices. As a public company, and particularly after we are no longer an emerging growth company or smaller reporting company, we will incur significant legal, accounting and other expenses that we did not incur as a private company. The Sarbanes-Oxley Act, the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act, Nasdaq listing requirements and other applicable securities rules and regulations impose various requirements on public companies, including establishment and maintenance of effective disclosure and financial controls and corporate governance practices. Our management and other personnel will need to devote a substantial amount of time to these compliance initiatives. Moreover, we expect these rules and regulations to substantially increase our legal and financial compliance costs and to make some activities more time consuming and costly. For example, we expect that these rules and regulations may make it more difficult and more expensive for us to obtain director and officer liability insurance and we may be required to incur substantial costs to maintain sufficient coverage. We cannot predict or estimate the amount or timing of additional costs we may incur to respond to these requirements. The impact of these requirements could also make it more difficult for us to attract and retain qualified persons to serve on our board of directors, our board committees or as executive officers. Moreover, these rules and regulations are often subject to varying interpretations, in many cases due to their lack of specificity, and, as a result, their application in practice may evolve over time as new guidance is provided by regulatory and governing bodies. This could result in continuing uncertainty regarding compliance matters and higher costs necessitated by ongoing revisions to disclosure and governance practices. If we experience material weaknesses in the future or otherwise fail to implement and maintain an effective system of internal controls in the future, we may not be able to accurately report our financial condition or results of operations which may adversely affect investor confidence in us and, as a result, the value of our common stock. We are required, under Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, to furnish a report by management on, among other things, the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting. This assessment includes disclosure of any material weaknesses identified by our management in our internal control over financial reporting. A material weakness is a deficiency or combination of deficiencies in internal control over financial reporting, such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of a company s annual and interim financial statements will not be detected or prevented on a timely basis. The rules governing the standards that must be met for management to assess our internal control over financial reporting are complex and require significant documentation, testing and possible remediation. To comply with the requirements of being a reporting company under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the Exchange Act ), including performing the evaluation needed to comply with Section 404, we will need to implement additional financial and management controls, reporting systems and procedures and hire additional accounting and finance staff. We may not be able to complete our evaluation, testing and any required remediation in a timely fashion. During the evaluation and testing process, if we identify one or more material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting, we will be unable to assert that our internal controls are effective. The effectiveness of our controls and procedures may be limited by a variety of factors, including: faulty human judgment and simple errors, omissions or mistakes; fraudulent action of an individual or collusion of two or more people; inappropriate management override of procedures; and the possibility that any enhancements to controls and procedures may still not be adequate to assure timely and accurate financial control.

Table of Contents 
 We cannot assure you that there will not be material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting in the future. Any failure to implement and maintain internal control over financial reporting could severely inhibit our ability to accurately report our financial condition, results of operations or cash flows. If we are unable to conclude that our internal control over financial reporting is effective, or if our independent registered public accounting firm determines we have a material weakness in our internal control over financial reporting, investors may lose confidence in the accuracy and completeness of our financial reports, the market price of our common stock could decline, and we could be subject to sanctions or investigations by Nasdaq, the SEC or other regulatory authorities. Failure to remedy any material weakness in our internal control over financial reporting, or to implement or maintain other effective control systems required of public companies, could also restrict our future access to the capital markets. When we cease to be an emerging growth company under the JOBS Act, our auditors will be required to express an opinion on the effectiveness of our internal controls, unless we are then eligible for any other exemption from such requirement. If we are unable to confirm that our internal control over financial reporting is effective, or if our independent registered public accounting firm is unable to express an opinion on the effectiveness of our internal controls, we could lose investor confidence in the accuracy and completeness of our financial reports, which could cause the price of our common stock to decline. The failure to successfully implement and maintain accounting systems could materially adversely impact our business, results of operations, and financial condition. If our revenue and other accounting or tax systems do not operate as intended or do not scale with anticipated growth in our business, the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting could be adversely affected. Any failure to develop, implement, or maintain effective internal controls related to our revenue and other accounting or tax systems and associated reporting could materially adversely affect our business, results of operations, and financial condition or cause us to fail to meet our reporting obligations. In addition, if we experience interruptions in service or operational difficulties with our revenue and other accounting or tax systems, our business, results of operations, and financial condition could be materially adversely affected. Our results of operations and financial condition could be materially adversely affected by changes in accounting principles. The accounting for our business is subject to change based on the evolution of our business model, interpretations of relevant accounting principles, enforcement of existing or new regulations, and changes in policies, rules, regulations, and interpretations, of accounting and financial reporting requirements of the SEC or other regulatory agencies. Adoption of a change in accounting principles or interpretations could have a significant effect on our reported results of operations and could affect the reporting of transactions completed before the adoption of such change. It is difficult to predict the impact of future changes to accounting principles and accounting policies over financial reporting, any of which could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition and could require significant investment in systems and personnel. Provisions in our corporate charter documents and under Delaware law could make an acquisition of us more difficult and may prevent attempts by our stockholders to replace or remove our current management. Provisions in our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and our amended and restated bylaws may discourage, delay or prevent a merger, acquisition or other change in control of us that stockholders may consider favorable, including transactions in which stockholders might otherwise receive a premium for their shares. These provisions could also limit the price that investors might be willing to pay in the future for shares of our common stock, thereby depressing the market price of our common stock. In addition, these provisions may frustrate or prevent any attempts by our stockholders to replace or remove our current management by making it more difficult for stockholders to replace members of our board of directors. Because our board of directors is responsible for appointing the members 
 65 

Table of Contents 
 of our management team, these provisions could in turn affect any attempt by our stockholders to replace current members of our management team. Among others, these provisions include that: our board of directors has the right to expand the size of our board of directors and to elect directors to fill a vacancy created by the expansion of the board of directors or the resignation, death or removal of a director, which prevents stockholders from being able to fill vacancies on our board of directors; our board of directors is divided into three classes, Class I, Class II and Class III, with each class serving staggered three-year terms, which may delay the ability of stockholders to change the membership of a majority of our board of directors; our stockholders may not act by written consent, which forces stockholder action to be taken at an annual or special meeting of our stockholders; a special meeting of stockholders may be called only by the chair of the board of directors, the chief executive officer, or a majority of the board of directors, which may delay the ability of our stockholders to force consideration of a proposal or to take action, including the removal of directors; our amended and restated certificate of incorporation prohibits cumulative voting in the election of directors, which limits the ability of minority stockholders to elect director candidates; our board of directors may alter our bylaws without obtaining stockholder approval; the required approval of the holders of at least two-thirds of the voting power of all of the then outstanding shares of voting stock to adopt, amend or repeal our bylaws or repeal the provisions of our amended and restated certificate of incorporation regarding the election and removal of directors; stockholders must provide advance notice and additional disclosures in order to nominate individuals for election to the board of directors or to propose matters that can be acted upon at a stockholders meeting, which may discourage or deter a potential acquiror from conducting a solicitation of proxies to elect the acquiror s own slate of directors or otherwise attempting to obtain control of our company; and our board of directors is authorized to issue shares of preferred stock and to determine the terms of those shares, including preferences and voting rights, without stockholder approval, which could be used to significantly dilute the ownership of a hostile acquiror. 
 Moreover, because we are incorporated in Delaware, we are governed by the provisions of Section 203 of the Delaware General Corporation Law, which prohibits a person who owns in excess of 15 of our outstanding voting stock from merging or combining with us for a period of three years after the date of the transaction in which the person acquired in excess of 15 of our outstanding voting stock, unless the merger or combination is approved in a prescribed manner. Claims for indemnification by our directors and officers may reduce our available funds to satisfy successful third-party claims against us and may reduce the amount of money available to us. Our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and amended and restated bylaws provide that we will indemnify our directors and officers, in each case to the fullest extent permitted by Delaware law. In addition, as permitted by Section 145 of the Delaware General Corporation Law, our amended and restated bylaws and our indemnification agreements that we have entered into with our directors and officers provide that: we will indemnify our directors and officers to the fullest extent permitted by Delaware law. Delaware law provides that a corporation may indemnify such person if such person acted in good faith and in a manner such 
 66 

Table of Contents 
 person reasonably believed to be in or not opposed to the best interests of the registrant and, with respect to any criminal proceeding, had no reasonable cause to believe such person s conduct was unlawful; we may, in our discretion, indemnify employees and agents in those circumstances where indemnification is permitted by applicable law; we are required to advance expenses, as incurred, to our directors and officers in connection with defending a proceeding, except that such directors or officers will undertake to repay such advances if it is ultimately determined that such person is not entitled to indemnification; the rights conferred in our amended and restated bylaws are not exclusive, and we are authorized to enter into indemnification agreements with our directors, officers, employees and agents and to obtain insurance to indemnify such persons; and we may not retroactively amend our amended and restated bylaw provisions to reduce our indemnification obligations to directors, officers, employees, and agents. 
 While we have procured directors and officers liability insurance policies, such insurance policies may not be available to us in the future at a reasonable rate, may not cover all potential claims for indemnification, and may not be adequate to indemnify us for all liability that may be imposed. Our amended and restated certificate of incorporation provides that the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware will be the exclusive forum for certain disputes between us and our stockholders, which could limit our stockholders ability to obtain a favorable judicial forum for disputes with us or our directors, officers or employees. Our amended and restated certificate of incorporation specifies that, unless we consent in writing to the selection of an alternative forum, the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware will be the sole and exclusive forum for most legal actions involving actions brought against us by stockholders; provided that, if and only if the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware dismisses any such action for lack of subject matter jurisdiction, such action may be brought in another state or federal court sitting in the State of Delaware. Our amended and restated certificate of incorporation also provides that the federal district courts of the United States of America will be the exclusive forum for the resolution of any complaint asserting a cause of action against us or any of our directors, officers, employees or agents and arising under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the Securities Act ). We believe these provisions may benefit us by providing increased consistency in the application of Delaware law and federal securities laws by chancellors and judges, as applicable, particularly experienced in resolving corporate disputes, efficient administration of cases on a more expedited schedule relative to other forums and protection against the burdens of multi-forum litigation. However, these provisions may have the effect of discouraging lawsuits against our directors and officers. The choice of forum provision requiring that the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware be the exclusive forum for certain actions would not apply to suits brought to enforce any liability or duty created by the Exchange Act. There is uncertainty as to whether a court would enforce such provisions, and the enforceability of similar choice of forum provisions in other companies charter documents has been challenged in legal proceedings. While the Delaware courts have determined that such choice of forum provisions are facially valid, a stockholder may nevertheless seek to bring a claim in a venue other than those designated in the exclusive forum provisions, and there can be no assurance that such provisions will be enforced by a court in those other jurisdictions. If a court were to find these types of provisions to be inapplicable or unenforceable, and if a court were to find the exclusive forum provision in our amended and restated certificate of incorporation to be inapplicable or unenforceable in an action, we may incur additional costs associated with resolving the dispute in other jurisdictions, which could materially adversely affect our business. Because we do not anticipate paying any cash dividends on our capital stock in the foreseeable future, capital appreciation, if any, will be your sole source of gain. We have never declared or paid cash dividends on our capital stock. We currently intend to retain all of our future earnings, if any, to finance the growth and development of our business. Any future determination related to dividend 
 67 

Table of Contents 
 policy will be made at the discretion of our board of directors, subject to applicable laws and the restrictions set forth in any of our contractual agreements, and will depend upon, among other factors, our results of operations, financial condition, contractual restrictions and capital requirements. In addition, any future debt or preferred securities or future debt agreements we may enter may preclude us from paying dividends. As a result, capital appreciation, if any, of our common stock will be your sole source of gain for the foreseeable future. Our ability to use our net operating losses and certain other tax attributes may be limited. Under Sections 382 and 383 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, or the Code, if a corporation undergoes an ownership change, generally defined as a cumulative change of more than 50 percentage points (by value) in its equity ownership by certain stockholders over a three-year period, the corporation s ability to use its pre-change NOL carryforwards and other pre-change tax attributes (such as research tax credits) to offset its post-change income or taxes may be limited. We may have experienced at least one ownership change in the past, and we may experience ownership changes in the future as a result of shifts in our stock ownership (some of which shifts are outside our control). As a result, if we earn net taxable income, our ability to use our pre-change NOL carryforwards to offset such taxable income will be subject to limitations. Similar provisions of state tax law may also apply to limit our use of accumulated state tax attributes. As a result, even if we attain profitability, we may be unable to use a material portion of our NOL carryforwards and other tax attributes, which could adversely affect our future cash flows. Item 1B. Unresolved Staff Comments None. Item 2. Properties Our corporate headquarters, research and development facilities and manufacturing and distribution centers are located in Marlborough, Massachusetts and Menlo Park, California, where we lease in aggregate approximately 80,968 and 20,675 square feet of space, respectively, under leases expiring between December 31, 2023 and March 1, 2030. We do not own any real property and believe that our current facilities, together with our global headquarters and research and development center, are sufficient to meet our ongoing needs and that, if we require additional space, we will be able to obtain additional facilities on commercially reasonable terms. Item 3. Legal Proceedings From time to time, we may be subject to legal proceedings. We are not currently a party to or aware of any proceedings that we believe will have, individually or in the aggregate, a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations. Regardless of outcome, litigation can have an adverse impact on us because of defense and settlement costs, diversion of management resources and other factors. Item 4. Mine Safety Disclosures Not applicable.

 Overview We are an innovative life sciences technology company delivering spatial biology solutions focused on transforming discovery and clinical research. Our mission is to deliver a revolutionary new class of spatially derived biomarkers that empower life sciences researchers to better understand disease and clinicians to improve patient outcomes. Spatial biology refers to a rapidly evolving technology that enables academic and biopharma scientists to detect and map the distribution of cell types and biomarkers across whole tissue samples at single-cell resolution, enabling advancements in their understanding of disease progression and patient response to therapy. Through our PhenoCycler (formerly CODEX and PhenoImager (formerly Phenoptics platforms, reagents, software and services, we offer end-to-end solutions to perform tissue analysis and spatial phenotyping across the full continuum from discovery through translational and clinical research. Our spatial biology solutions measure cells and proteins by providing biomarker data in its spatial context while preserving tissue integrity. Biomarkers are objective measures that capture what is happening in a cell or tissue at a given moment. Current genomic and proteomic methods, such as next-generation sequencing (NGS), single-cell analysis, flow cytometry and mass spectrometry, are providing meaningful data but require the destruction of the tissue sample for analysis. While valuable and broadly adopted, these approaches allow scientists to analyze the biomarkers and cells that comprise the tissue but do not provide the fundamental information about tissue structure, cellular interactions and the localized measurements of key biomarkers. Furthermore, current non-destructive tissue analysis and histological methods provide some limited spatial information, but they only measure a minimal number of biomarkers at a time and require expert pathologist interpretation. Our platforms address these limitations by providing end-to -end solutions that enable researchers to quantitatively interrogate a large number of biomarkers and cell types across a tissue section at single-cell resolution. The result is a detailed and computable map of the tissue sample that thoroughly captures the underlying tissue dynamics and interactions between key cell types and biomarkers, a process now referred to as spatial phenotyping. We believe that we are the only business with the breadth of platform capabilities that enable researchers to do a deep exploratory and discovery study, and then further advance and scale their research through the translational and clinical phases, leading to a better understanding of human biology, disease progression and response to therapy. We offer complete end-to-end solutions for spatial phenotyping, designed to serve the unique needs of our customers in the discovery, translational and clinical markets. The PhenoCycler (formerly CODEX), is an ultra-high parameter and cost-effective platform ideally suited for discovery high-plex research. The PhenoImager platforms (formerly Phenoptics), which includes the newly introduced Fusion instrument and HT instrument (formerly Vectra Polaris), provide high-throughput with the automation and robustness needed for translational and clinical applications. Furthermore, the PhenoCycler and the PhenoImager Fusion can be integrated into a combined system, the PhenoCycler-Fusion System, to enable spatial discovery at scale by providing significant improvements in the speed of the workflow. Together the systems offer seamless and integrated workflow solutions for our customers, including important benefits such as flexible sample types, automated sample processing, scalability, comprehensive data analysis and software solutions and dedicated field and applications support. With these platforms, our customers are performing spatial phenotyping to further advance their understanding of diseases such as cancer, neurological and autoimmune disorders, and many other therapeutic areas. For the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, revenue from North America accounted for approximately 56 and 51 of our revenue, respectively. As of December 31, 2022, we employed a commercial team of 151 employees, including many with significant industry and technical experience. This total includes field instrument service personnel whose salaries and other personnel costs are classified in cost of goods sold in our consolidated statements of operations. We follow a direct sales model in North America and EMEA, while selling through third-party distributors and dealers in APAC. We focus a substantial portion of our resources on research and development, as well as on business development and sales and marketing. Our research and development efforts are geared towards developing new instruments and assay capabilities, as well as new reagent kits, to meet both our customers needs and to address new markets. We intend 
 70 

Table of Contents 
 to continue making significant investments in this area for the foreseeable future. We also intend to continue to make investments in building our sales team and marketing our products and services to potential customers. We generally outsource all of our production manufacturing. Design work, prototyping and pilot manufacturing are performed in-house before outsourcing to third-party contract manufacturers. Our outsourced production strategy is intended to drive cost leverage and scale and avoid the high capital outlays and fixed costs related to constructing and operating a manufacturing facility. The contract manufacturers of our systems and reagent kits are located in the United States and Asia. Certain of our suppliers of components and materials are single source suppliers. We manufacture and assemble certain instrument components in-house. As of the date of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, we have financed our operations primarily from the issuance and sale of convertible preferred stock, borrowings under our long-term debt agreement, and our IPO. We have incurred net losses in each year since our inception in 2015. Our net losses were 70.6 million and 42.9 million for the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. We expect to continue to incur significant expenses and operating losses for the foreseeable future. We expect our expenses will increase substantially in connection with our ongoing activities, as we: attract, hire and retain qualified personnel, including the expansion of our commercial capabilities and organizations; market and sell new and existing solutions and services; invest in processes and infrastructure to scale our business; support research and development to introduce new solutions; expand, protect and defend our intellectual property; and acquire complementary businesses or technologies to support the growth of our business. 
 Key factors affecting our results of operations and future performance There are a number of factors that have impacted, and we believe will continue to impact, our business, results of operations and growth. Our ability to successfully address these factors is subject to various risks and uncertainties, including those described under the heading Risk Factors. Expansion of our installed base We are focused on increasing sales of our PhenoCycler and PhenoImager platforms (Fusion and HT) to new and existing customers. Our financial performance has historically been driven by, and will continue to be impacted by, the volume of instrument sales. Additionally, instrument sales are a leading indicator of future recurring revenue from consumables and services. Our operating results and growth prospects will be dependent in part on our ability to increase our instrument installed base as we further penetrate existing markets and expand into, or offer new features and solutions that appeal to, new markets. We believe our market is still evolving and relatively underpenetrated. As spatial biology is further validated through rapid acceleration of peer-reviewed publications and growing adoption by the life sciences research market, we believe we have an opportunity to significantly increase our installed base. In order to capitalize on this opportunity to drive adoption of our platforms across the entire market, we intend to expand our global sales and marketing organizations, increase the scale of our outbound marketing activities, invest in commercial channel infrastructure and deliver new, market-leading solutions to our customers. In addition, we regularly solicit feedback from our customers in order to enhance our solutions and their applications for life sciences research, which we believe will drive increased adoption of our platforms as they better serve our customers needs.

 Drive incremental pull through We believe that expansion of our installed base to new and existing customers will drive an increase in our recurring reagent and instrument service revenue. In addition, as our research and development team identifies and launches new applications and biomarker targets, we expect to increase incremental pull through on our existing and new instrument installed base. Recurring revenue was 35 and 38 for the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. Our recurring revenue as a percentage of total product and service revenue will vary based upon new device placements in the period. As our installed base expands, we expect recurring revenue on an absolute basis to increase and become an increasingly important contributor to our revenue. Improve revenue mix and gross margin Our revenue is primarily derived from sales of our platforms, consumables, software, and services. Our revenue mix will fluctuate from period-to-period, particularly revenue generated from instrument sales. As our installed base grows, we expect consumables and instrument service revenue to constitute a larger percentage of total revenue. Our margins are higher for those instruments and consumables that we sell directly to customers compared to those sold through distributors. Future instrument and consumable selling prices and gross margins may fluctuate due to a variety of factors, including the introduction by others of competing products and solutions. We aim to mitigate downward pressure on our average selling prices by increasing the value proposition offered by our instruments and consumables, primarily by expanding the applications for our devices and increasing the quantity and quality of data that can be obtained using our consumables. Key Business Metrics We regularly review the number of instrument placements and cumulative instrument placement as key metrics to evaluate our business, measure our performance, identify trends affecting our business, develop financial projections, and make strategic decisions. We believe that these metrics are representative of our current business; however, we anticipate these will change or may be substituted for additional or different metrics as our business grows. During the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, our instrument placements were as follows: 

Year ended December 31, 2022 2021 Instrument Placements: 237 147 Our instruments are sold globally to leading biopharma companies and top research institutions and medical centers. Our quarterly instrument placements fluctuate considerably from period-to-period due to the type and size of our customers and their procurement and budgeting cycles. We expect continued fluctuations in our quarterly period-to-period number of instrument placements. We believe our instrument placements is an important metric to measure our business because the number of new placements is driven by our ability to secure new customers and to increase adoption of our PhenoCycler and PhenoImager platforms as well as provide insights into anticipated recurring revenue for consumables and instrument services.

 Components of results of operations Revenue Product Revenue We generate product revenue from the sale of our instruments, consumables and software products. Instrument sales accounted for 67 and 65 of product revenue for the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. Consumables revenue accounted for 32 and 32 of product revenue for the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. Our current instrument offerings include our PhenoCycler and PhenoImager platforms. Our sales process with customers is often long and involves multiple levels of approvals. As a result, the revenue for our platforms can vary significantly from period-to-period and has been, and may continue to be, concentrated in a small number of customers in any given period. We sell our instruments directly to customers and through distributors. Each of our instrument sales drives various streams of recurring revenue comprised of consumable product sales and instrument services. Service and Other Revenue We primarily generate service and other revenue from instrument service, which generally consists of sales of extended service contracts, in addition to installation and training, as well as from our laboratory services operations, where we provide sample testing services to customers utilizing our in-house lab operation, and revenue generated from companion diagnostic development. We offer our customers extended warranty and service plans for our platforms. Our extended warranty and service plans are offered for periods beyond the standard one-year warranty that all customers receive. These extended warranty and service plans generally have fixed fees and terms ranging from one to four additional years. We recognize revenue from the sale of extended warranty and service plans over the respective coverage period, which approximates the service effort provided by us. We record shipping and handling billed to customers as service and other revenue and the related costs in cost of service and other revenue in the consolidated statement of operations. During the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively, our revenue was comprised of the following sources: 

Year ended December 31, in thousands) 2022 2021 Revenue: Product revenue 57,650 44,477 Service and other revenue 17,209 10,440 Total revenue 74,859 54,917 We sell our products globally. We sell directly to end customers in North America and EMEA and we sell through third-party distributors and dealers in the APAC region. Cost of Goods Sold, Gross Profit and Gross Margin Product cost of revenue primarily consists of costs for finished goods (both instruments and reagents) produced by our contract manufacturers, and associated freight, shipping and handling costs for products shipped to customers, salaries and other personnel costs, and other direct costs related to those sales recognized as product revenue in the 
 73 

Table of Contents 
 period. Cost of goods sold for services and other revenue primarily consists of salaries and other personnel costs, travel related to services provided, costs of servicing equipment at customer sites, and all personnel and related costs for our laboratory services operation. We expect that our cost of goods sold will increase or decrease to the extent that our revenue increases and decreases and depending on the mix of revenue in any specific period. Gross profit is calculated as revenue less cost of goods sold. Gross margin is gross profit expressed as a percentage of revenue. Our gross profit in future periods will depend on a variety of factors, including market conditions that may impact our pricing, sales mix among instruments, sales mix changes among consumables, excess and obsolete inventories, costs we pay our contract manufacturers for their services, our cost structure for lab service operations relative to volume, product warranty obligations, and inflationary cost pressures. Our gross profit in future periods will also vary based upon our channel mix and may decrease based upon our distribution channels. Gross profit was 43.4 million compared to 34.2 million for the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. Operating expenses Research and development. Research and development costs primarily consist of salaries, benefits, engineering/design costs, laboratory supplies, and materials expenses for employees and third parties engaged in research and product development. We expense all research and development costs in the period in which they are incurred. We plan to continue to invest in our research and development efforts, including hiring additional employees, to enhance existing products and develop new products. As a result, we expect that our research and development expenses will continue to increase in absolute dollars in future periods. We expect these expenses to vary from period to period as a percentage of revenue. Selling, general and administrative. Our selling, general and administrative expenses primarily consist of salaries and benefits for employees in our executive, accounting and finance, legal expenses related to intellectual property, sales and marketing, operations, and human resource functions as well as professional services fees, such as consulting, audit, tax and legal fees, general corporate costs, commercial sales functions, marketing, travel expenses, facilities, and IT. We expect that our sales, general and administrative expenses will continue to increase in absolute dollars, primarily due to increased headcount to support anticipated growth in the business and due to incremental costs associated with operating as a public company. Additionally, we expect an increase in absolute dollars as we expand our commercial sales, marketing and business development teams, increase our presence globally and increase marketing activities to drive awareness and adoption of our platform. We expect these expenses to vary from period to period as a percentage of revenue. Change in fair value of contingent consideration. On September 28, 2018, the Company acquired substantially all the assets of the QPS division of PKI. As part of the acquisition, on September 28, 2018, the Company entered into a License Agreement with PKI. Under the terms of the License Agreement, the Company agreed to pay PKI certain royalties as a percentage of future sales of products from the QPS division, in exchange for a perpetual license of the right to produce and sell QPS products. This contingent consideration is subject to remeasurement. Depreciation and amortization. Depreciation and amortization expenses primarily consist of depreciation of property and equipment and amortization of acquired intangibles. Other income (expense) Interest expense. Interest expense consists primarily of interest related to borrowings under our debt obligations. 
 74 

Table of Contents 
 Change in fair value of warrant liability. Prior to our IPO, we classified our outstanding warrant to purchase shares of our Series D redeemable convertible preferred stock as a liability on our balance sheets at its estimated fair value since the underlying redeemable convertible preferred stock was classified as temporary equity. At the end of each reporting period, changes in the estimated fair value during the period were recorded as a component of other income (expense). In connection with our IPO, this warrant was adjusted to become a warrant to purchase shares of our common stock and met the criteria to be classified within stockholders equity; therefore, the warrant was no longer subject to liability accounting. Accordingly, the fair value of the warrant liability was reclassified to stockholders equity. Gain on extinguishment of debt. Gain on extinguishment of debt relates to forgiveness of our Payroll Protection Program loan, (the PPP Loan ). Interest income. Interest income consists of interest earned on cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities. Other expense, net. Other expense, net consists primarily of franchise tax and foreign currency exchange gains and losses. Benefit (provision) for income taxes Our benefit (provision) for income taxes consists primarily of foreign taxes and minimal state taxes in the United States. As we expand the scale and scope of our international business activities, any changes in the United States and foreign taxation of such activities may increase our overall provision for income taxes in the future.

The increase in cost of product revenue was primarily driven by costs associated with increased instrument and consumable sales. Cost of service and other revenue increased by 4.3 million, or 69 , for the year ended December 31, 2022, compared to the year ended December 31, 2021. The increase was primarily due to increases in costs for lab services driven by an increase in activity, as well as an increase in extended warranty costs as there were higher customer renewals due to the maturity of the installed base. Additionally, a 0.4 million reduction to cost of goods sold in the year ended December 31, 2021 was recorded, which was associated with the employee retention credit. Gross profit increased by 9.2 million, or 27 , and gross margin decreased by 4 for the year ended December 31, 2022, as compared to the year ended December 31, 2021. The decline in gross margin was primarily due to the costs increases noted above, which includes the impact of inflationary cost pressures, as well as promotional pricing offered during the launch of the Fusion instrument.

Liquidity and Capital Resources As of December 31, 2022, we had approximately 81.2 million in cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities. Since our inception, we have experienced losses and negative cash flows from operations, and incurred a consolidated net loss of 70.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2022 and had an accumulated deficit of 166.7 million as of December 31, 2022. We have historically relied on equity and debt financings to fund our operations to date. We may in the future sell shares of our common stock pursuant to the Equity Distribution Agreement or draw the remaining tranche pursuant to Amendment No. 3 to the Midcap Trust Term Loan to help fund our operations. We expect to incur additional operating losses in the foreseeable future as we continue to invest in the research and development of our product offerings, commercialize and launch platforms, and expand into new markets. Based on our current business plan, we believe the net proceeds from the IPO, together with our existing cash, cash equivalents, marketable securities and anticipated cash flows from operations will be sufficient to meet our working capital and capital expenditure needs over at least the next 12 months following the date of the filing of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Our future capital requirements will depend on many factors, including, but not limited to our ability to successfully commercialize and launch products, and to achieve a level of sales adequate to support our cost structure. If we are unable to execute on our business plan and adequately fund operations, or if the business plan requires a level of spending in excess of cash resources, we will have to seek additional equity or debt financing. If additional financings are required from outside sources, we may not be able to raise it on terms acceptable to us or at all. If we are unable to raise additional capital when desired, our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects could be adversely affected. Sources of Liquidity Since our inception, we have financed our operations primarily from the issuance and sale of our convertible preferred stock and borrowings under long-term debt agreements. In April 2021, we completed our IPO, resulting in the receipt of aggregate proceeds of 138.6 million, net of offering costs, underwriter discounts and commissions of 12.8 million.

 Convertible preferred stock financings Through December 31, 2022, we have raised a total of 60.5 million from the issuance and sale of convertible preferred stock, net of costs associated with such financings. Most recently, in 2019 we issued shares of Series D convertible preferred stock for gross proceeds of 25.0 million. All preferred stock converted to common stock immediately prior to our IPO. Payroll Protection Program loan During April 2020, we received a 2.48 million small business loan under the Payroll Protection Program, part of the Coronavirus Aid, Relief and Economic Security Act (the CARES Act ). The PPP Loan was forgiven in full in June 2021. Midcap Trust Term Loan In October 2020, we entered into the Midcap Trust Term Loan for a 37.5 million credit facility, consisting of a senior, secured term loan. We realized 32.5 million in aggregate proceeds as a result of the debt financing. On June 1, 2022, we entered into Amendment No. 2, which permitted the draw of a second tranche of 10.0 million, which was drawn on June 1, 2022. Additionally, Amendment No. 2 provides us with a new third tranche pursuant to which we may draw 10.0 million any time after September 30, 2022 until September 30, 2023. Amendment No. 2 also delayed the amortization start dates for the outstanding loan amounts from November 1, 2023 until April 1, 2025, at which point we will repay the principal amounts in seven equal monthly installments until the maturity date. Finally, Amendment No. 2 amended the interest rate payable on the term loan to apply an interest rate equal to the SOFR rate (with a floor of 1.61448 plus 6.35 . On September 30, 2022, we drew the third tranche of 10,000 related to Amendment No. 2. On November 7, 2022, we entered into Amendment No. 3 to the Midcap Trust Term Loan, which permitted the draw of two additional tranches, each totaling 11,250, the first of which was drawn on November 7, 2022. The remaining tranche will become available for draw after June 30, 2023 but before December 31, 2023, and is subject to us achieving certain trailing twelve month revenue targets. Amendment No. 3 also delayed the amortization start dates for the outstanding loan amounts from April 1, 2025 until December 1, 2025 (subject to further extension upon certain conditions), at which point we will repay the principal amounts in equal monthly installments until the new maturity date of November 1, 2027. In addition, Amendment No. 3 amended the interest rate payable on the term loan to apply an interest rate equal to the SOFR rate (with a floor of 2.50 plus 6.80 , and reset the call protection to begin as of November 7, 2025. Finally, Amendment No. 3 provides for a commitment fee of 74 payable on November 7, 2022 on the new tranche amounts and an exit fee of 4.75 . Substantially all other terms and conditions, and covenants of the credit agreement remain unchanged. The Midcap Trust Term Loan is subject to a minimum revenue financial covenant measuring our last twelve months trailing revenue, tested on a monthly basis. The Midcap Trust Term Loan is collateralized by substantially all of our assets. The agreement contains customary negative covenants that limit our ability to, among other things, incur additional indebtedness, grant liens, make investments, repurchase stock, pay dividends, transfer assets and merge or consolidate with any other entity or to acquire all or substantially all the capital stock or property of another entity. The agreement also contains customary affirmative covenants, including requirements to, among other things, deliver audited financial statements. If we default under the Midcap Trust Term Loan and if the default is not cured or waived, the lender could cause any amounts outstanding to be payable immediately. Under certain circumstances, the lender could also exercise its rights with respect to the collateral securing such loans. Moreover, any such default would limit our ability to obtain additional financing, which may have an adverse effect on our cash flow and liquidity. We were in compliance with all covenants under the Midcap Trust Term Loan as of December 31, 2022.

 At-the-Market Offering On November 7, 2022, we entered into an Equity Distribution Agreement (the Equity Distribution Agreement with Piper Sandler Co. Piper Sandler with respect to an at-the-market ATM offering program under which we may offer and sell, from time to time at our sole discretion, shares of our common stock, par value 0.00001 per share (the Common Stock ), having an aggregate offering price of up to 50.0 million (the Placement Shares through Piper Sandler as our sales agent. As of December 31, 2022, we have not sold any shares of common stock under the ATM program. Cash flows The following table summarizes our cash flows for the periods presented: 

Year ended December 31, in thousands) 2022 2021 Net cash provided by (used in): Operating activities (53,496) (36,068) Investing activities (14,079) (5,094) Financing activities 28,726 137,035 Net (decrease) increase in cash, cash equivalents, and restricted cash (38,849) 95,873 Operating activities Net cash used in operating activities increased by 17.4 million to 53.5 million in the year ended December 31, 2022 compared to 36.1 million in the year ended December 31, 2021. This increase is attributable to a net loss of 70.6 million, offset by non-cash charges of 15.0 million and a change in our net operating assets and liabilities of 2.2 million. The change in our net operating assets and liabilities was due to increases in accounts payable, accrued expenses and other liabilities of 4.4 million, increases in deferred revenue of 2.6 million, and decreases in prepaid expenses and other assets of 0.8 million, offset by increased inventory levels of 5.4 million, and increases in accounts receivable of 0.3 million. Non-cash charges primarily consisted of 7.4 million of stock-based compensation expense, 7.1 million of depreciation and amortization, and 0.6 million of non-cash interest expense, offset by 0.2 million in net accretion of marketable securities, and 0.1 million in change in fair value of contingent consideration. Investing activities Net cash used in investing activities was 14.1 million in the year ended December 31, 2022 compared to 5.1 million during the year ended December 31, 2021. The increase was primarily driven by purchases of marketable securities of 40.8 million and purchases of property and equipment of 7.4 million, offset by 34.0 million in maturities of marketable securities. Financing activities Net cash provided by financing activities was 28.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2022 compared with 137.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2021. This amount was driven by 31.3 million in debt proceeds and 0.4 million in proceeds from stock option exercises, partially offset by 1.2 million in payments of consideration, 0.6 million in principal payments on financing leases, 0.8 million in payment of accrued final fee, 0.2 million in payments of debt issuance costs, and 0.1 million in payments of deferred offering costs.

 Qualitative and Quantitative Disclosures About Market Risk Interest rate risk Customer financing exposure. We are indirectly exposed to interest rate risk because many of our customers depend on debt financings to purchase our platforms and systems. An increase in interest rates could make it challenging for our customers to obtain the capital necessary to make such purchases on favorable terms, or at all. Such factors could reduce demand or lower the price we can charge for our platforms and systems, thereby reducing our net sales and gross profit. Variable rate debt. In October 2020, we entered into the Midcap Trust Term Loan, which as amended, is due in November 2027, and carries variable interest equal to the SOFR rate (with a floor of 2.50 plus 6.80 per annum. If we refinance the Midcap Trust Term Loan or enter into new debt arrangements, interest rates could increase and thereby increase our financing costs and increase our net loss. A hypothetical 100 basis point change in interest rates would not have a material impact on interest expense for the year ended December 31, 2022. Bank deposit, money market, and note receivable exposure. As of December 31, 2022, we had cash and cash equivalents, including restricted cash, and marketable securities of 81.5 million. The primary objective of our investment is to preserve principal and provide liquidity. A hypothetical 100 basis point decrease in interest rates would not have a material impact on interest income or net loss. Foreign currency risk As we expand our presence in international markets, to the extent we are required to enter into agreements denominated in a currency other than the U.S. dollar, our results of operations and cash flows may increasingly be subject to fluctuations due to changes in foreign currency exchange rates and may be adversely affected in the future due to changes in foreign exchange rates. To date, we have not entered into any hedging arrangements with respect to foreign currency risk. As our international operations grow, we will continue to reassess our approach to manage our risk relating to fluctuations in currency rates. Critical accounting policies and estimates We have prepared our consolidated financial statements in accordance with GAAP. Our preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates, assumptions and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue, expenses and related disclosures. We evaluate our estimates and judgments on an ongoing basis. We base our estimates on historical experience and on various other factors that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying value of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results could therefore differ materially from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions. While our significant accounting policies are described in more detail in Note 2 to our audited consolidated financial statements, we believe the following accounting policies to be critical to the judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements. Impairment of long-lived assets and goodwill We evaluate our long-lived assets, including demo inventory, for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable. If indications of impairment exist, projected future undiscounted cash flows associated with the asset or asset group are compared to the carrying amount to determine whether the asset s value is recoverable. During this analysis, we reevaluate the significant assumptions used in determining the original cost and estimated lives of long-lived assets. Although the assumptions may vary from asset to asset, they generally include operating results, changes in the use of the asset or asset group, cash flows and other indicators of value. We then determine whether the remaining useful life continues to be appropriate or whether there has been an impairment of long-lived assets based primarily upon whether expected future undiscounted cash flows are 
 82 

Table of Contents 
 sufficient to support the assets or asset groups recovery. If impairment exists, we would adjust the carrying value of the asset to fair value, generally determined by a discounted cash flow analysis. If the carrying value of the asset or asset group exceeds such projected undiscounted cash flows, the asset or asset group will be written down to its estimated fair value. We test goodwill for impairment annually and test intangible assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of the asset may not be recoverable (i.e., upon occurrence of a triggering event). We perform our annual impairment review of goodwill on November 1 of each calendar year (and if and when triggering events occur between annual impairment tests). Revenue recognition We follow ASC 606, Revenue from Contracts with Customers ASC 606 ). We derive revenue from two primary sources, product revenue, which is comprised primarily of instrument sales revenue, consumables revenue, and software revenue, as well as service revenue, which is comprised of, service and warranty, and laboratory services revenue. Revenue is recognized net of applicable taxes imposed on the related transaction. We recognize revenue when we satisfy the performance obligations under the terms of a contract and control of our products and services is transferred to our customers in an amount that reflects the consideration we expect to receive from our customers in exchange for those products and services. This process involves identifying the contract with a customer, determining the performance obligations in the contract, determining the contract price, allocating the contract price to the distinct performance obligations in the contract based on standalone selling price, and recognizing revenue when the performance obligations have been satisfied. A performance obligation is considered distinct from other obligations in a contract when it provides a benefit to the customer either on its own or together with other resources that are readily available to the customer and is separately identified in the contract. We consider a performance obligation satisfied once we have transferred control of a good or service to the customer, meaning the customer has the ability to use and obtain the benefit of the good or service. Our agreements with customers often include multiple performance obligations, which can sometimes be included in separate contracts entered into within a reasonably short period of time. We consider an entire customer arrangement to determine if separate contracts should be considered combined for the purposes of revenue recognition. In order to determine the stand-alone selling price, we conduct a periodic analysis to determine whether various goods or services have an observable stand-alone selling price as well as to identify significant changes to current stand-alone selling prices. If we do not have an observable stand-alone selling price for a particular good or service, then the stand-alone selling price for that particular good or service is estimated using an approach that maximizes the use of observable inputs. Our process for determining stand-alone selling price requires judgment and considers multiple factors that are reasonably available and maximizes the use of observable inputs that may vary over time depending upon the unique facts and circumstances related to each performance obligation. We believe that this method results in an estimate that represents the price we would charge for the product offerings if they were sold separately. Taxes, such as sales, value-added and other taxes, collected from customers concurrent with revenue generating activities and remitted to governmental authorities are not included in revenue. Shipping and handling costs associated with outbound freight are accounted for as a fulfillment cost and are included in cost of sales. The following describes the nature of our primary types of revenue and the revenue recognition policies and significant payment terms as they pertain to the types of transactions we enter into with our customers.

Table of Contents 
 Product revenue Product revenue is comprised of three major revenue streams, instrument sales, consumables, and standalone software products. Instrument sales revenue is comprised of sales of PhenoCycler and PhenoImager platforms. Consumables revenue is comprised of reagent kits. We also sell software licenses, both internally developed as well as third-party software. Our standard arrangement with our customers is generally a purchase order or an executed contract. Revenue is recognized upon transfer of title. Payment terms are generally thirty to ninety days from the date of invoicing. Service and other revenue Service and other revenue primarily consists of instrument service and warranty, instrument installation and training, and revenue generated by our ABS operation, which provides sample testing services to customers. Our services are provided primarily on a fixed fee basis; from time to time these fixed fee contracts may be invoiced at the outset of the arrangements. We recognize revenue from the sale of an extended warranty, enhanced service warranty arrangements over the respective period, while revenue on installation, training and laboratory services is recognized as the services are performed. For laboratory services, we generally use the cost-to-cost approach to measure the extent of progress towards completion of the performance obligation because we believe it best depicts the transfer of assets to the customer. Under the cost-to-cost measure approach, the extent of progress towards completion is measured based on the ratio of costs incurred to date to the total estimated costs at completion of the performance obligation. Revenues are recorded proportionally as costs are incurred. Payment terms are generally thirty to ninety days from the date of invoicing. We record shipping and handling billed to customers as service and other revenue and the related costs in cost of other revenue in our consolidated statement of operations. Contract assets and contract liabilities Our contract liabilities consist of upfront payments for service-based warranties on instrument sales, as well as lab services. We classify contract liabilities associated with service-based warranties in deferred revenue, and contract liabilities associated with lab services in accrued expenses. Contract liabilities are classified as current or noncurrent based on the timing of when we expect to service the warranty, or complete the lab services contract. Costs to obtain or fulfill a contract Under ASC 606, we are required to capitalize certain costs to obtain customer contracts and costs to fulfill customer contracts. These costs are required to be amortized to expense on a systemic basis that is consistent with the transfer to the customer of the goods or services to which the asset relates, compared to previously being expensed as incurred. As a practical expedient, we recognize any incremental costs to obtain a contract as an expense when incurred if the amortization period of the asset is one year or less. Stock-based compensation We maintain an incentive compensation plan under which incentive stock options and nonqualified stock options are granted primarily to employees, non-employee consultants, and board members. Stock-based compensation cost is measured at the grant date, based on the fair value of the award, and is recognized as expense over the requisite service period. The fair value of stock-based awards to employees is estimated using the Black-Scholes option pricing model. We record forfeitures as they occur.

 Off-balance sheet arrangements We did not have during the periods presented, and we do not currently have, any off-balance sheet arrangements, as defined in the rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission. Recent accounting pronouncements For information on recently issued accounting pronouncements, see Note 2 to our consolidated financial statements in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. JOBS Act accounting election We are an emerging growth company, as defined in the Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act of 2012, or the JOBS Act. Under the JOBS Act, emerging growth companies can delay adopting new or revised accounting standards issued subsequent to the enactment of the JOBS Act until such time as those standards apply to private companies. We have elected to avail ourselves of this extended transition period, and, as a result, we will not be required to adopt new or revised accounting standards on the relevant dates on which adoption of such standards is required for other public companies. We intend to rely on other exemptions provided by the JOBS Act, including without limitation, not being required to comply with the auditor attestation requirements of Section 404(b) of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002. Smaller reporting company status We are also a smaller reporting company, meaning that the market value of our stock held by non-affiliates is less than 700 million as of the last trading day of our second quarter and our annual revenue is less than 100 million during the most recently completed fiscal year. We may continue to be a smaller reporting company if either (i) the market value of our stock held by non-affiliates is less than 250 million as of the last trading day of our second quarter or (ii) our annual revenue is less than 100 million during the most recently completed fiscal year and the market value of our stock held by non-affiliates is less than 700 million as of the last trading day of our second quarter. If we are a smaller reporting company at the time we cease to be an emerging growth company, we may continue to rely on exemptions from certain disclosure requirements that are available to smaller reporting companies. For example, as a smaller reporting company we may choose to present only the two most recent fiscal years of audited financial statements in our Annual Report on Form 10-K and, similar to emerging growth companies, smaller reporting companies have reduced disclosure obligations regarding executive compensation. Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk We are a smaller reporting company, as defined in Rule 12b-2 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, for this reporting period and are not required to provide the information required under this item .

 Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm To the Stockholders and the Board of Directors of Akoya Biosciences, Inc. Opinion on the Financial Statements We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Akoya Biosciences, Inc. and its subsidiary (the Company) as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, the related consolidated statements of operations, comprehensive loss, redeemable convertible preferred stock and stockholders equity (deficit) and cash flows for the years then ended, and the related notes to the consolidated financial statements (collectively, the financial statements). In our opinion, the financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for the years then ended, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. Change in Accounting Principle As discussed in Note 1 to the financial statements, the Company has changed its method of accounting for leases in 2022. Basis for Opinion These financial statements are the responsibility of the Company s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company s financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB) and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. The Company is not required to have, nor were we engaged to perform, an audit of its internal control over financial reporting. As part of our audits we are required to obtain an understanding of internal control over financial reporting but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Company s internal control over financial reporting. Accordingly, we express no such opinion. Our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion. /s/ We have served as the Company s auditor since 2019. March 6, 2023

On April 8, 2021, the Board of Directors of the Company (the Board approved a 1-for- reverse stock split of its issued and outstanding common stock and a proportional adjustment to the existing conversion ratios for each series of the Company s convertible preferred stock, which was effected on April 9, 2021. The par value of the authorized stock was not adjusted as a result of the reverse stock split. Other than the par value, all issued and outstanding shares of common stock and related per share data shown in the accompanying financial statements and related notes have been retroactively revised to reflect the reverse stock split and adjustment of the Preferred Stock conversion ratios. In April 2021, the Company completed the initial public offering of its common stock (the IPO ). In the IPO, the Company issued and sold shares of its common stock at a price to the public of per share, including the exercise by the underwriters of their option to purchase an additional shares. The Company received million in net proceeds, after deducting underwriting discounts and commissions and other offering expenses. Immediately prior to completing the IPO, all preferred stock converted into shares of common stock, and all outstanding shares of the Company s Class B common stock converted on a 1 for 1 basis into shares of the Company s Class A common stock. On April 20, 2021, in connection with the closing of the IPO, the Company s amended and restated certificate of incorporation, as filed with the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware, and the Company s amended and restated bylaws became effective.

 to . For those arrangements which arise from a business combination that involve potential future contingent consideration, the Company records on the date of acquisition a liability equal to the fair value of the estimated additional consideration the Company may be obligated to make in the future. The Company re-measures this liability each reporting period and records changes in the fair value through changes in fair value of contingent consideration within the Company s consolidated statements of operations. The Company records amounts currently due as it relates to contingent consideration within accrued expenses. Increases or decreases in the fair value of the contingent consideration liability can result from changes in discount rates, periods, timing and amount of projected revenue or timing or likelihood of achieving regulatory, revenue or commercialization-based milestones. The use of alternative valuation assumptions, including estimated revenue projections, growth rates, cash flows, discount rates, useful life or probability of achieving regulatory or revenue-based milestones could result in different purchase price allocations and recognized amortization expense and contingent consideration expense or benefit in current and future periods.

 following the installation of the purchased instrument, with an extended warranty for an additional year sold in many cases. These are separate performance obligations as they are service-based warranties and are recognized on a straight-line basis over the service delivery period. After completion of the service period, customers have an option to renew or extend the warranty services, typically for additional one-year periods in exchange for additional consideration. The extended warranties are also service-based warranties that represent separate purchasing decisions. The Company recognizes revenue allocated to the extended warranty performance obligation on a straight-line basis over the service delivery period. Revenue from separately charged installation services is recognized upon completion of the installation process. Additionally, the Company provides laboratory services, in which revenue is recognized as services are performed. For laboratory services, the Company generally uses the cost-to-cost approach to measure the extent of progress towards completion of the performance obligation because the Company believes it best depicts the transfer of assets to the customer. Under the cost-to-cost measure approach, the extent of progress towards completion is measured based on the ratio of costs incurred to date to the total estimated costs at completion of the performance obligation. Revenues are recorded

 . The Acrivon Agreement is in the scope of ASC 606, Revenue from Contracts with Customers and includes one performance obligation since the underlying elements are inputs to a single development service and are not distinct within the context of the contract. Accordingly, the Company will recognize revenue over time for the transaction price in an amount proportional to the expenses incurred and the total estimated expenses to satisfy its performance obligation. Due to the uncertainty in the achievement of certain developmental, commercial, and FDA milestones, the variable consideration associated with certain future milestone payments has been fully constrained from the transaction price until such time that the Company concludes that it is probable that a significant reversal of previously recognized revenue will not occur. The costs incurred by the Company under this arrangement are included as research and development expenses in the Company s Consolidated Statements of Operations as these costs are related to the development of new services and technology to be owned and offered by the Company. Disaggregation of Revenue The Company disaggregates revenue from contracts with customers by type of products, and between service and other revenue, as it best depicts how the nature, amount, timing and uncertainty of revenue and cash flows are affected by economic factors. The following table disaggregates the Company s revenue by major source: Consumables Standalone software products Total product revenue Service and other revenue Total revenue Significant Judgments The Company s contracts with customers often include promises to transfer multiple products and services to a customer. Determining whether products and services are considered distinct performance obligations that should be accounted for separately versus together requires significant judgment. Once the Company determines the performance obligations, the Company determines the transaction price, which includes estimating the amount of variable consideration, based on the most likely amount, to be included in the transaction price, if any. The Company then allocates the transaction price to each performance obligation in the contract based on a relative standalone selling price method. The corresponding revenue is recognized as the related performance obligations are satisfied as discussed in the revenue categories above. Judgment is required to determine the standalone selling price for each distinct performance obligation. The Company determines standalone selling price based on the price at which the performance obligation in the contract (i.e. instrument, service warranty, installation) would be sold separately. As the first-year warranty for each instrument is embedded in the instrument price, the amount allocated to the first-year warranty has been determined based on the separately identifiable price of the Company s extended warranty offering when it is sold on a renewal basis.

We account for costs to develop or obtain internal-use software in accordance with ASC 350-40, Internal-Use Software, or ASC 350-40. We also account for costs of significant upgrades and enhancements resulting in additional functionality under ASC 350-40. Costs incurred for maintenance, training, and minor modifications or enhancements are expensed as incurred. Internal-use software is amortized on a straight-line basis over its estimated useful life. Management evaluates the useful lives of these assets on an annual basis and tests for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances occur that could impact the recoverability of these assets. Development costs related to internal-use software were immaterial during the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021. million and million, respectively. of deferred offering costs were included in other assets in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets. There were deferred offering costs at December 31, 2021. . The Company uses the Black-Scholes-Merton option pricing model to determine the fair value of stock options. The use of the Black-Scholes-Merton option-pricing model requires management to make assumptions with respect to the expected term of the option, the expected volatility of the common stock consistent with the expected life of the option, risk-free interest rates and expected dividend yields of the common stock. The expected term was determined according to the simplified method, which is the average of the vesting tranche dates and the contractual term. Due to the lack of company-specific historical and implied volatility, the Company bases its estimate of expected volatility on the historical volatility of a group of similar companies that are publicly traded. For these analyses, companies with comparable characteristics are selected, including enterprise value and position within the industry, and with historical price information sufficient to meet the expected life of the stock-based awards. The Company computes the historical volatility data using the daily closing prices for the selected companies shares during the equivalent period of the calculated expected term of its stock-based awards. The risk-free interest rate is determined by reference to the U.S. Treasury zero-coupon issues with remaining maturities similar to the expected term of the options. The Company has not paid, and does not anticipate paying, cash dividends on shares of common stock; therefore, the expected dividend yield is assumed to be . For restricted stock units RSUs issued under the Company s stock-based compensation plans, the fair value of each grant is calculated based on the Company s stock price on the date of grant.

The fair market value of these securities was . The Company evaluated its securities for other-than-temporary impairments based on quantitative and qualitative factors. The Company considered the decline in market value for these securities to be primarily attributable to current economic and market conditions. It is not more likely than not that the Company will be required to sell these securities, and the Company does not intend to sell these securities before the recovery of their amortized cost basis. Based on its analysis, the Company does not consider these investments to be other-than-temporarily impaired as of December 31, 2022. The Company had no material realized gains or losses on its available-for-sale securities for the year ended December 31, 2022. There were no other-than-temporary impairments recognized for the year ended December 31, 2022. The Company s recurring fair value measurements using Level 3 inputs relate to the Company s contingent consideration liability and warrant liability. In those circumstances where an acquisition involves a contingent consideration arrangement, the Company recognizes a liability equal to the fair value of the contingent payments the Company expects to make as of the acquisition date. The Company re-measures this liability each reporting period and records changes in the fair value through changes in fair value of contingent consideration on the Company s consolidated statements of operations. Increases or decreases in the fair value of the contingent consideration liability can result from changes in discount rates, periods, timing and amount of projected revenue. In September 2019, the Company entered into a Loan and Security Agreement with Innovatus Life Sciences Lending Fund I, LP Innovatus ), under which Innovatus agreed to make a term loan to the Company in an aggregate principal amount of (the Innovatus Term Loan ). In connection with the Loan and Security Agreement, the Company also issued the lender a warrant to purchase additional shares of Series D Preferred Stock, at a purchase price of per share. The expiration date of the warrant is September 27, 2029. The holder may at any time and from time to time exercise this warrant, in whole or in part, and on any exercise of the warrant, the holder may elect to receive shares equal to the full value of the warrant or a portion of its full value. Prior to the IPO, since the underlying Series D redeemable convertible preferred stock was classified outside of permanent equity, the preferred stock warrant was classified as other long-term liabilities in the accompanying balance sheet. The preferred stock warrant liability was recorded at fair value utilizing the Black-Scholes model. The Black Scholes option pricing model is based on the estimated market value of the underlying redeemable convertible preferred stock at the valuation measurement date, the remaining contractual term of the warrant, risk-free interest rates, expected dividends, and expected volatility of the price of the underlying redeemable convertible preferred stock. The Company adjusted the carrying value of the preferred stock warrant to its estimated fair value at each reporting date, with any related increase or decrease in the fair value recorded as an increase or decrease to other income (expense) in the statements of operations. In connection with the IPO, the preferred stock warrant was converted to a warrant to purchase shares of the Company s common stock, pursuant to its preexisting terms. As such, the Company assessed the classification of the common stock warrant and determined it met the criteria to be classified within stockholders equity. Accordingly, the fair value of the warrant

In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act (the CARES Act was signed into law on March 27, 2020. The CARES Act included several provisions that provide economic relief for individuals and businesses. The CARES Act, among other things, included tax provisions relating to refundable payroll tax credits, the deferral of employer s social security payments, and modifications to net operating loss carryback provisions. On December 27, 2020, the Consolidated Appropriations Act of 2021 (the CAA ), which includes the Economic Aid to Hard-Hit Small Businesses, Nonprofits, and Venues Act and the American Rescue Plan Act of 2021, was signed into law and provided further COVID-19 economic relief with an expansion of the employee retention credit. In March 2021, the Internal Revenue Service IRS released Notice 2021-20, which retroactively eliminated the restriction that prevented employers who received a PPP loan from qualifying for the Employee Retention Credit ERC ), which is a refundable tax credit against certain employment taxes. Upon determination that the employer has complied with all of the conditions required to receive the credit, a receivable is recognized and the credit reduces salaries and wages. In connection with the CARES Act, the Company adopted a policy to recognize the employee retention credit when earned. For the year ended December 31, 2021, we determined that we qualify for the employee retention credit as it relates to wages paid during the twelve months ended December 31, 2020, as well as wages paid during the first, second, and third fiscal quarters of 2021.

 Item 9. Changes in and Disagreements with Accountants on Accounting and Financial Disclosure None. Item 9A. Controls and Procedures (a) Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures. Our principal executive officer and principal financial officer, after evaluating the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Exchange Act Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e)) as of the end of the period covered by this Form 10-K, have concluded that, based on such evaluation, our disclosure controls and procedures were effective to ensure that information required to be disclosed by us in the reports that we file or submit under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported, within the time periods specified in the SEC s rules and forms, and is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our principal executive and principal financial officers, or persons performing similar functions, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. (b) Changes in Internal Controls. There were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting, identified in connection with the evaluation of such internal control that occurred during the fourth quarter of our last fiscal year that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting. (c) Management s Annual Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting. Our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting. Internal control over financial reporting is defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Exchange Act, as a process designed by, or under the supervision of, our principal executive officer and principal financial officer and effected by our board of directors, management and other personnel to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. Our internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that: pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of our assets; provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that our receipts and expenditures are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and our directors; and provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of our assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements. Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. Under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our principal executive officer and principal financial officer, we conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting based on the 2013 framework in Internal Control Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. Based on our evaluation under that framework, our management concluded that our internal controls over financial reporting were effective as of December 31, 2022. Item 9B.

(a) All payments to be made by each Borrower under any Financing Document, including payments of principal and interest made hereunder and pursuant to any other Financing Document, and all fees, expenses, indemnities and reimbursements, shall be made without set-off, recoupment or counterclaim. If any payment hereunder becomes due and payable on a day other than a Business Day, such payment shall be extended to the next succeeding Business Day and, with respect to payments of principal, interest thereon shall be payable at the then applicable rate during such extension (it being understood and agreed that, solely for purposes of calculating financial covenants and computations contained herein and determining compliance therewith, if payment is made, in full, on any such extended due date, such payment shall be deemed to have been paid on the original due date without giving effect to any extension thereto). Any payments received in the Payment Account before 12:00 Noon (Eastern time) on any date shall be deemed received by Agent on such date, and any payments received in the Payment Account at or after 12:00 Noon (Eastern time) on any date shall be deemed received by Agent on the next succeeding Business Day.

The balance in the Loan Account, as recorded in Agent s books and records at any time shall be conclusive and binding evidence of the amounts due and owing to Agent by each Borrower absent manifest error; provided , however , that any failure to so record or any error in so recording shall not limit or otherwise affect any Borrower s duty to pay all amounts owing hereunder or under any other Financing Document. Agent shall endeavor to provide Borrowers with a monthly statement regarding the Loan Account (but neither Agent nor any Lender shall have any liability if Agent shall fail to provide any such statement). Unless any Borrower notifies Agent of any objection to any such statement (specifically describing the basis for such objection) within ninety (90) days after the date of receipt thereof, it shall be deemed final, binding and conclusive upon Borrowers in all respects as to all matters reflected therein. Section 2.7 Maximum Interest . In no event shall the interest charged with respect to the Loans or any other Obligations of any Borrower under any Financing Document exceed the maximum amount permitted under the laws of the State of New York or of any other applicable jurisdiction. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein or elsewhere, if at any time the rate of interest payable hereunder or under any Note or other Financing Document (the Stated Rate would exceed the highest rate of interest permitted under any applicable law to be charged (the Maximum Lawful Rate ), then for so long as the Maximum Lawful Rate would be so exceeded, the rate of interest payable shall be equal to the Maximum Lawful Rate; provided , however , that if at any time thereafter the Stated Rate is less than the Maximum Lawful Rate, each Borrower shall, to the extent permitted by law, continue to pay interest at the Maximum Lawful Rate until such time as the total interest received is equal to the total interest which would have been received had the Stated Rate been (but for the operation of this 
 43 

 provision) the interest rate payable. Thereafter, the interest rate payable shall be the Stated Rate unless and until the Stated Rate again would exceed the Maximum Lawful Rate, in which event this provision shall again apply. In no event shall the total interest received by any Lender exceed the amount which it could lawfully have received had the interest been calculated for the full term hereof at the Maximum Lawful Rate. If, notwithstanding the prior sentence, any Lender has received interest hereunder in excess of the Maximum Lawful Rate, such excess amount shall be applied to the reduction of the principal balance of the Loans or to other amounts (other than interest) payable hereunder, and if no such principal or other amounts are then outstanding, such excess or part thereof remaining shall be paid to Borrowers. In computing interest payable with reference to the Maximum Lawful Rate applicable to any Lender, such interest shall be calculated at a daily rate equal to the Maximum Lawful Rate divided by the number of days in the year in which such calculation is made. Section 2.8 Taxes; Capital Adequacy; Increased Costs; Inability to Determine Rates; Illegality . (a) All payments of principal and interest on the Loans and all other amounts payable hereunder shall be made free and clear of and without deduction for any present or future Taxes, except as required by applicable Law.

After payment of any Tax by a Borrower to a Governmental Authority pursuant to this Section 2.8, such Borrower shall promptly forward to Agent the original or a certified copy of an official receipt, a copy of the return reporting such payment, or other documentation satisfactory to Agent evidencing such payment to such authority. Borrowers shall timely pay to the relevant Governmental Authority in accordance with applicable Law, or at the option of Agent timely reimburse Agent for the payment of, any Other Taxes. (b) The Borrowers shall indemnify Agent and Lenders, within ten (10) days after demand thereof, for the full amount of any Indemnified Taxes (including Indemnified Taxes imposed or asserted on or attributable to amounts payable under this Section 2.8) payable or paid by Agent or any Lender or required to be withheld or deducted from a payment to Agent or any Lender and any expenses arising therefrom or with respect thereto, whether or not such Indemnified Taxes and Other Taxes were correctly or legally imposed or asserted by the relevant Governmental Authority. A certificate in reasonable detail as to the amount of such payment or liability delivered to Borrowers by a Lender (with a copy to Agent), or by Agent on its own behalf or on behalf of a Lender, shall be conclusive absent manifest error. (c) Any Lender that is entitled to an exemption from or reduction of withholding Tax with respect to payments made under any Financing Document shall deliver to Borrower Representative and Agent, at the time or times prescribed by applicable Law or reasonably requested by Borrower Representative or Agent, such properly completed and executed documentation reasonably requested by Borrower Representative or Agent as will permit such payments to be made without withholding or at a reduced rate of withholding. In addition, any Lender, if reasonably requested by Borrower Representative or Agent, shall deliver such other documentation prescribed by applicable Law 
 44 

 or reasonably requested by Borrowers or Agent as will enable Borrowers or Agent to determine whether or not such Lender is subject to backup withholding or information reporting requirements. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in the preceding two sentences, the completion, execution and submission of such documentation (other than such documentation set forth in Sections 2.8(c)(i), 2.8(c)(ii) and 2.8(e) below) shall not be required if in such Lender s reasonable judgment such completion, execution or submission would subject such Lender to any material unreimbursed cost or expense or would materially prejudice the legal or commercial position of such Lender. (i) Each Lender that is not a United States person (as such term is defined in Section 7701(a)(30) of the Code) for U.S. federal income tax purposes and is a party hereto on the Closing Date or purports to become an assignee of an interest pursuant to Section 11.17(a) after the Closing Date (unless such Lender was already a Lender hereunder immediately prior to such assignment) (each such Lender a Foreign Lender shall, to the extent permitted by Law, execute and deliver to Borrower Representative and Agent (in such number of copies as shall be requested by the recipient) on or prior to the date on which such Foreign Lender becomes a Lender under this Agreement (and from time to time thereafter upon the reasonable request of the Borrower Representative or Agent) whichever of the following is applicable: (A) in the case of a Foreign Lender claiming the benefits of an income tax treaty to which the United States is a party, (x) with respect to payments of interest under any Financing Document, two (2) properly completed and executed originals of United States Internal Revenue Service IRS Forms W-8BEN or W-8BEN-E (or successor form) establishing an exemption from, or reduction of, U.S. federal withholding tax pursuant to the interest article of such tax treaty and (y) with respect to any other applicable payments under any Financing Documents, two (2) properly completed and executed originals of IRS Forms W-8BEN or W-8BEN-E (or successor form) establishing an exemption from, or reduction of, U.S. federal withholding tax pursuant to the business profits or other income article of such tax treaty; (B) two (2) executed originals of IRS Form W-8ECI (or successor form); (C) in the case of a Foreign Lender claiming the benefits of the exemption for portfolio interest under Section 881(c) of the Code, (x) a certificate substantially in the form of Exhibit E-1 to the effect that such Foreign Lender is not a bank within the meaning of Section 881(c)(3)(A) of the Code, a 10 percent shareholder of any Borrower within the meaning of Section 881(c)(3)(B) of the Code, or a controlled foreign corporation described in Section 881(c)(3)(C) of the Code (a U.S. Tax Compliance Certificate and (y) two (2) executed originals of IRS Forms W-8BEN or W-8BEN-E (or successor form); (D) to the extent a Foreign Lender is not the beneficial owner, two (2) executed originals of IRS Form W-8IMY, accompanied by IRS Form W-8ECI, IRS Form W-8BEN or W-8BEN-E (or successor form), a U.S. Tax Compliance Certificate substantially in the form of Exhibit E-2 or Exhibit E-3 , IRS Form W-9 (or successor form), and/or other certification documents from each beneficial owner, as applicable; provided that if the Foreign Lender is a partnership and one or more direct or indirect partners of such Foreign Lender are claiming the portfolio interest exemption, such Foreign Lender may provide a U.S. Tax Compliance Certificate substantially in the form of Exhibit E-4 on behalf of each such direct and indirect partner; or (E) other applicable forms, certificates or documents prescribed by the IRS. Each Lender agrees that if any form or certification it previously delivered expires or becomes obsolete or inaccurate in any respect, it shall update such form or certification or promptly notify Borrower Representative and Agent in writing of its legal inability to do so. In addition, to the extent permitted by applicable Law, such forms shall be delivered by each Foreign Lender upon the obsolescence or invalidity of any form previously delivered by such Foreign Lender. Each Foreign Lender shall promptly notify Borrower Representative at any time it determines that it is 
 45 

 no longer in a position to provide any previously delivered certificate to Borrower Representative (or any other form of certification adopted by the U.S. taxing authorities for such purpose). (ii) Each Lender that is a United States person (as such term is defined in Section 7701(a)(30) of the Code) for U.S. federal income tax purposes and is a party hereto on the Closing Date or purports to become an assignee of an interest pursuant to Section 11.17(a) after the Closing Date (unless such Lender was already a Lender hereunder immediately prior to such assignment) shall, to the extent permitted by Law, provide to Borrower Representative and Agent on or prior to the date on which such Lender becomes a Lender under this Agreement (and from time to time thereafter upon the reasonable request of the Borrower Representative or Agent), a properly completed and executed IRS Form W-9 or any successor form certifying as to such Lender s entitlement to an exemption from U.S. backup withholding and other applicable forms, certificates or documents prescribed by the IRS or reasonably requested by Borrower Representative or Agent. Each such Lender shall promptly notify Borrowers at any time it determines that any certificate previously delivered to Borrower Representative (or any other form of certification adopted by the U.S. governmental authorities for such purposes) is no longer valid. (iii) Any Foreign Lender shall, to the extent it is legally entitled to do so, deliver to Borrower Representative and Agent (in such number of copies as shall be requested by the recipient) on or prior to the date on which such Foreign Lender becomes a Lender under this Agreement (and from time to time thereafter upon the reasonable request of the Borrower Representative or Agent), executed copies of any other form prescribed by applicable Law as a basis for claiming exemption from or a reduction in U.S. Federal withholding Tax, duly completed, together with such supplementary documentation as may be prescribed by applicable law to permit Borrowers or Agent to determine the withholding or deduction required to be made. (d) If any Lender determines, in its reasonable discretion, that it has received a refund in respect of any Taxes as to which it has been indemnified by any Borrower pursuant to this Section 2.8 (including by the payment of additional amounts pursuant to this Section 2.8), then it shall promptly pay an amount equal to such refund to Borrowers, net of all reasonable out-of-pocket expenses of such Lender or of Agent with respect thereto, including any Taxes; provided , however , that Borrowers, upon the written request of such Lender or Agent, agree to repay any amount paid over to Borrowers to such Lender or to Agent (plus any related penalties, interest or other charges imposed by the relevant Governmental Authority) in the event such Lender or Agent is required, for any reason, to repay such refund to such Governmental Authority. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Section 2.8, in no event will the indemnified party be required to pay any amount to an indemnifying party pursuant to this Section 2.8(d) the payment of which would place the indemnified party in a less favorable net after-Tax position than the indemnified party would have been in if the Tax subject to indemnification and giving rise to such refund had not been deducted, withheld or otherwise imposed and the indemnification payments or additional amounts with respect to such Tax had never been paid. This Section 2.8 shall not be construed to require any indemnified party to make available its Tax returns (or any other information relating to its Taxes that it deems confidential) to the indemnifying party or any other Person. (e) If a payment made to a Lender under any Financing Document would be subject to U.S. federal withholding tax imposed by FATCA if such Lender were to fail to comply with the applicable reporting requirements of FATCA (including those contained in Section 1471(b) or 1472(b) of the Code, as applicable), such Lender shall deliver to Borrower Representative and Agent at the time 
 46 

 or times prescribed by Law and at such time or times reasonably requested by Borrower Representative or Agent such documentation prescribed by applicable Law (including as prescribed by Section 1471(b)(3)(C)(i) of the Code) and such additional documentation reasonably requested by Borrower Representative or Agent as may be necessary for Borrowers and Agent to comply with their obligations under FATCA and to determine that such Lender has complied with such Lender s obligations under FATCA or to determine the amount to deduct and withhold from such payment. Solely for purposes of this clause (e), FATCA shall include any amendments made to FATCA after the date of this Agreement. (f) Each Lender shall severally indemnify Agent, within ten (10) days after demand therefor, for (i) any Indemnified Taxes attributable to such Lender (but only to the extent that any Credit Party has not already indemnified Agent for such Indemnified Taxes and without limiting the obligation of the Credit Parties to do so), (ii) any Taxes attributable to such Lender s failure to comply with the provisions of Section 11.17 relating to the maintenance of a Participant Register and (iii) any Excluded Taxes attributable to such Lender, in each case, that are payable or paid by Agent in connection with any Financing Document, and any reasonable expenses arising therefrom or with respect thereto, whether or not such Taxes were correctly or legally imposed or asserted by the relevant Governmental Authority. A certificate as to the amount of such payment or liability delivered to any Lender by Agent shall be conclusive absent manifest error. Each Lender hereby authorizes Agent to set off and apply any and all amounts at any time owing to such Lender under any Financing Document or otherwise payable by Agent to such Lender from any other source against any amount due to Agent under this paragraph (f). (g) If any Lender shall reasonably determine that the adoption or taking effect of, or any change in, any applicable Law regarding capital adequacy, in each instance, after the Closing Date, or any change after the Closing Date in the interpretation, administration or application thereof by any Governmental Authority, central bank or comparable agency charged with the interpretation, administration or application thereof, or the compliance by any Lender or any Person controlling such Lender with any request, guideline or directive regarding capital adequacy (whether or not having the force of Law) of any such Governmental Authority, central bank or comparable agency adopted or otherwise taking effect after the Closing Date, has or would have the effect of reducing the rate of return on such Lender s or such controlling Person s capital as a consequence of such Lender s obligations hereunder to a level below that which such Lender or such controlling Person could have achieved but for such adoption, taking effect, change, interpretation, administration, application or compliance (taking into consideration such Lender s or such controlling Person s policies with respect to capital adequacy) then from time to time, upon demand by such Lender (which demand shall be accompanied by a certificate setting forth the basis for such demand and a calculation of the amount thereof in reasonable detail, a copy of which shall be furnished to Agent), Borrowers shall promptly pay to such Lender such additional amount as will compensate such Lender or such controlling Person for such reduction, so long as such amounts have accrued on or after the day which is two hundred seventy (270) days prior to the date on which such Lender first made demand therefor; provided that notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, (i) the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act and all requests, rules, guidelines or directives thereunder or issued in connection therewith and (ii) all requests, rules, guidelines or directives promulgated by the Bank for International Settlements, the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision (or any successor or similar authority) or the United States or foreign regulatory authorities, in each case pursuant to Basel III, shall in each case be deemed to be a change in applicable Law , regardless of the date enacted, adopted or issued; provided; further; that this Section 2.8(h) shall apply only to Taxes that are not (A) Indemnified Taxes, (B) Taxes 
 47 

 described in clauses (b) through (d) of the definition of Excluded Taxes, or (c) Connection Income Taxes. (h) If any Lender shall reasonably determine that the adoption or taking effect of, or any change in, any applicable Law shall (i) impose, modify or deem applicable any reserve, special deposit, compulsory loan, insurance charge or similar requirement against assets of, deposits with or for the account of, or credit extended or participated in by, any Lender, (ii) subject any Lender to any tax of any kind whatsoever with respect to this Agreement, or any SOFR Loan made by it, or change the basis of taxation of payments to such Lender in respect thereof (except for Taxes covered by Section 2.8); or (iii) impose on any Lender any other condition, cost or expense affecting this Agreement or SOFR Loans made by such Lender, and the result of any of the foregoing shall be to increase the cost to such Lender of making or maintaining any Loan the interest on which is determined by reference to Term SOFR (or of maintaining its obligation to make any such Loan), or to reduce the amount of any sum received or receivable by such Lender (whether of principal, interest or any other amount) then, upon request of such Lender, the Borrowers will pay to such Lender such additional amount or amounts as will compensate such Lender for such additional costs incurred or reduction suffered. (i) If any Lender requests compensation under the clauses of this Section 2.8, or requires Borrowers to pay any additional amount to any Lender or any Governmental Authority for the account of any Lender pursuant to Section 2.8, then, upon the written request of Borrower Representative, such Lender shall use reasonable efforts to designate a different lending office for funding or booking its Loans hereunder or to assign its rights and obligations hereunder (subject to the provisions of Section 11.17) to another of its offices, branches or affiliates, if, in the reasonable judgment of such Lender, such designation or assignment (i) would eliminate or materially reduce amounts payable pursuant to any such Section, as the case may be, in the future, (ii) would not subject such Lender to any unreimbursed cost or expense and (iii) would not otherwise be disadvantageous to such Lender (as determined in its sole good faith discretion). Without limitation of the provisions of Section 12.14, each Borrower hereby agrees to pay all reasonable and documented, out-of-pocket costs and expenses incurred by any Lender in connection with any such designation or assignment . (j) Subject to Section 2.2(k), if Agent determines (which determination shall be conclusive and binding absent manifest error) that Term SOFR cannot be determined pursuant to the definition thereof on or prior to the first day of any Interest Period, Agent will promptly so notify the Borrowers and each Lender. Upon notice thereof by Agent to Borrowers, any obligation of the Lenders to make SOFR Loans shall be suspended until Agent revokes such notice. Upon receipt of such notice, any outstanding affected SOFR Loans will be deemed to have been converted into Base Rate Loans at the end of the applicable Interest Period. Upon any such conversion, Borrower shall also pay any additional amounts required pursuant to this Agreement. (k) If any Lender determines that any Law has made it unlawful, or that any Governmental Authority has asserted that it is unlawful, for any Lender or its applicable lending office to make, maintain or fund SOFR Loans, or to determine or charge interest rates based upon Term SOFR, then, upon notice thereof by such Lender to Borrowers (through Agent), any obligation of such Lender to make SOFR Loans shall be suspended, in each case until such Lender notifies Agent and Borrower that the circumstances giving rise to such determination no longer exist. Upon receipt of such notice, all SOFR Loans shall become Base Rate Loans. Upon any such conversion, Borrower shall also pay any additional amounts required pursuant to this Agreement. 
 48 

 (l) Each party s obligations under this Section 2.8 shall survive the resignation or replacement of Agent or any assignment of rights by, or the replacement of, a Lender, and the repayment, satisfaction or discharge of all Obligations hereunder. Section 2.9 Appointment of Borrower Representative . (a) Each Borrower hereby irrevocably appoints and constitutes Borrower Representative as its agent and attorney-in-fact to request and receive Loans in the name or on behalf of such Borrower and any other Borrowers, deliver Notices of Borrowing, give instructions with respect to the disbursement of the proceeds of the Loans, giving and receiving all other notices and consents hereunder or under any of the other Financing Documents and taking all other actions (including in respect of compliance with covenants) in the name or on behalf of any Borrower or Borrowers pursuant to this Agreement and the other Financing Documents. Agent and Lenders may disburse the Loans to such bank account of Borrower Representative or a Borrower or otherwise make such Loans to a Borrower, in each case as Borrower Representative may designate or direct, without notice to any other Borrower. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, Agent may at any time and from time to time require that Loans to or for the account of any Borrower be disbursed directly to an operating account of such Borrower. (b) Borrower Representative hereby accepts the appointment by Borrowers to act as the agent and attorney-in-fact of Borrowers pursuant to this Section 2.9. Borrower Representative shall ensure that the disbursement of any Loans that are at any time requested by or to be remitted to or for the account of a Borrower, shall be remitted or issued to or for the account of such Borrower. (c) Each Borrower hereby irrevocably appoints and constitutes Borrower Representative as its agent to receive statements on account and all other notices from Agent, Lenders with respect to the Obligations or otherwise under or in connection with this Agreement and the other Financing Documents. (d) Any notice, election, representation, warranty, agreement or undertaking made or delivered by or on behalf of any Borrower by Borrower Representative shall be deemed for all purposes to have been made or delivered by such Borrower, as the case may be, and shall be binding upon and enforceable against such Borrower to the same extent as if made or delivered directly by such Borrower. (e) No resignation by or termination of the appointment of Borrower Representative as agent and attorney-in-fact as aforesaid shall be effective, except after ten (10) Business Days prior written notice to Agent. If the Borrower Representative resigns under this Agreement, Borrowers shall be entitled to appoint a successor Borrower Representative (which shall be a Borrower and shall be reasonably acceptable to Agent as such successor). Upon the acceptance of its appointment as successor Borrower Representative hereunder, such successor Borrower Representative shall succeed to all the rights, powers and duties of the retiring Borrower Representative and the term Borrower Representative means such successor Borrower Representative for all purposes of this Agreement and the other Financing Documents, and the retiring or terminated Borrower Representative s appointment, powers and duties as Borrower Representative shall be thereupon terminated. Section 2.10 Joint and Several Liability; Rights of Contribution; Subordination and Subrogation . (a) Borrowers are defined collectively to include all Persons named as one of the Borrowers herein; provided, however , that any references herein to any Borrower , each Borrower or 
 49 

 similar references, shall be construed as a reference to each individual Person named as one of the Borrowers herein. Each Person so named shall be jointly and severally liable for all of the obligations of Borrowers under this Agreement. Each Borrower, individually, expressly understands, agrees and acknowledges, that the credit facilities would not be made available on the terms herein in the absence of the collective credit of all of the Persons named as the Borrowers herein, the joint and several liability of all such Persons, and the cross-collateralization of the collateral of all such Persons. Accordingly, each Borrower individually acknowledges that the benefit to each of the Persons named as one of the Borrowers as a whole constitutes reasonably equivalent value, regardless of the amount of the credit facilities actually borrowed by, advanced to, or the amount of collateral provided by, any individual Borrower. In addition, each entity named as one of the Borrowers herein hereby acknowledges and agrees that all of the representations, warranties, covenants, obligations, conditions, agreements and other terms contained in this Agreement shall be applicable to and shall be binding upon and measured and enforceable individually against each Person named as one of the Borrowers herein as well as all such Persons when taken together. By way of illustration, but without limiting the generality of the foregoing, the terms of Section 10.1 of this Agreement are to be applied to each individual Person named as one of the Borrowers herein (as well as to all such Persons taken as a whole), such that the occurrence of any of the events described in Section 10.1 of this Agreement as to any Person named as one of the Borrowers herein shall constitute an Event of Default even if such event has not occurred as to any other Persons named as the Borrowers or as to all such Persons taken as a whole. (b) Notwithstanding any provisions of this Agreement to the contrary, it is intended that the joint and several nature of the liability of each Borrower for the Obligations and the Liens granted by Borrowers to secure the Obligations not constitute a Fraudulent Conveyance (as defined below). Consequently, Agent, Lenders and each Borrower agree that if the liability of a Borrower for the Obligations or any Liens granted by such Borrower securing the Obligations would, but for the application of this sentence, constitute a Fraudulent Conveyance, the liability of such Borrower and the Liens securing such liability shall be valid and enforceable only to the maximum extent that would not cause such liability or such Lien to constitute a Fraudulent Conveyance, and the liability of such Borrower and this Agreement shall automatically be deemed to have been amended accordingly.

 81 

 Share), and/or (b) by notice to Borrower Representative declare all or any portion of the Obligations to be, and the Obligations shall thereupon become, immediately due and payable, with accrued interest thereon, without presentment, demand, protest or other notice of any kind, all of which are hereby waived by each Borrower and Borrowers will pay the same; provided , however , that in the case of any of the Events of Default specified in Section 10.1(e) or 10.1(f) above, without any notice to any Borrower or any other act by Agent or the Lenders, the Term Loan Commitment and the obligations of Agent and the Lenders with respect thereto shall thereupon immediately and automatically terminate and all of the Obligations shall become immediately and automatically due and payable without presentment, demand, protest or other notice of any kind, all of which are hereby waived by each Borrower and Borrowers will pay the same. Section 10.3 UCC Remedies . (a) Upon the occurrence of and during the continuance of an Event of Default under this Agreement or the other Financing Documents, Agent, in addition to all other rights, options, and remedies granted to Agent under this Agreement or at law or in equity, may exercise, either directly or through one or more assignees or designees, all rights and remedies granted to it under all Financing Documents and under the UCC in effect in the applicable jurisdiction(s) and under any other applicable law, including, without limitation: (i) the right to take possession of, send notices regarding, and collect directly the Collateral, with or without judicial process; (ii) the right to (by its own means or with judicial assistance) enter any of Borrowers premises and take possession of the Collateral, or render it unusable, or to render it usable or saleable, or dispose of the Collateral on such premises in compliance with subsection (iii) below and to take possession of Borrowers original books and records, to obtain access to Borrowers data processing equipment, computer hardware and software relating to the Collateral and to use all of the foregoing and the information contained therein in any manner Agent deems appropriate, without any liability for rent, storage, utilities, or other sums, and Borrowers shall not resist or interfere with such action (if Borrowers books and records are prepared or maintained by an accounting service, contractor or other third party agent, Borrowers hereby irrevocably authorize such service, contractor or other agent, upon notice by Agent to such Person that an Event of Default has occurred and is continuing, to deliver to Agent or its designees such books and records, and to follow Agent s instructions with respect to further services to be rendered); (iii) the right to require Borrowers at Borrowers expense to assemble all or any part of the Collateral and make it available to Agent at any place designated by Lender; (iv) the right to notify postal authorities to change the address for delivery of Borrowers mail to an address designated by Agent and to receive, open and dispose of all mail addressed to any Borrower; and/or (v) the right to enforce Borrowers rights against Account Debtors and other obligors, including, without limitation, (i) the right to collect Accounts directly in Agent s own name (as agent for Lenders) and to charge the collection costs and expenses, including documented out-of-pocket attorneys fees, to Borrowers, and (ii) the right, in the name of Agent or any designee of Agent or Borrowers, to verify the validity, amount or any other matter relating to any Accounts by mail, telephone, telegraph or otherwise, including, without limitation, 
 82 

 verification of Borrowers compliance with applicable Laws. Borrowers shall cooperate fully with Agent in an effort to facilitate and promptly conclude such verification process. Such verification may include contacts between Agent and applicable federal, state and local regulatory authorities having jurisdiction over the Borrowers affairs, all of which contacts Borrowers hereby irrevocably authorize. (b) Each Borrower agrees that a notice received by it at least ten (10) days before the time of any intended public sale, or the time after which any private sale or other disposition of the Collateral is to be made, shall be deemed to be reasonable notice of such sale or other disposition. If permitted by applicable law, any perishable Collateral which threatens to speedily decline in value or which is sold on a recognized market may be sold immediately by Agent without prior notice to Borrowers. At any sale or disposition of Collateral, Agent may (to the extent permitted by applicable law) purchase all or any part of the Collateral, free from any right of redemption by Borrowers, which right is hereby waived and released. Each Borrower covenants and agrees not to interfere with or impose any obstacle to Agent s exercise of its rights and remedies with respect to the Collateral. Agent shall have no obligation to clean-up or otherwise prepare the Collateral for sale. Agent may comply with any applicable state or federal law requirements in connection with a disposition of the Collateral and compliance will not be considered to adversely affect the commercial reasonableness of any sale of the Collateral. Agent may sell the Collateral without giving any warranties as to the Collateral. Agent may specifically disclaim any warranties of title or the like. This procedure will not be considered to adversely affect the commercial reasonableness of any sale of the Collateral. If Agent sells any of the Collateral upon credit, Borrowers will be credited only with payments actually made by the purchaser, received by Agent and applied to the indebtedness of the purchaser. In the event the purchaser fails to pay for the Collateral, Agent may resell the Collateral and Borrowers shall be credited with the proceeds of the sale. Borrowers shall remain liable for any deficiency if the proceeds of any sale or disposition of the Collateral are insufficient to pay all Obligations. (c) Without restricting the generality of the foregoing and for the purposes aforesaid, each Borrower hereby appoints and constitutes Agent its lawful attorney-in-fact with full power of substitution in the Collateral, upon the occurrence and during the continuance of an Event of Default, to (i) use unadvanced funds remaining under this Agreement or which may be reserved, escrowed or set aside for any purposes hereunder at any time, or to advance funds in excess of the face amount of the Notes, (ii) pay, settle or compromise all existing bills and claims, which may be Liens or security interests, or to avoid such bills and claims becoming Liens against the Collateral, (iii) execute all applications and certificates in the name of such Borrower and to prosecute and defend all actions or proceedings in connection with the Collateral, and (iv) do any and every act which such Borrower might do in its own behalf; it being understood and agreed that this power of attorney in this subsection (c) shall be a power coupled with an interest and cannot be revoked. (d) Upon the occurrence and during the continuance of an Event of Default, subject to any right of any third parties and/or any agreement between any Borrower and any third party to the extent not granted or entered into in contravention of the terms of this Agreement, Agent and each Lender is hereby granted a non-exclusive, royalty-free license or other right to use, without charge, Borrowers labels, mask works, rights of use of any name, any other Intellectual Property and advertising matter, and any similar property as it pertains to the Collateral, in completing production of, advertising for sale, and selling any Collateral and, in connection with Agent s exercise of its rights under this Article, Borrowers rights under all licenses (whether as licensor or licensee) and all franchise agreements inure to Agent s and each Lender s benefit. 
 83 

 Section 10.4 Reserved. Section 10.5 Default Rate of Interest . At the election of Agent or Required Lenders, after the occurrence of an Event of Default and for so long as it continues, the Loans and other Obligations shall bear interest at rates that are three percent (3.0 per annum in excess of the rates otherwise payable under this Agreement; provided, however , that in the case of any Event of Default specified in Section 10.1(e) or 10.1(f) above, such default rates shall apply immediately and automatically without the need for any election or action of any kind on the part of Agent or any Lender. Section 10.6 Setoff Rights . During the continuance of any Event of Default, each Lender is hereby authorized by each Borrower at any time or from time to time, with reasonably prompt subsequent notice to such Borrower (any prior or contemporaneous notice being hereby expressly waived) to set off and to appropriate and to apply any and all (a) balances held by such Lender or any of such Lender s Affiliates at any of its offices for the account of such Borrower or any of its Subsidiaries (regardless of whether such balances are then due to such Borrower or its Subsidiaries), and (b) other property at any time held or owing by such Lender to or for the credit or for the account of such Borrower or any of its Subsidiaries, against and on account of any of the Obligations (other than contingent obligations for which no claim has been made); except that no Lender shall exercise any such right without the prior written consent of Agent. Any Lender exercising a right to set off shall purchase for cash (and the other Lenders shall sell) interests in each of such other Lender s Pro Rata Share of the Obligations as would be necessary to cause all Lenders to share the amount so set off with each other Lender in accordance with their respective Pro Rata Share of the Obligations. Each Borrower agrees, to the fullest extent permitted by law, that any Lender and any of such Lender s Affiliates may exercise its right to set off with respect to the Obligations as provided in this Section 10.6. Section 10.7 Application of Proceeds . (a) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, upon the occurrence and during the continuance of an Event of Default, each Borrower irrevocably waives the right to direct the application of any and all payments at any time or times thereafter received by Agent from or on behalf of such Borrower or any Guarantor of all or any part of the Obligations, and, as between Borrowers on the one hand and Agent and Lenders on the other, Agent shall have the continuing and exclusive right to apply and to reapply any and all payments received against the Obligations in such manner as Agent may deem advisable notwithstanding any previous application by Agent. (b) Following the occurrence and during the continuance of an Event of Default, but absent the occurrence and continuance of an Acceleration Event, Agent shall apply any and all payments received by Agent in respect of the Obligations, and any and all proceeds of Collateral received by Agent, in such order as Agent may from time to time elect. (c) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, if an Acceleration Event shall have occurred, and so long as it continues, Agent shall apply any and all payments received by Agent in respect of the Obligations, and any and all proceeds of Collateral received by Agent, in the following order: first , to all fees, costs, indemnities, liabilities, obligations and expenses incurred by or owing to Agent with respect to this Agreement, the other Financing Documents or the Collateral; second , to all fees, costs, indemnities, liabilities, obligations and expenses incurred by or owing to any Lender with respect to this Agreement, the other Financing Documents or the Collateral; third , to accrued and unpaid interest on the Obligations (including any interest which, but for the provisions of the Bankruptcy Code, would have accrued on such amounts); fourth , to the 
 84 

 principal amount of the Obligations outstanding; and fifth , to any other indebtedness or obligations of Borrowers owing to Agent or any Lender under the Financing Documents. Any balance remaining shall be delivered to Borrowers or to whomever may be lawfully entitled to receive such balance or as a court of competent jurisdiction may direct. In carrying out the foregoing, (y) amounts received shall be applied in the numerical order provided until exhausted prior to the application to the next succeeding category, and (z) each of the Persons entitled to receive a payment in any particular category shall receive an amount equal to its Pro Rata Share of amounts available to be applied pursuant thereto for such category. Section 10.8 Waivers . (a) Except as otherwise provided for in this Agreement and to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, each Borrower waives: (i) presentment, demand and protest, and notice of presentment, dishonor, intent to accelerate, acceleration, protest, default, nonpayment, maturity, release, compromise, settlement, extension or renewal of any or all Financing Documents, the Notes or any other notes, commercial paper, accounts, contracts, documents, Instruments, Chattel Paper and Guarantees at any time held by Lenders on which any Borrower may in any way be liable, and hereby ratifies and confirms whatever Lenders may do in this regard; (ii) all rights to notice and a hearing prior to Agent s or any Lender s taking possession or control of, or to Agent s or any Lender s replevy, attachment or levy upon, any Collateral or any bond or security which might be required by any court prior to allowing Agent or any Lender to exercise any of its remedies; and (iii) the benefit of all valuation, appraisal and exemption Laws. Each Borrower acknowledges that it has been advised by counsel of its choices and decisions with respect to this Agreement, the other Financing Documents and the transactions evidenced hereby and thereby. (b) Each Borrower for itself and all its successors and assigns, (i) agrees that its liability shall not be in any manner affected by any indulgence, extension of time, renewal, waiver, or modification granted or consented to by Lender; (ii) consents to any indulgences and all extensions of time, renewals, waivers, or modifications that may be granted by Agent or any Lender with respect to the payment or other provisions of the Financing Documents, and to any substitution, exchange or release of the Collateral, or any part thereof, with or without substitution, and agrees to the addition or release of any Borrower, endorsers, guarantors, or sureties, or whether primarily or secondarily liable, without notice to any other Borrower and without affecting its liability hereunder; (iii) agrees that its liability shall be unconditional and without regard to the liability of any other Borrower, Agent or any Lender for any tax on the indebtedness; and (iv) to the fullest extent permitted by law, expressly waives the benefit of any statute or rule of law or equity now provided, or which may hereafter be provided, which would produce a result contrary to or in conflict with the foregoing. (c) To the extent that Agent or any Lender may have acquiesced in any noncompliance with any requirements or conditions precedent to the closing of the Loans or to any subsequent disbursement of Loan proceeds, such acquiescence shall not be deemed to constitute a waiver by Agent or any Lender of such requirements with respect to any future disbursements of Loan proceeds and Agent may at any time after such acquiescence require Borrowers to comply with all such requirements. Any forbearance by Agent or Lender in exercising any right or remedy under any of the Financing Documents, or otherwise afforded by applicable law, including any failure to accelerate the maturity date of the Loans, shall not be a waiver of or preclude the exercise of any right or remedy nor shall it serve as a novation of the Notes or as a reinstatement of the Loans or a waiver of such right of acceleration or the right to insist upon strict compliance of the terms of the Financing Documents. Agent s or any Lender s acceptance of payment of any sum secured by any of the Financing Documents after the due date of such payment shall not be a waiver of Agent s and such Lender s right to either 
 85 

 require prompt payment when due of all other sums so secured or to declare a default for failure to make prompt payment. The procurement of insurance or the payment of taxes or other Liens or charges by Agent as the result of an Event of Default shall not be a waiver of Agent s right to accelerate the maturity of the Loans, nor shall Agent s receipt of any condemnation awards, insurance proceeds, or damages under this Agreement operate to cure or waive any Credit Party s default in payment of sums secured by any of the Financing Documents. (d) Without limiting the generality of anything contained in this Agreement or the other Financing Documents, each Borrower agrees that if an Event of Default is continuing (i) Agent and Lenders shall not be subject to any one action or election of remedies law or rule, and (ii) all Liens and other rights, remedies or privileges provided to Agent or Lenders shall remain in full force and effect until Agent or Lenders have exhausted all remedies against the Collateral and any other properties owned by Borrowers and the Financing Documents and other security instruments or agreements securing the Loans have been foreclosed, sold and/or otherwise realized upon in satisfaction of Borrowers obligations under the Financing Documents. (e) Nothing contained herein or in any other Financing Document shall be construed as requiring Agent or any Lender to resort to any part of the Collateral for the satisfaction of any of Borrowers obligations under the Financing Documents in preference or priority to any other Collateral, and Agent may seek satisfaction out of all of the Collateral or any part thereof, in its absolute discretion in respect of Borrowers obligations under the Financing Documents. In addition, Agent shall have the right from time to time to partially foreclose upon any Collateral in any manner and for any amounts secured by the Financing Documents then due and payable as determined by Agent in its sole discretion, including, without limitation, the following circumstances: (i) in the event any Borrower defaults beyond any applicable grace period in the payment of one or more scheduled payments of principal and/or interest, Agent may foreclose upon all or any part of the Collateral to recover such delinquent payments, or (ii) in the event Agent elects to accelerate less than the entire outstanding principal balance of the Loans, Agent may foreclose all or any part of the Collateral to recover so much of the principal balance of the Loans as Lender may accelerate and such other sums secured by one or more of the Financing Documents as Agent may elect. Notwithstanding one or more partial foreclosures, any unforeclosed Collateral shall remain subject to the Financing Documents to secure payment of sums secured by the Financing Documents and not previously recovered. (f) To the fullest extent permitted by law, each Borrower, for itself and its successors and assigns, waives in the event of foreclosure of any or all of the Collateral any equitable right otherwise available to any Credit Party which would require the separate sale of any of the Collateral or require Agent or Lenders to exhaust their remedies against any part of the Collateral before proceeding against any other part of the Collateral; and further in the event of such foreclosure each Borrower does hereby expressly consent to and authorize, at the option of Agent, the foreclosure and sale either separately or together of each part of the Collateral. Section 10.9 Injunctive Relief . The parties acknowledge and agree that, in the event of a breach or threatened breach of any Credit Party s obligations under any Financing Documents, Agent and Lenders may have no adequate remedy in money damages and, accordingly, shall be entitled to an injunction (including, without limitation, a temporary restraining order, preliminary injunction, writ of attachment, or order compelling an audit) against such breach or threatened breach, including, without limitation, maintaining any cash management and collection procedure described herein. However, no specification in this Agreement of a specific legal or equitable remedy shall be construed as a waiver or prohibition against any other legal or equitable remedies in the event of a breach or threatened breach of any provision of this Agreement. Each Credit Party waives, to the fullest extent permitted by law, the 
 86 

 requirement of the posting of any bond in connection with such injunctive relief. By joining in the Financing Documents as a Credit Party, each Credit Party specifically joins in this Section as if this Section were a part of each Financing Document executed by such Credit Party. Section 10.10 Marshalling; Payments Set Aside . Neither Agent nor any Lender shall be under any obligation to marshal any assets in payment of any or all of the Obligations. To the extent that Borrower makes any payment or Agent enforces its Liens or Agent or any Lender exercises its right of set-off, and such payment or the proceeds of such enforcement or set-off is subsequently invalidated, declared to be fraudulent or preferential, set aside, or required to be repaid by anyone, then to the extent of such recovery, the Obligations or part thereof originally intended to be satisfied, and all Liens, rights and remedies therefor, shall be revived and continued in full force and effect as if such payment had not been made or such enforcement or set-off had not occurred. ARTICLE 11 - AGENT Section 11.1 Appointment and Authorization . Each Lender hereby irrevocably appoints and authorizes Agent to enter into each of the Financing Documents to which it is a party (other than this Agreement) on its behalf and to take such actions as Agent on its behalf and to exercise such powers under the Financing Documents as are delegated to Agent by the terms thereof, together with all such powers as are reasonably incidental thereto. Subject to the terms of Section 11.16 and to the terms of the other Financing Documents, Agent is authorized and empowered to amend, modify, or waive any provisions of this Agreement or the other Financing Documents on behalf of Lenders. The provisions of this Article 11 are solely for the benefit of Agent and Lenders and neither any Borrower nor any other Credit Party shall have any rights as a third party beneficiary of any of the provisions hereof. In performing its functions and duties under this Agreement, Agent shall act solely as agent of Lenders and does not assume and shall not be deemed to have assumed any obligation toward or relationship of agency or trust with or for any Borrower or any other Credit Party. Agent may perform any of its duties hereunder, or under the Financing Documents, by or through its agents, servicers, trustees, investment managers or employees. Section 11.2 Agent and Affiliates . Agent shall have the same rights and powers under the Financing Documents as any other Lender and may exercise or refrain from exercising the same as though it were not Agent, and Agent and its Affiliates may lend money to, invest in and generally engage in any kind of business with each Credit Party or Affiliate of any Credit Party as if it were not Agent hereunder. Section 11.3 Action by Agent . The duties of Agent shall be mechanical and administrative in nature. Agent shall not have by reason of this Agreement a fiduciary relationship in respect of any Lender. Nothing in this Agreement or any of the Financing Documents is intended to or shall be construed to impose upon Agent any obligations in respect of this Agreement or any of the Financing Documents except as expressly set forth herein or therein. Section 11.4 Consultation with Experts . Agent may consult with legal counsel, independent public accountants and other experts selected by it and shall not be liable for any action taken or omitted to be taken by it in good faith in accordance with the advice of such counsel, accountants or experts. Section 11.5 Liability of Agent . Neither Agent nor any of its directors, officers, agents, trustees, investment managers, servicers or employees shall be liable to any Lender for any action taken or not taken by it in connection with the Financing Documents, except that Agent shall be liable with respect to its specific duties set forth hereunder but only to the extent of its own gross negligence or 
 87 

 willful misconduct in the discharge thereof as determined by a final non-appealable judgment of a court of competent jurisdiction. Neither Agent nor any of its directors, officers, agents, trustees, investment managers, servicers or employees shall be responsible for or have any duty to ascertain, inquire into or verify (a) any statement, warranty or representation made in connection with any Financing Document or any borrowing hereunder; (b) the performance or observance of any of the covenants or agreements specified in any Financing Document; (c) the satisfaction of any condition specified in any Financing Document; (d) the validity, effectiveness, sufficiency or genuineness of any Financing Document, any Lien purported to be created or perfected thereby or any other instrument or writing furnished in connection therewith; (e) the existence or non-existence of any Default or Event of Default; or (f) the financial condition of any Credit Party. Agent shall not incur any liability by acting in reliance upon any notice, consent, certificate, statement, or other writing (which may be a bank wire, facsimile or electronic transmission or similar writing) believed by it to be genuine or to be signed by the proper party or parties. Agent shall not be liable for any apportionment or distribution of payments made by it in good faith and if any such apportionment or distribution is subsequently determined to have been made in error the sole recourse of any Lender to whom payment was due but not made, shall be to recover from other Lenders any payment in excess of the amount to which they are determined to be entitled (and such other Lenders hereby agree to return to such Lender any such erroneous payments received by them). Section 11.6 Indemnification . Each Lender shall, in accordance with its Pro Rata Share, indemnify Agent (to the extent not reimbursed by Borrowers) upon demand against any cost, expense (including counsel fees and disbursements), claim, demand, action, loss or liability (except such as result from Agent s gross negligence or willful misconduct as determined by a final non-appealable judgment of a court of competent jurisdiction) that Agent may suffer or incur in connection with the Financing Documents or any action taken or omitted by Agent hereunder or thereunder. If any indemnity furnished to Agent for any purpose shall, in the opinion of Agent, be insufficient or become impaired, Agent may call for additional indemnity and cease, or not commence, to do the acts indemnified against even if so directed by Required Lenders until such additional indemnity is furnished. Section 11.7 Right to Request and Act on Instructions . Agent may at any time request instructions from Lenders with respect to any actions or approvals which by the terms of this Agreement or of any of the Financing Documents Agent is permitted or desires to take or to grant, and if such instructions are promptly requested, Agent shall be absolutely entitled to refrain from taking any action or to withhold any approval and shall not be under any liability whatsoever to any Person for refraining from any action or withholding any approval under any of the Financing Documents until it shall have received such instructions from Required Lenders or all or such other portion of the Lenders as shall be prescribed by this Agreement. Without limiting the foregoing, no Lender shall have any right of action whatsoever against Agent as a result of Agent acting or refraining from acting under this Agreement or any of the other Financing Documents in accordance with the instructions of Required Lenders (or all or such other portion of the Lenders as shall be prescribed by this Agreement) and, notwithstanding the instructions of Required Lenders (or such other applicable portion of the Lenders), Agent shall have no obligation to take any action if it believes, in good faith, that such action would violate applicable Law or exposes Agent to any liability for which it has not received satisfactory indemnification in accordance with the provisions of Section 11.6. Section 11.8 Credit Decision . Each Lender acknowledges that it has, independently and without reliance upon Agent or any other Lender, and based on such documents and information as it has deemed appropriate, made its own credit analysis and decision to enter into this Agreement. Each Lender also acknowledges that it will, independently and without reliance upon Agent or any other Lender, and 
 88 

 based on such documents and information as it shall deem appropriate at the time, continue to make its own credit decisions in taking or not taking any action under the Financing Documents. Section 11.9 Collateral Matters . Lenders irrevocably authorize Agent, at its option and in its discretion, to (a) release any Lien granted to or held by Agent under any Security Document (i) upon termination of the Term Loan Commitment and payment in full of all Obligations; or (ii) constituting property sold or disposed of as part of or in connection with any disposition permitted under any Financing Document (it being understood and agreed that Agent may conclusively rely without further inquiry on a certificate of a Responsible Officer as to the sale or other disposition of property being made in full compliance with the provisions of the Financing Documents); and (b) subordinate any Lien granted to or held by Agent under any Security Document to a Permitted Lien that is allowed to have priority over the Liens granted to or held by Agent pursuant to the definition of Permitted Liens . Upon request by Agent at any time, Lenders will confirm Agent s authority to release and/or subordinate particular types or items of Collateral pursuant to this Section 11.9. Section 11.10 Agency for Perfection . Agent and each Lender hereby appoint each other Lender as agent for the purpose of perfecting Agent s security interest in assets which, in accordance with the Uniform Commercial Code in any applicable jurisdiction, can be perfected by possession or control. Should any Lender (other than Agent) obtain possession or control of any such assets, such Lender shall notify Agent thereof, and, promptly upon Agent s request therefor, shall deliver such assets to Agent or in accordance with Agent s instructions or transfer control to Agent in accordance with Agent s instructions. Each Lender agrees that it will not have any right individually to enforce or seek to enforce any Security Document or to realize upon any Collateral for the Loan unless instructed to do so by Agent (or consented to by Agent), it being understood and agreed that such rights and remedies may be exercised only by Agent. Section 11.11 Notice of Default . Agent shall not be deemed to have knowledge or notice of the occurrence of any Default or Event of Default except with respect to defaults in the payment of principal, interest and fees required to be paid to Agent for the account of Lenders, unless Agent shall have received written notice from a Lender or a Borrower referring to this Agreement, describing such Default or Event of Default and stating that such notice is a notice of default . Agent will notify each Lender of its receipt of any such notice. Agent shall take such action with respect to such Default or Event of Default as may be requested by Required Lenders (or all or such other portion of the Lenders as shall be prescribed by this Agreement) in accordance with the terms hereof. Unless and until Agent has received any such request, Agent may (but shall not be obligated to) take such action, or refrain from taking such action, with respect to such Default or Event of Default as it shall deem advisable or in the best interests of Lenders. Section 11.12 Assignment by Agent; Resignation of Agent; Successor Agent . (a) Agent may at any time assign its rights, powers, privileges and duties hereunder to (i) another Lender or an Affiliate of Agent or any Approved Fund, or (ii) any Eligible Assignee to whom Agent, in its capacity as a Lender, has assigned (or will assign, in conjunction with such assignment of agency rights hereunder) 50 or more of its Loan, in each case without the consent of the Lenders or Borrowers. Following any such assignment, Agent shall endeavor to give notice to the Lenders and Borrowers. Failure to give such notice shall not affect such assignment in any way or cause the assignment to be ineffective. An assignment by Agent pursuant to this subsection (a) shall not be deemed a resignation by Agent for purposes of subsection (b) below. 
 89 

 (b) Without limiting the rights of Agent to designate an assignee pursuant to subsection (a) above, Agent may at any time give notice of its resignation to the Lenders and Borrowers. Upon receipt of any such notice of resignation, Required Lenders shall have the right to appoint a successor Agent. If no such successor shall have been so appointed by Required Lenders and shall have accepted such appointment within ten (10) Business Days after the retiring Agent gives notice of its resignation, then the retiring Agent may on behalf of the Lenders, appoint a successor Agent; provided, however, that if Agent shall notify Borrowers and the Lenders that no Person has accepted such appointment, then such resignation shall nonetheless become effective in accordance with such notice from Agent that no Person has accepted such appointment and, from and following delivery of such notice, (i) the retiring Agent shall be discharged from its duties and obligations hereunder and under the other Financing Documents, and (ii) all payments, communications and determinations provided to be made by, to or through Agent shall instead be made by or to each Lender directly, until such time as Required Lenders appoint a successor Agent as provided for above in this paragraph. (c) Upon (i) an assignment permitted by subsection (a) above, or (ii) the acceptance of a successor s appointment as Agent pursuant to subsection (b) above, such successor shall succeed to and become vested with all of the rights, powers, privileges and duties of the retiring (or retired) Agent, and the retiring Agent shall be discharged from all of its duties and obligations hereunder and under the other Financing Documents (if not already discharged therefrom as provided above in this paragraph). The fees payable by Borrowers to a successor Agent shall be the same as those payable to its predecessor unless otherwise agreed between Borrowers and such successor. After the retiring Agent s resignation hereunder and under the other Financing Documents, the provisions of this Article and Section 11.12 shall continue in effect for the benefit of such retiring Agent and its sub-agents in respect of any actions taken or omitted to be taken by any of them while the retiring Agent was acting or was continuing to act as Agent. Section 11.13 Payment and Sharing of Payment . (a) Reserved . (b) Term Loan Payments . Payments of principal, interest and fees in respect of the Term Loans will be settled on the date of receipt if received by Agent on the last Business Day of a month or on the Business Day immediately following the date of receipt if received on any day other than the last Business Day of a month; provided, however , that, in the case such Lender is a Defaulted Lender, Agent shall be entitled to set off the funding short fall against that Defaulted Lender s respective share of all payments received from any Borrower. (c) Return of Payments . (i) If Agent pays an amount to a Lender under this Agreement in the belief or expectation that a related payment has been or will be received by Agent from a Borrower and such related payment is not received by Agent, then Agent will be entitled to recover such amount from such Lender on demand without setoff, counterclaim or deduction of any kind, together with interest accruing on a daily basis at the Federal Funds Rate. (ii) If Agent determines at any time that any amount received by Agent under this Agreement must be returned to any Borrower or paid to any other Person pursuant to any insolvency law or otherwise, then, notwithstanding any other term or condition of this Agreement or any other Financing Document, Agent will not be required to distribute any portion thereof to any Lender. In addition, each Lender will repay to Agent on demand any 
 90 

 portion of such amount that Agent has distributed to such Lender, together with interest at such rate, if any, as Agent is required to pay to any Borrower or such other Person, without setoff, counterclaim or deduction of any kind. (d) Defaulted Lenders . The failure of any Defaulted Lender to make any payment required by it hereunder shall not relieve any other Lender of its obligations to make payment, but neither any other Lender nor Agent shall be responsible for the failure of any Defaulted Lender to make any payment required hereunder. Notwithstanding anything set forth herein to the contrary, a Defaulted Lender shall not have any voting or consent rights under or with respect to any Financing Document or constitute a Lender (or be included in the calculation of Required Lenders hereunder) for any voting or consent rights under or with respect to any Financing Document. (e) Sharing of Payments . If any Lender shall obtain any payment or other recovery (whether voluntary, involuntary, by application of setoff or otherwise) on account of any Loan (other than pursuant to the terms of Section 2.8(d)) in excess of its Pro Rata Share of payments entitled pursuant to the other provisions of this Section 11.13, such Lender shall purchase from the other Lenders such participations in extensions of credit made by such other Lenders (without recourse, representation or warranty) as shall be necessary to cause such purchasing Lender to share the excess payment or other recovery ratably with each of them; provided, however, that if all or any portion of the excess payment or other recovery is thereafter required to be returned or otherwise recovered from such purchasing Lender, such portion of such purchase shall be rescinded and each Lender which has sold a participation to the purchasing Lender shall repay to the purchasing Lender the purchase price to the ratable extent of such return or recovery, without interest. Each Borrower agrees that any Lender so purchasing a participation from another Lender pursuant to this clause (e) may, to the fullest extent permitted by law, exercise all its rights of payment (including pursuant to Section 10.6) with respect to such participation as fully as if such Lender were the direct creditor of Borrowers in the amount of such participation). If under any applicable bankruptcy, insolvency or other similar law, any Lender receives a secured claim in lieu of a setoff to which this clause (e) applies, such Lender shall, to the extent practicable, exercise its rights in respect of such secured claim in a manner consistent with the rights of the Lenders entitled under this clause (e) to share in the benefits of any recovery on such secured claim. Section 11.14 Right to Perform, Preserve and Protect . If any Credit Party fails to perform any obligation hereunder or under any other Financing Document, Agent itself may, but shall not be obligated to, cause such obligation to be performed at Borrowers expense. Agent is further authorized by Borrowers and the Lenders to make expenditures from time to time which Agent, in its reasonable business judgment, deems necessary or desirable to (a) preserve or protect the business conducted by Borrowers, the Collateral, or any portion thereof, and/or (b) enhance the likelihood of, or maximize the amount of, repayment of the Loan and other Obligations. Each Borrower hereby agrees to reimburse Agent on demand for any and all costs, liabilities and obligations incurred by Agent pursuant to this Section 11.14. Each Lender hereby agrees to indemnify Agent upon demand for any and all costs, liabilities and obligations incurred by Agent pursuant to this Section 11.14, in accordance with the provisions of Section 11.6. Section 11.15 Additional Titled Agents . Except for rights and powers, if any, expressly reserved under this Agreement to any bookrunner, arranger or to any titled agent named on the cover page of this Agreement, other than Agent (collectively, the Additional Titled Agents ), and except for obligations, liabilities, duties and responsibilities, if any, expressly assumed under this Agreement by any Additional Titled Agent, no Additional Titled Agent, in such capacity, has any rights, powers, liabilities, duties or responsibilities hereunder or under any of the other Financing Documents. Without limiting the foregoing, no Additional Titled Agent shall have nor be deemed to have a fiduciary relationship with any 
 91 

 Lender. At any time that any Lender serving as an Additional Titled Agent shall have transferred to any other Person (other than any Affiliates) all of its interests in the Loan, such Lender shall be deemed to have concurrently resigned as such Additional Titled Agent. Section 11.16 Amendments and Waivers . (a) No provision of this Agreement or any other Financing Document may be amended, waived or otherwise modified unless such amendment, waiver or other modification is in writing and is signed or otherwise approved by Borrowers, the Required Lenders and any other Lender to the extent required under Section 11.16(b); provided, however , the Fee Letter may be amended, or rights or privileges thereunder waived, in a writing executed only by the parties thereto. (b) In addition to the required signatures under Section 11.16(a), no provision of this Agreement or any other Financing Document may be amended, waived or otherwise modified unless such amendment, waiver or other modification is in writing and is signed or otherwise approved by the following Persons: (i) if any amendment, waiver or other modification would increase a Lender s funding obligations in respect of any Loan, by such Lender; and/or (ii) if the rights or duties of Agent are affected thereby, by Agent; provided, however , that, in each of (i) and (ii) above, no such amendment, waiver or other modification shall, unless signed or otherwise approved in writing by all the Lenders directly affected thereby, (A) reduce the principal of, rate of interest on or any fees with respect to any Loan or forgive any principal, interest (other than default interest) or fees (other than late charges) with respect to any Loan; (B) postpone the date fixed for, or waive, any payment (other than any mandatory prepayment pursuant to Section 2.1(a)(ii)) of principal of any Loan, or of interest on any Loan (other than default interest) or any fees provided for hereunder (other than late charges) or postpone the date of termination of any commitment of any Lender hereunder; (C) change the definition of the term Required Lenders or the percentage of Lenders which shall be required for Lenders to take any action hereunder; (D) release all or substantially all of the Collateral, authorize any Borrower to sell or otherwise dispose of all or substantially all of the Collateral, release any Guarantor of all or any portion of the Obligations or its Guarantee obligations with respect thereto, or consent to a transfer of any of the Intellectual Property, except, in each case with respect to this clause (D), as otherwise may be provided in this Agreement or the other Financing Documents (including in connection with any disposition permitted hereunder); (E) amend, waive or otherwise modify this Section 11.16(b) or the definitions of the terms used in this Section 11.16(b) insofar as the definitions affect the substance of this Section 11.16(b); (F) consent to the assignment, delegation or other transfer by any Credit Party of any of its rights and obligations under any Financing Document or release any Borrower of its payment obligations under any Financing Document, except, in each case with respect to this clause (F), pursuant to a merger or consolidation permitted pursuant to this Agreement; or (G) amend any of the provisions of Section 10.7 or amend any of the definitions Pro Rata Share, Term Loan Commitment, Term Loan Tranche 1 Commitments, Term Loan Tranche 2 Commitments, Term Loan Tranche 3 Commitments, Term Loan Tranche 4 Commitments, Term Loan Tranche 5 Commitments, Term Loan Commitment Amount, Term Loan Tranche 1 Commitment Amount, Term Loan Tranche 2 Commitment Amount, Term Loan Tranche 3 Commitment Amount, Term Loan Tranche 4 Commitment Amount, Term Loan Tranche 5 Commitment Amount, Term Loan Commitment Percentage or that provide for the Lenders to receive their Pro Rata Shares of any fees, payments, setoffs or proceeds of Collateral hereunder.

Section 11.17 Assignments and Participations . (a) Assignments . (i) Any Lender may at any time assign to one or more Eligible Assignees all or any portion of such Lender s Loan together with all related obligations of such Lender hereunder. Except as Agent may otherwise agree, the amount of any such assignment (determined as of the date of the applicable Assignment Agreement or, if a Trade Date is specified in such Assignment Agreement, as of such Trade Date) shall be in a minimum aggregate amount equal to 1,000,000 or, if less, the assignor s entire interests in the outstanding Loan; provided, however, that, in connection with simultaneous assignments to two or more related Approved Funds, such Approved Funds shall be treated as one assignee for purposes of determining compliance with the minimum assignment size referred to above. Borrowers and Agent shall be entitled to continue to deal solely and directly with such Lender in connection with the interests so assigned to an Eligible Assignee until Agent shall have received and accepted an effective Assignment Agreement executed, delivered and fully completed by the applicable parties thereto and a processing fee of 3,500 to be paid by the assigning Lender; provided, however, that only one processing fee shall be payable in connection with simultaneous assignments to two or more related Approved Funds. (ii) From and after the date on which the conditions described above have been met, (A) such Eligible Assignee shall be deemed automatically to have become a party hereto and, to the extent of the interests assigned to such Eligible Assignee pursuant to such Assignment Agreement, shall have the rights and obligations of a Lender hereunder, and (B) the assigning Lender, to the extent that rights and obligations hereunder have been assigned by it pursuant to such Assignment Agreement, shall be released from its rights and obligations hereunder (other than those that survive termination pursuant to Section 12.1). Upon the request of the Eligible Assignee (and, as applicable, the assigning Lender) pursuant to an effective Assignment Agreement, each Borrower shall execute and deliver to Agent for delivery to the Eligible Assignee (and, as applicable, the assigning Lender) Notes in the aggregate principal amount of the Eligible Assignee s Loan (and, as applicable, Notes in the principal amount of that portion of the principal amount of the Loan retained by the assigning Lender). Upon receipt by the assigning Lender of such Note, the assigning Lender shall return to Borrower Representative any prior Note held by it. (iii) Agent, acting solely for this purpose as an agent of Borrower, shall maintain at the office of its servicer located in Bethesda, Maryland a copy of each Assignment Agreement delivered to it and a register for the recordation of the names and addresses of each Lender, and the commitments of, and principal amount of the Loan owing to, such Lender pursuant to the terms hereof (the Register ). The entries in such Register shall be conclusive, absent manifest error, and Borrower, Agent and Lenders may treat each Person whose name is recorded therein pursuant to the terms hereof as a Lender hereunder for all purposes of this Agreement, notwithstanding notice to the contrary. Such Register shall be available for inspection by Borrower and any Lender, at any reasonable time upon reasonable prior notice to Agent. Each Lender that sells a participation shall, acting solely for this purpose as an agent of Borrower maintain a register on which it enters the name and address of each participant and the principal amounts (and stated interest) of each participant s interest in the Obligations (each, a 
 93 

 Participant Register ). The entries in the Participant Registers shall be conclusive, absent manifest error. Each Participant Register shall be available for inspection by Borrower and Agent at any reasonable time upon reasonable prior notice to the applicable Lender; provided, that no Lender shall have any obligation to disclose all or any portion of the Participant Register (including the identity of any Participant or any information relating to a Participant s interest in any commitments, loans, letters of credit or its other obligations under any Financing Document) to any Person (including Borrower) except to the extent that such disclosure is necessary to establish that such commitment, loan, letter of credit or other obligation is in registered form under Section 5f.103-1(c) of the United States Treasury Regulations. For the avoidance of doubt, Agent (in its capacity as Agent) shall have no responsibility for maintaining a Participant Register. (iv) Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions of this Section 11.17(a) or any other provision of this Agreement, any Lender may at any time pledge or assign a security interest in all or any portion of its rights under this Agreement to secure obligations of such Lender, including any pledge or assignment to secure obligations to a Federal Reserve Bank; provided, however, that no such pledge or assignment shall release such Lender from any of its obligations hereunder or substitute any such pledgee or assignee for such Lender as a party hereto. (v) Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions of this Section 11.17(a) or any other provision of this Agreement, Agent has the right, but not the obligation, to effectuate assignments of Loan via an electronic settlement system acceptable to Agent as designated in writing from time to time to the Lenders by Agent (the Settlement Service ). At any time when Agent elects, in its sole discretion, to implement such Settlement Service, each such assignment shall be effected by the assigning Lender and proposed assignee pursuant to the procedures then in effect under the Settlement Service, which procedures shall be consistent with the other provisions of this Section 11.17(a). Each assigning Lender and proposed Eligible Assignee shall comply with the requirements of the Settlement Service in connection with effecting any assignment of Loan pursuant to the Settlement Service. With the prior written approval of Agent, Agent s approval of such Eligible Assignee shall be deemed to have been automatically granted with respect to any transfer effected through the Settlement Service. Assignments and assumptions of the Loan shall be effected by the provisions otherwise set forth herein until Agent notifies Lenders of the Settlement Service as set forth herein. (b) Participations . Any Lender may at any time, without the consent of, or notice to, any Borrower or Agent, sell to one or more Persons (other than any Borrower or any Borrower s Affiliates) participating interests in its Loan, commitments or other interests hereunder (any such Person, a Participant ). In the event of a sale by a Lender of a participating interest to a Participant, (i) such Lender s obligations hereunder shall remain unchanged for all purposes, (ii) Borrowers and Agent shall continue to deal solely and directly with such Lender in connection with such Lender s rights and obligations hereunder, and (iii) all amounts payable by each Borrower shall be determined as if such Lender had not sold such participation and shall be paid directly to such Lender. Each Borrower agrees that if amounts outstanding under this Agreement are due and payable (as a result of acceleration or otherwise), each Participant shall be deemed to have the right of set-off in respect of its participating interest in amounts owing under this Agreement to the same extent as if the amount of its participating interest were owing directly to it as a Lender under this Agreement; provided, however , that such right of set-off shall be subject to the obligation of each Participant to share with Lenders, and Lenders agree to share with each Participant, as provided in Section 11.5. 
 94

In the event Borrowers or Agent, as applicable, obtains a Replacement Lender within ninety (90) days following notice of its intention to do so, the Affected Lender shall sell, at par, and assign all of its Loan and funding commitments hereunder to such Replacement Lender in accordance with the procedures set forth in Section 11.17(a); provided, however, that (A) Borrowers shall have reimbursed such Lender for its increased costs and additional payments for which it is entitled to reimbursement under Section 2.8(a) through (h), as applicable, of this Agreement through the date of such sale and assignment, and (B) Borrowers shall pay to Agent the 3,500 processing fee in respect of such assignment. In the event that a replaced Lender does not execute an Assignment Agreement pursuant to Section 11.17(a) within five (5) Business Days after receipt by such replaced Lender of notice of replacement pursuant to this Section 11.17(c) and presentation to such replaced Lender of an Assignment Agreement evidencing an assignment pursuant to this Section 11.17(c), such replaced Lender shall be deemed to have consented to the terms of such Assignment Agreement, and any such Assignment Agreement executed by Agent, the Replacement Lender and, to the extent required pursuant to Section 11.17(a), Borrowers, shall be effective for purposes of this Section 11.17(c) and Section 11.17(a). Upon any such assignment and payment, such replaced Lender shall no longer constitute a Lender for purposes hereof, other than with respect to such rights and obligations that survive termination as set forth in Section 12.1.

Any Lender delivering any such notice shall become a non-funding Lender (a Non-Funding Lender for purposes of this Agreement commencing on the Business Day following receipt by Agent of such notice, and shall cease to be a Non-Funding Lender on the date on which such Lender has either revoked the effectiveness of such notice or acknowledged in writing to each of Agent the satisfaction of the condition(s) specified in such notice, or Required Lenders waive the conditions to the funding of such Loans giving rise to such notice by Non-Funding Lender. Each Non-Funding Lender shall remain a Lender for purposes of this Agreement to the extent that such Non-Funding Lender has Term Loans outstanding in excess of Zero Dollars 0); provided, however, that during any period of time that any Non-Funding Lender exists, and notwithstanding any provision to the contrary set forth herein, the following provisions shall apply: (a) For purposes of determining the Pro Rata Share of each Lender under clause (b) of the definition of such term, each Non-Funding Lender shall be deemed to have a Term Loan Commitment Amount as in effect immediately before such Lender became a Non-Funding Lender. (b) Except as provided in clause (a) above, the Term Loan Commitment Amount of each Non-Funding Lender shall be deemed to be Zero Dollars 0). (c) The Term Loan Commitment at any date of determination during such period shall be deemed to be equal to the sum of (i) the aggregate Term Loan Commitment Amounts of all Lenders, other than the Non-Funding Lenders as of such date plus (ii) the aggregate principal amount outstanding under the Term Loans of all Non-Funding Lenders as of such date.

The rights and remedies herein and therein provided shall be cumulative and not exclusive of any rights or remedies provided by law. Any reference in any Financing Document to the continuing nature of any Event of Default shall not be construed as establishing or otherwise indicating that any Borrower or any other Credit Party has the independent right to cure any such Event of Default, but is rather presented merely for convenience should such Event of Default be waived in accordance with the terms of the applicable Financing Documents.

Exhibit 4.2 DESCRIPTION OF CAPITAL STOCK REGISTERED PURSUANT TO SECTION 12 OF THE SECURITIES EXCHANGE ACT OF 1934 The following description of the common stock of Akoya Biosciences, Inc. we, us and our is a summary and does not purport to be complete. It is subject to, and qualified in its entirety by reference to, our Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation Certificate of Incorporation ), our Amended and Restated Bylaws Bylaws and our Amended and Restated Investors Rights Agreement Investors Rights Agreement ). This description also summarizes relevant provisions of General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware (the DGCL ). We encourage you to read these materials for additional information. General Our authorized capital stock consists of 500,000,000 shares of common stock, 0.00001 par value per share, and 10,000,000 shares of preferred stock, par value 0.00001 per share, all of which shares of preferred stock are undesignated. Common Stock The holders of our common stock are entitled to one vote per share on all matters to be voted upon by the stockholders. The holders of our common stock are entitled to receive ratably those dividends, if any, that may be declared from time to time by our board of directors out of funds legally available, subject to preferences that may be applicable to preferred stock, if any, then outstanding. In the event of a liquidation, dissolution or winding up of our company, the holders of common stock will be entitled to share ratably in all assets remaining after payment of liabilities, subject to prior distribution rights of preferred stock, if any, then outstanding. Our common stock has no preemptive or conversion rights or other subscription rights or redemption or sinking fund provisions. Preferred Stock Our Certificate of Incorporation authorizes our board of directors to establish one or more series of preferred stock (including convertible preferred stock). Unless required by law or any stock exchange, the authorized shares of preferred stock will be available for issuance without further action by the holders of our common stock. Our board of directors will be able to determine, with respect to any series of preferred stock, the powers (including voting powers), preferences and relative, participating, optional or other special rights, and the qualifications, limitations, or restrictions thereof. No shares of preferred stock have been issued or are outstanding as of the date of the filing of the Annual Report on Form 10-K of which this Description forms a part, and we have no present plan to issue any shares of preferred stock. Anti-Takeover Matters in our Governing Documents and Under Delaware Law Our Certificate of Incorporation and our Bylaws contain, and the DGCL contains, provisions that are intended to enhance the likelihood of continuity and stability in the composition of our board of directors. These provisions are intended to avoid costly takeover battles, reduce our vulnerability to a hostile or abusive change of control, and enhance the ability of our board of directors to maximize stockholder value in connection with any unsolicited offer to acquire us. However, these provisions may have an antitakeover effect and may delay, deter, or prevent a merger or acquisition by means of a tender offer, a proxy contest, or other takeover attempt that a stockholder might consider in its best interest, including those attempts that might result in a premium over the prevailing market price for the shares of common stock held by stockholders. Authorized But Unissued Capital Stock The authorized but unissued shares of common stock and preferred stock are available for future issuance without stockholder approval, subject to any limitations imposed by the listing standards of Nasdaq. These additional shares may be used for a variety of corporate finance transactions, acquisitions and employee benefit plans. The existence of authorized but unissued and unreserved common stock and preferred stock could make more 

 difficult or discourage an attempt to obtain control of us by means of a proxy contest, tender offer, merger, or otherwise. Classified Board of Directors Our Certificate of Incorporation provides that our board of directors be divided into three classes, with the classes as nearly equal in number as possible and each class serving three-year staggered terms. Directors may only be removed from our board of directors for cause by the affirmative vote of at least 66 2 3 of the voting power of all of our then-outstanding shares of capital stock entitled to vote generally in the election of directors, voting together as a single class. In addition, our Certificate of Incorporation provides that, subject to the rights granted to one or more series of preferred stock then outstanding, any newly created directorship on the board of directors that results from an increase in the number of directors and any vacancies on our board of directors will be filled only by the affirmative vote of a majority of the remaining directors, even if less than a quorum, or by a sole remaining director. A director chosen to fill a position resulting from an increase in the number of directors will hold office until the next election of the director s class and until the director s successor is duly elected and qualified, or until the director s earlier death, resignation or removal. These provisions may have the effect of deferring, delaying, or discouraging hostile takeovers, changes in control of us or changes in our management. Delaware Anti-Takeover Law We are subject to Section 203 of the DGCL, which is an anti-takeover law. In general, Section 203 prohibits a publicly held Delaware corporation from engaging in a business combination with an interested stockholder for a period of three years following the date that the person became an interested stockholder, unless the business combination or the transaction in which the person became an interested stockholder is approved in a prescribed manner. Generally, a business combination includes a merger, asset or stock sale, or another transaction resulting in a financial benefit to the interested stockholder. Generally, an interested stockholder is a person who, together with affiliates and associates, owns 15 or more of the corporation s outstanding voting stock or is the corporation s affiliate or associate and was the owner of 15 or more of the corporation s outstanding voting stock at any time within the three-year period immediately before the date of determination. The existence of this provision may have an anti-takeover effect with respect to transactions that are not approved in advance by our board, including discouraging attempts that might result in a premium over the market price for the shares of common stock held by stockholders. No Cumulative Voting Under Delaware law, the right to vote cumulatively does not exist unless the certificate of incorporation specifically authorizes cumulative voting. Our Certificate of Incorporation does not authorize cumulative voting. Therefore, stockholders holding a majority of the shares of our stock entitled to vote generally in the election of directors are able to elect all of our directors. Special Stockholder Meetings Our Certificate of Incorporation provides that special meetings of our stockholders may be called at any time only by or at the direction of the board of directors, the chair of the board of directors or our Chief Executive Officer. Our Bylaws prohibit the conduct of any business at a special meeting other than as specified in the notice for such meeting. These provisions may have the effect of deferring, delaying, or discouraging hostile takeovers or changes in control or management. Director Nominations and Stockholder Proposals Our Bylaws establish advance notice procedures with respect to stockholder proposals and the nomination of candidates for election as directors, other than nominations made by or at the direction of the board of directors or a committee of the board of directors. In order for any matter to be properly brought before a meeting, a stockholder will have to comply with advance notice requirements and provide us with certain information. Generally, to be timely, a stockholder s notice must be received at our principal executive offices not less than 

 90 days nor more than 120 days prior to the first anniversary date of the immediately preceding annual meeting of stockholders. Our Bylaws also specify requirements as to the form and content of a stockholder s notice. Our Bylaws allow the chair of a meeting of the stockholders to adopt rules and regulations for the conduct of that meeting that may have the effect of precluding the conduct of certain business at that meeting if the rules and regulations are not followed. These provisions may also defer, delay, or discourage a potential acquirer from conducting a solicitation of proxies to elect the acquirer s own slate of directors or otherwise attempting to influence or obtain control. Stockholder Action by Written Consent Pursuant to Section 228 of the DGCL, any action required to be taken at any annual or special meeting of the stockholders may be taken without a meeting, without prior notice, and without a vote if a consent or consents in writing, setting forth the action so taken, is or are signed by the holders of outstanding stock having not less than the minimum number of votes that would be necessary to authorize or take such action at a meeting at which all shares of our stock entitled to vote thereon were present and voted, unless the certificate of incorporation provides otherwise. Our Certificate of Incorporation precludes stockholder action by written consent. Amendment of Certificate of Incorporation or Bylaws The DGCL provides generally that the affirmative vote of a majority of the shares entitled to vote on any matter is required to amend a corporation s certificate of incorporation or bylaws, unless a corporation s certificate of incorporation or bylaws, as the case may be, requires a greater percentage. Our Bylaws may be amended or repealed by a majority vote of our board of directors or by the affirmative vote of the holders of at least 662 3 of the votes which all our stockholders would be entitled to cast in any annual election of directors. In addition, the affirmative vote of the holders of at least 662 3 of the votes which all our stockholders would be entitled to cast in any election of directors will be required to amend or repeal or to adopt any provisions inconsistent with any of the provisions of our Certificate of Incorporation described above. The foregoing provisions of our Certificate of Incorporation and our Bylaws could discourage potential acquisition proposals and could delay or prevent a change in control. These provisions are intended to enhance the likelihood of continuity and stability in the composition of our board of directors and in the policies formulated by our board of directors and to discourage certain types of transactions that may involve an actual or threatened change of control. These provisions are designed to reduce our vulnerability to an unsolicited acquisition proposal. The provisions also are intended to discourage certain tactics that may be used in proxy fights. However, such provisions could have the effect of discouraging others from making tender offers for our shares and, as a consequence, they also may inhibit fluctuations in the market price of our shares of common stock that could result from actual or rumored takeover attempts. Such provisions also may have the effect of preventing changes in our management or delaying or preventing a transaction that might benefit you or other minority stockholders. Exclusive Forum Our Certificate of Incorporation provides that, unless we consent in writing to the selection of an alternative forum, the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware be the sole and exclusive forum for: (1) any derivative action or proceeding brought on behalf of our company, (2) any action asserting a claim of breach of fiduciary duty owed by any director, officer, agent, or other employee or stockholder of our company to us or our stockholders, (3) any action asserting a claim arising pursuant to any provision of the DGCL, our Certificate of Incorporation or our Bylaws or as to which the DGCL confers jurisdiction on the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware, or (4) any action asserting a claim governed by the internal affairs doctrine, in each case subject to such Court of Chancery having personal jurisdiction over the indispensable parties named as defendants therein. It will further provide that, unless we consent in writing to the selection of an alternative forum, the federal district courts of the United States of America shall, to the fullest extent permitted by law, be the sole and exclusive forum for the resolutions of any complaint asserting a cause of action arising under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the Securities Act ). The exclusive forum clauses described above shall not apply to suits brought to enforce a duty or liability created by the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended or any other claim for which the federal courts have exclusive jurisdiction. Although we believe these provisions benefit us by providing increased consistency in the application of applicable law in the types of lawsuits to which they apply, the provisions may have the effect of 

 discouraging lawsuits against our directors and officers. The enforceability of similar choice of forum provisions in other companies certificates of incorporation has been challenged in legal proceedings and there is uncertainty as to whether a court would enforce such provisions. In addition, investors cannot waive compliance with the federal securities laws and the rules and regulations thereunder. It is possible that, in connection with any applicable action brought against us, a court could find the choice of forum provisions contained in our Certificate of Incorporation to be inapplicable or unenforceable in such action. Any person or entity purchasing or otherwise acquiring any interest in shares of our capital stock shall be deemed to have notice of and consented to the forum provisions in our Certificate of Incorporation. Limitations of Liability and Indemnification The DGCL authorizes corporations to limit or eliminate the personal liability of directors to corporations and their stockholders for monetary damages for breaches of directors fiduciary duties, subject to certain exceptions. Our Certificate of Incorporation includes a provision that eliminates the personal liability of directors for monetary damages to the corporation or its stockholders for any breach of fiduciary duty as a director, except to the extent such exemption from liability or limitation thereof is not permitted under the DGCL. The effect of these provisions is to eliminate the rights of us and our stockholders, through stockholders derivative suits on our behalf, to recover monetary damages from a director for breach of fiduciary duty as a director, including breaches resulting from grossly negligent behavior. However, exculpation does not apply to any breaches of the director s duty of loyalty, any acts or omissions not in good faith or that involve intentional misconduct or knowing violation of law, any authorization of dividends or stock redemptions or repurchases paid or made in violation of the DGCL, or for any transaction from which the director derived an improper personal benefit. Our Bylaws generally rovide that we must indemnify and advance expenses to our directors and officers to the fullest extent authorized by the DGCL. We also are expressly authorized to carry directors and officers liability insurance providing indemnification for our directors, officers and certain employees for some liabilities. We believe these indemnification and advancement provisions and insurance are useful to attract and retain qualified directors and executive officers. The limitation of liability, indemnification and advancement provisions in our Certificate of Incorporation and our Bylaws may discourage stockholders from bringing a lawsuit against directors for breach of their fiduciary duty. These provisions also may have the effect of reducing the likelihood of derivative litigation against directors and officers, even though such an action, if successful, might otherwise benefit us and our stockholders. In addition, your investment may be adversely affected to the extent we pay the costs of settlement and damage awards against directors and officers pursuant to these indemnification provisions. There is currently no pending material litigation or proceeding involving any of our directors, officers or employees for which indemnification is sought. We have entered into indemnification agreements with each of our directors and executive officers. Insofar as indemnification for liabilities arising under the Securities Act may be permitted to directors or executive officers, we have been informed that in the opinion of the SEC such indemnification is against public policy and is therefore unenforceable.
