ITEM 1. DESCRIPTION OF BUSINESS 

Yuengling s Ice Cream Corporation, (f/k/a
Aureus, Inc.) Yuengling s , YCRM , we , us , or
the Company was incorporated in Nevada on April 19, 2013, under the name Aureus Incorporated. 
We were initially organized to develop and explore mineral properties in the state of Nevada. Effective December 15, 2017, we changed
our name to Hohme, Inc., and, effective February 7, 2019, we changed our name to Aureus, Inc. and on September
14, 2021, the Company changed their name to Yuengling s Ice Cream Corporation . We are currently active in the state of Nevada. 

We are a food brand development company that builds
and represents popular food concepts throughout the United States and international markets. Management is highly experienced at business
integration and re-branding potential. With little territory available for the older brands, we intend to bring fresh, innovative brands
with great potential. Our brands will be unique as we focus on niche markets that are still in need of development. 

We are a food brand development company that builds
and represents popular food concepts throughout the United States and international markets. Management is highly experienced at business
integration and re-branding potential. With little territory available for the older brands, we intend to bring fresh innovative brands
that have great potential to our customers. Our brands will be unique in nature as we focus on niche markets that are still in need of
development. 

Our Website 

www.yuenglingsicecream.com 

Our Business Objectives 

Yuengling s mission is to provide the highest
quality ice cream and dairy-related products to its consumers, offer an enjoyable work environment for its employees, establish lasting
relationships with its customers and vendors that are centered on trust, strive to surpass its customers expectations, always act
ethically, and give back to the communities that support it. 

Business Overview 

 Yuengling s started as an American and family-owned
company and is proud to maintain high brand recognition, quality loyalty. Its products are considered in the super-premium category
and are all-natural. Yuengling s exceeds Whole Foods Market Ingredient Quality Standards. Its products are kosher with no added
growth hormones, steroids, or antibiotics. 

Yuengling s is a strong, recognized brand
with a long, positive family history and an experienced management team. We are smaller and more responsive than larger competitors. 

When national brands continue to reduce the quality
of their offerings and downsize their products, Yuengling s products compare favorably and provide good value to our
customers. We offer innovative new products and flavors. 

Operating Strategy 

Yuengling s retail operating strategy is
three-phased, centering on (1) product development, (2) achieving acceptance in a defined core area, and (3) expanding our operations
once specific volume and metrics are attained. We are currently in the early stages of phase two. 

1 

Marketing and Distribution 

Yuengling s core marketing area is defined
as the area from Scranton, Pennsylvania in the North, central Virginia in the South, Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania to the West, and the New
Jersey shore to the East. Our goal is to offer higher than average overall margins for retailers. 

Our objective is to establish critical mass distribution
and specific consumer acceptance levels in the defined core marketing area. We feel this will be accomplished through brand promotion
at the store level and top-of-mind-focused marketing programs, including large-scale and small-scale direct consumer product sampling.
Once we have sufficient market penetration in our core marketing area, we plan to expand and establish the brand outside this area. At
the time of this filing, Yuengling s Ice Cream is not yet available for sale to the public. 

The Company plans to begin selling its three-gallon
tubs to food service customers in summer of 2023. The Company also plans to begin selling its ice cream pints to distributors and retailers
in the summer of 2023. 

In the future, we anticipate working with several
independent ice cream distributors, rather than a few large distributors, to distribute our products regionally and nationally. To help
facilitate customer relationships, we may engage food brokers to act as our agents within designated territories or for specific accounts
and receive commissions, which average 5 of net collected sales. 

Our ice cream is shipped from our manufacturer
to third-party cold storage facilities. In turn, our products are distributed from these cold storage facilities. We do not own, lease
or otherwise maintain any vehicles involved in the shipping of our products. 

Development Strategy 

Our development strategy began with market entry
in February 2014. The target was to establish distribution in retail grocery stores within the core marketing area with six-quart flavors
of ice cream per store. Distribution is warehouse-based. 

We believe our products are a slight bargain compared
to super-premium brands such as Ben Jerry s and H agen-Dazs and on par with other brands such as Gifford s. Our
promotional pricing strategy depends upon the retailer, with brand positioning as a super-premium offering. We sometimes engage in short-term
Everyday Low Price EDLP program pricing to undermine the existing premium and super-premium players. 

Production 

Yuengling s Ice Cream s primary production
facility has been Totally Cool, Inc. Totally Cool a high quality, modern, FDA-compliant facility in Owings Mills, Maryland.
Our packaging consists of six quarts to a case, eight pints to a case, and three-gallon tubs. Totally Cool is a smaller ice cream production
facility that produces ice cream and other frozen desserts for several local, regional, and national brands. Totally Cool s size
allows for smaller and more flexible production runs. We currently do not have a written agreement with Totally Cool; but rather, we order
our products as needed pursuant to purchase orders. We do not anticipate that we would encounter any material difficulty in obtaining
alternative production sources, at a comparable cost, if our co-packer decides to terminate their relationships with us. Nevertheless,
any disruption in supply could have a material adverse effect on our company. 

Product Specifications 

Our packaging consists of six quarts to a case
and eight pints to a case. We offer super-premium butterfat (14 basis with super-premium flavorings and super-premium ingredients. Our
products have high solids, and mid-range weight (50 overrun/air) for a super-premium mouth feel. 

Product History 

In February 2014, Yuengling s brand was
launched in quart containers in 10 flavors. Quarts were the best way to gain access to shelf space without displacing an existing 48oz
or 16oz products. In October 2014, we launched two seasonal flavors, and we added four new flavors in February 2015. In July 2015,
we launched six-pint flavors in 800 Ahold stores and began 3-gallon tub food service sales. In May 2016, we were granted a trademark
for Black Tan for the ice cream category, and in September 2016, we were granted a trademark for Butterbeer 
for the ice cream category. 

At the national level, our primary retail competitors
are Ben Jerry s and H agen-Dazs. At the regional level, our direct retail competitors are Giffords (Maine), Graeter s
(Ohio), and Turkey Hill (Pennsylvania). 

2 

Primary Advantages 

We believe we have a higher quality than most
national brands, comparable to Ben Jerry s and H agen-Dazs. We have new and different flavors. We also believe we have
better value to consumers in cost per ounce, strong brand loyalty, and close relationships with retailers. 

American Sourced 

Yuengling s Ice Cream uses a high super-premium butterfat (14 base-paired with America s finest artisan flavorings and inclusions (12 ); 

Yuengling s Ice Cream contains no added growth hormones, steroids, or antibiotics. Yuengling s Ice Cream is rBST / rBGH free, kosher, and 11 of our 13 flavors are gluten-free 

American Made 

Yuengling s Ice Cream s primary production facility has
been Totally Cool, a high quality, modern, FDA-compliant facility in Maryland. Yuengling s recipe contains high solids and mid-range
weight (50 overrun / air) for a gourmet mouth feel. We believe Yuengling s Ice Cream is a Pennsylvania preferred brand and exceeds
the Whole Foods Market Ingredient Quality Standards. 

American Served 

Yuengling s Ice Cream is offered at select
universities, restaurants, professional stadiums, local grocers, and upscale convenience stores. We offer packaging for a range of consumers,
including three-gallon tubs (food service), six quarts per case (food service + Retail + Online), and 8-Pints per case (Universities,
Stadiums + Retail + Online). 

Employees 

We currently have three full-time employees, including
officers and directors. We believe that we have been successful in attracting experienced and capable personnel. Mr. Dickson s
employment agreement prohibits him from competing with us or disclosing our proprietary information to non-authorized third parties. Our
employees are not represented by any labor union.

ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS
OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS 

Results of Operations
for the Year Ended October 31, 2022, compared to the Year Ended October 31, 2021 

Revenue 
 We had 0 in revenue for the year ended October 31, 2022, compared to 3,450 for the year ended October 31, 2021. The large decrease
in revenue is due to a loss in retail food service customers. As the Company reorganized, it sold through its remaining inventory and
did not produce additional product while it worked on plans to relaunch the Yuengling s Ice Cream brand. 

Cost of Goods Sold 

 We incurred 0 in costs of goods sold for the
year ended October 31, 2022, compared to 148,014 for the year ended October 31, 2021. In the prior period we had a large write down of
our inventory of approximately 136,000 due to expired or goods sold below cost. 

General and administrative expenses 

 We had 89,687 of general and administrative expenses G A for the year ended October 31, 2022, compared to 90,223 for the year ended October 31, 2021, a decrease of 536
or 0.6 . 

Bad debt expense 

 During the year ended October 31, 2022, due to
the uncertainty of the collection of our note receivable the Company has written the receivable off and recognized 80,000 of bad debt
expense. 

Consulting related party 

 We had 0 of related party consulting expenses
for the year ended October 31, 2022, compared to 85,000 for the year ended October 31, 2021. In the prior period we made a payment of
 40,000 to Everett Dickson, our former CEO and two payments totaling 45,000 to Robert Bohorad, YICA s former Chief Operating Officer
and our current CEO.

CEO, 5,000 per month. 

5 

Professional fees 

 We incurred 107,583 of professional fees for
the year ended October 31, 2022, compared to 171,692 for the year ended October 31, 2021, a decrease of 64,109 or 37.3 . Professional
fees generally consist of audit, legal, accounting and investor relation service fees. The decrease is due to a decrease in investor relation
expense of approximately 70,000, which was offset by small increases in all other professional fees. 

Other income (expense) 

 For the year ended October 31, 2022, we had total
other expense of 141,082, compared to total other income of 110,973 for the year ended October 31, 2021. In the current period we incurred

on forgiveness of debt of 80,637. We also incurred additional expense of 186,886 for the issuance of convertible debt and a gain of

 93,750 on debt discount amortization, earned 738 of interest income, recognized a gain on forgiveness of debt of 151,418 and a loss
on conversion of debt of 26,000. We also incurred additional expense of 59,028 for the issuance of convertible debt and a prepayment
penalty on that debt of 17,819.

 We incurred a net loss of 481,352 for the year
ended October 31, 2022, compared to a net loss of 602,452 for the year ended October 31, 2021. Our net loss decreased due to reasons

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING
FIRM 

To the Board of Directors and Shareholders of Yuengling s
Ice Cream Corporation 

Opinion on the Financial Statements 

We have audited the accompanying consolidated
balance sheets of Yuengling s Ice Cream Corporation the Company as of October 31, 2022 and 2021, and the related
consolidated statements of operations, stockholders deficit, and cash flows for each of the years in the two-year period ended
October 31, 2022, and the related notes (collectively referred to as the financial statements). In our opinion, the financial statements
present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of October 31, 2022 and 2021 and the results of its
operations and its cash flows for each of the years in the two-year period ended October 31, 2022, in conformity with accounting principles
generally accepted in the United States of America. 

Going Concern 

The accompanying financial statements have been
prepared assuming that the Company will continue as a going concern. As discussed in Note 3 to the financial statements, the Company has
an accumulated deficit, net losses, and negative cash flows from operations. These factors, among others, raise substantial doubt about
the Company s ability to continue as a going concern. Management s plans in regard to these matters are also described in
Note 3. The financial statements do not include any adjustments that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty. 

Basis for Opinion 

These financial statements are the responsibility
of the Company s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company s financial statements based on our
audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB) and are
required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and
regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. 

We conducted our audits in accordance with the
standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial
statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. The Company is not required to have, nor were we engaged
to perform, an audit of its internal control over financial reporting. As part of our audits, we are required to obtain an understanding
of internal control over financial reporting, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Company s
internal control over financial reporting. Accordingly, we express no such opinion. 

Our audits included performing procedures to assess
the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond
to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements.
Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating
the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion. 

Critical Audit Matters 

The critical audit matters communicated below
are matters arising from the current period audit of the financial statements that were communicated or required to be communicated to
the audit committee and that: (1) relate to accounts or disclosures that are material to the financial statements and (2) involved our
especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion
on the financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matters below, providing separate opinions
on the critical audit matters or on the accounts or disclosures to which they relate. 

F- 1 

Accounting for Embedded Conversion Features
on Notes Payable Refer to Notes 2 and 8 to the financial statements 

Description of the Critical Audit Matter 

The Company has issued several notes payable during
the year with conversion rates that are adjustable at a discounted rate to public trading prices near the conversion date. The terms allow
for variable amounts of shares to be converted for a set dollar value; this and other factors require the embedded conversion feature
to be accounted for as a derivative and revalued at the conversion date or each period end if still outstanding. Calculations and accounting
for the notes payable and embedded conversion features require management s judgments related to initial and subsequent recognition
of the debt and related features, use of a valuation model, and value of the inputs used in the selected valuation model. 

How the Critical Audit Matter Was Addressed
in the Audit 

Our audit procedures related to evaluating the
Company s accounting for embedded conversion features on notes payable included the following: 

We confirmed a selection of notes payable and
related terms, including notes paid off during the year. 

We performed an independent assessment of the
appropriate valuation model for derivatives, independent calculations based on the binomial model, and compared the Company s results
to a reasonable range. 

We analyzed notes payable and derivatives and
determined if there were unusual transactions related to notes payable and evaluated the appropriate accounting treatment for such transactions. 

We tested substantially all transactions related
to notes payable and all related matters including embedded conversion features. 

We have served as the Company s auditor since 2019.

October 31, 2022 and 2021, the Company s diluted loss per share is the same as the basic loss per share, as the inclusion of any
potential shares would have had an anti-dilutive effect due to the Company generating a loss. 

The following required disclosure of the estimated
fair value of financial instruments has been determined by the Company using available market information and appropriate valuation methodologies.
However, considerable judgment is required to interpret market data to develop the estimates of fair value. Accordingly, the use of different
market assumptions and/or estimation methodologies may have a material effect on the estimated fair value amounts. 

The methods and assumptions used to estimate the
fair values of each class of financial instruments are as follows: Cash and Cash Equivalents, Accounts Receivable, and Accounts Payable.
The items are generally short-term in nature, and accordingly, the carrying amounts reported on the consolidated balance sheets are reasonable
approximations of their fair values. 

The carrying amounts of Notes Payable approximate
the fair value as the notes bear interest rates that are consistent with current market rates.

The Company only applies the five-step model to contracts
when it is probable that the entity will collect the consideration it is entitled to in exchange for the goods or services it transfers
to the customer. Once a contract is determined to be within the scope of ASC 606 at contract inception, the Company reviews the contract
to determine which performance obligations the Company must deliver and which of these performance obligations are distinct. The Company
recognizes as revenues the amount of the transaction price that is allocated to the respective performance obligation when the performance
obligation is satisfied or as it is satisfied. Generally, the Company's performance obligations are transferred to customers at a point
in time, typically upon delivery. YIC Acquisitions Corp Yuengling s Ice Cream) generates
its revenue through the sale of pints to retailers, through the online sales of pints directly to consumers, and through the sale of 3
gallon tubs to food service establishments, such as restaurants, stadiums, and universities. Revenue is recognized at the time of delivery
or, for online sales, at the time of the transaction. Retailers and food service customers terms are generally 15 or 30 days. Online
sales are paid via credit card and funds are generally received within 30 days. 

, had a net loss of , and net cash used in operating activities

contemplated plan of operations, and its transition, ultimately, to the attainment of profitable operations are necessary for the Company
to continue operations. These conditions and the ability to successfully resolve these factors raise substantial doubt about the Company s
ability to continue as a going concern. The financial statements of the Company do not include any adjustments that may result from the
outcome of these aforementioned uncertainties.

AND FINANCIAL DISCLOSURE 

None. 

ITEM 9A. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES 

Under the supervision and with the participation
of our management, including the Chief Executive Officer who also acts as our principal financial officer, we have evaluated the effectiveness
of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) and Rule 15d-15(e) of the Exchange Act) as of the end of the period
covered by this report. The disclosure controls and procedures ensure that all information required to be disclosed by us in the
reports that we file or submit under the Exchange Act is: (i) recorded, processed, summarized and reported, within the time periods specified
in the SEC s rule and forms; and (ii) accumulated and communicated to our management, including our Chief Executive Officer as appropriate
to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. Based on that evaluation, the Chief Executive Officer concluded that, as
of October 31, 2022, these disclosure controls and procedures were not effective. 

Management s Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting 

Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures 

Under the supervision and with the participation
of our management, including the Chief Executive Officer who also acts as our principal financial officer, we have evaluated the effectiveness
of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) and Rule 15d-15(e) of the Exchange Act) as of the end of the period
covered by this report. The disclosure controls and procedures ensure that all information required to be disclosed by us in the
reports that we file or submit under the Exchange Act is: (i) recorded, processed, summarized and reported, within the time periods specified
in the SEC s rule and forms; and (ii) accumulated and communicated to our management, including our Chief Executive Officer as appropriate
to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. Based on that evaluation, the Chief Executive Officer concluded that, as
of October 31, 2022, these disclosure controls and procedures were not effective. 

Management s Annual Report on Internal Control over Financial
Reporting 

Our management is responsible to establish and
maintain adequate internal control over financial reporting. Our Chief Executive Officer is responsible to design or supervise a process
that provides reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external
purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. The policies and procedures include: 

maintenance of records in reasonable detail to accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of assets, 

reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors, and 

reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of assets that could have a material effect on our financial statements. 

Because of its inherent limitations, internal
control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Therefore, even those systems determined to be effective can
provide only reasonable assurance of achieving their control objectives. 

11 

Our management, with the participation of our
Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, evaluated the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of
the end of the period October 31, 2022. In making this assessment, our management used the criteria set forth by the Committee of
Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission COSO in Internal Control Integrated Framework (2013). Based
on this evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that, as of the end of the fiscal year October 31,
2022, our internal control over financial reporting were not effective at that reasonable assurance level. The following aspects of the
Company were noted as potential material weaknesses: 

Due to our size and limited resources, we currently do not employ the appropriate accounting personnel to ensure (a) we maintain proper segregation of duties, (b) that all transactions are entered timely and accurately, and (c) we properly account for complex or unusual transactions; 

Due to our size and scope of operations, we currently do not have an independent audit committee in place; 

Due to our size and limited resources, we have not properly documented a complete assessment of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our internal control over financial reporting. 

Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting 

There were no changes in our internal control
over financial reporting that occurred during our most recent fiscal quarter that have materially affected, or reasonably likely to materially
affect, our internal control over financial reporting. 

Attestation Report of Independent Public Accounting Firm 

This annual report does not include an attestation
report of our registered public accounting firm regarding internal control over financial reporting because as a smaller reporting company
we are not subject to attestation by our independent registered public accounting firm pursuant to rules of the Securities and Exchange
Commission that permit us to provide only management s report in this annual report.

Indemnification of Directors and Officers 

Our Articles of Incorporation and Bylaws both
provide for the indemnification of our officers and directors, to the fullest extent, permitted by Nevada law. 

Compliance with Section 16(a) of the Exchange Act 

Section 16(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of
1934 requires our directors, executive officers and persons who own more than ten percent of our common stock, to file with the SEC initial
reports of ownership and reports of changes in ownership of common stock. Officers, directors and 10 or greater beneficial owners
are required by SEC regulations to furnish us with copies of all Section 16(a) reports they file. Based upon a review of those forms
and representations regarding the need for filing for the year ended October 31, 2022, we believe all necessary forms have been filed. 

13 

Involvement in Certain Legal Proceedings 

Our directors and executive officers have not
been personally involved in any of the following events during the past ten years: 

any bankruptcy petition filed by or against such person or any business of which such person was a general partner or executive officer either at the time of the bankruptcy or within two years prior to that time; 

any conviction in a criminal proceeding or being subject to a pending criminal proceeding (excluding traffic violations and other minor offenses); 

being subject to any order, judgment, or decree, not subsequently reversed, suspended or vacated, of any court of competent jurisdiction, permanently or temporarily enjoining him from or otherwise limiting his involvement in any type of business, securities or banking activities or to be associated with any person practicing in banking or securities activities; 

being found by a court of competent jurisdiction in a civil action, the SEC or the Commodity Futures Trading Commission to have violated a Federal or state securities or commodities law, and the judgment has not been reversed, suspended, or vacated; 

being subject of, or a party to, any Federal or state judicial or administrative order, judgment decree, or finding, not subsequently reversed, suspended or vacated, relating to an alleged violation of any Federal or state securities or commodities law or regulation, any law or regulation respecting financial institutions or insurance companies, or any law or regulation prohibiting mail or wire fraud or fraud in connection with any business entity; or 

being subject of or party to any sanction or order, not subsequently reversed, suspended, or vacated, of any self-regulatory organization, any registered entity or any equivalent exchange, association, entity or organization that has disciplinary authority over its members or persons associated with a member. 

Family Relationships 

There are no familial relationships among any of our directors or officers. 

Director Independence 

We are not currently subject to listing requirements
of any national securities exchange or inter-dealer quotation system, which has requirements that a majority of the Board of Directors
be independent and, as a result, we are not at this time required to have our Board of Directors comprised of a majority
of independent directors. 

Board Committees 

Our board does not currently have a standing Audit
Committee, Compensation Committee or Nominating/Corporate Governance Committee due the board s limited size and the Company s
limited operations. The entire Board of Directors performs all functions that would otherwise be performed by committees. Given the present
size of our Board, it is not practical for us to have committees other than those described above, or to have more than two directors
on such committees. If we are able to grow our business and increase our operations, we intend to expand the size of our board and our
committees and allocate responsibilities accordingly.

is elected at our annual meeting and qualified. The duration of office for each of our officers is at the pleasure of the Board of Directors.
The Board of Directors has no nominating, auditing committee, or compensation committee. Therefore, the selection of a person or election

director, Mr. Dickson, received no compensation for director services. 

Outstanding Equity Awards at Fiscal Year End .
There were no outstanding equity awards as of October 31, 2022. 

Board Committees 

We do not currently have any committees of the
Board of Directors. Additionally, due to the nature of our intended business, the Board of Directors does not foresee a need for any committees
in the foreseeable future.

 Unless as otherwise indicated in the following table and the footnotes, our named executive officers and directors address in the following table is c/o Aureus Inc., One Glenlake Parkway #650, Atlanta, GA 30328. 

(2) 
 Under Rule 13d-3 of the Exchange Act, a beneficial owner of a security includes any person who, directly or indirectly, through any contract, arrangement, understanding, relationship, or otherwise has or shares: (i) voting power, which includes the power to vote, or to direct the voting of shares; and (ii) investment power, which includes the power to dispose or direct the disposition of shares. Certain shares may be deemed to be beneficially owned by more than one person (if, for example, persons share the power to vote or dispose of the shares). In addition, shares are deemed to be beneficially owned by a person if the person has the right to acquire the shares (for example, upon exercise of an option) within 60 days of the date as of which the information is provided. In computing the percentage ownership of any person, the amount of shares outstanding is deemed to include the number of shares beneficially owned by such person (and only such person) because of these acquisition rights. As a result, the percentage of outstanding shares of any person as shown in the above table does not necessarily reflect the person s actual ownership or voting power concerning the number of shares of common stock outstanding on the date of this Form 10. 

(3) 
 In calculating any percentage in the following table of common stock beneficially owned by one or more persons named therein, the following table is based on 255,527,518 shares of common stock, consisting of 85,166,322 shares outstanding as of the filing date of this Form 10-K and 170,358,196 shares of common stock issuable upon the conversion of the 5,000,000 shares of Series A Preferred Stock held by Mr. Dickson. (The Shares A Preferred Stock are convertible into such number of shares of common stock resulting in two-thirds (66.67 of the outstanding shares of common stock of the Company on a post-conversion basis.) 

16 

ITEM 13. CERTAIN RELATIONSHIPS AND RELATED TRANSACTIONS, AND DIRECTOR
INDEPENDENCE 

During the year ended October 31 ,
2022, a 5,500 payment was mistakenly made to a Company controlled by Everett Dickson. The amount is to be repaid. 

During the year ended October 31 ,
2022, the Company paid Robert Bohorad, the Company s President and CEO, 22,000 for compensation. As of October 31 ,
2022, there is 41,000 of accrued compensation due to Mr. Bohorad. 

In June 2022, Everett Dickson advanced the Company
 6,000 for a general operating expense. The 6,000 was repaid the following month. 

Director Independence 

We currently do not have any independent directors,
as the term independent is defined in Section 803A of the NYSE Amex LLC Company Guide. Since the OTC Markets does not have
rules regarding director independence, the Board makes its determination as to director independence based on the definition of independence 
as defined under the rules of the New York Stock Exchange NYSE and American Stock Exchange Amex ). 

ITEM 14. PRINCIPAL ACCOUNTING FEES AND SERVICES 

Audit Fees 

The aggregate fees billed for professional services
rendered by our auditor Fruci Associates II, PLLC for the audit and review of our financial statements for the fiscal years ended
October 31, 2022 and 2021 amounted to 47,531 and 40,250, respectively. 

Audit-Related Fees 

During the fiscal years ended October 31, 2022
and 2021 our principal accountant rendered assurance and related services reasonably related to the performance of the audit or review
of our financial statements in the amount of 0 and 0, respectively. 

Tax Fees 

The aggregate fees billed for professional services
rendered by our principal accountant for the tax compliance for the years ended October 31, 2022 and 2021 was 0.
