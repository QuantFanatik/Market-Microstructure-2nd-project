Forward Looking Statements 

The information contained in this Report includes
some statements that are not purely historical and that are forward-looking statements within the meaning of Section 27A
of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the Securities Act ), and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934,
as amended (the Exchange Act ), and as such, may involve risks and uncertainties. These forward-looking statements relate
to, among other things, expectations of the business environment in which we operate, perceived opportunities in the market and statements
regarding our mission and vision. In addition, any statements that refer to projections, forecasts or other characterizations of future
events or circumstances, including any underlying assumptions, are forward-looking statements. You can generally identify forward-looking
statements as statements containing the words anticipates, believes, continue, could, 
 estimates, expects, intends, may, might, plans, possible, 
 potential, predicts, projects, seeks, should, will, 
 would and similar expressions, or the negatives of such terms, but the absence of these words does not mean that a statement
is not forward-looking. 

Forward-looking statements involve risks and
uncertainties that could cause actual results or outcomes to differ materially from those expressed in the forward-looking statements.
The forward-looking statements contained herein are based on various assumptions, many of which are based, in turn, upon further assumptions.
Our expectations, beliefs and forward-looking statements are expressed in good faith on the basis of management s views and assumptions
as of the time the statements are made, but there can be no assurance that management s expectations, beliefs or projections will
result or be achieved or accomplished. We disclaim any obligation to update forward-looking statements to reflect events or circumstances
after the date hereof.

PART I 

ITEM 1. 
 BUSINESS 

Overview 

TechCom, Inc., which may also
be referred to we, us, our, or the Company, was organized on August 22, 2000 under the laws of the State of Nevada, as UgoMedia Interactive
Corporation. The Company has gone through several changes in its lines of business since its incorporation. 

On October 17, 2009, we acquired
Beijing Innotrek Technology Co. Ltd, a Chinese company based in Beijing, China Innotrek ). As a subsidiary of TechCom, Inc.,
Innotrek engaged in the research and development of broadband technology products in China. Innotrek specialized in high technology network
communications and offered broadband technology installation services to hotels. Its products included (i) a system that makes use of
various wired mediums, (ii) a cable modem and (iii) security and monitoring products. The company also distributed computers, network
equipment, storage devices, and software products. The Company currently has no operations. 

On June 30, 2017, the Company
re-domiciled in Delaware and ceased being a Nevada corporation. 

Pursuant to a Stock Purchase
Agreement dated October 6, 2017 and a Note Purchase Agreement dated October 11, 2017, Kok Seng Yeap obtained 1,000,000 shares of the Company s
convertible preferred stock and a convertible note in the amount of 50,000, the combination of which gave him a majority of the voting
power of all outstanding shares of the Company. 

On February 26, 2020, the
Company filed a Certificate of Amendment with Delaware to change its name to TechCom, Inc. 

On July 27, 2021, Kok Seng
Yeap sold 55,070,000 shares of Company s common stock and 1,000,000 shares of Company s Series A Preferred Stock to AlphaBit,
LLC, a Nevada limited liability company beneficially owned by Munaf Ali for 550,000. Such shares represent 87.60 of the Company s
voting power assuming conversion of all of the Company s Series A Preferred Stock. 

Going Concern 

The accompanying financial
statements have been prepared assuming that the Company will continue as a going concern, which contemplates the realization of assets
and the liquidation of liabilities in the normal course of business. The Company currently has no operations and as of December 31, 2022
a stockholders deficit of 124,608 with an accumulated deficit of 2,544,174. The Company intends to find a merger target in the form
of an operating entity. The Company cannot be certain that it will be successful in this strategy. 

These factors, among others,
raise substantial doubt about the Company s ability to continue as a going concern. The accompanying financial statements do not
include any adjustments that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty. 

Business 

Currently, we have no active
operations. 

1 

Research and Development 

We have not incurred any research
and development costs in the fiscal years ended December 31, 2022 or 2021. 

Employees 

As of March 30, 2023, the
Company has two officers: Mr. Kok Seng Yeap as Chief Executive Officer, and Mr. Lau Chew Chye as Chief Financial Officer. 

Insurance 

We do not maintain any insurance
and do not intend to maintain insurance in the future. Because we do not have any insurance, if we are made a party to any action, we
may not have sufficient funds to defend the litigation. If that occurs a judgment could be rendered against us that could cause us to
cease operations. 

Intellectual Property 

We currently have not obtained
any copyrights, patents or trademarks. We do not anticipate filing any copyright or trademark applications related to any assets over
the next 12 months. 

Government Regulation 

We will be required to comply
with all regulations, rules and directives of governmental authorities and agencies in any jurisdiction which we would conduct activities.
We do not believe that regulation will have a material impact on the way we conduct our business. We do not need to receive any government
approvals necessary to conduct our business; however, we will have to comply with all applicable export and import regulations.

 MARKET FOR COMMON EQUITY, RELATED STOCKHOLDER MATTERS AND ISSUER PURCHASES OF EQUITY SECURITIES 

Market Information 

The following table sets forth
the range of high and low closing sales prices for our common stock during each fiscal quarter during the two-year period ended December
31, 2022 as reported by the OTC Market. The trading volume of our securities fluctuates and may be limited during certain periods.
As a result, the liquidity of an investment in our securities may be adversely affected.

Holders 

As of December 31, 2022, we
had 64,990,254 shares of our common stock issued and outstanding, and held by 175 persons. 

In general, pursuant to Rule
144 adopted under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, a shareholder who owns restricted shares of a company which files periodic reports
with the Securities and Exchange Commission and who has a holding period of at least six months, is entitled to sell such shares in accordance
with the provisions of Rule 144. In the event the shareholder is a non-affiliate of the issuer, he or she may make unlimited public resales
of shares under Rule 144 provided that the current public information requirement is satisfied. A non-affiliate who has a holding period
of more than one year, may make unlimited resales of shares without compliance with any other requirement of Rule 144. Persons who are
affiliates of the issuer must comply with all requirements of Rule 144 in conjunction with resales of their shares including the current
public information requirement, the volume limitations, the manner of sale requirements and the filing of a Form 144. Therefore, the possible
sale of our currently outstanding shares pursuant to Rule 144 may, in the future, have a depressive effect on the price of our common
stock in the over-the-counter market. 

Dividends 

We have never declared or
paid a dividend on our common stock and, because we have very limited resources and a substantial accumulated deficit, we do not anticipate
declaring or paying any dividends on our common stock in the foreseeable future. Rather, we intend to retain earnings, if any, for the
continued operation and expansion of our business. It is unlikely, therefore, that the holders of our common stock will have an opportunity
to profit from anything other than potential appreciation in the value of our common shares held by them. If you require dividend income,
you should not rely on an investment in our common stock. 

Equity Compensation Plans 

We do not currently have any equity compensation
plans.

ITEM 7. 
 MANAGEMENT S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS 

You should
read this discussion together with the Financial Statements, related Notes and other financial information included elsewhere in this
Form 10-K. The following discussion contains assumptions, estimates and other forward-looking statements that involve a number of
risks and uncertainties, including those discussed elsewhere in this Form 10-K. These risks could cause our actual results to differ
materially from those anticipated in these forward-looking statements. 

This discussion is intended to further the reader s understanding
of the Company s financial condition and results of operations and should be read in conjunction with the Company s financial
statements and related notes included elsewhere herein. This discussion also contains forward-looking statements. The Company s
actual results could differ materially from those anticipated in these forward-looking statements as a result of the risks and uncertainties
set forth elsewhere in this Annual Report and in the Company s other SEC filings. Readers are cautioned not to place undue reliance
on any forward-looking statements, which speak only as of the date hereof. The Company is not party to any transactions that would be
considered off balance sheet pursuant to disclosure requirements under Item 303(c) of Regulation S-K. 

Overview 

The Company is a non-operating
holding company. Historically, the Company has been involved and invested in gaming and vending businesses, the focus of which was on
the entertainment, travel and leisure industries. Current management acquired control of the Company through purchase of preferred shares
in July 2021 and is in the process of identifying operating businesses that are potential candidates for acquisition. 

Critical Accounting Policies 

The relevant accounting policies are listed below. 

Basis of Accounting 

The basis is United States generally accepted
accounting principles. 

4 

Cash and Cash Equivalents 

The Company considers all short-term investments
with a maturity of three months or less at the date of purchase to be cash and cash equivalents. 

Use of Estimates 

In preparing financial statements in conformity
with generally accepted accounting principles, management is required to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts
of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and revenues
and expenses during the reported period. Actual results could differ from those estimates. 

Advertising 

Advertising costs are expensed when incurred.
The Company incurred 0 of sales and marketing expenses, including advertising, for the years ended December 31, 2022 and December 31,
2021. 

Comprehensive Income (Loss) 

Net income (loss) is equal to comprehensive income
(loss). 

Income Taxes 

H.R. 1 (the
 Tax Reform Law ), effective for tax years beginning on or after January 1, 2018, except for certain provisions, resulting
in significant changes to existing United States tax law, including various provisions that are expected to impact the Company. The Tax
Reform Law reduced the federal corporate tax rate from 34 to 21 effective January 1, 2018 for the Company. 

At December 31, 2022 and 2021, the Company had
net operating losses NOL for income tax purposes. The Company has NOL carry-forwards for Federal income tax purposes
of 2.54 million and 2.44 million at December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. No tax benefit was reported with respect to
these NOL carry-forwards in the accompanying financial statements because the Company believes the realization of the
Company s deferred tax of approximately 0.51 million as of December 31, 2022, was not considered more likely than not
and accordingly, the potential tax benefits of the net loss carry-forwards are fully offset by a full valuation allowance. 

Components of deferred tax assets as of December
31, 2022 and 2021 are as follows:

Recent Accounting Pronouncements 

In January 2020, the FASB issued ASU 2020-01 to
clarify the interaction of the accounting for equity securities under ASC 321 and investments accounted for under the equity method of
accounting in ASC 323 and the accounting for certain forward contracts and purchased options accounted for under ASC 815. With respect
to the interactions between ASC 321 and ASC 323, the amendments clarify that an entity should consider observable transactions that require
it to either apply or discontinue the equity method of accounting when applying the measurement alternative in ASC 321, immediately before
applying or upon discontinuing the equity method of accounting. With respect to forward contracts or purchased options to purchase securities,
the amendments clarify that when applying the guidance in ASC 815-10-15-141(a), an entity should not consider whether upon the settlement
of the forward contract or exercise of the purchased option, individually or with existing investments, the underlying securities would
be accounted for under the equity method in ASC 323 or the fair value option in accordance with ASC 825. The ASU is effective for interim
and annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2020. Early adoption is permitted, including adoption in any interim period.
The adoption of this standard did not have a material impact on the Company s financial statements. 

In November 2019, the FASB issued ASU No.
2019-08, Compensation Stock Compensation (Topic 718) and Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606), Codification
Improvements Share-Based Consideration Payable to a Customer. The amendments in this Update require that an entity measure
and classify share-based payment awards granted to a customer by applying the guidance in Topic 718. The amount recorded as a
reduction of the transaction price is required to be measured on the basis of the grant-date fair value of the share-based payment
award in accordance with Topic 718. The grant date is the date at which a grantor (supplier) and a grantee (customer) reach a mutual
understanding of the key terms and conditions of a share-based payment award. For entities that have not yet adopted the amendments
in Update 2018-07, the amendments in this Update are effective for (1) public business entities in fiscal years beginning after
December 15, 2019, and interim periods within those fiscal years, and (2) other than public business entities in fiscal years
beginning after December 15, 2019, and interim periods within fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2020. The Company is
evaluating the impact of this on its consolidated financial statements. 

6 

In December 2019, the FASB issued ASU 2019-12,
Simplifying the Accounting for Income Taxes, which simplifies the accounting for income taxes, eliminates certain exceptions within ASC
740, Income Taxes, and clarifies certain aspects of the current guidance to promote consistent application among reporting entities.
The guidance is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2020, and interim periods within those fiscal years, with
early adoption permitted. Upon adoption, the Company must apply certain aspects of this standard retrospectively for all periods presented
while other aspects are applied on a modified retrospective basis through a cumulative-effect adjustment to retained earnings as of the
beginning of the fiscal year of adoption. The Company is evaluating the impact of this on its consolidated financial statements. 

In August 2020, the FASB issued ASU
2020-06, Debt - Debt with Conversion and Other Options (Subtopic 470- 20) and Derivatives and Hedging - Contracts in
Entity s Own Equity (Subtopic 815-40): Accounting for Convertible Instruments and Contracts in an Entity s Own
Equity ASU 2020-06 ), which simplifies the accounting for certain financial instruments with characteristics of
liabilities and equity. This ASU (1) simplifies the accounting for convertible debt instruments and convertible preferred stock by
removing the existing guidance in ASC 470-20, Debt: Debt with Conversion and Other Options, that requires entities to account for
beneficial conversion features and cash conversion features in equity, separately from the host convertible debt or preferred stock;
(2) revises the scope exception from derivative accounting in ASC 815-40 for freestanding financial instruments and embedded
features that are both indexed to the issuer s own stock and classified in stockholders equity, by removing certain
criteria required for equity classification; and (3) revises the guidance in ASC 260, Earnings Per Share, to require entities
to calculate diluted earnings per share (EPS) for convertible instruments by using the if-converted method. In addition, entities
must presume share settlement for purposes of calculating diluted EPS when an instrument may be settled in cash or shares. For
SEC filers, excluding smaller reporting companies, ASU 2020-06 is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2021
including interim periods within those fiscal years. Early adoption is permitted, but no earlier than fiscal years beginning after
December 15, 2020. For all other entities, ASU 2020-06 is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2023, including
interim periods within those fiscal years. Entities should adopt the guidance as of the beginning of the fiscal year of adoption and
cannot adopt the guidance in an interim reporting period. The Company is currently evaluating the impact that ASU 2020-06 may
have on its financial statements and related disclosures when adopted. 

In May 2021, the FASB issued ASU 2021-04, Earnings
Per Share (Topic 260), Debt-Modifications and Extinguishments (Subtopic 470-50), Compensation-Stock Compensation (Topic 718), and Derivatives
and Hedging-Contracts in Entity s Own Equity (Subtopic 815-40) , ASU 2021-04 ). This ASU reduces diversity in an
issuer s accounting for modifications or exchanges of freestanding equity-classified written call options (for example, warrants)
that remain equity classified after modification or exchange. This ASU provides guidance for a modification or an exchange of a freestanding
equity-classified written call option that is not within the scope of another Topic. It specifically addresses: (1) how an entity should
treat a modification of the terms or conditions or an exchange of a freestanding equity-classified written call option that remains equity
classified after modification or exchange; (2) how an entity should measure the effect of a modification or an exchange of a freestanding
equity-classified written call option that remains equity classified after modification or exchange; and (3) how an entity should recognize
the effect of a modification or an exchange of a freestanding equity-classified written call option that remains equity classified after
modification or exchange. This ASU is effective for all entities for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2021. An entity should
apply the amendments prospectively to modifications or exchanges occurring on or after the effective date of the amendments. Early adoption
is permitted, including adoption in an interim period. The adoption of ASU 2021-04 on January 1, 2022 did not have a material impact on
the Company s condensed financial statements or disclosures. 

Management believes that other recent accounting
pronouncements issued by the FASB, including its Emerging Issues Task Force, the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants, and
the Securities and Exchange Commission do not have a material impact on the Company s present or near future financial statements.

Results of Operations for the years ended December
31, 2022 and December 31, 2021 

For the year ended December 31, 2022 and 2021,
we had no revenue. 

Costs of revenue during these same periods were
 0. 

For the years ended December 31, 2022 and December
31, 2021, professional and administrative expenses were 108,064 and 90,708, respectively. These costs were primarily the costs for the
daily operations and legal services. 

For the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021,
professional expenses were 52,446 and 83,380. The professional fee expenses in 2022 and 2021 were mainly due to SEC filing preparations. 

For the years ended December 31, 2022 and December
31, 2021, general and administrative expenses were 55,618 and 7,328. Costs incurred were primarily SEC filings and stock records service
fees. The significant increase of general and administrative expenses was due to hiring the former owner team as their management company
assumed the responsibilities of CEO and CFO.

Going Concern 

The accompanying financial statements have been
prepared assuming that the Company will continue as a going concern, which contemplates the realization of assets and the liquidation
of liabilities in the normal course of business. The Company currently has no operations and has a stockholders deficit of 124,608 with
an accumulated deficit of 2,544,174. The Company intends to find a merger target in the form of an operating entity. The Company cannot
be certain that it will be successful in this strategy. 

These factors, among others, raise substantial
doubt about the Company s ability to continue as a going concern. The accompanying financial statements do not include any adjustments
that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty. 

Summary of any product research and development
that we will perform for the term of our plan of operation 

The Company is a shell company with no operations
and does not have specific products. Our research and development will depend on a future merger with an operational company or companies. 

Expected purchase or sale of plant and significant
equipment 

We do not anticipate the purchase or sale of any
plant or significant equipment; as such, items are not required by us at this time. 

Significant changes in the number of employees 

As of December 31, 2022, we did not have any paid
employees. We are dependent upon our officers and directors for our future business development. As our operations expand, we anticipate
that we need to hire additional employees, consultants and professionals; however, the exact number is not certain at this time. 

Liquidity and Capital Resources 

As of December 31 2022, we had cash of 0. 

A critical component of our operating plan impacting
our continued existence is our ability to obtain additional capital through additional equity and/or debt financing. 

We have limited financial resources available,
which has had an adverse impact on our liquidity, activities and operations. These limitations have adversely affected our ability
to obtain certain projects and pursue additional business. Without realization of additional capital, it would be unlikely for us to continue
as a going concern. In order for us to remain a going concern, we will need to obtain additional capital. Additional working capital
may be sought through additional debt or equity private placements, additional notes payable to banks or related parties (officers, directors
or stockholders), from other funding sources at market rates of interest, or a combination of these. The ability to raise necessary financing
will depend on many factors, including the nature and prospects of any business to be acquired and the economic and market conditions
prevailing at the time financing is sought. No assurances can be given that any necessary financing can be obtained on terms favorable
to us, or at all. 

In addition, the Company hired a consulting company
which consists of the former principal shareholders to manage the Company and for these managers to continue to serve as CEO and CFO.
The fees were 48,000 in 2022. 

Future funding could result in potentially dilutive
issuances of equity securities, the incurrence of debt, contingent liabilities and/or amortization expenses related to goodwill and other
intangible assets, which could materially adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition. Any future
acquisitions of other businesses, technologies, services or products might require us to obtain additional equity or debt financing, which
might not be available on terms favorable to us, or at all, and such financing, if available, might be dilutive. 

9 

Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements 

We do not have any off-balance sheet arrangements
that have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on our financial condition, changes in financial condition, revenues
or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources that are material to investors. 

Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates 

Revenue Recognition: We recognize revenue from
product sales once all of the following criteria for revenue recognition have been met: pervasive evidence that an agreement exists; the
services have been rendered; the fee is fixed and determinable and not subject to refund or adjustment; and collection of the amount due
is reasonable assured.

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING
FIRM 

To the Board of Directors and Stockholders of TECHCOM,
Inc. 

Opinion on the Financial Statements 

We have audited the accompanying
balance sheets of TECHCOM, Inc. (the Company) as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, and the related statements of operations, changes in stockholders 
deficit, and cash flows for the years then ended, and the related notes (collectively referred to as the financial statements). In our
opinion, the financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of December 31, 2022
and 2021, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for the years then ended, in conformity with accounting principles generally
accepted in the United States of America. 

Going Concern Matter 

As discussed in Note 2 to the financial
statements, as of December 31, 2022, the Company experienced an accumulated deficit of 2,544,174 and suffered from continuous losses
for a reasonable period of time, which is considered to be one year from the issuance date of the financial statements. These matters
raise substantial doubt about the Company's ability to continue as a going concern. Management s plans in regard to this matter
are described in Note 2. The financial statements do not include any adjustments that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty. 

Basis for Opinion 

These financial statements are
the responsibility of the Company s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company s financial statements
based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB)
and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable
rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. 

We conducted our audits in accordance
with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether
the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. The Company is not required to have, nor were
we engaged to perform, an audit of its internal control over financial reporting. As part of our audits, we are required to obtain an
understanding of internal control over financial reporting, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the
Company s internal control over financial reporting. Accordingly, we express no such opinion. 

Our audits included performing procedures
to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that
respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial
statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as
evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion. 

Critical Audit Matters 

Critical audit matters
are matters arising from the current period audit of the consolidated financial statements that were communicated or required to be communicated
to the audit committee and that: (1) relate to accounts or disclosures that are material to the consolidated financial statements and
(2) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. We determined that there are no critical audit matters.

stock-based compensation was issued during
the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021. 

In November 2019, the FASB issued ASU No. 2019-08,
Compensation Stock Compensation (Topic 718) and Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606), Codification Improvements 
Share-Based Consideration Payable to a Customer. The amendments in this Update require that an entity measure and classify share-based
payment awards granted to a customer by applying the guidance in Topic 718. The amount recorded as a reduction of the transaction price
is required to be measured on the basis of the grant-date fair value of the share-based payment award in accordance with Topic 718. The
grant date is the date at which a grantor (supplier) and a grantee (customer) reach a mutual understanding of the key terms and conditions
of a share-based payment award. For entities that have not yet adopted the amendments in Update 2018-07, the amendments in this Update
are effective for (1) public business entities in fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2019, and interim periods within those fiscal
years, and (2) other than public business entities in fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2019, and interim periods within fiscal
years beginning after December 15, 2020. The Company is evaluating the impact of this on its consolidated financial statements. 

In December 2019, the FASB issued ASU 2019-12,
Simplifying the Accounting for Income Taxes, which simplifies the accounting for income taxes, eliminates certain exceptions within ASC
740, Income Taxes, and clarifies certain aspects of the current guidance to promote consistent application among reporting entities. The
guidance is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2020, and interim periods within those fiscal years, with early
adoption permitted. Upon adoption, the Company must apply certain aspects of this standard retrospectively for all periods presented while
other aspects are applied on a modified retrospective basis through a cumulative-effect adjustment to retained earnings as of the beginning
of the fiscal year of adoption. The Company is evaluating the impact of this on its consolidated financial statements. 

In August 2020, the FASB issued ASU
2020-06, Debt - Debt with Conversion and Other Options (Subtopic 470- 20) and Derivatives and Hedging - Contracts in
Entity s Own Equity (Subtopic 815-40): Accounting for Convertible Instruments and Contracts in an Entity s Own
Equity ASU 2020-06 ), which simplifies the accounting for certain financial instruments with characteristics of
liabilities and equity. This ASU (1) simplifies the accounting for convertible debt instruments and convertible preferred stock by
removing the existing guidance in ASC 470-20, Debt: Debt with Conversion and Other Options, that requires entities to account
for beneficial conversion features and cash conversion features in equity, separately from the host convertible debt or preferred
stock; (2) revises the scope exception from derivative accounting in ASC 815-40 for freestanding financial instruments and embedded
features that are both indexed to the issuer s own stock and classified in stockholders equity, by removing certain
criteria required for equity classification; and (3) revises the guidance in ASC 260, Earnings Per Share, to require entities
to calculate diluted earnings per share (EPS) for convertible instruments by using the if-converted method. In addition, entities
must presume share settlement for purposes of calculating diluted EPS when an instrument may be settled in cash or shares. For
SEC filers, excluding smaller reporting companies, ASU 2020-06 is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2021
including interim periods within those fiscal years. Early adoption is permitted, but no earlier than fiscal years beginning after
December 15, 2020. For all other entities, ASU 2020-06 is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2023, including
interim periods within those fiscal years. Entities should adopt the guidance as of the beginning of the fiscal year of adoption and
cannot adopt the guidance in an interim reporting period. The Company is currently evaluating the impact that ASU 2020-06 may
have on its financial statements and related disclosures when adopted. 

In May 2021, the FASB issued ASU 2021-04, Earnings
Per Share (Topic 260), Debt-Modifications and Extinguishments (Subtopic 470-50), Compensation-Stock Compensation (Topic 718), and Derivatives
and Hedging-Contracts in Entity s Own Equity (Subtopic 815-40) , ASU 2021-04 ). This ASU reduces diversity in an
issuer s accounting for modifications or exchanges of freestanding equity-classified written call options (for example, warrants)
that remain equity classified after modification or exchange. This ASU provides guidance for a modification or an exchange of a freestanding
equity-classified written call option that is not within the scope of another Topic. It specifically addresses: (1) how an entity should
treat a modification of the terms or conditions or an exchange of a freestanding equity-classified written call option that remains equity
classified after modification or exchange; (2) how an entity should measure the effect of a modification or an exchange of a freestanding
equity-classified written call option that remains equity classified after modification or exchange; and (3) how an entity should recognize
the effect of a modification or an exchange of a freestanding equity-classified written call option that remains equity classified after
modification or exchange. This ASU is effective for all entities for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2021. An entity should
apply the amendments prospectively to modifications or exchanges occurring on or after the effective date of the amendments. Early adoption
is permitted, including adoption in an interim period. The adoption of ASU 2021-04 on January 1, 2022 did not have a material impact on
the Company s condensed financial statements or disclosures. 

Management believes that other recent accounting
pronouncements issued by the FASB, including its Emerging Issues Task Force, the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants, and
the Securities and Exchange Commission do not have a material impact on the Company s present or near future financial statements.

in the accompanying financial statements because the Company believes the realization of the Company s deferred tax of approximately

ITEM 9. 
 CHANGES IN AND DISAGREEMENTS WITH ACCOUNTANTS ON ACCOUNTING AND FINANCIAL DISCLOSURE 

Since inception, our principal
independent accountant has neither resigned, declined to stand for re-election, nor been dismissed by our directors. 

ITEM 9A. 
 CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES 

Disclosure Controls and Procedures. 

The Company maintains disclosure controls and
procedures (as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended) that are designed to ensure that information
required to be disclosed in the Company s Securities Exchange Act reports is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within
the time periods specified in SEC rules and forms and that such information is accumulated and communicated to the Company s management,
as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. 

The Company s management, with the participation
of our principal executive and principal financial officer evaluated the effectiveness of the Company s disclosure controls and
procedures as of the end of the period covered by this report. Based upon that evaluation, our principal executive and principal financial
officer concluded that, as of the end of the period covered by this report, the Company s disclosure controls and procedures were
not effective. 

Management s Report on Internal Controls
over Financial Disclosure Controls and Procedures 

Management is responsible for establishing and
maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Exchange Act Rule 13a-15(f)). The Company s internal
control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting
and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United
States of America. Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements.
Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because
of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. Under the supervision and
with the participation of management, including the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, the Company conducted an evaluation
of the effectiveness of the Company s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2021 using the criteria established
in Internal Control - Integrated Framework issued in 2013 by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Tread way
Commission COSO ). 

A material weakness is a deficiency, or combination
of deficiencies, in internal control over financial reporting, such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement
of the Company s annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis. In its assessment of
the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2021, the Company determined that there were control
deficiencies that constituted material weaknesses, as described below. 

1. 
 We do not have an Audit Committee While not being legally obligated to have an audit committee, it is the management s view that such a committee, including a financial expert member, is an utmost important entity level control over the Company s financial statement. Currently the Board of Directors acts in the capacity of the Audit Committee, and does not include a member that is considered to be independent of management to provide the necessary oversight over management s activities.

 We did not maintain appropriate cash controls As of December 31, 2021, the Company has not maintained sufficient internal controls over financial reporting for the cash process, including failure to segregate cash handling and accounting functions, and did not require dual signature on the Company s bank accounts. Alternatively, the effects of poor cash controls were mitigated by the fact that the Company had limited transactions in their bank accounts. 

3. 
 We did not implement appropriate information technology controls As at December 31, 2021, the Company retains copies of all financial data and material agreements; however there is no formal procedure or evidence of normal backup of the Company s data or off-site storage of data in the event of theft, misplacement, or loss due to unmitigated factors. 

11 

Accordingly, the Company concluded that these
control deficiencies resulted in a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of the annual or interim financial statements will
not be prevented or detected on a timely basis by the Company s internal controls. 

As a result of the material weaknesses described
above, management has concluded that the Company did not maintain effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31,
2021 based on criteria established in Internal Control- Integrated Framework issued by COSO. 

System of Internal Control over Financial
Reporting 

Our management is responsible for establishing
and maintaining a system of disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act) that
is designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by us in the reports that we file or submit under the Exchange Act is
recorded, processed, summarized and reported, within the time periods specified in the Commission s rules and forms. Disclosure
controls and procedures include, without limitation, controls and procedures designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed
by an issuer in the reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to the issuer s management,
including its principal executive officer or officers and principal financial officer or officers, or persons performing similar functions,
as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. 

An evaluation was conducted under the supervision
and with the participation of our management of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures
as of December 31, 2021. Based on that evaluation, our management concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were not effective
as of such date to ensure that information required to be disclosed in the reports that we file or submit under the Exchange Act, is recorded,
processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in SEC rules and forms. 

Changes in Internal Control over Financial
Reporting 

There was no change in the Company s internal
control over financial reporting during the quarterly period covered by this report that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely
to materially affect, the Company s internal control over financial reporting.

Section 16(a) of the Securities

to file reports of ownership and changes in ownership with the Securities and Exchange Commission. Officers, directors and ten percent
stockholders are required by regulation to furnish us with copies of all Section 16(a) forms they file. Based solely on copies of such
forms received or written representations from certain reporting persons that no Form 5s were required for those persons, we believe that,
during the fiscal year ended December 31, 2019, all filing requirements applicable to our officers, directors and greater than ten percent
beneficial owners were complied with.

CFO. The fees were 48,000 in 2022. 

None of the Company s
Named Executive Officers have received any other compensation for their management services to the Company since our inception. Future
compensation of officers will be determined by the Board of Directors based upon our financial condition and performance, our financial
requirements, and individual performance of each officer. 

We do not have an employment
agreement with the Company s Named Executive Officers. Further, we have no compensatory plans or arrangements, including payments
to be received from the Company, with respect to either Executive Officer or any other of our employees, which would in any way result
in payments to any such person because of resignation, retirement or other termination of such person's employment with us, or any change
in control of the Company, or a change in the person's responsibilities following such a change in control. 

No retirement, pension, profit

Our directors have advanced
funds on an interest-free basis, with no maturity date, from inception for working. Amounts advanced totaled 97,867 in 2022 and 130,006
in 202. 

As of the date of this Annual
Report, we have no standing committees and our entire board of directors serves as our audit and compensation committees. We have determined
that none of our directors are independent based on an analysis of the standards for independence set forth in NASDAQ listing standards
and SEC rule. If we undertake to qualify our common stock for quotation in the over-the-counter market, we may need to ensure we meet
any eligibility requirements with respect to independent directors.
