 Item 1: Business 
 In this Annual Report on Form 10-K, unless the context otherwise requires, references to Realty Income, the Company, we, our or us refer to Realty Income Corporation and our subsidiaries. Our financial results for the periods presented reflect our merger with VEREIT, Inc. ("VEREIT") from the merger date of November 1, 2021; therefore, periods prior to that date do not reflect the impact of the VEREIT merger. 
 THE COMPANY 
 Realty Income, The Monthly Dividend Company , is an S P 500 company and member of the S P 500 Dividend Aristocrats index for having increased its dividend every year for over 25 consecutive years. We invest in people and places to deliver dependable monthly dividends that increase over time. We are structured as a real estate investment trust ("REIT"), requiring us to annually distribute at least 90 of our taxable income (excluding net capital gains) in the form of dividends to our stockholders. The monthly dividends are supported by the cash flow generated from real estate in which we own or hold interests in under long-term net lease agreements with our commercial clients. 
 Realty Income was founded in 1969, and listed on the New York Stock Exchange ("NYSE": O) in 1994. Over the past 54 years, Realty Income has been acquiring and managing freestanding commercial properties that generate rental revenue under long-term net lease agreements with our commercial clients. 
 At December 31, 2022, our diversified portfolio consisted of: 
 Owned or held interests in 12,237 properties; 
 An occupancy rate of 99.0 , or 12,111 properties leased and 126 properties available for lease or sale; 
 Clients doing business in 84 separate industries; 
 Locations in all 50 United States ("U.S."), Puerto Rico, the United Kingdom ("U.K."), Spain, and Italy; 
 Approximately 236.8 million square feet of leasable space; 
 A weighted average remaining lease term (excluding rights to extend a lease at the option of our client) of approximately 9.5 years; and 
 An average leasable space per property of approximately 19,350 square feet, approximately 13,000 square feet per retail property and approximately 234,100 square feet per industrial property. 
 Of the 12,237 properties in the portfolio at December 31, 2022, 12,018, or 98.2 , are single-client properties, of which 11,894 were leased, and the remaining are multi-client properties. 
 Our common stock is listed on the NYSE under the ticker symbol O with a CUSIP number of 756109-104. Our central index key number is 726728. Our notes are listed on the NYSE as follows: 
 Notes Ticker Symbol CUISP 1.125 Notes due July 2027 O27A 756109-BB9 
 1.875 Notes due January 2027 O27B 756109-BM5 
 1.625 Notes due December 2030 O30 756109-AY0 
 1.750 Notes due July 2033 O33A 756109-BC7 
 2.500 Notes due January 2042 O42 756109-BN3 
 
 In January 2023, we had 395 employees, inclusive of four part-time employees, as compared to 371 employees, inclusive of four part-time employees, in January 2022. 
 We maintain a corporate website at www.realtyincome.com. On our website we make available, free of charge, copies of our annual report on Form 10-K, quarterly reports on Form 10-Q, Form 3s, Form 4s, Form 5s, current reports on Form 8-K, and amendments to those reports, as soon as reasonably practicable after we electronically file these reports with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the "SEC"). None of the information on our website is deemed to be part of this report.

RECENT DEVELOPMENTS 
 Increases in Monthly Dividends to Common Stockholders 
 We have continued our 54-year policy of paying monthly dividends. In addition, we increased the dividend four times during 2022 and twice during 2023. As of February 2023, we have paid 101 consecutive quarterly dividend increases and increased the dividend 119 times since our listing on the NYSE in 1994. 
 Month Month Monthly Dividend Increase 2022 Dividend increases 
 Declared Paid per share per share 1st increase Dec 2021 Jan 2022 0.2465 0.0005 2nd increase Mar 2022 Apr 2022 0.2470 0.0005 3rd increase Jun 2022 Jul 2022 0.2475 0.0005 4th increase Sep 2022 Oct 2022 0.2480 0.0005 2023 Dividend increases 
 1st increase Dec 2022 Jan 2023 0.2485 0.0005 2nd increase Feb 2023 Mar 2023 0.2545 0.0060 
 The dividends paid per share during 2022 totaled 2.967, as compared to 2.833 during 2021, an increase of 0.134, or 4.7 . 
 The monthly dividend of 0.2545 per share represents a current annualized dividend of 3.0540 per share, and an annualized dividend yield of 4.8 based on the last reported sale price of our common stock on the NYSE of 63.43 on December 31, 2022. Although we expect to continue our policy of paying monthly dividends, we cannot guarantee that we will maintain our current level of dividends, that we will continue our pattern of increasing dividends per share, or what our actual dividend yield will be in any future period. 
 Acquisitions During 2022 
 Below is a listing of our acquisitions in the U.S. and Europe for the year ended December 31, 2022: 
 Number of Properties Leasable Square Feet (in thousands, unaudited) Investment in millions) Weighted Average Lease Term (Years) Initial Weighted Average Cash Lease Yield (1) 
 Year ended December 31, 2022 (2) 
 Acquisitions - U.S. 990 15,774 5,746.4 19.3 6.0 Acquisitions - Europe 94 11,179 2,441.3 8.9 6.0 Total acquisitions 1,084 26,953 8,187.7 16.3 6.0 Properties under development (3) 
 217 5,500 807.6 15.0 5.3 Total (4) 
 1,301 32,453 8,995.3 16.2 5.9 
 (1) The initial weighted average cash lease yield for a property is generally computed as estimated contractual first year cash net operating income, which, in the case of a net leased property, is equal to the aggregate cash base rent for the first full year of each lease, divided by the total cost of the property. Since it is possible that a client could default on the payment of contractual rent, we cannot provide assurance that the actual return on the funds invested will remain at the percentages listed above. Contractual net operating income used in the calculation of initial weighted average cash yield includes approximately 10.5 million received as settlement credits as reimbursement of free rent periods for the year ended December 31, 2022. 
 In the case of a property under development or expansion, the contractual lease rate is generally fixed such that rent varies based on the actual total investment in order to provide a fixed rate of return. When the lease does not provide for a fixed rate of return on a property under development or expansion, the initial weighted average cash lease yield is computed as follows: estimated cash net operating income (determined by the lease) for the first full year of each lease, divided by our projected total investment in the property, including land, construction and capitalized interest costs. 
 (2) None of our investments during the year ended December 31, 2022, caused any one client to be 10 or more of our total assets at December 31, 2022. 
 (3) Includes five U.K. development properties that represent an investment of 40.9 million during the year ended December 31, 2022, converted at the applicable exchange rate on the funding date. 
 (4) Our clients occupying the new properties are 71.4 retail, 19.1 gaming, 6.5 industrial and 3.0 other property types (including 2.7 agricultural and 0.3 office) based on rental revenue. Approximately 23 of the rental revenue generated from acquisitions during the year ended December 31, 2022 is from our investment grade rated clients, their subsidiaries or affiliated companies.

Appointment of New Chief Operating Officer ("COO") 
 Effective January 2023, Gregory J. Whyte assumed his new role as our Executive Vice President and COO. Mr. Whyte has a background in investment banking and he has served in both advisory roles and as director for several publicly traded companies. 
 Portfolio Discussion 
 Leasing Results 
 At December 31, 2022, we had 126 properties available for lease or sale out of 12,237 properties in our portfolio, which represents a 99.0 occupancy rate based on the number of properties in our portfolio. Our property-level occupancy rates exclude properties with ancillary leases only, such as cell towers and billboards . 
 Below is a summary of our portfolio activity for the periods indicated below: 
 Three months ended December 31, 2022 Properties available for lease at September 30, 2022 
 131 Lease expirations (1) 
 185 Re-leases to same client (151) Re-leases to new client (9) Vacant dispositions (30) Properties available for lease at December 31, 2022 
 126 
 Year ended December 31, 2022 Properties available for lease at December 31, 2021 
 164 Lease expirations (1) 
 719 Re-leases to same client (571) Re-leases to new client (34) Vacant dispositions (152) Properties available for lease at December 31, 2022 
 126 
 (1) Includes scheduled and unscheduled expirations (including leases rejected in bankruptcy), as well as future expirations resolved in the periods indicated above. 
 During the three months ended December 31, 2022, the new annualized contractual rent on re-leases was 39.16 million, as compared to the previous annual contractual rent of 37.71 million on the same units, representing a rent recapture rate of 103.8 on the units re-leased. We re-leased six units to new clients without a period of vacancy, and seven units to new clients after a period of vacancy. 
 During the year ended December 31, 2022, the new annualized contractual rent on re-leases was 139.72 million, as compared to the previous annualized contractual rent of 131.93 million on the same units, representing a rent recapture rate of 105.9 on the units re-leased. We re-leased 18 units to new clients without a period of vacancy, and 32 units to new clients after a period of vacancy. 
 As part of our re-leasing costs, we pay leasing commissions to unrelated, third-party real estate brokers consistent with the commercial real estate industry standard, and sometimes provide rent concessions to our clients. We do not consider the collective impact of the leasing commissions or rent concessions to our clients to be material to our financial position or results of operations. 
 At December 31, 2022, our average annualized contractual rent was approximately 14.55 per square foot on the 12,111 leased properties in our portfolio. At December 31, 2022, we classified 22 properties, with a carrying amount of 29.5 million, as real estate and lease intangibles held for sale, net on our consolidated balance sheet. The expected sale of these properties does not represent a strategic shift that will have a major effect on our operations and financial results and is consistent with our existing disposition strategy to further enhance our real estate portfolio and maximize portfolio returns.

Investments in Existing Properties 
 During 2022, we capitalized costs of 96.7 million on existing properties in our portfolio, consisting of 88.3 million for non-recurring building improvements, 5.2 million for re-leasing costs, and 3.2 million for recurring capital expenditures. 
 The majority of our building improvements relate to roof repairs, HVAC improvements, and parking lot resurfacing and replacements. The amount of our capital expenditures can vary significantly, depending on the rental market, credit worthiness of our clients, the lease term and the willingness of our clients to pay higher rental revenue over the terms of the leases. 
 We define non-recurring capital expenditures as property improvements in which we invest additional capital that extend the useful life of the properties. We define recurring capital expenditures as mandatory and recurring landlord capital expenditure obligations that have a limited useful life. 
 Sale of Unconsolidated Joint Ventures 
 During 2022, all seven of the properties owned by our industrial partnerships acquired in connection with the VEREIT merger were sold. The gross purchase price for the properties was 905.0 million and we collected 114.0 million of net proceeds (after mortgage defeasance and closing costs) to date, representing our proportionate share of partnership distributions. 
 Equity Capital Raising 
 We have an At-The-Market ("ATM") program, pursuant to which we may offer and sell up to 120,000,000 shares of common stock (1) by us to, or through, a consortium of banks acting as our sales agents or (2) by a consortium of banks acting as forward sellers on behalf of any forward purchasers contemplated thereunder, in each case by means of ordinary brokers' transactions on the NYSE at prevailing market prices or at negotiated prices or by any other methods permitted by applicable law. 
 During 2022, we raised 4.6 billion of net proceeds from the sale of common stock, at a weighted average price of 67.04 per share, primarily through proceeds from the sale of common stock through our ATM programs. The ATM program issuances during 2022 included 58,534,967 shares issued pursuant to forward sale confirmations. As of December 31, 2022, 6,744,884 shares of common stock subject to forward sale confirmations have been executed but not settled. 
 Note Issuances 
 In January 2023, we issued 500 million of 5.05 senior unsecured notes due January 13, 2026 (the "2026 notes"), which are callable at par on January 13, 2024, and 600 million of 4.85 senior unsecured notes due March 15, 2030, which are callable at par on January 15, 2030 (the "2030 Notes"). The public offering price for the 2026 Notes was 99.618 of the principal amount for an effective semi-annual yield to maturity of 5.189 . and the public offering price for the 2030 Notes was 98.813 of the principal amount for an effective semi-annual yield to maturity of 5.047 . In conjunction with the pricing of the 2026 notes, we executed a three-year, 500 million fixed-to-variable interest rate swap, which is subject to the counterparties' right to terminate the swap at any time following the 2026 notes par call date and results in an effective variable borrowing rate of SOFR minus 0.0347 thereunder for the duration of the swap. We intend to use these variable rate borrowings in lieu of borrowing under our revolving credit facility, which, as of December 31, 2022, permits U.S. borrowings at an interest rate of SOFR plus 0.725 with a SOFR adjustment charge of 0.10 and a revolving credit facility commitment fee. 
 In October 2022, we issued 750 million of 5.625 senior unsecured notes October 2032 (the "October 2032 Notes"). The public offering price for the notes was 99.879 of the principal amount for an effective semi-annual yield to maturity of 5.641 . In conjunction with the pricing of this offering, we executed a 600 million U.S. Dollar-to-Euro 10-year cross currency swap, resulting in the receipt of approximately 612 million in proceeds and an effective fixed-rate, Euro-denominated semi-annual yield to maturity of approximately 4.7 . Additionally, we terminated forward interest rate swaps totaling 500 million in notional value previously entered into, recognizing a cash settlement gain of approximately 72 million. Giving effect to these contemporaneous transactions, we expect to recognize an effective semi-annual yield to maturity of 3.93 on the overall transaction, including the recognition of the cash settlement gain. 
 In June 2022, we closed on the previously announced private placement of 600.0 million of senior unsecured notes, which included 140.0 million of notes due June 2030, 345.0 million of notes due June 2032, and 115.0 million of notes due June 2037. The combined notes have a weighted average tenor of approximately 10.5 years, and a weighted average fixed interest rate of 3.22 .

Tabl e of Contents 

In January 2022, we issued 250.0 million of 1.875 senior unsecured notes due January 2027 (the "January 2027 Notes") and 250.0 million of 2.500 senior unsecured notes due January 2042 (the "January 2042 Notes"). The public offering price for the January 2027 Notes was 99.487 of the principal amount, for an effective semi-annual yield to maturity of 1.974 , and the public offering price for the January 2042 Notes was 98.445 of the principal amount, for an effective semi-annual yield to maturity of 2.584 . Combined, the new issues of the January 2027 Notes and the January 2042 Notes have a weighted average term of approximately 12.5 years and a weighted average effective semi-annual yield to maturity of approximately 2.28 . 
 Expanded Revolving Credit Facility 
 In April 2022, we entered into a 4.25 billion unsecured credit facility to amend and restate our previous 3.0 billion unsecured credit facility, which was due to expire in March 2023. Our current revolving credit facility matures in June 2026 and includes two six-month extensions that can be exercised at our option. Similar to our previous revolving credit facility, our current revolving credit facility also has a 1.0 billion expansion feature, which is subject to obtaining lender commitments. As of December 31, 2022, the balance of borrowings outstanding under our revolving credit facility was 2.0 billion, and we had a cash balance of 171.1 million. 
 Expansion of Commercial Paper Programs 
 During July 2022, our unsecured commercial paper program was amended to increase the maximum aggregate amount of outstanding notes from 1.0 billion to 1.5 billion. In addition, during July 2022, we established a new Euro-denominated unsecured commercial paper program, which permits us to issue additional unsecured commercial notes up to a maximum aggregate amount of 1.5 billion (or foreign currency equivalent), in U.S. Dollar ("USD") or various other foreign currencies, including but not limited to, Euros, Sterling, Swiss Francs, Yen, Canadian Dollars, and Australian Dollars, in each case, pursuant to customary terms in the European commercial paper note market. The notes offered under our European commercial paper program rank pari passu with all of our other unsecured senior indebtedness, including borrowings under our revolving credit facility and our term loan facilities, and our outstanding senior notes, including under our USD-denominated commercial paper programs. We use our 4.25 billion unsecured revolving credit facility as a liquidity backstop for the repayment of the notes issued under these two commercial paper programs. As of December 31, 2022, the balance of borrowings outstanding under our commercial paper programs was 701.8 million, including 361.0 million of Euro-denominated borrowings. 
 New Term Loan 
 During January 2023 we entered into a term loan agreement (the Term Loan Agreement ), pursuant to which we borrowed an aggregate of approximately 1.0 billion in multicurrency borrowings, including 90.0 million, 705.0 million and 85.0 million (collectively, the Term Loans ). The Term Loan Agreement also permits us to incur additional term loans, up to an aggregate of 1.5 billion in total borrowings. The Term Loans initially mature in January 2024 and include two 12-month maturity extensions that can be exercised at the company's option. Our A3/A- credit ratings provide for a borrowing rate of 80 basis points over the applicable benchmark rate, which includes adjusted SOFR for USD-denominated loans, adjusted SONIA for Sterling-denominated loans, and EURIBOR for Euro-denominated loans. 
 Impact of COVID-19 
 The COVID-19 pandemic continues to have widespread, rapidly evolving, and unpredictable impacts on businesses globally, including those in which some of our clients operate. Certain of our clients have been slower to recover economically (including those in the theater industry). However, even in light of this, during 2022 we have continued to collect contractual rent across our total portfolio at levels that are consistent with pre-pandemic rent collection. We cannot assure that our historical rent collections will be indicative of our future rental collections as the extent to which the COVID-19 pandemic (or future pandemics) will impact our operations and those of our clients in the future is not known and will depend on future developments. The impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, or future pandemics, on us, our business, our clients, and the economy generally is discussed further in Item 1A: Risk Factors. 
 Theater Industry Update 
 For the period from October 2022 through February 2023, we collected all of the contractual rent (1) across our theater portfolio. As of December 31, 2022, we had cumulative reserves of 35.6 million, including 13.7 million in additional reserves recognized in the three months ended December 31, 2022, on properties leased to Cineworld Group plc ("Cineworld"), the parent entity of the entities that lease certain of our theater portfolios, including Regal Cinemas, which commenced Chapter 11 reorganization proceedings during September 2022. These reserves for Cineworld and its affiliates, representing a reduction of rental revenue, primarily relate to contractual rent and expense recoveries recorded during the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020, and during the fourth quarter of 2022, and exclude straight-line rent reserves. Total receivables from Cineworld and its affiliates were 15.6 million at

December 31, 2022, net of reserves and excluding straight line rent receivables, and include both deferred contractual rent and deferred expense recoveries. 
 
 (1) We define contractual rent as the monthly aggregate cash amount charged to clients, inclusive of monthly base rent receivables. Charged amounts have not been adjusted for any COVID-19 related rent relief granted and include contractual rent from any clients in bankruptcy.

 See our discussion of FFO, Normalized FFO, and AFFO (which are not financial measures under generally accepted accounting principles in the United States, or "U.S. GAAP"), later in the section entitled Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, in this annual report, which includes a reconciliation of net income available to common stockholders to FFO and Normalized FFO, and AFFO. 
 
 DIVIDEND POLICY 
 Distributions are paid monthly to holders of shares of our common stock. 
 Distributions are paid monthly to the limited partners holding common units of Realty Income, L.P., each on a per unit basis that is generally equal to the amount paid per share to our common stockholders. 
 In order to maintain our status as a REIT for federal income tax purposes, we generally are required to distribute dividends to our stockholders aggregating annually at least 90 of our taxable income (excluding net capital gains), and we are subject to income tax to the extent we distribute less than 100 of our taxable income (including net capital gains). In 2022, our cash distributions to common stockholders totaled 1.81 billion, or approximately 95.3 of our estimated taxable income of 1.90 billion. Certain measures are available to us to reduce or eliminate our tax exposure as a REIT, and accordingly, no provision for federal income taxes, other than our taxable REIT subsidiaries (each, a "TRS"), has been made. Our estimated taxable income reflects non-cash deductions for 
 8 

Tabl e of Contents 

depreciation and amortization. Our estimated taxable income is presented to show our compliance with REIT dividend requirements and is not a measure of our liquidity or operating performance. We intend to continue to make distributions to our stockholders that are sufficient to meet this dividend requirement and that will reduce or eliminate our exposure to income taxes. Furthermore, we believe our cash on hand and funds from operations are sufficient to support our current level of cash distributions to our stockholders. We distributed 2.967 per share to stockholders during 2022, representing 75.7 of our diluted AFFO per share of 3.92. 
 Future distributions will be at the discretion of our Board of Directors and will depend on, among other things, our results of operations, FFO, Normalized FFO, AFFO, cash flow from operations, financial condition, capital requirements, the annual distribution requirements under the REIT provisions of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, or the Code, our debt service requirements, and any other factors the Board of Directors may deem relevant. In addition, our credit facility contains financial covenants that could limit the amount of distributions payable by us in the event of a default, and which prohibit the payment of distributions on our common stock in the event that we fail to pay when due (subject to any applicable grace period) any principal or interest on borrowings under our credit facility. 
 Distributions of our current and accumulated earnings and profits for federal income tax purposes generally will be taxable to stockholders as ordinary income, except to the extent that we recognize capital gains and declare a capital gains dividend, or that such amounts constitute qualified dividend income subject to a reduced rate of tax. The maximum tax rate of non-corporate taxpayers for qualified dividend income is generally 20 . In general, dividends payable by REITs are not eligible for the reduced tax rate on qualified dividend income, except to the extent that certain holding requirements have been met with respect to the REIT s stock and the REIT s dividends are attributable to dividends received from certain taxable corporations (such as our TRSs) or to income that was subject to tax at the corporate or REIT level (for example, if we distribute taxable income that we retained and paid tax on in the prior taxable year). However, non-corporate stockholders, including individuals, generally may deduct up to 20 of dividends from a REIT, other than capital gain dividends and dividends treated as qualified dividend income, for taxable years beginning after December 31, 2017 and before January 1, 2026. 
 Distributions in excess of earnings and profits generally will first be treated as a non-taxable reduction in the stockholders basis in their stock, but not below zero. Distributions in excess of that basis generally will be taxable as a capital gain to stockholders who hold their shares as a capital asset. None of the distributions to our common stockholders, made or deemed to have been made in 2022, were classified as a return of capital for federal income tax purposes. 
 
 BUSINESS PHILOSOPHY AND STRATEGY 
 We believe that actively managing a diversified portfolio of commercial properties under long-term, net lease agreements produces consistent and predictable income. A net lease typically requires the client to be responsible for monthly rent and certain property operating expenses including property taxes, insurance, and maintenance. In addition, clients of our properties typically pay rent increases based on: (1) fixed increases, (2) increases tied to inflation (typically subject to ceilings), or (3) additional rent calculated as a percentage of the clients gross sales above a specified level. We believe that a portfolio of properties under long-term net lease agreements with our commercial clients generally produces a more predictable income stream than many other types of real estate portfolios, while continuing to offer the potential for growth in rental income. 
 Diversification is also a key component of our investment philosophy. We believe that diversification of the portfolio by client, industry, geography, and property type leads to more consistent and predictable income for our stockholders by reducing vulnerability that can come with any single concentration. Our investment activities have led to a diversified property portfolio that, as of December 31, 2022, we owned or held interests in 12,237 properties located in all 50 U.S. states, Puerto Rico, the U.K., Spain, and Italy, and doing business in 84 industries. None of the 84 industries represented in our property portfolio accounted for more than 8.6 of our annualized contractual rent as of December 31, 2022. 
 As we look to continue to expand geographically across Europe, we focus upon building relationships with new multinational clients that seek a real estate partner with an expanding geographic footprint. 
 Investment Strategy 
 We seek to invest in high-quality real estate that our clients consider important to the successful operation of their businesses. We generally seek to own or hold interests in commercial real estate that has some or all of the following characteristics: 
 9 

Tabl e of Contents 

Properties in markets or locations important to our clients; 
 Properties with strong demographic attributes or that we deem to be profitable for our clients; 
 Properties with real estate valuations that approximate replacement costs; 
 Properties with rental or lease payments that approximate market rents for similar properties; 
 Properties that can be purchased with the simultaneous execution or assumption of long-term net lease agreements, offering both current income and the potential for future rent increases; 
 Properties that leverage relationships with clients, sellers, investors, or developers as part of a long-term strategy; and 
 Properties that leverage our proprietary insights, including those in locations and geographic markets we expect to remain strong or strengthen in the future. 
 We typically seek to invest in properties or portfolios of properties owned or leased by clients that are already or could become leaders in their respective businesses supported by mechanisms including (but not limited to) occupancy of prime real estate locations, pricing, merchandise assortment, service, quality, economies of scale, consumer branding, e-commerce, and advertising. We have an internal team dedicated to sourcing such opportunities, often using our relationships with various clients, owners/developers, brokers and advisers to uncover and secure transactions. We also undertake thorough research and analysis to identify what we consider to be appropriate property locations, clients, and industries for investment. This research expertise is instrumental to uncovering net lease opportunities in markets where we believe we can add value. 
 In selecting potential investments, we generally look for clients with the following attributes: 
 Reliable and sustainable cash flow, including demonstrated economic resiliency; 
 Revenue and cash flow from multiple sources; 
 Are willing to sign a long-term lease (10 or more years); and 
 Are large owners and users of real estate. 
 From a retail perspective, our investment strategy is to target clients that have a service, non-discretionary, and/or low-price-point component to their business. We target investments with clients who have demonstrated resiliency to e-commerce or have a strong omni channel retail strategy, uniting brick-and-mortar and mobile browsing, both of which reflect the continued importance of last mile retail, the movement of goods to their final destination, real estate as part of a customer experience and supply chain strategy. Our overall investments (including last mile retail) are driven by an optimal portfolio strategy that, among other considerations, targets allocation ranges by asset class and industry. We review our strategy periodically and stress test our portfolio in a variety of positive and negative economic scenarios to ensure we deliver consistent earnings growth and value creation across economic cycles. As a result of the execution of this strategy, approximately 93 of our annualized retail contractual rent on December 31, 2022, is derived from our clients with a service, non-discretionary, and/or low price point component to their business. From a non-retail perspective, we target industrial properties leased to industry leaders, the majority of which are investment grade rated companies. We believe these characteristics enhance the stability of the rental revenue generated from these properties. 
 After applying this investment strategy, we pursue those transactions where we believe we can achieve an attractive investment spread over our cost of capital and favorable risk-adjusted returns. We will continue to evaluate all investments for consistency with our objective of owning net lease assets. 
 Underwriting Strategy 
 In order to be considered for acquisition, properties must meet stringent underwriting requirements. We have established a four-part analysis that examines each potential investment based on: 
 The aforementioned overall real estate characteristics, including demographics, replacement cost, and comparative rental rates; 
 Industry, client (including credit profile), and market conditions; 
 Store profitability for retail locations if profitability data is available; and 
 The importance of the real estate location to the operations of the clients business. 
 We believe the principal financial obligations for most of our clients typically include their bank and other debt, payment obligations to employees, suppliers, and real estate lease obligations. Because we typically own the land and building in which a client conducts its business or which are critical to the client s ability to generate revenue, we believe the risk of default on a client s lease obligation is less than the client s unsecured general obligations. It has been our experience that clients must retain their profitable and critical locations to survive. Therefore, in the 
 10 

Tabl e of Contents 

event of reorganization, we believe they are less likely to reject a lease of a profitable or critical location because this would terminate their right to use the property. 
 Thus, as the property owner, we believe that we will fare better than unsecured creditors of the same client in the event of reorganization. If a property is rejected by our client during reorganization, we own the property and can either lease it to a new client or sell the property. In addition, we believe that the risk of default on real estate leases can be further mitigated by monitoring the performance of our clients individual locations and considering whether to proactively sell locations that meet our criteria for disposition. 
 We conduct comprehensive reviews of the business segments and industries in which our clients operate. In addition, prior to entering any transaction, our research department conducts a review of a client s credit quality. The information reviewed may include reports and filings, including any public credit ratings, financial statements, debt and equity analyst reports, and reviews of corporate credit spreads, stock prices, market capitalization, and other financial metrics. We conduct due diligence, including financial reviews of the client, and monitor our clients credit quality on an ongoing basis and provide summaries of these findings to management. 
 At December 31, 2022, 40.9 of our total portfolio annualized contractual rent comes from properties leased to our investment grade clients, their subsidiaries or affiliated companies. At December 31, 2022, our top 20 clients (based on percentage of total portfolio annualized contractual rent) represented 40.9 of our annualized rent and 12 of these clients have investment grade credit ratings or are subsidiaries or affiliates of investment grade companies. 
 Asset Management Strategy 
 In addition to pursuing new properties for investment, we seek to increase earnings and dividends through active asset management. 
 Generally, our asset management efforts seek to achieve: 
 Rent increases at the expiration of existing leases, when market conditions permit; 
 Optimum exposure to certain clients, industries, and markets through re-leasing vacant properties and selectively selling properties; 
 Maximum asset-level returns on properties that are re-leased or sold; and 
 Additional value creation opportunities from the existing portfolio by leveraging internal capabilities to enhance individual properties, pursue alternative uses, and derive ancillary revenue. 
 As part of our ongoing credit research, we continually monitor our portfolio for any changes that could affect the performance of our clients, our clients industries, and the real estate locations in which we have invested. We also regularly analyze our portfolio with a view towards optimizing its returns and enhancing its overall credit quality. Our active asset management strategy pursues asset sales when we believe the reinvestment of the sale proceeds will: 
 Generate higher returns; 
 Enhance the credit quality of our real estate portfolio; 
 Extend our average remaining lease term; and/or 
 Strategically decrease client, industry, or geographic concentration. 
 The active management of the portfolio is an essential component of our long-term strategy of maintaining high occupancy. 
 Impact of Real Estate and Credit Markets 
 In the commercial real estate market, property prices generally continue to fluctuate. Likewise, during certain periods, including the current market, the global credit markets have experienced significant price volatility, dislocations, and liquidity disruptions, which may impact our access to and cost of capital. We continually monitor the commercial real estate and global credit markets carefully and, if required, will make decisions to adjust our business strategy accordingly. 
 Environmental, Social and Governance ("ESG") 
 In recent years, our environmental, social, and governance efforts have quickly evolved from commitment to action. We continue to focus on how best to institutionalize efforts for a lasting and positive impact. As a result, we strive to be a sustainability leader in the net lease REIT sector.

As The Monthly Dividend Company , our mission is to conduct business with integrity, transparency, respect and humility to create long-term value across economic cycles for all stakeholders. We are committed to conducting our business according to the highest moral and ethical standards. Our dedication to providing dependable monthly dividends that increase over time is only enhanced by our elevated purpose, mission, vision and values. 
 We believe that our commitment to corporate responsibility, which encompasses ESG principles, is critical to our performance and long-term success and that we all have a shared responsibility to our people, communities that we operate in and the planet. In support of this commitment, we are dedicated to providing an engaging, inclusive, and a safe work environment for our employees, operating our business in an environmentally conscious manner, and upholding our corporate responsibilities as a public company for the benefit of our stakeholders - our stockholders, clients, employees and community members. The Nominating/Corporate Governance Committee of our Board of Directors has direct oversight of ESG matters. 
 Environmental - Sustainability 
 We hold the protection of our assets, communities, and the environment in high regard. Based on our business model, the properties in our portfolio are primarily net leased to our clients, and each client is generally responsible for maintaining the buildings, including utilities management and the implementation of environmentally sustainable practices at each location. Therefore, we generally cannot control the implementation of environmentally sustainable practices without collaborating with our clients whose environmental initiatives may or may not be aligned with ours. However, we hope that with continued engagement, we can encourage clients to adopt environmentally sustainable practices. In that light, we have expanded and intend to continue to expand our client engagement efforts to achieve shared sustainability objectives on an ongoing basis. As a member of the National Association of Real Estate Investment Trusts ("Nareit") Real Estate Sustainability Council, we are focused on leveraging best practices and advancing our efforts in this area. 
 
 Response to Climate Change 
 We seek to promote effective energy efficiency and other sustainability strategies and compliance with federal, state and international laws and regulations related to climate change, both internally and with our clients. We remain committed to sustainable business practices in our day-to-day activities by encouraging a culture of environmental responsibility at our offices and within our communities. We work with our clients to promote environmental responsibility at the properties we own, however, as noted above, as our properties are primarily net leased to our clients we generally cannot control the implementation of environmentally sustainable practices without the assistance of our clients. As we have grown our sustainability efforts, we have leveraged our size and expanded our client engagement efforts to achieve shared sustainability objectives. We are: 
 
 Operating from green-certified buildings: our San Diego headquarters is Energy Star Certified and our Phoenix Office is LEED Platinum certified. 
 Continuing to upgrade our San Diego headquarters by completing a building-wide LED retrofit, subsidizing employee use of electric vehicle charging stations, and installing a carport photovoltaic panel system. These improvements are in addition to our automatic lighting control system with light-harvesting technology, a building management system that monitors and controls energy use, an adaptive and intelligent irrigation system, and energy efficient PVC roofing and heating and cooling systems. 
 Reporting according to our Green Financing Framework and our Green Bond Report, disclosing our allocation of proceeds from our inaugural green bond offering in 2021 to green certified building acquisitions and other eligible green projects. 
 Identifying transition risks across our European portfolio by assessing, identifying, and underwriting necessary property retrofits and upgrades during acquisition due diligence in order to ensure our investments will meet the England and Wales minimum energy efficiency standards MEES and the 2002 Scottish energy regulations. This due diligence will also help preparedness for future similar regulations that may be adopted in countries or regions where we have properties. 
 Enhancing our ESG and Green Lease schedule for our European operations to establish landlord/client cooperation, data sharing requirements, energy use, site alteration guidelines, and energy performance certificate requirements, among other items. We are also continuing the expansion and incorporation of Green Lease Clauses across our leases for access to utility and performance data through lease rollovers, sale-leaseback transactions, and initiatives which allow us to benchmark our properties and work with clients to identify and implement energy efficiency projects. 
 Holding a management led ESG Task Force to facilitate compliance with certain regulatory disclosure requirements to which we are subject (such as the anticipated changes to the SEC s climate-related 
 12

disclosure rules) or to comply with established ESG frameworks and standards, such as the Global Real Estate Sustainability Benchmarks and the Task Force for Climate-Related Financial Disclosures TCFD ). 
 Continuing our client engagement initiative to learn about client sustainability goals, initiatives, and collaboration opportunities focused on utility data sharing, renewable energy options, electric vehicle charging infrastructure, as well as LED lighting and HVAC retrofits and other energy efficiency projects. 
 Working with strategic real estate partners to survey existing site-level environmental characteristics to help develop a more comprehensive inventory of our portfolio s low-footprint carbon initiatives. 
 Providing our asset management and real estate operations teams with additional resources to identify and evaluate client partnership opportunities. 
 Surveying asset-level property characteristics via client survey requests to increase environmental data coverage. 
 Continuing to strengthen our governance structure and legal instruments to expedite opportunities across our portfolio. 
 Considering climate-related risks within our strategic enterprise-level risk assessment process while following TCFD recommendations to better understand how climate change may impact future business decisions. 
 We prepare and issue an annual sustainability report. 
 Social - Company Culture and Employees 
 Human Capital 
 We put great effort into cultivating an inclusive company culture. We are one team, and together we are committed to providing an engaging work environment centered on our One Team values of Do the right thing, Take ownership, Empower each other, Celebrate differences, and Give more than we take. As such, we hire talented employees with diverse backgrounds and perspectives and work to provide an environment with regular, open communication where capable team members have fulfilling careers and are encouraged to engage with and make a positive impact on business partners and the communities in which we operate. 
 
 We continue to take the following actions to offer an engaging environment: 
 Maintaining a hybrid onsite/remote work environment with flexible scheduling; 
 Implementing an improved internal communication and document management platform that provides employees enhanced video conferencing, document management, and virtual collaboration workspace which improved employee communications and collaboration supporting in-office and our remote work footprint; 
 Increasing dialogue with our team leaders, including our CEO, who conducts regular check-in meetings with all leadership levels and employees across the company; 
 Providing resources to employees who were directly impacted by the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic; 
 Updating our business continuity plan that includes emergency planning, disaster recovery, alternative communication outlets, and real-time testing simulations; 
 Establishing in-person and virtual engagement activities, bringing colleagues together through the Team Building Committee and Green Team; and 
 Hosting in-person and virtual wellbeing program classes and events addressing mental health, stress reduction, physical fitness, financial wellbeing, and other wellness topics. 
 Recruitment, Development and Retention 
 We believe our employees form the foundation of our corporate culture and are one of our most valuable assets. As of January 2023, we employed 395 professionals (including four part-time employees), with the majority of talent recruited and hired from the local communities in which we operate. In order to broaden our reach for talent, we offer college and high school internship programs and attract candidates utilizing diverse resources such as affinity associations, targeted job advertisements, sourcing software focusing on diversity criteria, and employee referrals. Additionally, as part of our ongoing efforts to strengthen our internal leadership development capabilities, we operate an annual mentorship program, will launch two leadership development programs in 2023, and train on topics such as anti-discrimination and harassment, cybersecurity, Diversity, Equality and Inclusion (DE I) awareness, safety, and important company policies that are required for every employee. We also offer competency-based training that includes professional development, executive and officer-level coaching, and other leadership development training for our colleagues.

Assistance and support are provided to employees who are working towards obtaining job-related licenses and relevant certifications as well as continuing education. Opportunities to enroll in professional and technical education is also extended to all employees who are looking for ways to continue learning and growing with the Company. 
 Employee retention is vital to maintaining a robust and cohesive workforce. To that end, we provide compensation that we believe is competitive with our peers and competitors, including a generous benefits package. Benefits include medical, dental, and vision healthcare benefits for all employees and their families; participation in a 401(k) or equivalent plan with a matching contribution from us; paid time-off or equivalent; disability and life insurance; and, in years that the Company's performance meets certain goals, the ability to earn equity in the Company that vests over four years. Our employees have an average tenure of approximately 4.8 years and our leadership, including Senior Vice President and above, have an average tenure of approximately 8.3 years. 
 Diversity, Equality and Inclusion 
 We believe that much of our success is rooted in the diversity of our teams and our commitment to inclusion. This commitment starts at the top with our highly skilled and diverse Board, comprised of individuals with a variety of backgrounds and experience. We strive to emulate this diversity throughout the Company as part of our ongoing commitment to diversity, equality and inclusion with our DE I Policy. We continue to expand our DE I efforts around building employee awareness and understanding through various training requirements and learning opportunities. In 2022, we accomplished a 100 participation in our required DE I training and in 2023 hosted a variety of voluntary learning sessions around an array of DE I topics (e.g., Generational Differences, and Allyship, Gender Equity, and Race Diversity), which supported employee self-reflection, engagement, and action throughout the year. In addition, we offer the option for employees to select a floating holiday that recognizes DE I that is personally meaningful to them. 
 These learning opportunities aim to continue building knowledge and facilitate open and safe conversations regarding critical DE I topics, drive inclusive conversations with others, and promote belonging in our hybrid environment. 
 We perform a pay equity analysis each year to ensure that regardless of gender, race, or ethnicity, employees who perform similar work under similar circumstances are paid similar wages. 
 Workforce Demographics 
 The following data is as of December 31, 2022 and was gathered voluntarily from employees and reflects the information provided by the participating responde nts. No employees identify as non-binary. We d efine Manager Level as employees that either supervise at least one team member or hold a title of Associate Director or above.

Employee Engagement 
 We believe our focus on culture, employee engagement and inclusion has helped us mitigate the risk of losing key team members. To assess, analyze, and respond to employee sentiment and to ensure that we are doing all we can to foster engagement from a strategic perspective, we launched our first employee engagement survey in 2019. Every eighteen months, we conduct a comprehensive employee engagement survey. Our 2022 survey garnered over 96 employee participation. We continuously strive in our culture and work environment to create opportunities for engagement and improvement. As such, our leaders develop focused action plans which address areas for enhanced engagement based on survey results in concert with feedback from their department team members. We intend to continue conducting employee engagement surveys every eighteen months. 
 We sponsor an active Team Building Committee comprised of volunteer-employees across numerous departments and seniority levels that organizes employee-driven, team-building events and activities to promote employee involvement, communication, and organizational continuity to foster strong interconnected relationships. We complement the Team Building Committee in support of our ESG efforts with another volunteer-based, employee-driven Green Team that works on sustainability related matters at our office and in the community. 
 Employee Health, Safety and Wellbeing 
 We believe the health and wellbeing of our team members are cornerstones for our successful operations. Our wellbeing program provides opportunities for our people to participate in various activities and educational programs to enhance their personal and professional lives. Our wellbeing model is to engage employees covering five pillars of wellness: Purpose, Social, Financial, Community, and Physical. We support a healthy work-life balance, by offering flexible work schedules, access to discounted fitness programs, on-site dry-cleaning pickup, car wash services, paid family leave, generous parental leave, lactation rooms, and an infant at work program for new parents. Employees also have access to a robust employee assistance program. 
 The COVID-19 pandemic prompted additional support needed to our One Team. Upon our return to the office in March 2022, we took the following actions to seek to assist our employees: we (i) implemented a hybrid remote and in-person working arrangements which was determined by each department leader based on an individual's role; (ii) implemented and improved internal communications; (iii) provided resources to employees who were directly impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic (e.g., financial support, scheduling flexibility, and time off to employees to receive and recover from the COVID-19 vaccine and booster); and (iv) updated our business continuity plan. 
 Governance - Fiduciary Duties and Ethics 
 We believe in the importance of a company s reputation for integrity and are committed to managing the Company for the benefit of our stockholders. We are focused on maintaining good corporate governance and have implemented the below practices that illustrate this commitment including, but are not limited to: 
 Our Board of Directors is currently comprised of 11 directors, 10 of whom are independent, non-employee directors; 
 Our Board of Directors is elected on an annual basis with a majority vote standard; 
 Our directors conduct annual self-evaluations and participate in director orientation and continuing education programs; 
 An enterprise risk management evaluation is conducted annually to identify and assess our risk; 
 Each standing committee of our Board of Directors is comprised entirely of independent directors; and 
 We adhere to all other corporate governance principles outlined in our Corporate Governance Guidelines. These guidelines, as well as our bylaws, committee charters and other governance documents may be found on our website. 
 We are committed to conducting our business according to the highest ethical standards and upholding our corporate responsibilities as a public company operating for the benefit of our stockholders. Our Board of Directors has adopted a Code of Business Ethics that applies to our directors, officers, and other employees. The Code of Business Ethics includes our commitment to dealing fairly with all of our clients, service providers, suppliers, and competitors. We require all employees to acknowledge the terms of, and abide by, our Code of Business Ethics, which is also available on our website. Our employees have access to members of our Board of Directors to report anonymously, if desired, any suspicion of misconduct by any member of our senior management or executive team. Anonymous reporting is always available through our whistleblower hotline and reported to our Audit Committee quarterly.

PROPERTY PORTFOLIO INFORMATION 
 At December 31, 2022, our diversified portfolio consisted of: 
 Owned or held interests in 12,237 properties; 
 An occupancy rate of 99.0 , or 12,111 properties leased and 126 properties available for lease or sale; 
 Clients doing business in 84 separate industries; 
 Locations in all 50 U.S. states, Puerto Rico, the U.K., Spain, and Italy; 
 Approximately 236.8 million square feet of leasable space; 
 A weighted average remaining lease term (excluding rights to extend a lease at the option of the client) of approximately 9.5 years; and 
 An average leasable space per property of approximately 19,350 square feet; approximately 13,000 square feet per retail property and approximately 234,100 square feet per industrial property. 
 At December 31, 2022, 12,111 properties were leased under net lease agreements. A net lease typically requires the client to be responsible for monthly rent and certain property operating expenses including property taxes, insurance, and maintenance. In addition, clients of our properties typically pay rent increases based on: (1) fixed increases, (2) increases tied to inflation (typically subject to ceilings), or (3) additional rent calculated as a percentage of the clients' gross sales above a specified level. 
 We define total portfolio annualized contractual rent as the monthly aggregate cash amount charged to clients, inclusive of monthly base rent receivables, but excluding percentage rent and reimbursements from clients, as of the balance sheet date, multiplied by 12, excluding percentage rent. We believe total portfolio annualized contractual revenue is a useful supplemental operating measure, as it excludes properties that were no longer owned at the balance sheet date and includes the annualized rent from properties acquired during the quarter. Total portfolio annualized contractual rent has not been reduced to reflect reserves and reserve reversals recorded as adjustments to U.S. GAAP rental revenue in the periods presented and excludes unconsolidated entities. 
 Top 10 Industry Concentrations 
 We are engaged in a single business activity, which is the leasing of property to clients, generally on a net basis. That business activity spans various geographic boundaries and includes property types and clients engaged in various industries. Even though we have a single segment, we believe our investors continue to view diversification as a key component of our investment philosophy and so we believe it remains important to present certain information regarding our property portfolio classified according to the business of the respective clients, expressed as a percentage of our total portfolio annualized contractual rent:

FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS 
 This Annual Report on Form 10-K, including the documents incorporated by reference, contain forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and Section 21E of the Exchange Act of 1934, as amended. When used in this annual report, the words estimated, anticipated, expect, believe, intend, continue, should, may, likely, plans, and similar expressions are intended to identify forward-looking statements. Forward-looking statements include discussions of our business and portfolio (including our growth strategies and our intention to acquire or dispose of additional properties and the timing of these acquisitions and dispositions), re-lease, re-development and speculative development of properties and expenditures related thereto; future operations and results; the announcement of operating results, strategy, plans, and the intentions of management; and trends in our business, including trends in the market for long-term net leases of freestanding, single-client properties. Forward-looking statements are subject to risks, uncertainties, and assumptions about Realty Income Corporation which may cause our actual future results to differ materially from expected results. Some of the factors that could cause actual results to differ materially are, among others our continued qualification as a real estate investment trust; general domestic and foreign business, economic, or financial conditions; competition; fluctuating interest and currency rates; inflation and its impact on our clients and us; access to debt and equity capital markets and other sources of funding; continued volatility and uncertainty in the credit markets and broader financial markets; other risks inherent in the real estate business including our clients' defaults under leases, increased client bankruptcies, potential liability relating to environmental matters, illiquidity of real estate investments, and potential damages from natural disasters; impairments in the value of our real estate assets; changes in domestic and foreign income tax laws and rates; our clients' solvency; property ownership through joint ventures and partnerships which may limit control of the underlying investments; the continued evolution of the COVID-19 pandemic or future epidemics or pandemics, measures taken to limit their spread, the impacts on us, our business, our clients (including those in the theater and fitness industries), and the economy generally; the loss of key personnel; the outcome of any legal proceedings to which we are a party or which may occur in the future; acts of terrorism and war; and any effects of uncertainties regarding whether the anticipated benefits or results of our merger with VEREIT, Inc. will be achieved. 
 Additional factors that may cause risks and uncertainties include those discussed in the sections entitled Business , Risk Factors and Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2022. 
 Readers are cautioned not to place undue reliance on forward-looking statements.

Actual plans and operating results may differ materially from what is expressed or forecasted in this annual report and forecasts made in the forward-looking statements discussed in this annual report might not materialize. We do not undertake any obligation to publicly release the results of any revisions to these forward-looking statements that may be made to reflect events or circumstances after the date these statements were made. 
 
 Item 1A: Risk Factors 
 This Risk Factors section contains references to our capital stock and to our stockholders. Unless expressly stated otherwise, the references to our capital stock represent our common stock and any class or series of preferred stock which may be outstanding from time to time, while the references to our stockholders represent holders of our common stock. 
 Risks Related to Our Business and Industry 
 In order to grow we need to continue to acquire investment properties. The acquisition of investment properties may be subject to competitive pressures. 
 We face competition in the acquisition and operation of our properties. We expect competition from businesses, individuals, fiduciary accounts and plans, and other entities engaged in real estate investment and financing. This competition may result in a higher cost for properties we wish to purchase. 
 
 Negative market conditions or adverse events affecting our existing or potential clients, or the industries in which they operate, could have an adverse impact on our ability to attract new clients, re-lease space, collect rent or renew leases, which could adversely affect our cash flow from operations and inhibit growth. 
 Cash flow from operations depends in part on our ability to lease space to our clients on economically favorable terms and to collect rent from our clients on a timely basis. We could be adversely affected by various facts and events over which we have limited or no control, such as: 
 21 

Tabl e of Contents 

Lack of demand in areas where our properties are located; 
 Inability to retain existing clients and attract new clients; 
 Oversupply of space and changes in market rental rates; 
 Declines in our clients creditworthiness and ability to pay rent, which may be affected by their operations (including as a result from changes in consumer behaviors or preferences impacting our clients operations), economic downturns and competition within their industries from other operators; 
 Defaults by and bankruptcies of clients, failure of clients to pay rent on a timely basis, or failure of our clients to comply with their contractual obligations; 
 Changes in laws, rules or regulations that negatively impact clients or our properties; 
 The COVID-19 pandemic or other epidemics or pandemics or outbreaks of illness, disease or virus that affect countries or regions in which our clients and their parent companies operate or in which our properties or corporate headquarters are located; 
 Changes in consumer behaviors (e.g., decrease in discretionary consumer spending), preferences or demographics impacting our clients' operations; 
 Supply chain disruptions; 
 Economic or physical decline of the areas where the properties are located; and 
 Deterioration of physical condition of our properties. 
 
 If our clients do not renew their leases as they expire, we may not be able to rent or sell the properties. Leases that are renewed, and some new leases for properties that are re-leased, may have terms that are less economically favorable than expiring lease terms, or may require us to incur significant costs, such as renovations, improvements on behalf of the client or lease transaction costs. Negative market conditions may cause us to sell vacant properties for less than their carrying value, which could result in impairments. Any of these events could adversely affect our cash flow from operations and our ability to make distributions to our stockholders and service our indebtedness. A significant portion of the costs of owning property, such as real estate taxes, insurance and maintenance, are not necessarily reduced when circumstances cause a decrease in rental revenue from the properties. In a weakened financial condition, our clients may not be able to pay these costs of ownership and we may be unable to recover these operating expenses from them. 
 
 At any time, any of our clients may experience a downturn in its business that may weaken its operating results or overall financial condition. As a result, a client may delay lease commencement, fail to make rental payments when due, decline to extend a lease upon its expiration, become insolvent or declare bankruptcy. Any client bankruptcy or insolvency, leasing delay or failure to make rental payments when due could result in the termination of our client s lease and material losses to us. Further, the occurrence of a client bankruptcy or insolvency could diminish or eliminate the income we receive from our client s lease or leases. A bankruptcy court might authorize a client to terminate one or more of its leases with us. If that happens, our claim against the bankrupt client for unpaid future rent would be subject to statutory limitations that most likely would result in rent payments that would be substantially less than the remaining rent we are owed under the leases (it is also possible that we may not receive any unpaid future rent under terminated leases) or we may elect not to pursue claims against a client for terminated leases. Claims we have for unpaid past rent, if any, may not be paid in full, or at all. Client bankruptcies within a given property may also adversely impact our ability to re-release that property at favorable terms, or at all. Moreover, in the case of a client s leases that are not terminated as the result of its bankruptcy, we may be required or elect to reduce the rent payable under those leases or provide other concessions, reducing amounts we receive under those leases. As a result, client bankruptcies may have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition. Any of these events could adversely affect our cash flow from operations and our ability to make distributions to stockholders and service our indebtedness. 
 
 Downturns in any of our industries could adversely affect our clients (including, for example, the recent challenges faced by our clients in the theater industry), which in turn could also have a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations and our ability to pay the principal of and interest on our debt securities and other indebtedness and to make distributions on our common stock and any outstanding preferred stock. In addition, some of our properties are leased to clients that may have limited financial and other resources and, therefore, they are more likely to be adversely affected by a downturn in their respective businesses, including any downturns that have resulted or may result from the COVID-19 pandemic or other epidemics or pandemics, or in the regional, national or international economy. Furthermore, we have made and may continue to make selected acquisitions of 
 22 

Tabl e of Contents 

properties that fall outside our historical focus on freestanding, single-client, net-lease retail locations in the U.S. As a result, we may be exposed to a variety of new risks by expanding into new property types and/or new jurisdictions outside the U.S. and properties leased to clients engaged in non-retail businesses. These risks may include limited experience in managing certain types of new properties, new types of real estate locations and lease structures, and the laws and culture of non-U.S. jurisdictions. 
 
 The COVID-19 pandemic has disrupted our operations and the effects of the pandemic are expected to continue to have an adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition and liquidity. 
 The COVID-19 pandemic, including the continued spread of new variants and the measures taken to limit its spread, has had, and other pandemics in the future could have, adverse repercussions across global economies and financial markets, as well as on us and our clients. Factors that have contributed or may contribute in the future to the adverse impact of the COVID-19 pandemic and the measures taken to limit its spread on the business, results of operations, financial condition and liquidity of us and our clients include, without limitation, the following: 
 Operational limitations or issues at properties operated by our clients resulting from government action (including travel bans, border closings, business closures, quarantine, vaccine and testing requirements, shelter-in-place or similar orders requiring that people remain in their homes); 
 Reduced economic activity, customer traffic, consumer confidence or discretionary spending, the deterioration in our or our clients ability to operate in affected areas, and any delays in the supply of products or services to our clients may impact certain of our clients businesses, results of operations, financial condition and liquidity and may cause certain of our clients to be unable to meet their obligations to us in full, or at all, and to seek, whether through negotiation, restructuring or bankruptcy, reductions or deferrals in their rent payments and other obligations to us or early termination of their leases; 
 Difficulties with supply chain disruptions and in leasing, selling or redeveloping properties or renewing expiring or terminated leases on terms we consider acceptable, or at all; 
 Difficulties accessing bank lending, capital markets and other financial markets on attractive terms, or at all, may adversely affect our cost of capital, our access to capital to grow our business (including through acquisitions, development opportunities and other strategic transactions) and to fund our business operations, our ability to pay dividends on our common stock, our ability to pay the principal of and interest on our indebtedness, and our other liabilities on a timely basis, and may adversely affect our clients ability to fund their business operations and meet their obligations to us and others; 
 Potential negative impacts on our credit ratings, the interest rates on our borrowings, and our future compliance with financial covenants under our credit facility and other debt instruments, which could result in a default and potentially an acceleration of indebtedness, any of which could negatively impact our ability to make additional borrowings under our revolving credit facility, sell commercial paper notes under our commercial paper programs, incur other indebtedness, pay dividends on our common stock and pay the principal of and interest on our indebtedness and our other obligations when due; 
 The impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the market value of certain of our properties has led to impairment charges and may require that we incur further impairment charges, asset write-downs or similar charges; 
 The impact on the ability of our employees, including members of our management team or board of directors, to fulfill their duties to us; and 
 A general decline in business activity and demand for real estate transactions could adversely affect our ability to grow our portfolio of properties. 
 
 Most of our clients operate retail businesses, many of which have been disproportionately impacted by certain of the issues described above, and may continue to be disproportionately impacted in the future. The extent to which the COVID-19 pandemic continues to impact our operations and those of our clients will depend on future developments, which are highly uncertain and cannot be predicted with confidence, including the scope, severity and duration of the pandemic, the actions taken to contain the pandemic or limit its impact, and the direct and indirect economic effects of the pandemic and containment measures. 
 
 Likewise, the deterioration of global economic conditions as a result of the pandemic may ultimately lead to a further decrease in occupancy levels and rental rates across our portfolio as our clients (including those in the theater 
 23 

Tabl e of Contents 

industry) reduce or defer their spending, institute restructuring plans or file for bankruptcy. Some of our clients have experienced temporary closures of some or all of their properties or have substantially altered or reduced their operations in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, and additional clients may do so in the future. 
 
 To the extent the COVID-19 pandemic or other epidemics or pandemics in the future adversely affect economic conditions and financial markets, as well as the business, results of operations, financial conditions and liquidity of us and our clients, they may also have the effect of heightening many of the risks described elsewhere in this Risk Factors section and our historical information regarding our business, properties, results of operations, financial condition or liquidity may not be representative of the future results of operations, financial condition, liquidity or other financial or operating results of us, our properties or our business. 
 
 As a property owner, we may be subject to unknown environmental liabilities. 
 Investments in real property can create a potential for environmental liability. An owner of property can face liability for environmental contamination created by the presence or discharge of hazardous substances on the property. We can face such liability regardless of our knowledge of the contamination; the timing of the contamination; the cause of the contamination; or the party responsible for the contamination of the property. 
 
 There may be environmental conditions associated with our properties of which we are unaware. A number of our properties are leased to operators of convenience stores that sell petroleum-based fuels, to operators of oil change and tune-up facilities, and operators that use chemicals and other waste products. These facilities and some other of our properties, use, or may have used in the past, underground lifts or storage tanks for the storage of petroleum-based or waste products, which could create a potential for the release of hazardous substances. Certain of our other properties, particularly those leased for industrial-type purposes, may also involve operations or activities that could give rise to environmental liabilities. 
 
 The presence of hazardous substances on a property may adversely affect our client's ability to continue to operate that property or our ability to lease or sell that property and we may incur substantial remediation costs or third-party liability claims. Although our leases generally require our clients to operate in compliance with all applicable federal, state, and local environmental laws, ordinances and regulations, and to indemnify us against any environmental liabilities arising from the clients activities on the properties, we could nevertheless be subject to liability, including strict liability, by virtue of our ownership interest. There also can be no assurance that our clients could or would satisfy their indemnification obligations under their leases. The discovery of environmental liabilities attached to our properties could have an adverse effect on our results of operations, our financial condition, or our ability to make distributions to stockholders and to pay the principal of and interest on our debt securities and other indebtedness. In addition, several of our properties were built during the period when asbestos was commonly used in building construction and we may acquire other buildings that contain asbestos in the future. Environmental laws govern the presence, maintenance, and removal of asbestos-containing materials, or ACMs, and require that owners or operators of buildings containing asbestos properly manage and maintain the asbestos, that they adequately inform or train those who may come into contact with asbestos and that they undertake special precautions, including removal or other abatement in the event that asbestos is disturbed during renovation or demolition of a building. These laws may impose fines and penalties on building owners or operators for failure to comply with these requirements and may allow third parties to seek recovery from owners or operators for personal injury associated with exposure to asbestos fibers. 
 
 While we have not been notified by any governmental authority, and are not otherwise aware, of any material noncompliance, liability or claim relating to environmental contamination, if environmental contamination should exist on any of our properties, we could be subject to liability, including strict liability, by virtue of our ownership interest. In addition, while we maintain environmental insurance policies, it is possible that our insurance could be insufficient to address any particular environmental situation and/or that, in the future, we could be unable to obtain insurance for environmental matters at a reasonable cost, or at all. Our clients are generally responsible for, and indemnify us against, liabilities for environmental matters that arise during the lease terms as a result of clients activities on the properties. However, it is possible that one or more of our clients could fail to have sufficient funds to cover any such indemnification or to meet applicable state financial assurance obligations or such environmental contamination may predate our client's lease term, and thus we may still be obligated to pay for any such environmental liabilities.

If we fail to qualify as a REIT, it could adversely impact us, and the amount of dividends we are able to pay would decrease, which could adversely affect the market price of our capital stock and could adversely affect the value of our debt securities. 
 We believe that, commencing with our taxable year ended December 31, 1994, we have been organized and have operated, and we intend to continue to operate, so as to qualify as a REIT under Sections 856 through 860 of the Code. However, we cannot make any assurances that we have been organized or have operated in a manner that has satisfied the requirements for qualification as a REIT, or that we will continue to be organized or operate in a manner that will allow us to continue to qualify as a REIT. Qualification as a REIT involves the satisfaction of numerous requirements under highly technical and complex Code provisions, for which there are only limited judicial and administrative interpretations, as well as the determination of various factual matters and circumstances not entirely within our control. As we have recently expanded into new geographies and transactional structures, and may continue to do so in the future, the analyses of our REIT qualification, and our ability to ensure such qualification, have become, and may become in the future, more complex. For example, in order to qualify as a REIT, at least 95 of our gross income in each year must be derived from qualifying sources, and we must pay distributions to stockholders aggregating annually at least 90 of our taxable income (excluding net capital gains). If we fail to satisfy any of the requirements for qualification as a REIT, we may be subject to certain penalty taxes or, in some circumstances, we may fail to qualify as a REIT. If we were to fail to qualify as a REIT in any taxable year: 
 We would be required to pay regular U.S. federal corporate income tax on our taxable income; 
 We would not be allowed a deduction for amounts distributed to our stockholders in computing our taxable income; 
 We could be disqualified from treatment as a REIT for the four taxable years following the year during which qualification is lost; 
 We would no longer be required to make distributions to stockholders; and 
 This treatment would substantially reduce amounts available for investment or distribution to stockholders because of the additional tax liability for the years involved, which could have a material adverse effect on the market price of our capital stock and the value of our debt securities. 
 
 Even if we qualify for and maintain our REIT status, we may be subject to certain federal, state, local and foreign taxes on our income and property. For example, if we have net income from a prohibited transaction, that income will be subject to a 100 tax. In addition, our taxable REIT subsidiaries are subject to federal, state and, in some cases, foreign taxes at the applicable tax rates on their income and property. Any failure to comply with legal and regulatory tax obligations could adversely affect our ability to conduct business and could adversely affect the market price of our capital stock and the value of our debt securities. 
 
 Legislative or other actions affecting REITs could have a negative effect on us or our investors. 
 The rules dealing with federal income taxation are constantly under review by persons involved in the legislative process and by the Internal Revenue Services, or the IRS, and the U.S. Department of the Treasury, or the Treasury. Changes to the tax laws, with or without retroactive application, could adversely affect us or our investors, including holders of our common stock or debt securities. We cannot predict how changes in the tax laws might affect us or our investors. New legislation, Treasury regulations, administrative interpretations or court decisions could significantly and negatively affect our ability to qualify as a REIT, the federal income tax consequences of such qualification, or the federal income tax consequences of an investment in us. Also, the law relating to the tax treatment of other entities, or an investment in other entities, could change, making an investment in such other entities more attractive relative to an investment in a REIT. 
 
 Distribution requirements imposed by law limit our flexibility. 
 To maintain our status as a REIT for federal income tax purposes, we generally are required to distribute to our stockholders at least 90 of our taxable income, excluding net capital gains, each year. We also are subject to tax at regular corporate rates to the extent that we distribute less than 100 of our taxable income (including net capital gains) each year. In addition, we are subject to a 4 nondeductible excise tax to the extent that we fail to distribute during any calendar year at least the sum of 85 of our ordinary income for that calendar year, 95 of our capital gain net income for the calendar year, and any amount of that income that was not distributed in prior years. We intend to continue to make distributions to our stockholders to comply with the distribution requirements of the Code as well as to reduce our exposure to federal income taxes and the nondeductible excise tax. Differences in timing between the receipt of income and the payment of expenses to arrive at taxable income, along with the effect of 
 25 

Tabl e of Contents 

required debt amortization payments, could require us to borrow funds to meet the distribution requirements that are necessary to achieve the tax benefits associated with qualifying as a REIT. 
 
 Future issuances of equity securities could dilute the interest of holders of our common stock. 
 Our future growth will depend, in large part, upon our ability to raise additional capital. Raising additional capital through the issuance of equity securities can dilute the interests of holders of our common stock. The interests of our common stockholders could also be diluted by the issuance of shares of common stock pursuant to stock incentive plans. Likewise, our Board of Directors is authorized to cause us to issue preferred stock of any class or series with dividend, voting and other rights as determined by our Board of Directors, which could dilute, or otherwise adversely affect, the interest of holders of our common stock. 
 
 We may acquire properties or portfolios of properties through tax deferred contribution transactions, which could result in stockholder dilution and limit our ability to sell or refinance such assets. 
 We have in the past and may in the future acquire properties or portfolios of properties through tax deferred contribution transactions in exchange for partnership units in an operating partnership, which could result in stockholder dilution through the issuance of operating partnership units that, under certain circumstances, may be exchanged for shares of our common stock. This acquisition structure may have the effect of, among other things, reducing the amount of tax depreciation we could deduct over the tax life of the acquired properties, and may require that we agree to restrictions on our ability to dispose of, or refinance the debt on, the acquired properties in order to protect the contributors ability to defer recognition of taxable gain. Similarly, we may be required to incur or maintain debt we would otherwise not incur so we can allocate the debt to the contributors to maintain their tax bases. In the event we take any action that incurs taxable gain allocated to these contributors, we may be required to make them whole under tax protection agreements. These restrictions could limit our ability to sell or refinance an asset at a time, or on terms, that would be favorable absent such restrictions. 
 We are subject to risks associated with debt and preferred stock financing. 
 We intend to incur additional indebtedness in the future, including borrowings under our 4.25 billion unsecured revolving credit facility and our 3.0 billion commercial paper programs. Our revolving credit facility grants us the option, subject to obtaining lender commitments and other customary conditions, to expand the borrowing limits thereunder to up to 5.25 billion. The credit agreement governing our revolving credit facility also governs our 250.0 million unsecured term loan facility due March 2024 and, on January 6, 2023 we entered into the Term Loan Agreement governing our term loan, pursuant to which we borrowed an aggregate of approximately 1.0 billion in multicurrency borrowings. The Term Loan Agreement also permits us to incur additional term loans, up to an aggregate of 1.5 billion in total borrowings. The Term Loans initially mature in January 2024 and include two 12-month maturity extensions that can be exercised at the company's option. Our A3/A- credit ratings provide for a borrowing rate of 80 basis points over the applicable benchmark rate, which includes adjusted SOFR for US Dollar-denominated loans, adjusted SONIA for Sterling-denominated loans, and EURIBOR for Euro-denominated loans. In conjunction with closing, we executed one-year variable-to-fixed interest rate swaps which fix our per annum interest rate at 5.0 over the initial term. 
 
 Pursuant to our unsecured commercial paper programs we may offer and sell up to 3.0 billion of commercial paper at any time. We use our revolving credit facility as a liquidity backstop for the repayment of notes issued under the commercial paper programs. Specifically, we maintain unused borrowing capacity under our revolving credit facility equal to the aggregate principal amount of borrowings outstanding under our commercial paper programs from time to time. We may in the future enter into amendments and restatements of our revolving credit facility and term loan facilities, or enter into new revolving credit facilities or term loan facilities, and any such amended, restated or replacement revolving credit facilities or term loan facilities may increase the amounts we are entitled to borrow, subject to customary conditions, compared to our current revolving credit facility and term loan facilities, or we may incur other indebtedness. We may also in the future increase the size of our commercial paper programs or establish new commercial paper programs. We expect that we will continue to use our current and any new revolving credit facilities we may enter into (in each case as the same may be expanded, amended or restated, if applicable, from time to time), as a liquidity backstop for the repayment of notes issued under our current or any new commercial paper programs that we may maintain from time to time. As a result of the merger, all outstanding secured indebtedness and all outstanding liabilities and other indebtedness of VEREIT and its subsidiaries (including 4.65 billion of additional senior unsecured notes that were originally issued by VEREIT OP, substantially all of which were exchanged for senior unsecured notes issued by us) became indebtedness and liabilities of ours or our subsidiaries, as the case may be, which substantially increased the total secured indebtedness and the total liabilities and other indebtedness of us and our subsidiaries.

To the extent that new indebtedness is added to our current debt levels, the related risks that we now face would increase. As a result, we are and will be subject to risks associated with debt financing, including the risk that our cash flow could be insufficient to make required payments on our debt or to pay dividends on our common stock. We also face variable interest rate risk as the interest rates on our revolving credit facility, term loan facilities, and commercial paper programs are variable (subject to our interest rate swaps on our term loan facilities, in effect from time to time), and the interest rates on any credit facilities and term loan facilities we may enter into in the future may be variable, and could therefore increase over time. In addition, commercial paper borrowings are short-term obligations and the interest rate on newly issued commercial paper varies according to market conditions at the time of issuance. In addition, while we may enter into hedging and other derivatives instruments to mitigate our exposure to fluctuations in borrowing and currency rates, we may not realize the anticipated benefits from these arrangements or they may be insufficient to mitigate our exposure. We also face the risk that we may be unable to refinance or repay our debt as it comes due. Given past disruptions in the financial markets and ongoing global financial uncertainties, including the impact of COVID-19, the United Kingdom s withdrawal from the European Union (referred to as Brexit), and the ongoing Russia-Ukraine conflict, we also face the risk that one or more of the participants in our revolving credit facility may be unwilling or unable to lend us money. 
 
 We have incurred and may continue to incur indebtedness that is denominated in local currencies to fund our international investments and operations. However, it is possible that such indebtedness may be insufficient or may be on unacceptable terms requiring us to use non-local currency indebtedness. In such event, we may be subject to foreign exchange rate volatility. While we may enter into hedging and other derivatives instruments to mitigate our exposure to fluctuations in foreign exchange rates, we may not realize the anticipated benefits from these arrangements or these arrangements may be insufficient to mitigate our exposure. 
 
 Our revolving credit facility, our term loan facilities, and our mortgage loan documents contain provisions that could limit or, in certain cases, prohibit the payment of dividends and other distributions to holders of our common stock and any outstanding preferred stock. The credit agreements governing our revolving credit facility and term loan facilities provide that, if an event of default (as defined in the credit agreements, as applicable) exists, we may not pay any dividends or make other distributions on (except distributions payable in shares of a given class of our stock to the stockholders of that class), or repurchase or redeem, among other things, any shares of our common stock or any outstanding preferred stock, during any period of four consecutive fiscal quarters in an aggregate amount in excess of the greater of (i) the sum of 95 of our adjusted funds from operations (as defined in the credit agreements, as applicable) for that period plus the aggregate amount of cash distributions made to holders of our outstanding preferred stock for that period, and (ii) the minimum amount of cash distributions required to be made to our stockholders in order to maintain our status as a REIT for federal income tax purposes and to avoid the payment of income or excise taxes that would otherwise be imposed under specified sections of the Code on income we do not distribute to our stockholders, except we may repurchase or redeem shares of our outstanding preferred stock, if any, with net proceeds from the issuance of shares of our common stock or preferred stock. 
 
 The credit agreements each provide that, in the event of a failure to pay principal, interest, or any other amount payable thereunder when due or upon the occurrence of certain events of bankruptcy, insolvency or reorganization with respect to us or with respect to one or more of our subsidiaries that in the aggregate meet a significance test set forth in the credit agreements, we and our subsidiaries (other than our wholly-owned subsidiaries) may not pay dividends or make other distributions on (except for (a) distributions payable in shares of a given class of our stock to the stockholders of that class and (b) dividends and distributions described in (ii) above), or repurchase or redeem, among other things, any shares of our common stock or preferred stock. If any such event of default under the applicable credit agreements (or under any other credit agreement or debt instrument with similar terms that we may in the future enter into or be subject to) were to occur, it would likely have a material adverse effect on the market price of our outstanding common stock and any outstanding preferred stock and on the market value of our debt securities which could limit the amount of dividends or other distributions payable to holders of our common stock and any outstanding preferred stock or the amount of interest and principal we are able to pay on our indebtedness, or prevent us from paying those dividends, other distributions, interest or principal altogether, and may adversely affect our ability to qualify, or prevent us from qualifying, as a REIT. 
 
 Our indebtedness could also have other important consequences to holders of our common stock, any outstanding preferred stock, and our debt securities, including: 
 Increasing our vulnerability to general adverse economic and industry conditions; 
 27 

Tabl e of Contents 

Limiting our ability to obtain additional financing to fund future working capital, acquisitions, capital expenditures and other general corporate requirements; 
 Requiring the use of a substantial portion of our cash flow from operations for the payment of principal and interest on our indebtedness, thereby reducing our ability to use our cash flow to fund working capital, acquisitions, capital expenditures, and general corporate requirements; 
 Limiting our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our business and our industry; and 
 Putting us at a disadvantage compared to our competitors with less indebtedness. 
 
 If we default under a credit facility, loan agreement, or other debt instrument, the lenders will generally have the right to demand immediate repayment of the principal and interest on all of their loans and, in the case of secured indebtedness, to exercise their rights to seize and sell the collateral. Moreover, a default under a single loan or debt instrument may trigger cross-default or cross-acceleration provisions in other indebtedness and debt instruments, giving the holders of such other indebtedness and debt instruments similar rights to demand immediate repayment and to seize and sell any collateral. 
 
 Real estate ownership is subject to particular conditions that may have a negative impact on our revenue. 
 We are subject to all of the inherent risks associated with the ownership of real estate. In particular, we face the risk that rental revenue from our properties may be insufficient to cover all corporate operating expenses, debt service payments on indebtedness we incur, and distributions on our capital stock. Additional real estate ownership risks include: 
 Adverse changes in general or local economic conditions; 
 Changes in supply of, or demand for, similar or competing properties; 
 Changes in interest rates and operating expenses (including energy costs, shortages and rationing); 
 Competition within an industry and for our clients; 
 Changes in market rents; 
 Inability to lease properties upon termination of existing leases; 
 Renewal of leases at lower rental rates; 
 Inability to collect rental revenue from our clients due to financial hardship, including bankruptcy; 
 Changes in tax, real estate, zoning and environmental laws that may have an adverse impact upon the value of real estate; 
 Uninsured property liability; 
 Property damage or casualty losses; 
 Unexpected expenditures for capital improvements, including requirements to bring properties into compliance with applicable federal, state and local laws; 
 The need to periodically renovate and repair our properties; 
 Risks assumed as manager for development or redevelopment projects; 
 Physical or weather-related damage to properties; 
 The potential risk of functional obsolescence of properties over time; 
 Acts of terrorism and war; 
 Changes in consumer behaviors, preferences or demographics; 
 The impacts of climate change; and 
 Acts of God and other factors beyond the control of our management. 
 
 Real estate property investments are illiquid. We may not be able to acquire or dispose of properties when desired or on favorable terms. 
 Real estate investments are relatively illiquid. Our ability to quickly buy, sell or exchange any of our properties in response to changes in economic and other conditions will be limited and U.S. and foreign tax and regulatory regimes and authorities may impose or have the effect of restricting or limiting our ability to sell properties. No assurances can be given that we will recognize full value, at a price and at terms that are acceptable to us, for any property that we are required to sell for liquidity reasons. Our inability to respond rapidly to changes in the performance of our investments could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations.

Our acquisition of additional properties may have a significant effect on our business, liquidity, financial position and/or results of operations. 
 Our future success will depend, in part, upon our ability to manage our acquisitions and expansion opportunities under prevailing market conditions. We are regularly engaged in the process of identifying, analyzing, underwriting, and negotiating possible acquisition transactions. We cannot provide any assurances that we will be successful in consummating future acquisitions on favorable terms or that we will realize expected cash lease yields, operating efficiencies, cost savings, revenue enhancements, synergies, or other benefits. Our inability to consummate one or more acquisitions on such terms, our failure to adequately underwrite and identify risks and obligations when acquiring properties, or our failure to realize the intended benefits from one or more acquisitions, could have a significant adverse effect on our business, liquidity, financial position and/or results of operations, including as a result of our incurrence of additional indebtedness and related interest expense and our assumption of unforeseen contingent liabilities in connection with completed acquisitions. 
 
 We have made and may continue to make selected acquisitions of properties that fall outside our historical focus on freestanding, single-client, net lease retail locations in the U.S. We may be exposed to a variety of new risks by expanding into new property types and/or new jurisdictions outside the U.S. and from properties leased to our clients who engage in non-retail businesses. These risks may include limited experience in managing certain types of new properties, new types of real estate locations and lease structures, and the laws and culture of non-U.S. jurisdictions. 
 
 We may face extensive regulations from gaming and other regulatory authorities regarding current and future gaming properties. 
 As a landlord of a gaming facility or future gaming facilities, we may be impacted by the risks associated with the gaming industry. The ownership, operation, and management of gaming facilities are subject to pervasive regulation. Gaming authorities also retain great discretion such that gaming regulations can impact our gaming clients, individuals associated with the operation of gaming properties, and us as the owner of the real estate and landlord related to such facilities. Gaming laws and regulations can impact all facets of a gaming property, including but not limited to alcoholic beverages, environmental matters, employees, health care, currency transactions, zoning and building codes, and marketing and advertising. Such laws and regulations could change or could be interpreted differently in the future, or new laws and regulations could be enacted, which could adversely affect our operating results, and may also result in additional taxes or licensing fees imposed on us and our gaming clients. In addition, subject to certain administrative due process requirements, gaming regulators generally have broad authority to conduct investigations into the conduct or associations of our officers or certain investors to ensure compliance with applicable standards and suitability to hold a gaming license, and to deny any application or limit, condition, restrict, revoke, or suspend any gaming license, registration, or finding of suitability or approval, or fine any person licensed, registered, or found suitable or qualified as a licensee. As a result, our ability to obtain or maintain our required licenses and approvals, or avoid penalties related thereto, may be subject to risks, including risks outside of our control, and cannot be predicted. 
 
 Were a tenant unable to continue to perform under a lease, because of the highly regulated nature of the industry, it may be difficult to re-lease gaming properties. This difficulty may be exacerbated to the extent the gaming property is located in a geography that does not have an expansive gaming footprint, such as the property in which we are invested. A transfer of interest, including a new lease, will likely require approval of regulators and the licensing of a new gaming operator tenant. 
 
 We are subject to additional risks from our international investments and debt. 
 We have acquired and may continue to acquire properties outside of the U.S. These investments may expose us to a variety of risks that are different from and in addition to those commonly found in the U.S. Our international investments are subject to additional risks, including: 
 The laws, rules and regulations applicable in such jurisdictions outside of the U.S., including those related to property ownership and control by foreign entities; 
 Complying with a wide variety of foreign laws, including corruption, employment, data protection, energy usage, health and safety and environmental regulations which may require capital expenditures to maintain or bring our foreign properties into compliance with applicable regulations; 
 29 

Tabl e of Contents 

Fluctuations in exchange rates between foreign currencies and the U.S. dollar (including risks related to their impact on our results of operations, hedging and other derivative arrangements used to mitigate our exposure to fluctuations in foreign currency rates, translational reporting risks, and exchange controls); 
 As we may not have or have only a limited number of properties within a jurisdiction, our experience in that market and with local business may be limited; 
 Cultural factors and business practices that differ from our U.S. standards and practices including as they relate to rent adjustments, ground leases and property ownership requirements and limitations; 
 Challenges in establishing effective controls and procedures to manage and regulate operations in different regions and to monitor and ensure compliance with applicable regulations, such as applicable laws related to corrupt practices, employment, licensing, construction, energy usage, climate change or environmental compliance; 
 Unexpected or other changes in regulatory requirements, tax, tariffs, trade barriers and other laws within jurisdictions outside the U.S. or between the U.S. and such jurisdictions; 
 Potentially adverse tax consequences with respect to our properties and/or investment vehicles; 
 Initial limited investments within certain regions or countries resulting in industry or client concentration risks; 
 The impact of regional or country-specific business cycles, inflation and economic instability, including deterioration in political relations with the U.S., instability in, or further withdrawals from, the European Union or other international trade alliances or agreements; and 
 Political instability, uncertainty over property rights, civil unrest, acts of war, drug trafficking, political activism or the continuation or escalation of terrorist or gang activities. 
 
 We also engage external property managers who assist with managing our international properties. If a property manager fails to meet its obligations or terminates its services, we may need to find a replacement but these services may be on less favorable terms and conditions or we may not be able to find a suitable replacement in a timely manner or at all. 
 
 We have incurred and may continue to incur indebtedness that is denominated in local currencies to fund our international investments and operations. However, it is possible that such indebtedness may be insufficient or may be on unacceptable terms requiring us to use non-local currency indebtedness. In such event, we may be subject to foreign exchange rate volatility which may be impacted by various factors, including those described above. While we may enter into hedging and other derivatives instruments to mitigate our exposure to fluctuations in foreign exchange rates, we may not realize the anticipated benefits from these arrangements or these arrangements may be insufficient to mitigate our exposure. For more information, see We are subject to risks associated with debt and preferred stock financing. 
 
 If we are unable to adequately address these risks, they could have a significant adverse effect on our operations. 
 
 We may engage in development, speculative development, or expansion projects or invest in new assets, which would subject us to additional risks that could negatively impact our operations. 
 We may engage in development, speculative development, or other expansion projects, which could require us to raise additional capital and obtain additional state and local permits. A decision by any governmental agency not to issue a required permit or substantial delays in the permitting process could cause us to incur penalties, delay us from receiving rental payments or result in us receiving reduced rental payments, or prevent us from pursuing the development, speculative development, or expansion project altogether. Additionally, any such new development, speculative development, or expansion project may not operate at designed capacity or may cost more to operate than we expect. The inability to successfully complete development, speculative development, or expansion projects or to complete them on a timely basis could adversely affect our business and results of operations. 
 
 In addition, in the future, we may invest in new or different assets or enter into new transaction structures that may or may not be closely related to our current business. These new assets and transaction structures may have new, different or increased risks than what we are currently exposed to in our business and we may not be able to manage these risks successfully. Additionally, when investing in such new assets or transaction structures, we will be exposed to the risk that those assets or structures, or the income generated thereby, will affect our ability to meet the requirements to maintain our REIT status, or will subject us to additional regulatory requirements or limitations. If 
 30 

Tabl e of Contents 

we are not able to successfully manage the risks associated with such new assets, it could have an adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. 
 
 An uninsured loss or a loss that exceeds the policy limits on our properties could subject us to lost capital or revenue on those properties. 
 Our leases generally require our clients to indemnify and hold us harmless from liabilities resulting from injury to persons, air, water, land or property, due to activities conducted on the properties, except for claims arising from the negligence or intentional misconduct of us or our agents. Additionally, clients are generally required, at the client s expense, to obtain and keep in full force during the term of the lease, liability and property damage insurance policies. The insurance policies our clients are required to maintain for property damage are generally in amounts not less than the full replacement cost of the improvements less slab, foundations, supports and other customarily excluded improvements. Our clients are generally required to maintain general liability coverage depending on the client and the industry in which the client operates. 
 
 Many of our properties are also covered by flood and earthquake insurance policies (subject to substantial deductibles) obtained and paid for by our clients as part of their risk management programs. Additionally, we have obtained blanket liability, flood and earthquake (subject to substantial deductibles) and property damage insurance policies to protect us and our properties against loss should the indemnities and insurance policies provided by the clients fail to restore the properties to their condition prior to a loss. We do not carry insurance for certain losses and certain types of losses may be either uninsurable or not economically insurable. However, should a loss occur that is uninsured or in an amount exceeding the combined aggregate limits for the policies noted above, or in the event of a loss that is subject to a substantial deductible under an insurance policy, we could lose all or part of our capital invested in, and anticipated revenue from, one or more of the properties, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations or financial condition and on our ability to pay the principal of and interest on our debt securities and other indebtedness and to make distributions to our stockholders. We also face the risk that our insurance carriers may not be able to provide payment under any potential claims that might arise under the terms of our insurance policies, and we may not have the ability to purchase insurance policies we desire. 
 
 In addition, although we obtain title insurance policies on our properties to help protect us and our properties against title defects (such as adverse claims of ownership, liens or other encumbrances), there may be certain title defects that our title insurance will not cover. If a material title defect related to any of our properties is not adequately covered by a title insurance policy, we could lose some or all of our capital invested in and our anticipated profits from such property, cause a financial misstatement or damage our reputation. 
 
 Compliance with the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990 and fire, safety, and other regulations may require us to make unintended expenditures that could adversely impact our results of operations. 
 Our properties are generally required to comply with the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990, or the ADA. The ADA has separate compliance requirements for public accommodations and commercial facilities, but generally requires that buildings be made accessible to people with disabilities. Compliance with the ADA requirements could require removal of access barriers and non-compliance could result in imposition of fines by the U.S. government or an award of damages to private litigants. The retailers to whom we lease properties are obligated by law to comply with the ADA provisions and, in many cases, the retailers are generally obligated to cover costs associated with compliance pursuant to the terms of their applicable leases. If required changes involve greater expenditures than anticipated, or if the changes must be made on a more accelerated basis than anticipated, the ability of these retailers to cover costs could be adversely affected and we could be required to expend our own funds to comply with the provisions of the ADA, which could materially adversely affect our results of operations or financial condition and our ability to pay the principal of and interest on our debt securities and other indebtedness and to make distributions to our stockholders. In addition, our properties must be in compliance with fire and safety regulations, building codes and other land use regulations, as they may be adopted by governmental agencies and bodies and become applicable to our properties. We may be required to make substantial capital expenditures to comply with those requirements and these expenditures could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations or financial condition and our ability to pay the principal of and interest on our debt securities and other indebtedness and to make distributions to our stockholders. 
 
 Property taxes may increase without notice. 
 The real property taxes on our properties and any other properties that we develop or acquire in the future may increase as property tax rates change and as those properties are assessed or reassessed by tax authorities. While 
 31 

Tabl e of Contents 

the majority of our leases are under a net lease structure, some or all of such property taxes may not be collectible from our clients. 
 Our business is subject to risks associated with climate change and our sustainability strategies. 
 Our business is subject to risks associated with the effects of climate change, and a resulting shift to a lower carbon economy, and may be subject to further risks in the future. Climate change could adversely affect our business through both chronic and acute perils including, but not limited to, extreme weather, changes in precipitation and temperature, and rising sea levels, all of which may result in physical damage to, or a decrease in demand for, our properties located in the areas affected by these conditions, and may adversely impact consumer behaviors, preferences and spending for our clients, which may impact their ability to fulfill their obligations under our leases, or our ability to re-lease the properties in the future. In addition, should the impact of climate change be severe or occur for lengthy periods of time, connectivity, labor and supply chains could impact business continuity for ourselves and our clients. Chronic climate change may lead to increased costs for us and our clients to adapt to the demands and expectations of climate change or lower carbon usage, including with respect to heating, cooling or electricity costs, retrofitting properties to be more energy efficient or comply with new rules or regulations, or other unforeseen costs. These risks could adversely affect our reputation, financial condition or results of operations. 
 
 We seek to promote effective energy efficiency and other sustainability strategies and compliance with federal, state and international laws and regulations related to climate change, both internally and with our clients. Our sustainability strategies and efforts to comply with changes in federal, state and international laws and regulations on climate change could result in significant capital expenditures to improve our existing properties or properties we may acquire. Any changes to such laws and regulations could also result in increased operating costs or capital expenditures at our properties. If we are unable to comply with laws and regulations on climate change or implement effective sustainability strategies, our reputation among our clients and investors may be damaged and we may incur fines and/or penalties. Moreover, there can be no assurance that any of our sustainability strategies will result in reduced operating costs, higher occupancy or higher rental rates or deter our existing clients from relocating to properties owned by our competitors. 
 
 In addition, tenants of net-leased properties are responsible for maintenance and other day-to-day management of the properties. This lack of control over our net-leased properties makes it difficult for us to collect property-level environmental metrics and to enforce sustainability initiatives, which may impact our ability to comply with certain regulatory disclosure requirements to which we are subject (such as the anticipated changes to the SEC s climate-related disclosure rules) or comply effectively with established ESG frameworks and standards, such as the Global Real Estate Sustainability Benchmarks, the TCFD and the Sustainability Accounting Standards Board. If we are unable to successfully collect the data necessary to comply with these disclosure requirements, we may be subject to increased regulatory risk and if such data is incomplete or unfavorable, our relationship with our investors, our stock price, and our access to capital may be negatively impacted. 
 
 Our charter contains restrictions upon ownership of our common stock. 
 Our charter contains restrictions on ownership and transfer of our common stock intended to, among other purposes, assist us in maintaining our status as a REIT for U.S. federal and/or state income tax purposes. For example, our charter restricts any person from acquiring beneficial or constructive ownership of more than 9.8 (by value or by number of shares, whichever is more restrictive) of our outstanding shares of common stock. These restrictions could have anti-takeover effects and could reduce the possibility that a third party will attempt to acquire control of us, which could adversely affect the market price of our common stock. 
 The value of certain of our investment in real property may be reduced as the result of the expiration or loss of local tax abatements, tax credit programs, or other governmental incentives. 
 Certain of our investments have the benefit of governmental tax incentives aimed at inducing property users to relocate to incentivize development in areas and neighborhoods which have not historically seen robust commercial development. These incentives typically have specific sunset provisions and may be subject to governmental discretion in the eligibility or award of the applicable incentives. The expiration of these incentive programs or the inability of potential clients or users to be eligible for or to obtain governmental approval of the incentives, or the inability to remain compliant with such programs, may have an adverse effect on the value of our investment, cash flow and net income, and may result in impairment charges.

We may not be able to realize the anticipated synergies and related benefits of the merger with VEREIT and the transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement. 
 The merger involved the combination of two companies which operated as independent public companies. While we devoted significant management attention and resources to integrating the business practices and operations of VEREIT, it is possible that we may be unable to realize expected operating efficiencies, cost savings, revenue enhancements, synergies or other benefits. 
 General Risk Factors 
 The market value of our capital stock and debt securities could be substantially affected by various factors. 
 The market value of our capital stock and debt securities will depend on many factors, which may change from time to time and may be outside of our control, including: 
 Prevailing interest rates, increases in which may have an adverse effect on the market value of our capital stock and debt securities; 
 The market for similar securities issued by other REITs; 
 General economic, political and financial market conditions; 
 The financial condition, performance and prospects of us, our clients and our competitors; 
 Changes in legal and regulatory taxation obligations; 
 Litigation and regulatory proceedings; 
 Changes in financial estimates or recommendations by securities analysts with respect to us, our competitors or our industry; 
 Changes in our credit ratings; 
 Actual or anticipated variations in quarterly operating results of us and our competitors; and 
 Failure to achieve the perceived benefits of the merger and the transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement or if the effect of the merger and the transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement on our results of operations or financial condition is not consistent with the expectations of financial or industry analysts. 
 
 In addition, over the last several years, prices of common stock and debt securities in the U.S., trading markets have experienced extreme price fluctuations, and the market values of our common stock and debt securities have also fluctuated significantly during this period. As a result of these and other factors, investors who purchase our capital stock and debt securities may experience a decrease, which could be substantial and rapid, in the market value of our capital stock and debt securities, including decreases unrelated to our operating performance or prospects. 
 
 Litigation risks could affect our business. 
 From time to time, we are involved in legal proceedings, lawsuits, and other claims including those that may arise out of acquisitions, development opportunities and other strategic transactions. An unfavorable resolution of litigation may have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. Regardless of its outcome, litigation may result in substantial costs and expenses and significantly divert the attention of management. 
 
 We depend on key personnel. 
 We depend on the efforts of our executive officers and key employees The loss of the services of our executive officers and key employees could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations or financial condition and on our ability to pay the principal and interest on our debt securities and other indebtedness and to make distributions to our stockholders. It is possible that we will not be able to recruit additional personnel with equivalent experience in the net lease industry or retain employees to the same extent as in the past. 
 
 Natural disasters, terrorist attacks, other acts of violence or war, or other unexpected events may affect the value of our debt and equity securities, the markets in which we operate and our results of operations. 
 Natural disasters, terrorist attacks, other acts of violence or war, or other unexpected events (e.g., pandemics or epidemics) may negatively affect our operations, the market price of our capital stock and the value of our debt securities. There can be no assurance that events like these will not occur or have a direct impact on our clients, our business or the U.S. or world generally. If events like these were to occur, they could materially interrupt our business operations, cause consumer confidence and spending to decrease or result in increased volatility in the U.S. and worldwide financial markets and economy. They also could result in or prolong an economic recession in 
 33 

Tabl e of Contents 

the U.S. or abroad. Any of these occurrences could have a significant adverse impact on our operating results and revenues and on the market price of our capital stock and on the value of our debt securities. It could also have an adverse effect on our ability to pay principal and interest on our debt securities or other indebtedness and to make distributions to our stockholders. 
 
 We rely on information technology in our operations, and any material failure, inadequacy, interruption or security failure of that technology could harm our business. 
 We, like all businesses, are subject to cyber-attacks and security incidents, which threaten the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of our systems and information resources. Cyber-attacks are malicious cyber activity and a security incident is a successful cyber-attack that has the potential to expose sensitive data, internal systems, or otherwise disrupt business operations. Those attacks and incidents may be due to intentional or unintentional acts by employees, contractors or third-parties, who seek to gain unauthorized access to our or our service providers systems to disrupt operations, corrupt data, or steal confidential information through malware, computer viruses, ransomware, social engineering (e.g., phishing attachments to e-mails) or other vectors. 
 
 The risk of a cybersecurity breach or operational disruption, particularly through a cyber incident, including by computer hackers, foreign governments and cyber terrorists, has generally increased as the number, intensity and sophistication of attempted attacks and intrusions from around the world have increased, particularly as remote working has become more common. Our information technology IT networks and related systems are essential to the operation of our business and our ability to perform day-to-day operations and, in some cases, may be critical to the operations of certain of our clients. Although we make efforts to maintain the security and integrity of these types of IT networks and related systems, and we have implemented various measures to manage the risk of a security breach or disruption (such as the implementation of systems and/or vendors that provide constant monitoring of our IT networks and related systems for cyber-attacks and incidents); however, there can be no assurance that our security efforts and measures will be effective or that attempted security breaches or disruptions would not be successful or damaging. 
 
 While we maintain some of our own critical IT networks and related systems, we also depend on third-parties to provide important software, technologies, tools and a broad array of services and functions, such as payroll, human resources, electronic communications, data storage, and certain finance and treasury functions, among others. In addition, in the ordinary course of our business, we collect, process, transmit and store sensitive data, within our own systems and utilizing those of third-party providers, including intellectual property, our proprietary business information and that of our customers, suppliers and business partners, as well as personally identifiable information. 
 
 Our measures to prevent, detect and mitigate these threats may not be successful in preventing a security incident or data breach or limiting the effects of such a breach. This is particularly so because attack methodologies change frequently or are not recognized until launched, and we also may be unable to investigate or remediate incidents because attackers are increasingly using techniques and tools designed to circumvent controls, to avoid detection, and to remove or obfuscate forensic evidence. 
 
 The primary risks that could directly result from the occurrence of a cyberattack or security incident include operational interruption, damage to our relationship with our clients, reputational damage, and private data exposure. We could be required to expend significant capital and other resources to address an attack or incident, which may not be covered or fully covered by our insurance and which may involve payments for investigations, forensic analyses, legal advice, public relations advice, system repair or replacement, or other services, in addition to any remedies or relief that may result from legal proceedings. Our financial results may be negatively impacted by such attacks and incidents or any resulting negative media attention. Further, while we carry cyber liability insurance, such insurance may not be adequate to cover all losses related to such events. 
 
 Volatility in market and economic conditions may impact the accuracy of the various estimates used in the preparation of our financial statements and footnotes to the financial statements. 
 Various estimates are used in the preparation of our financial statements, including estimates related to asset and liability valuations (or potential impairments), and various receivables. Often these estimates require the use of market data values that are currently difficult to assess, as well as estimates of future performance or receivables collectability that can also be difficult to accurately predict. Although management believes it has been prudent and 
 34 

Tabl e of Contents 

used reasonable judgment in making these estimates, it is possible that actual results may differ from these estimates. 
 
 Inherent limitations of internal controls over financial statements, disclosure controls and safeguarding of assets may adversely impact our financial condition and results of operations. 
 Our internal controls over financial reporting, disclosure controls and procedures and our operating internal controls may not prevent or detect financial misstatements or loss of assets because of inherent limitations, including the possibility of human error, the circumvention or overriding of controls, or fraud. Effective internal controls can provide only reasonable assurance with respect to financial statement and disclosure accuracy and safeguarding of assets. Failures in our internal controls could result in adverse consequences in our financial reporting and operations, including delays, additional costs, impairment in our ability to access capital, adverse impacts to investor confidence, regulatory review, or litigation. 
 
 Our business operations may not generate the cash needed to make distributions on our capital stock or to service our indebtedness. 
 Our ability to make distributions on our common stock and any outstanding preferred stock and payments on our indebtedness, and to fund planned acquisitions and capital expenditures will depend on our ability to generate cash in the future. We cannot make any assurances that our business will generate sufficient cash flow from operations or that future borrowings will be available to us in an amount sufficient to enable us to make distributions on our common stock and any outstanding preferred stock, to pay our indebtedness, or to fund our other liquidity needs. 
 
 Disruptions in the financial markets could affect our ability to obtain financing on reasonable terms and have other adverse effects on us, the market price of our common stock, and may make it more difficult or costly for us to raise capital. 
 Historically, there have been periods where the global equity and credit markets have experienced significant price volatility, dislocations and liquidity disruptions, which have caused market prices of equity and debt securities to fluctuate substantially and the spreads on prospective debt financings to widen considerably. These circumstances have materially impacted liquidity in the financial markets, making terms for certain financings less attractive, and in certain cases have resulted in the unavailability of certain types of financing. Uncertainty in the equity and credit markets may negatively impact our ability to access additional financing at reasonable terms, which may adversely affect our ability to make acquisitions. A prolonged downturn in the equity or credit markets may cause us to refinance at higher rates, seek alternative sources of potentially less attractive financing, and may require us to adjust our business plan accordingly. In addition, these factors may make it more difficult for us to buy or sell properties, may adversely affect the price we purchase or receive for properties, as we and prospective buyers may experience increased costs of financing or difficulties in obtaining financing. These events in the equity and credit markets may make it more difficult or costly for us to raise capital through the issuance of common stock, preferred stock or debt securities. These disruptions in the financial markets also may have a material adverse effect on the market value of our common stock and debt securities, the income we receive from our properties and the lease rates we can charge for our properties, as well as other unknown adverse effects on us or the economy in general. 
 
 Inflation (including prolonged inflationary periods) may adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations. 
 Increased inflation or anticipated inflationary periods could have a more pronounced negative impact on any variable rate debt we incur in the future and on our results of operations. During times when inflation is greater than increases in rent, as provided for in our leases, rent increases may not keep up with the rate of inflation and other costs (including increases in employment and other fees and expenses). Government regulations may limit the indices we can utilize in lease adjustments and, in turn, limit our ability to increase rent in our leases. Even though net leases reduce our exposure to rising property expenses due to inflation, substantial inflationary pressures and increased costs may have an adverse impact on our clients if increases in their operating expenses exceed increases in revenue, which may adversely affect our clients ability to pay rent. The U.K. government plans to migrate away from the Retail Price Index (RPI), which has been widely used in lease adjustments, to alternatives such as the Consumer Price Index including owner occupiers' housing costs (CPIH), that may result in a lower measure of inflation and, in turn, have a negative impact on our lease revenue currently tied to RPI in the U.K. Inflationary periods may cause us to experience increased costs of financing, make it difficult to refinance debt at attractive rates or at all, and may adversely affect the properties we can acquire if the cost of financing an acquisition is in excess of our anticipated earnings from such property thereby limiting the properties that can be acquired. All of these may have an adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition and liquidity. To the extent periods of high inflation are prolonged, these results may be exacerbated.

 GENERAL 
 Realty Income, The Monthly Dividend Company , is an S P 500 company and member of the S P 500 Dividend Aristocrats index for having increased its dividend every year for over 25 consecutive years. We invest in people and places to deliver dependable monthly dividends that increase over time. We are structured as a REIT requiring us annually to distribute at least 90 of our taxable income (excluding net capital gains) in the form of dividends to our stockholders. The monthly dividends are supported by the cash flow generated from real estate owned under long-term net lease agreements with our commercial clients. 
 Realty Income was founded in 1969, and listed on the NYSE under the ticker symbol "O" in 1994. Over the past 54 years, Realty Income has been acquiring and managing freestanding commercial properties that generate rental revenue under long-term net lease agreements with our commercial clients. 
 At December 31, 2022, our diversified portfolio consisted of: 
 Owned or held interests in 12,237 properties; 
 An occupancy rate of 99.0 , or 12,111 properties leased and 126 properties available for lease or sale; 
 Clients doing business in 84 separate industries; 
 Locations in all 50 U.S. states, Puerto Rico, the U.K., Spain, and Italy; 
 Approximately 236.8 million square feet of leasable space; 
 A weighted average remaining lease term (excluding rights to extend a lease at the option of our client) of approximately 9.5 years; and 
 An average leasable space per property of approximately 19,350 square feet, approximately 13,000 square feet per retail property and approximately 234,100 square feet per industrial property. 
 Of the 12,237 properties in the portfolio at December 31, 2022, 12,018, or 98.2 , are single-client properties, of which 11,894 were leased, and the remaining are multi-client properties. 
 Unless otherwise specified, references to rental revenue in the Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations are exclusive of reimbursements from clients for recoverable real estate taxes and operating expenses totaling 184.7 million, 104.9 million and 79.4 million for the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively. In addition, references to reserves recorded as a reduction of rental revenue include amounts reserved for in the current period, as well as unrecognized contractual revenue and unrecognized straight-line rental revenue for leases accounted for on a cash basis. 
 
 LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES 
 Capital Philosophy 
 Our goal is to deliver dependable monthly dividends to our shareholders that increase over time. Historically, we have met our principal short-term and long-term capital needs, including the funding of high-quality real estate 
 37 

Tabl e of Contents 

acquisitions, property development, and capital expenditures, by issuing common stock, preferred stock, long-term unsecured notes and term loan borrowings. Over the long term, we believe that common stock should be the majority of our capital structure. We may issue common stock when we believe our share price is at a level that allows for the proceeds of an offering to be accretively invested into additional properties or to permanently finance properties that were initially financed by our revolving credit facility, commercial paper programs, or shorter-term debt securities. However, we cannot assure you that we will have access to the capital markets at all times and at terms that are acceptable to us. 
 Our primary cash obligations, for the current year and subsequent years, are included in the Table of Obligations, which is presented later in this section. We expect to fund our operating expenses and other short-term liquidity requirements, including property acquisitions and development costs, payment of principal and interest on our outstanding indebtedness, property improvements, re-leasing costs, and cash distributions to common stockholders, primarily through cash provided by operating activities, borrowings under our revolving credit facility, short-term term loans, and under our commercial paper programs, and through public securities offerings. As of December 31, 2022, there are approximately 2.0 billion of obligations becoming due during 2023, which we expect to fund through a combination of the following: 
 Cash and cash equivalents; 
 Future cash flows from operations; 
 Issuances of common stock or debt; and 
 Additional borrowings under our revolving credit facility (after deducting outstanding borrowings under our commercial paper programs). 
 We may choose to mitigate our financial exposure to exchange rate risk for properties acquired outside the U.S. through the issuance of debt securities denominated in the same local currency and through currency derivatives. We may leave a portion of our foreign cash flow unhedged to reinvest in additional properties in the same local currency. 
 Conservative Capital Structure 
 We believe that our stockholders are best served by a conservative capital structure. Therefore, we seek to maintain a conservative debt level on our balance sheet and solid interest and fixed charge coverage ratios. At December 31, 2022, our total outstanding borrowings of senior unsecured notes and bonds, 250.0 million term loan, mortgages payable, revolving credit facility and commercial paper were 17.9 billion, or approximately 29.9 of our total market capitalization of 59.9 billion. 
 We define our total market capitalization at December 31, 2022, as the sum of: 
 
 Shares of our common stock outstanding of 660,300,195, plus total common units outstanding of 1,795,167, multiplied by the last reported sales price of our common stock on the NYSE of 63.43 per share on December 31, 2022, or 42.0 billion; 
 Outstanding borrowings of 2.0 billion on our revolving credit facility, comprised of 1.8 billion Euro and 70.0 million Sterling borrowings; 
 Outstanding borrowings of 701.8 million on our commercial paper programs, including 361.0 million of Euro-denominated borrowings; 
 Outstanding mortgages payable of 842.3 million, excluding net mortgage premiums of 12.4 million and deferred financing costs of 0.8 million; 
 Outstanding borrowings on our 250.0 million term loan, excluding deferred financing costs of 0.2 million; and 
 Outstanding senior unsecured notes and bonds of 14.1 billion, including Sterling-denominated notes of 2.57 billion, and excluding unamortized net premiums of 224.6 million and deferred financing costs of 60.7 million. 
 Universal Shelf Registration 
 In June 2021, we filed a shelf registration statement with the SEC, which is effective for a term of three years and will expire in June 2024. In accordance with SEC rules, the amount of securities to be issued pursuant to this shelf registration statement was not specified when it was filed and there is no specific dollar limit. The securities covered by this registration statement include (1) common stock, (2) preferred stock, (3) debt securities, (4) depositary shares representing fractional interests in shares of preferred stock, (5) warrants to purchase debt securities, common stock, preferred stock, or depositary shares, and (6) any combination of these securities. We may periodically offer one or more of these securities in amounts, prices and on terms to be announced when and if 
 38 

Tabl e of Contents 

these securities are offered. The specifics of any future offerings, along with the use of proceeds of any securities offered, will be described in detail in a prospectus supplement, or other offering materials, at the time of any offering. 
 Equity Capital Raising 
 Under our ATM program, up to 120,000,000 shares of common stock may be offered and sold (1) by us to, or through, a consortium of banks acting as our sales agents or (2) by a consortium of banks acting as forward sellers on behalf of any forward purchasers contemplated thereunder, in each case by means of ordinary brokers transactions on the NYSE at prevailing market prices, at prices related to prevailing market prices or at negotiated prices or by any other methods permitted by applicable law. We currently expect to fully physically cash settle any forward sale agreement with the respective forward purchaser on one or more dates specified by us on or prior to the maturity date of such forward sale agreement, in which case we expect to receive aggregate net cash proceeds at settlement equal to the number of shares specified in such forward sale agreement multiplied by the relevant forward price per share. During the year ended December 31, 2022, we issued 68,608,176 shares and raised approximately 4.6 billion of net proceeds under the ATM programs. With respect to forward sales pursuant to our ATM program, we do not initially receive any proceeds from any sale of shares of our common stock borrowed by a forward purchaser and sold through a forward seller. As of December 31, 2022, there were 6,744,884 shares of common stock subject to forward sale agreements through our ATM program, with a weighted average initial price of 63.31 per share, representing approximately 0.4 billion in estimated net proceeds (assuming full physical settlement of all outstanding shares of common stock subject to such forward sale agreements and certain assumptions made with respect to settlement dates), which have been executed but not settled. The weighted average forward price at December 31, 2022 was 62.59 per share, after price deduction and adjustments. After deducting the 6,744,884 shares sold pursuant to forward sale confirmations that remained outstanding as of December 31, 2022, we had 70,620,121 shares remaining for future issuance under our ATM program. We anticipate maintaining the availability of our ATM program in the future, including the replenishment of authorized shares issuable thereunder. 
 
 Our Dividend Reinvestment and Stock Purchase Plan, (our "DRSPP"), provides our common stockholders, as well as new investors, with a convenient and economical method of purchasing our common stock and reinvesting their distributions. Our DRSPP also allows our current stockholders to buy additional shares of common stock by reinvesting all or a portion of their distributions. Our DRSPP authorizes up to 26,000,000 common shares to be issued. Our DRSPP includes a waiver approval process, allowing larger investors or institutions, per a formal approval process, to purchase shares at a small discount, if approved by us. We did not issue shares under the waiver approval process during the year ended December 31, 2022. During the year ended December 31, 2022, we issued 175,554 shares and raised approximately 11.7 million under our DRSPP. At December 31, 2022, we had 11,159,825 shares remaining for future issuance under our DRSPP program. 
 
 There were no issuances of common stock in underwritten public offerings during the year ended December 31, 2022. 
 Revolving Credit Facility 
 We have a 4.25 billion unsecured revolving multicurrency credit facility that matures in June 2026, includes two six-month extensions that can be exercised at our option and allows us to borrow in up to 14 currencies, including U.S. dollars. Our revolving credit facility also has a 1.0 billion expansion feature, which is subject to obtaining lender commitments. Under our revolving credit facility, our current investment grade credit ratings provide for financing on USD borrowings at the Secured Overnight Financing Rate ("SOFR"), plus 0.725 with a SOFR adjustment charge of 0.10 and a revolving credit facility fee of 0.125 , for all-in pricing of 0.95 over SOFR, British Pound Sterling at the Sterling Overnight Indexed Average SONIA ), plus 0.725 with a SONIA adjustment charge of 0.0326 and a revolving credit facility fee of 0.125 , for all-in pricing of 0.8826 over SONIA, and Euro Borrowings at one-month Euro Interbank Offered Rate EURIBOR ), plus 0.725 , and a revolving credit facility fee of 0.125 , for all-in pricing of 0.85 over one-month EURIBOR. 
 The borrowing rate is subject to an interest rate floor and may change if our investment grade credit ratings change. We also have other interest rate options available to us in different currencies. Our credit facility is unsecured and accordingly, we have not pledged any assets as collateral for this obligation . 
 At December 31, 2022, we had a borrowing capacity of 2.2 billion available on our revolving credit facility (subject to customary conditions to borrowings) and an outstanding balance of 2.0 billion, comprised of 1.8 billion Euro and 70.0 million Sterling borrowings. The weighted average interest rate on borrowings under our revolving credit facility during the year ended December 31, 2022, was 1.8 per annum. Our revolving credit facility is subject to various leverage and interest coverage ration limitations, as at December 31, 2022, we were in compliance with 
 39 

Tabl e of Contents 

these covenants. We expect to use our credit facility to acquire additional properties and for other general corporate purposes. Any additional borrowings will increase our exposure to interest rate risk. 
 Commercial Paper Programs 
 During July 2022, our USD-denominated unsecured commercial paper program was amended to increase the maximum aggregate amount of outstanding notes from 1.0 billion to 1.5 billion. We also established a Euro-denominated unsecured commercial paper program, which permits us to issue additional unsecured commercial notes up to a maximum aggregate amount of 1.5 billion (or foreign currency equivalent), which may be issued in U.S. Dollars or various other foreign currencies, including but not limited to, Euros, Sterling, Swiss Francs, Yen, Canadian Dollars, and Australian Dollars, in each case, pursuant to customary terms in the European commercial paper note market. At December 31, 2022, we had an outstanding balance of 701.8 million, including 361.0 million of Euro-denominated borrowings. The weighted average interest rate on borrowings under our commercial paper programs was 1.6 for the year ended December 31, 2022. The commercial paper borrowings outstanding at December 31, 2022 have matured and will mature between January 2023 and February 2023. We use our 4.25 billion revolving credit facility as a liquidity backstop for the repayment of the notes issued under the commercial paper programs. 
 We generally use our credit facility and commercial paper borrowings for the short-term financing of new property acquisitions. Thereafter, we generally seek to refinance those borrowings with the net proceeds of long-term or more permanent financing, including the issuance of equity or debt securities. We cannot assure you, however, that we will be able to obtain any such refinancing, or that market conditions prevailing at the time of the refinancing will enable us to issue equity or debt securities at acceptable terms. We regularly review our credit facility and commercial paper programs and may seek to extend, renew or replace our credit facility and commercial paper programs, to the extent we deem appropriate. 
 Term Loans 
 On January 6, 2023 we entered into the Term Loan Agreement governing our term loan, pursuant to which we borrowed an aggregate of approximately 1.0 billion in multicurrency borrowings, including 90.0 million, 705.0 million and 85.0 million in outstanding borrowings. The Term Loan Agreement also permits us to incur additional term loans, up to an aggregate of 1.5 billion in total borrowings. The Term Loans initially mature in January 2024 and include two 12-month maturity extensions that can be exercised at the company's option. Our A3/A- credit ratings provide for a borrowing rate of 80 basis points over the applicable benchmark rate, which includes adjusted SOFR for USD-denominated loans, adjusted SONIA for Sterling-denominated loans, and EURIBOR for Euro-denominated loans. 
 In October 2018, in conjunction with entering into our current revolving credit facility, we entered into a 250.0 million senior unsecured term loan, which matures in March 2024. Prior to April 2022, borrowing under this term loan bore interest at the current one-month London Inter-Bank Offered Rate LIBOR ), plus 0.85 . In connection with entering into our new unsecured credit facility in April 2022, the previous LIBOR benchmark rate was replaced with daily SOFR, based on a five-day lookback period, and, due to our current credit ratings, is not subject to a credit spread adjustment. In conjunction with this term loan, we also entered into an interest rate swap, which was based off the daily SOFR through June 30, 2022. As of December 31, 2022, the effective interest rate on this term loan, after giving effect to the interest rate swap, was 3.83 . 
 Mortgage Debt 
 As of December 31, 2022, we had 842.3 million of mortgages payable, of which 30.7 million related to a Sterling-denominated mortgage. The majority of our mortgages payable were assumed in connection with our merger with VEREIT or with our property acquisitions, including the assumption of eight mortgages on 17 properties totaling 45.1 million during the year ended December 31, 2022. At December 31, 2022, we had net premiums totaling 12.4 million on these mortgages and deferred financing costs of 0.8 million. We expect to pay off the mortgages payable as soon as prepayment penalties have declined to a level that would make it economically feasible to do so. During the year ended December 31, 2022, we made 312.2 million in principal payments, including the repayment of 12 mortgages in full for 308.0 million. Our mortgages contain customary covenants, such as limiting our ability to further mortgage each applicable property or to discontinue insurance coverage without the prior consent of the lender. At December 31, 2022, we were in compliance with these covenants.

 All of our outstanding notes and bonds have fixed interest rates and contain various covenants, with which we remained in compliance as of December 31, 2022. Interest on our 400 million of 1.625 senior unsecured notes issued in October 2020, our 400 million of 1.125 senior unsecured notes issued in July 2021, our 350 million of 1.750 senior unsecured notes also issued in July 2021, our 250 million of 1.875 senior unsecured notes issued in January 2022, and 250 million of 2.500 senior unsecured notes also issued in January 2022 is paid annually. Interest on our remaining senior unsecured note and bond obligations is paid semiannually. 
 The following is a summary of the key financial covenants for our senior unsecured notes, as defined and calculated per the terms of our senior notes and bonds. These calculations, which are not based on U.S. GAAP, are presented to investors to show our ability to incur additional debt under the terms of our senior notes and bonds as well as to disclose our current compliance with such covenants and are not measures of our liquidity or performance. The actual amounts as of December 31, 2022, are:

 (1) Our debt service coverage ratio is calculated on a pro forma basis for the preceding four-quarter period on the assumptions that: (i) the incurrence of any debt (as defined in the covenants) incurred by us since the first day of such four-quarter period and the application of the proceeds therefrom (including to refinance other debt since the first day of such four-quarter period), (ii) the repayment or retirement of any of our debt since the first day of such four-quarter period, and (iii) any acquisition or disposition by us of any asset or group since the first day of such four quarters had in each case occurred on January 1, 2022 and subject to certain additional adjustments. Such pro forma ratio has been prepared on the basis required by that debt service covenant, reflects various estimates and assumptions and is subject to other uncertainties, and therefore does not purport to reflect what our actual debt service coverage ratio would have been had transactions referred to in clauses (i), (ii) and (iii) of the preceding sentence occurred as of January 1, 2022, nor does it purport to reflect our debt service coverage ratio for any

 Cash Reserves 
 We are organized to operate as an equity REIT that acquires and leases properties and distributes to stockholders, in the form of monthly cash distributions, a substantial portion of our net cash flow generated from leases on our properties. We intend to retain an appropriate amount of cash as working capital. At December 31, 2022, we had cash and cash equivalents totaling 171.1 million, inclusive of 74.3 million denominated in Sterling and 17.8 million denominated in Euro. 
 We believe that our cash and cash equivalents on hand, cash provided from operating activities, and borrowing capacity is sufficient to meet our liquidity needs for the next twelve months. We intend, however, to use permanent or long-term capital to fund property acquisitions and to repay future borrowings under our credit facility and commercial paper programs. 
 Credit Agency Ratings 
 The borrowing interest rates under our revolving credit facility are based upon our ratings assigned by credit rating agencies. As of December 31, 2022, we were assigned the following investment grade corporate credit ratings on our senior unsecured notes and bonds: Moody s Investors Service has assigned a rating of A3 with a stable outlook and Standard Poor s Ratings Group has assigned a rating of A- with a stable outlook. In addition, we were assigned the following ratings on our commercial paper at December 31, 2022: Moody's Investors Service has assigned a rating of P-2 and Standard Poor's Ratings Group has assigned a rating of A-2. 
 Based on our credit agency ratings as of December 31, 2022, interest rates under our new credit facility for U.S. borrowings would have been at the SOFR, plus 0.725 with a SOFR adjustment charge of 0.10 and a revolving credit facility fee of 0.125 , for all-in pricing of 0.95 over SOFR, for British Pound Sterling borrowings, at the SONIA, plus 0.725 with a SONIA adjustment charge of 0.0326 and a revolving credit facility fee of 0.125 , for all-in pricing of 0.8826 over SONIA, and for Euro Borrowings at one-month Euro Interbank Offered Rate EURIBOR ), plus 0.725 , and a revolving credit facility fee of 0.125 , for all-in pricing of 0.85 over one-month EURIBOR. In addition, our new credit facility provides that the interest rates can range between: (i) SOFR/SONIA/EURIBOR, plus 1.40 if our credit rating is lower than BBB-/Baa3 or our senior unsecured debt is unrated and (ii) SOFR/SONIA/EURIBOR, plus 0.70 if our credit rating is A/A2 or higher. In addition, our credit facility provides for a facility commitment fee based on our credit ratings, which range from: (i) 0.30 for a rating lower than BBB-/Baa3 or unrated, and (ii) 0.10 for a credit rating of A/A2 or higher . 
 We also issue senior debt securities from time to time and our credit ratings can impact the interest rates charged in those transactions. If our credit ratings or ratings outlook change, our cost to obtain debt financing could increase or decrease. The credit ratings assigned to us could change based upon, among other things, our results of operations and financial condition. These ratings are subject to ongoing evaluation by credit rating agencies, and we cannot assure you that our ratings will not be changed or withdrawn by a rating agency in the future if, in its judgment, circumstances warrant. Moreover, a rating is not a recommendation to buy, sell or hold our debt securities, preferred stock or common stock.

 (8) Other consists of 606.3 million of commitments under construction contracts, and 21.7 million for re-leasing costs, recurring capital expenditures, and non-recurring building improvements. 
 Our credit facility, commercial paper programs, term loans, and notes payable obligations are unsecured. Accordingly, we have not pledged any assets as collateral for these obligations. 
 Unconsolidated Investments 
 As a result of our VEREIT merger, we assumed an equity method investment in three unconsolidated entities. In 2022, all seven assets owned by our industrial partnerships acquired in connection with the VEREIT merger were sold. The gross purchase price for the properties was 905.0 million and we collected 114.0 million of net proceeds (after mortgage defeasance and closing costs) to date, representing our proportionate share of partnership distributions. Up until the point of sale of these properties, we were responsible for funding our proportionate share of any operating cash deficits pursuant to the governance documents of the applicable entities. There are no further material commitments related to those investments. 
 
 RESULTS OF OPERATIONS 
 Critical Accounting Policies 
 Our consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP and are the basis for our discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations. Preparing our consolidated financial statements requires us to make a number of estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts and disclosures in the consolidated financial statements. We believe that we have made these estimates and assumptions in an appropriate manner and in a way that accurately reflects our financial condition. We continually test and evaluate these estimates and assumptions using our historical knowledge of the business, as well as other factors, to ensure that they are reasonable for reporting purposes. However, actual results may differ from these estimates and assumptions. This summary should be read in conjunction with the more complete discussion of our accounting policies and procedures included in note 2, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies and Procedures and New Accounting Standards , to our consolidated financial statements in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2022.

Tabl e of Contents 

In order to prepare our consolidated financial statements according to the rules and guidelines set forth by U.S. GAAP, many subjective judgments must be made with regard to critical accounting policies. Management must make significant assumptions in determining the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed. When acquiring a property for investment purposes, we typically allocate the cost of real estate acquired, inclusive of transaction costs, to: (1) land, (2) building and improvements, and (3) identified intangible assets and liabilities, based in each case on their relative estimated fair values. Intangible assets and liabilities consist of above-market or below-market lease value and the value of in-place leases, as applicable. Additionally, above-market rents on certain leases under which we are a lessor are accounted for as financing receivables amortizing over the lease term, while below-market rents on certain leases under which we are a lessor are accounted for as prepaid rent. In an acquisition of multiple properties, we must also allocate the purchase price among the properties. The allocation of the purchase price is based on our assessment of estimated fair value of the land, building and improvements, and identified intangible assets and liabilities and is often based upon the various characteristics of the market where the property is located. In addition, any assumed mortgages are recorded at their estimated fair values. The estimated fair values of our mortgages payable have been calculated by discounting the future cash flows using applicable interest rates that have been adjusted for factors, such as industry type, client investment grade, maturity date, and comparable borrowings for similar assets. The use of different assumptions in the allocation of the purchase price of the acquired properties and liabilities assumed could affect the timing of recognition of the related revenue and expenses. 
 Another significant judgment must be made as to if, and when, impairment losses should be taken on our properties when events or a change in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the asset may not be recoverable. If estimated future operating cash flows (undiscounted and without interest charges) plus estimated disposition proceeds (undiscounted) are less than the current book value of the property, a fair value analysis is performed and, to the extent the estimated fair value is less than the current book value, a provision for impairment is recorded to reduce the book value to estimated fair value. Key inputs that we utilize in this analysis include projected rental rates, estimated holding periods, capital expenditures, and property sales capitalization rates. If a property is held for sale, it is carried at the lower of carrying cost or estimated fair value, less estimated cost to sell. The carrying value of our real estate is the largest component of our consolidated balance sheets. Our strategy of primarily holding properties, long-term, directly decreases the likelihood of their carrying values not being recoverable, thus requiring the recognition of an impairment. However, if our strategy, or one or more of the above assumptions were to change in the future, an impairment may need to be recognized. If events should occur that require us to reduce the carrying value of our real estate by recording provisions for impairment, they could have a material impact on our results of operations. 
 The following is a comparison of our results of operations for the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020.

 (3) Following of the closing of our merger with VEREIT, we contributed 92 office real estate assets, a consolidated real estate venture holding one office asset, and an unconsolidated real estate venture holding five office assets to a wholly owned subsidiary named Orion Office REIT Inc. ("Orion"). On November 12, 2021, we distributed the outstanding shares of Orion common stock to our shareholders (including legacy VEREIT stockholders who received shares of our common stock in our merger with VEREIT) on a pro rata basis at a rate of one share of Orion common stock for every ten shares of Realty Income common stock held on November 12, 2021, the applicable record date, which we refer to as the Orion Divestiture.

 prior year is 2.8 . 
 (3) For purposes of comparability, same store rental revenue is presented on a constant currency basis using the exchange rate as of December 31, 2021 of 1.35 GBP/USD. None of the properties in Spain met our same store pool definition for the periods presented. In addition, the same store pool excludes properties assumed on November 1, 2021 as a result of our merger with VEREIT. 
 (4) Relates to the aggregate of (i) rental revenue from properties (128 properties comprising 2,292,635 square feet) that were available for lease during part of 2021 or 2020, (ii) rental revenue for properties (nine properties comprising 357,605 square feet) under development or completed developments that do not meet our same store pool definition for the periods presented. 
 (5) Primarily consists of reimbursements for tenant improvements and rental revenue that is not contractual base rent such as lease termination settlements. 
 For purposes of determining the same store rent property pool, we include all properties that were owned for the entire year-to-date period, for both the current and prior year, except for properties during the current or prior year that; (i) were vacant at any time, (ii) were under development or redevelopment, or (iii) were involved in eminent domain and rent was reduced. Beginning with the first quarter of 2022, properties acquired through the merger with VEREIT were considered under each element of our same store pool criterion, except for the requirement that the property be owned for the full comparative period. If the property was owned by VEREIT for the full comparative period and each of the other criteria were met, the property was included in our same store property pool. Each of the exclusions from the same store pool are separately addressed within the applicable sentences above, explaining the changes in rental revenue for the period. 
 Our calculation of same store rental revenue includes rent deferred for future payment as a result of lease concessions we granted in response to the COVID-19 pandemic and recognized under the practical expedient provided by the Financial Accounting Standards Board (the "FASB"). Our calculation of same store rental revenue also includes uncollected rent for which we have not granted a lease concession. If these applicable amounts of rent deferrals and uncollected rent were excluded from our calculation of same store rental revenue, the increases for 2022 relative to 2021 and 2021 relative to 2020 would have been 2.3 and 7.7 , respectively. 
 Of the 12,237 properties in the portfolio at December 31, 2022, 12,018, or 98.2 , are single-client properties and the remaining are multi-client properties. Of the 12,018 single-client properties, 11,894, or 99.0 , were net leased at December 31, 2022. 
 Of the 12,797 in-place leases in the portfolio, which excludes 181 vacant units, 10,835, or 84.7 , were under leases that provide for increases in rents through: 
 Base rent increases tied to inflation (typically subject to ceilings); 
 Percentage rent based on a percentage of the clients gross sales; 
 Fixed increases; or 
 A combination of two or more of the above rent provisions. 
 Rent based on a percentage of our client's gross sales, or percentage rent, was 14.9 million, 6.5 million and 5.1 million for the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively. Percentage rent represents less than 1 of rental revenue. 
 At December 31, 2022, our portfolio of 12,237 properties was 99.0 leased with 126 properties available for lease, as compared to 98.5 leased with 164 properties available for lease at December 31, 2021. It has been our experience that approximately 1 to 4 of our property portfolio will be available for lease at any given time; however, it is possible that the number of properties available for lease or sale could increase in the future, given the nature of economic cycles and other unforeseen global events, such as the COVID-19 pandemic. 
 Rental Revenue (reimbursable) 
 A number of our leases provide for contractually obligated reimbursements from clients for recoverable real estate taxes and operating expenses. The increase in contractually obligated reimbursements by our clients in the periods presented is primarily due to the growth of our portfolio due to acquisitions. 
 Other Revenue 
 Other revenue primarily relates to interest income recognized on financing receivables for certain leases with above-market terms. The increases in the periods presented are due to additional leases with above-market terms, which is proportional to overall portfolio growth.

 (2) General and administrative expenses for 2020 included an executive severance charge related to the departure of our former Chief Financial Officer ("CFO") in March 2020. The total value of cash, stock compensation and professional fees incurred as a result of this severance was 3.5 million and was recorded to general and administrative expense. In order to present a normalized calculation of our general and administrative expenses as a percentage of total revenue for 2020, we have excluded this executive severance charge to arrive at a normalized general and administrative amount of 69.8 million which was used for our calculation. 
 
 Depreciation and Amortization 
 The increase in depreciation and amortization is primarily due to the acquisition of properties in 2022 and 2021, which was partially offset by property sales in those same periods. The 2021 acquisition volume was primarily driven by the merger with VEREIT. As discussed in the sections entitled Funds from Operations Available to Common Stockholders (FFO) and Normalized Funds from Operations Available to Common Stockholders (Normalized FFO)" and Adjusted Funds from Operations Available to Common Stockholders (AFFO), depreciation and amortization is a non-cash item that is added back to net income available to common stockholders for our calculation of FFO, Normalized FFO, and AFFO.

 523,384 320,370 293,879 Credit facility commitment fees 4,908 3,801 3,812 Amortization of debt origination and deferred financing costs 14,149 11,695 10,694 Loss on interest rate swaps 718 2,905 4,132 Amortization of net mortgage premiums (13,622) (3,498) (1,258) Amortization of net note premiums (62,989) (10,349) (1,754) Interest capitalized (2,789) (1,926) (480) Capital lease obligation 1,464 646 311 Interest expense 465,223 323,644 309,336 Credit facility, commercial paper, 250.0 million term loan, mortgages and notes 
 Average outstanding balances (dollars in thousands) 16,460,928 10,024,343 8,240,829 Average interest rates 3.15 3.11 3.48 
 The increase in interest expense for the year ended December 31, 2022 is primarily due to the following: (i) the October 2022 issuance of 750.0 million in principal of notes, (ii) the June 2022 issuance of 600 million in principal of Sterling-denominated notes, (iii) the January 2022 issuance of 500 million in principal of Sterling-denominated notes, (iv) the issuance of 4.65 billion in principal of notes associated with the exchange offer and assumption of 839.1 million in principal of mortgage debt, both associated with our merger with VEREIT in November 2021, and (v) the July 2021 issuance of 750 million in principal of Sterling-denominated notes, as well as higher average balances and interest rates on the credit facility and commercial paper borrowings, partially offset by the December 2021 early redemption on all 750.0 million in principal of the 4.650 notes due August 2023, and the January 2021 early redemption on all 950.0 million in principal of the 3.250 notes due October 2022. 
 The increase in interest expense for the year ended December 31, 2021 is primarily due to the issuance of 4.65 billion in principal of notes associated with our merger with VEREIT as discussed above, the issuance of senior unsecured notes during 2020 and 2021 outside of our merger with VEREIT, which included aggregate totals of 1.68 billion in principal of USD-denominated notes and 1.15 billion in principal of Sterling-denominated notes, partially offset by the early redemptions during 2021 and 2020 of 1.2 billion of notes, increases in amortization of net note and mortgage premiums, and lower average balances on our credit facility and commercial paper borrowings. 
 During the year ended December 31, 2022, the weighted average interest rate on our: 
 Revolving credit facility outstanding borrowings of 2.0 billion was 1.8 ; 
 Commercial paper outstanding borrowings of 701.8 million was 1.6 ; 
 Term loan outstanding of 250.0 million (excluding deferred financing costs of 0.2 million) was swapped to fixed at 3.8 ; 
 Mortgages payable of 842.3 million (excluding net premiums totaling 12.4 million and deferred financing costs of 0.8 million on these mortgages) was 4.8 ; 
 Notes and bonds payable of 14.1 billion (excluding net unamortized original issue premiums of 224.6 million and deferred financing costs of 60.7 million) was 3.3 ; and 
 Notes, bonds, mortgages, 250.0 million term loan, and credit facility and commercial paper borrowings of 17.9 billion (excluding all net premiums and deferred financing costs) was 3.15 .

Property Expenses (excluding reimbursable) 
 Property expenses (excluding reimbursable) consist of costs associated with properties available for lease, non-net-leased properties and general portfolio expenses. Expenses related to properties available for lease and non-net-leased properties include, but are not limited to, property taxes, maintenance, insurance, utilities, property inspections and legal fees. General portfolio costs include, but are not limited to, insurance, legal, property inspections, and title search fees. At December 31, 2022, 126 properties were available for lease or sale, as compared to 164 at December 31, 2021, and 140 at December 31, 2020. 
 The increase in property expenses (excluding reimbursable) for the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021 is primarily due to the increase in portfolio size, resulting in higher utilities, repairs and maintenance, property-related legal expenses, property taxes, insurance expenses and reserves for contractually obligated reimbursements by our clients. 
 Property Expenses (reimbursable) 
 The increase in property expenses (reimbursable) for the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, is primarily attributable to our increased portfolio size, which contributed to higher operating expenses as a result of our acquisitions during the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, and an increase in ground lease rent, insurance, and property taxes paid on behalf of our clients. 
 General and Administrative Expenses 
 General and administrative expenses are expenditures related to the operations of our company, including employee-related costs, professional fees, and other general overhead costs associated with running our business. 
 The increase in general and administrative expenses for the year ended December 31, 2022 is primarily due to higher payroll-related costs, corporate-level professional fees, corporate occupancy costs, and information technology costs associated with the growth of the company, including the merger with VEREIT. The increase in general and administrative expenses for 2021 is primarily due to higher payroll-related costs and corporate-level professional fees. 
 Provisions for Impairment 
 The following table summarizes provisions for impairment during the periods indicated below (dollars in millions): 
 Years ended December 31, 2022 2021 2020 Carrying value prior to impairment 140.9 169.2 260.8 Less: total provisions for impairment (25.9) (39.0) (147.2) Carrying value after impairment 115.0 130.2 113.6 
 The impairments for the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021 primarily relate to properties sold, in the process of being sold, or vacant. 
 We identify the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic as an impairment triggering event for properties occupied by certain of our clients experiencing difficulties meeting their lease obligations to us. After considering the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic on the key assumptions, we determined that the carrying values of 38 properties classified as held for investment for the year ended December 31, 2020 were not recoverable. As a result, we recorded provisions for impairment of 105.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2020 on the applicable properties impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic. 
 Merger and Integration-Related Costs 
 In conjunction with our merger with VEREIT, we incurred approximately 13.9 million and 167.4 million of merger and integration-related transaction costs during the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. There were no such costs incurred during the year ended December 31, 2020. Merger and integration-related costs consist of advisory fees, attorney fees, accountant fees, SEC filing fees and additional incremental and non-recurring costs necessary to convert data and systems, retain employees and otherwise enable us to operate the acquired business or assets efficiently. 
 Gain on Sales of Real Estate 
 The following summarizes our property dispositions, excluding our proportionate share of net proceeds from the disposition of properties by our consolidated industrial partnerships in 2022 (dollars in millions):

Tabl e of Contents 

Years ended December 31, 2022 2021 2020 Number of properties sold 168 154 126 Net sales proceeds 434.9 250.3 262.5 Gain on sales of real estate 102.7 55.8 76.2 
 Foreign Currency and Derivative Gains (Losses), Net 
 We borrow in the functional currencies of the countries in which we invest. Net foreign currency gain and loss are primarily related to the remeasurement of intercompany debt from foreign subsidiaries. Gain and loss on foreign currency are largely offset by derivative gain and loss. 
 Derivative gain and loss relates to mark-to-market adjustments on derivatives that do not qualify for hedge accounting. Net derivative gain and loss are primarily related to realized and unrealized short term currency exchange swaps. Gain and loss on derivatives are largely offset by foreign currency gain and loss. 
 In June 2022, following the early prepayment of our Sterling-denominated intercompany loan receivable from our consolidated foreign subsidiaries, we terminated the four cross-currency swaps used to hedge the foreign currency exposure of the intercompany loan. As the hedge relationship was terminated and the future principal and interest associated with the prepaid intercompany loan will not occur, 20.0 million gain was reclassified from accumulated other comprehensive income ("AOCI"), to 'Foreign currency and derivative (loss) gain, net' during the year ended December 31, 2022. The reclassification from AOCI was offset by 7.9 million in losses from the intercompany loan remeasurement on the final exchange. 
 Gain (loss) on extinguishment of debt 
 We redeemed the following principal amounts (in millions) of certain outstanding notes and mortgages, prior to their maturity. As a result of these early redemptions, we recognized the following losses on extinguishment of debt (in millions) in the consolidated statements of income and comprehensive income. There were no comparable repayments for the year ended December 31, 2022. Gain (Loss) on Extinguishment of Debt 2021 Repayments Principal Amount (1) 
 Amount of Loss Period Recognized 4.650 notes due August 2023 redeemed in December 2021 
 750.0 46.4 December 31, 2021 Mortgage due June 2022 redeemed in October 2021

 250.0 9.8 March 31, 2020 
 (1) The redeemed principal amounts presented exclude the amounts we paid in accrued and unpaid interest. 
 Equity in Income and Impairment of Investment in Unconsolidated Entities 
 Equity in income and impairment of investment in unconsolidated entities for the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021 relate to three equity method investments that were acquired in our merger with VEREIT. The loss for the year ended December 31, 2022 is primarily driven by an other than temporary impairment. There were no comparative investments for the year ended December 31, 2020. During 2022 all seven of the properties owned by our industrial partnerships acquired in connection with the VEREIT merger were sold. 
 Other Income, Net 
 Certain miscellaneous non-recurring revenue is included in other income, net. The increase for the year ended December 31, 2022 as compared to 2021, is primarily related to an increase in gain on insurance proceeds from recoveries on property losses exceeding our carrying value, an increase in gain from the involuntary conversions of real estate, gains on land sales and higher interest income due to higher average cash balances.

Tabl e of Contents 

The increase for the year ended December 31, 2021 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2020, is primarily related to an increase in gain on insurance proceeds from recoveries on property losses exceeding our carrying value and an increase in gain from the involuntary conversions of real estate, which was partially offset by a decrease in interest income from lower average cash balances. 
 Income Taxes Income taxes are for city and state income and franchise taxes, and for international income taxes accrued or paid by us and our subsidiaries. The increase in income taxes for the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021 is primarily attributable to our increased volume of U.K. investments, which contributed to higher U.K. income taxes for both years. 
 Net Income Available to Common Stockholders 
 The following summarizes our net income available to common stockholders (dollars in millions, except per share data): 
 Years ended December 31, Increase/(Decrease) 2022 2021 2020 2022 versus 2021 2021 versus 2020 Net income available to common stockholders 
 869.4 359.5 395.5 141.8 (9.1) Net income per share (1) 
 1.42 0.87 1.14 63.2 (23.7) 
 (1) All per share amounts are presented on a diluted per common share basis. 
 The calculation to determine net income available to common stockholders includes provisions for impairment, gain from the sale of properties, and foreign currency gain and loss, which can vary from period to period based on timing and significantly impact net income available to common stockholders. 
 The increase in net income available to common stockholders for the year ended December 31, 2022, compared to the year ended December 31, 2021 primarily related to the increase in the size of our portfolio due to the merger with VEREIT, which closed on November 1, 2021, gain on insurance proceeds from recoveries on property losses exceeding our carrying value, and 13.9 million of merger and integration-related costs related to our merger with VEREIT. The increases were partially offset by reserves to rental revenue of 4.0 million (of which 1.7 million was related to straight-line rent receivables) for the year ended December 31, 2022. Net income available to common stockholders for the year ended December 31, 2021, was impacted by the following transactions: (i) a 97.2 million loss on extinguishment of debt, which primarily includes 46.5 million related to the January 2021 early redemption of the 3.250 notes due October 2022 recorded in the three months ended March 31, 2021 and 46.4 million related to the December 2021 early redemption of the 4.650 notes due August 2023 recorded in the three months ended December 31, 2021, (ii) 167.4 million of merger and integration-related costs related to our merger with VEREIT, and (iii) 14.7 million of reserves to rental revenue (of which 4.5 million was related to straight-line rent receivables). Net income available to common stockholders for the year ended December 31, 2020 was primarily impacted by the following transactions: (i) 147.2 million of provisions for impairment, (ii) 52.5 million in net reserves recorded as a reduction of rental revenue, (iii) a 9.8 million loss on extinguishment of debt due to the January 2020 early redemption of the 5.750 notes due January 2021, and (iv) a 3.5 million executive severance charge for our former CFO.

Adjusted Earnings before Interest, Taxes, Depreciation and Amortization for Real Estate ("Adjusted EBITDA re" 
 Nareit established an EBITDA metric for real estate companies (i.e., EBITDA for real estate, or EBITDA re it believed would provide investors with a consistent measure to help make investment decisions among REITs. Our definition of Adjusted EBITDA re is generally consistent with the Nareit definition, other than our adjustments to remove foreign currency and derivative gain and loss, excluding gain and loss from the settlement of foreign currency forwards not designated as hedges (which is consistent with our previous calculations of "Adjusted EBITDA"). We define Adjusted EBITDA re , a non GAAP financial measure, for the most recent quarter as earnings (net income) before (i) interest expense, including non-cash loss (gain) on swaps, (ii) income and franchise taxes, (iii) gain (loss) on extinguishment of debt, (iv) real estate depreciation and amortization, (v) provisions for impairment, (vi) merger and integration-related costs, (vii) gain on sales of real estate, (viii) foreign currency and derivative gain, net (as described in the Adjusted Funds from Operations section), (ix) gain on settlement of foreign currency forwards, and (x) equity in income of investment in unconsolidated entities. Our Adjusted EBITDA re may not be comparable to Adjusted EBITDA re reported by other companies or as defined by Nareit, and other companies may interpret or define Adjusted EBITDA re differently than we do. Management believes Adjusted EBITDA re to be a meaningful measure of a REIT s performance because it provides a view of our operating performance, analyzes our ability to meet interest payment obligations before the effects of income tax, depreciation and amortization expense, provisions for impairment, gain on sales of real estate and other items, as defined above, that affect comparability, including the removal of non-recurring and non-cash items that industry observers believe are less relevant to evaluating the operating performance of a company. In addition, EBITDA re is widely followed by industry analysts, lenders, investors, rating agencies, and others as a means of evaluating the operational cash generating capacity of a company prior to servicing debt obligations. Management also believes the use of an annualized quarterly Adjusted EBITDA re metric, which we refer to as Annualized Adjusted EBITDA re , is meaningful because it represents our current earnings run rate for the period presented. Annualized Adjusted EBITDA re and Annualized Pro Forma Adjusted EBITDA re , as defined below, are also used to determine the vesting of performance share awards granted to executive officers. Annualized Adjusted EBITDA re should be considered along with, but not as an alternative to net income as a measure of our operating performance. We define Annualized Pro Forma Adjusted EBITDA re as Annualized Adjusted EBITDA re , subject to certain adjustments to incorporate Adjusted EBITDA re from properties we acquired or stabilized during the applicable quarter and to remove Adjusted EBITDA re from properties we disposed of during the applicable quarter, and includes transaction accounting adjustments in accordance with U.S. GAAP, giving pro forma effect to all transactions as if they occurred at the beginning of the applicable period. Our calculation includes all adjustments consistent with the requirements to present Adjusted EBITDA re on a pro forma basis in accordance with Article 11 of Regulation S-X. The Annualized Pro Forma Adjustments are consistent with the debt service coverage ratio calculated under financial covenants for our senior unsecured notes. We believe Annualized Pro Forma Adjusted EBITDA re is a useful non-GAAP supplemental measure, as it excludes properties that were no longer owned at the balance sheet date and includes the annualized rent from properties acquired during the quarter. Management also uses our ratios of net debt-to-Annualized Adjusted EBITDA re and net debt-to Annualized Pro Forma Adjusted EBITDA re as measures of leverage in assessing our financial performance, which is calculated as net debt (which we define as total debt per the consolidated balance sheets, excluding deferred financing costs and net premiums and discounts, but including our proportionate share on debt from unconsolidated entities, less cash and cash equivalents), divided by annualized quarterly Adjusted EBITDA re and annualized Pro Forma Adjusted EBITDA re , respectively.

FUNDS FROM OPERATIONS AVAILABLE TO COMMON STOCKHOLDERS AND NORMALIZED FUNDS FROM OPERATIONS AVAILABLE TO COMMON STOCKHOLDERS 
 We define FFO, a non-GAAP measure, consistent with the National Association of Real Estate Investment Trusts' definition, as net income available to common stockholders, plus depreciation and amortization of real estate assets, plus provisions for impairments of depreciable real estate assets, and reduced by gain on property sales. We define Normalized FFO, a non-GAAP financial measure, as FFO excluding merger and integration-related costs related to our merger with VEREIT. We define diluted FFO and diluted normalized FFO as FFO and normalized FFO adjusted for dilutive noncontrolling interests. 
 The following summarizes our FFO and Normalized FFO (dollars in millions, except per share data): 
 Years ended December 31, Increase/(Decrease) 2022 2021 2020 2022 versus 2021 2021 versus 2020 FFO available to common stockholders

 (1) All per share amounts are presented on a diluted per common share basis. 
 FFO and Normalized FFO for the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020 were impacted by the same transactions listed under "Net Income Available to Common Stockholders" on page 51, with the exception of provisions for impairment, which do not impact FFO and Normalized FFO. 
 The following is a reconciliation of net income available to common stockholders (which we believe is the most comparable U.S. GAAP measure) to FFO and Normalized FFO. Also presented is information regarding distributions paid to common stockholders and the weighted average number of common shares used for the basic and diluted computation per share (dollars in thousands, except per share amounts):

 (1) Includes an other than temporary impairment of 8.5 million recognized during the year ended December 31, 2022 on our investment in unconsolidated entities, all of which were sold as of December 31, 2022. 
 We consider FFO and Normalized FFO to be appropriate supplemental measures of a REIT s operating performance as they are based on a net income analysis of property portfolio performance that adds back items such as depreciation and impairments for FFO, and adds back merger and integration-related costs, for Normalized FFO. The historical accounting convention used for real estate assets requires straight-line depreciation of buildings and improvements, which implies that the value of real estate assets diminishes predictably over time. Since real estate values historically rise and fall with market conditions, presentations of operating results for a REIT, using historical accounting for depreciation, could be less informative.

ADJUSTED FUNDS FROM OPERATIONS AVAILABLE TO COMMON STOCKHOLDERS 
 We define AFFO, a non-GAAP measure, as FFO adjusted for unique revenue and expense items, which we believe are not as pertinent to the measurement of our ongoing operating performance. We define diluted AFFO as AFFO adjusted for dilutive noncontrolling interests. 
 The following summarizes our AFFO (dollars in millions, except per share data): 
 
 Years ended December 31, Increase 2022 2021 2020 2022 versus 2021 2021 versus 2020 AFFO available to common stockholders 
 2,401.4 1,488.8 1,172.6 61.3 27.0 AFFO per share (1) 
 3.92 3.59 3.39 9.2 5.9 
 (1) All per share amounts are presented on a diluted per common share basis. 
 The increases in AFFO for the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021 were primarily attributable to the increase in the size of our portfolio, especially as it relates to the impact from our merger with VEREIT, which closed on November 1, 2021. These increases were partially offset by reserves recorded as a reduction of rental revenue of 4.0 million, 14.7 million and 52.5 million for the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively. 
 We consider AFFO to be an appropriate supplemental measure of our performance. Most companies in our industry use a similar measurement, but they may use the term CAD (for Cash Available for Distribution), FAD (for Funds Available for Distribution) or other terms. Our AFFO calculations may not be comparable to AFFO, CAD or FAD reported by other companies, and other companies may interpret or define such terms differently than we do. 
 The following is a reconciliation of net income available to common stockholders (which we believe is the most comparable U.S. GAAP measure) to Normalized FFO and AFFO. Also presented is information regarding distributions paid to common stockholders and the weighted average number of common shares used for the basic and diluted computation per share (dollars in thousands, except per share amounts):

We believe the non-GAAP financial measure AFFO provides useful information to investors because it is a widely accepted industry measure of the operating performance of real estate companies that is used by industry analysts and investors who look at and compare those companies. In particular, AFFO provides an additional measure to compare the operating performance of different REITs without having to account for differing depreciation assumptions and other unique revenue and expense items which are not pertinent to measuring a particular company s on-going operating performance. Therefore, we believe that AFFO is an appropriate supplemental performance metric, and that the most appropriate U.S. GAAP performance metric to which AFFO should be reconciled is net income available to common stockholders. 
 Presentation of the information regarding FFO, Normalized FFO, and AFFO is intended to assist the reader in comparing the operating performance of different REITs, although it should be noted that not all REITs calculate FFO, Normalized FFO, and AFFO in the same way, so comparisons with other REITs may not be meaningful. Furthermore, FFO, Normalized FFO, and AFFO are not necessarily indicative of cash flow available to fund cash needs and should not be considered as alternatives to net income as an indication of our performance. FFO, Normalized FFO, and AFFO should not be considered as alternatives to reviewing our cash flows from operating, investing, and financing activities. In addition, FFO, Normalized FFO, and AFFO should not be considered as measures of liquidity, our ability to make cash distributions, or our ability to pay interest payments. 
 
 IMPACT OF INFLATION 
 Leases generally provide for limited increases in rent as a result of fixed increases, increases in the consumer price index, or retail price index in the case of certain leases in the U.K. (typically subject to ceilings), or increases in the clients sales volumes. We expect that inflation will cause these lease provisions to result in rent increases over time. During times when inflation is greater than increases in rent, as provided for in the leases, rent increases may not keep up with the rate of inflation and other costs (including increases in employment and other fees and expenses). 
 Moreover, our use of net lease agreements tends to reduce our exposure to rising property expenses due to inflation because the client is responsible for property expenses. Even though net leases reduce our exposure to rising property expenses due to inflation, substantial inflationary pressures and increased costs may have an adverse impact on our clients if increases in their operating expenses exceed increases in revenue, which may adversely affect our clients' ability to pay rent. Additionally, inflationary periods may cause us to experience increased costs of financing, make it difficult to refinance debt at attractive rates or at all, and may adversely affect the properties we can acquire if the cost of financing an acquisition is in excess of our anticipated earnings from such property, thereby limiting the properties that can be acquired. 
 
 IMPACT OF RECENT ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS 
 For information on the impact of new accounting standards on our business, see note 2, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies and Procedures and New Accounting Standards , to our Consolidated Financial Statements. 
 
 Item 7A: Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk 
 We are exposed to economic risks from interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates. A portion of these risks is hedged, but the risks may affect our financial statements. 
 Interest Rates 
 We are exposed to interest rate changes primarily as a result of our credit facility and commercial paper programs, term loans, mortgages payable, and long-term notes and bonds used to maintain liquidity and expand our real estate investment portfolio and operations. Our interest rate risk management objective is to limit the impact of interest rate changes on earnings and cash flow and to lower our overall borrowing costs. To achieve these objectives, we issue long-term notes and bonds, primarily at fixed rates. 
 
 In order to mitigate and manage the effects of interest rate risks on our operations, we may utilize a variety of financial instruments, including interest rate swaps, interest rate locks and caps. The use of these types of instruments to hedge our exposure to changes in interest rates carries additional risks, including counterparty credit risk, the enforceability of hedging contracts and the risk that unanticipated and significant changes in interest rates will cause a significant loss of basis in the contract. To limit counterparty credit risk, we will seek to enter into such agreements with major financial institutions with favorable credit ratings. There can be no assurance that we will be

able to adequately protect against the foregoing risks or realize an economic benefit that exceeds the related amounts incurred in connection with engaging in such hedging activities. We do not enter into any derivative transactions for speculative or trading purposes. 
 The following table presents, by year of expected maturity, the principal amounts, average interest rates and estimated fair values of our fixed and variable rate debt as of December 31, 2022. This information is presented to evaluate the expected cash flows and sensitivity to interest rate changes (dollars in millions):

 (1) Excludes net premiums recorded on mortgages payable, net premiums recorded on notes payable and deferred financing costs on mortgages payable, notes payable, and our 250.0 million term loan. At December 31, 2022, the unamortized balance of net premiums on mortgages payable is 12.4 million, the unamortized balance of net premiums on notes payable is 224.6 million, and the balance of deferred financing costs on mortgages payable is 0.8 million, on notes payable is 60.7 million, and on the 250.0 million term loan is 0.2 million. 
 (2) We base the estimated fair value of the publicly-traded fixed rate senior notes and bonds at December 31, 2022, on the indicative market prices and recent trading activity of our senior notes and bonds payable. We base the estimated fair value of our fixed rate mortgages and private senior notes payable at December 31, 2022, on the relevant forward interest rate curve, plus an applicable credit-adjusted spread. We believe that the carrying values of the line of credit and commercial paper borrowings and 250.0 million term loan balance reasonably approximate their estimated fair values at December 31, 2022. 
 The table above incorporates only those exposures that exist as of December 31, 2022. It does not consider those exposures or positions that could arise after that date. As a result, our ultimate realized gain or loss, with respect to interest rate fluctuations, would depend on the exposures that arise during the period, our hedging strategies at the time, and interest rates. 
 At December 31, 2022, our outstanding notes, bonds and mortgages payable had fixed interest rates. Interest on our credit facility and commercial paper borrowings and 250.0 million term loan balance is variable. However, the variable interest rate feature on our 250.0 million term loan has been mitigated by an interest rate swap agreement. Based on our revolving credit facility balance of 2.0 billion at December 31, 2022, a 1 change in interest rates would change our interest rate costs by 20.3 million per year. 
 Foreign Currency Exchange Rates 
 We are exposed to foreign currency exchange variability related to investments in and earnings from our foreign investments. Foreign currency market risk is the possibility that our results of operations or financial position could be better or worse than planned because of changes in foreign currency exchange rates. We primarily hedge our foreign currency risk by borrowing in the currencies in which we invest thereby providing a natural hedge. We continuously evaluate and manage our foreign currency risk through the use of derivative financial instruments, including currency exchange swaps, foreign currency collars, and foreign currency forward contracts with financial counterparties where practicable. Such derivative instruments are viewed as risk management tools and are not used for speculative or trading purposes. Additionally, our inability to redeploy rent receipts from our international operations on a timely basis subjects us to foreign exchange risk.

 To the Stockholders and Board of Directors 
 Realty Income Corporation: 
 Opinion on the Consolidated Financial Statements 
 We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Realty Income Corporation and subsidiaries (the Company) as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, the related consolidated statements of income and comprehensive income, equity, and cash flows for each of the years in the three-year period ended December 31, 2022, and the related notes and financial statement schedule III (collectively, the consolidated financial statements). In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the years in the three-year period ended December 31, 2022, in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. 
 We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the Company s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2022, based on criteria established in Internal Control Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission, and our report dated February 22, 2023 expressed an unqualified opinion on the effectiveness of the Company s internal control over financial reporting. 
 Basis for Opinion 
 These consolidated financial statements are the responsibility of the Company s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these consolidated financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. 
 We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. Our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the consolidated financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the consolidated financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion. 
 Critical Audit Matter 
 The critical audit matter communicated below is a matter arising from the current period audit of the consolidated financial statements that was communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that: (1) relates to accounts or disclosures that are material to the consolidated financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of a critical audit matter does not alter in any way our opinion on the consolidated financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matter below, providing a separate opinion on the critical audit matter or on the accounts or disclosures to which it relates. 
 Evaluation of the Fair Value of Land in Real Estate Acquisitions 
 As discussed in Note 5 to the consolidated financial statements, during 2022, the Company acquired 9.0 billion of real estate properties. As discussed in Note 2, the purchase price of a real estate acquisition is typically allocated among the individual components of both tangible and intangible assets and liabilities acquired based on their estimated relative fair values. 
 
 We identified the evaluation of the fair value of land in real estate acquisitions as a critical audit matter. Specifically, the measurement of the fair values of land is dependent upon significant assumptions of market land values for which relevant external market data is not always readily available. There was a high degree of subjective and complex auditor judgment required in evaluating the fair value measurements given the sensitivity of the fair value measurements to changes in these assumptions. 
 
 61 

Tabl e of Contents 

The following are the primary procedures we performed to address this critical audit matter. We evaluated the design and tested the operating effectiveness of certain internal controls over the Company s process to allocate the purchase price of real estate acquisitions. This included controls over the measurement of the fair value of land. For a selection of real estate acquisitions, we involved valuation professionals with specialized skills and knowledge who assisted in evaluating a selection of the Company s acquired land values by comparing them to independently developed ranges using market data from industry transaction databases and published industry reports.

Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm 
 
 To the Stockholders and Board of Directors 
 Realty Income Corporation: 
 Opinion on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting 
 We have audited Realty Income Corporation and subsidiaries' (the Company) internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2022, based on criteria established in Internal Control Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. In our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2022, based on criteria established in Internal Control Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. 
 We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the consolidated balance sheets of the Company as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, the related consolidated statements of income and comprehensive income, equity, and cash flows for each of the years in the three-year period ended December 31, 2022, and the related notes and financial statement schedule III (collectively, the consolidated financial statements), and our report dated February 22, 2023 expressed an unqualified opinion on those consolidated financial statements. 
 Basis for Opinion 
 The Company s management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in the accompanying Management's Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company s internal control over financial reporting based on our audit. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. 
 We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audit of internal control over financial reporting included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk. Our audit also included performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion. 
 Definition and Limitations of Internal Control Over Financial Reporting 
 A company s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements. 
 Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

 If circumstances arise that we previously considered unlikely and, as a result, we decide not to sell a property previously classified as held for sale, we will reclassify the property as held for investment. We measure and record a property that is reclassified as held for investment at the lower of (i) its carrying value before the property was classified as held for sale, adjusted for any depreciation expense that would have been recognized had the property been continuously classified as held for investment or (ii) the estimated fair value at the date of the subsequent decision not to sell.

 properties owned by industrial partnerships. These properties, which were subsequently sold during the year ended December 31, 2022, were accounted for under the equity method and considered unconsolidated entities. During our ownership of those properties and when circumstances indicated that a decrease in the value of an equity method investment had occurred that was other than temporary, we recognized an impairment loss, which required significant judgment. To determine whether the impairment loss was other-than-temporary, we considered whether it had the ability and intent to hold the investment until the carrying value was fully recovered. We evaluated the impairment of our investment in unconsolidated entities in accordance with accounting standards for equity investments by first reviewing each investment for indicators of impairment. If indicators were present, we estimated the fair value of the investments. If the carrying value of the investment was greater than the estimated fair value, we made an assessment of whether the impairment was temporary or other-than-temporary. In making this assessment, we considered the length of time and the extent to which fair value had been less than cost, the financial condition and near-term prospects of the entity, and our intent and ability to retain the interest long enough for a recovery in market value. The investment was reduced to its estimated fair value if conclusions indicated the impairment was other than temporary. For further details, see note 5, Investments in Real Estate.

Pursuant to the terms of the Merger Agreement, (i) one of the newly formed subsidiaries of us agreed to merge with and into VEREIT OP, with VEREIT OP as the surviving entity, which we refer to as the Partnership Merger, and (ii) immediately thereafter, VEREIT agreed to merge with and into the other newly formed subsidiary of us, with our subsidiary as the surviving corporation, which we refer to collectively as the merger. 
 The primary reason for the Merger was to expand our size, scale and diversification, in order to further enhance our competitive advantages and accelerate our investment activities. 
 On November 1, 2021, we completed our acquisition of VEREIT, and the merger was consummated.

 The initial assessment of fair value provided in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2021 was preliminary and was based on information that was available to management at the time the consolidated financial statements were prepared. Measurement period adjustments were recorded during the year ended December 31, 2022 in the period in which they were determined, as if they had been completed at the acquisition date. Before the first anniversary of the merger date, final measurement period adjustments, as reflected in the table above, resulted in a net increase of million to goodwill from the initial valuation, reflecting a decrease of million in land, million in building, million in lease intangible assets, million in investment in unconsolidated entities, million in other assets, offset by decrease of million in lease intangible liabilities, million in other liabilities and million in mortgages payable. 
 Approximately billion was allocated to goodwill. Goodwill represents the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of the net tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed. The recognized goodwill was attributable to expected synergies and benefits arising from the merger transaction, including anticipated financing and overhead cost savings, potential economies of scale benefits in both customer and vendor relationships and the

 B. Merger and Integration-Related Costs In conjunction with our merger with VEREIT, we incurred merger-related transaction costs of million and million for the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. Merger and integration-related costs consist of advisory fees, attorney fees, accountant fees, SEC filing fees and additional incremental and non-recurring costs necessary to convert data and systems, retain employees and otherwise enable us to operate the acquired business or assets efficiently. 
 C. Unaudited Pro Forma Financial Information 
 Our consolidated results of operations for the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, include billion and million of revenues, respectively, and million and million of net income associated with the results of operations of VEREIT OP, respectively. 
 Net income Basic and diluted earnings per share 
 
 The unaudited pro forma financial information above includes the following nonrecurring significant adjustment made to account for certain costs incurred as if our merger with VEREIT had been completed on January 1, 2020: merger and integration-related costs of million were excluded within the pro forma financial information for 2021, but included for 2020. 
 Orion Divestiture 
 Following of the closing of our merger with VEREIT, we contributed office real estate assets, a consolidated real estate venture holding office asset, and an unconsolidated real estate venture holding office assets to a wholly owned subsidiary named Orion. On November 12, 2021, we distributed the outstanding shares of Orion common stock to our shareholders (including legacy VEREIT stockholders who received shares of our common stock in our merger with VEREIT) on a pro rata basis at a rate of share of Orion common stock for every ten shares of Realty Income common stock held on November 12, 2021, the applicable record date, which we refer to as the Orion Divestiture. The fair market value of these shares for tax distribution was determined to be per share, which was calculated using the five-day volume weighted average share price after issuance. For more detail, see note 14, Distributions Paid and Payable . Following the Orion Divestiture, Orion began operating as a separate, independent public company. 
 In conjunction with the Orion Divestiture, we incurred approximately million of transaction costs during the year ended December 31, 2021, which were included in the million of merger and integration-related costs within our consolidated statements of income and comprehensive income. We incurred million of transaction costs relating to the Orion Divestiture during the year ended December 31, 2022. 
 As part of the Orion Divestiture, Orion paid us a dividend of million and reimbursed million to us for the early redemption of mortgage loans underlying the contributed assets prior to the effectuation of the Orion Divestiture. The distribution of Orion resulted in the derecognition of net assets of billion, which net of the aforementioned cash payments of million, resulted in a reduction to additional paid in capital of billion.

 (1) The initial weighted average cash lease yield for a property is generally computed as estimated contractual first year cash net operating income, which, in the case of a net leased property, is equal to the aggregate cash base rent for the first full year of each lease, divided by the total cost of the property. Since it is possible that a client could default on the payment of contractual rent, we cannot provide assurance that the actual return on the funds invested will remain at the percentages listed above. Contractual net operating income used in the calculation of initial weighted average cash yield includes approximately million received as settlement credits as reimbursement of free rent periods for the year ended December 31, 2022. 
 In the case of a property under development or expansion, the contractual lease rate is generally fixed such that rent varies based on the actual total investment in order to provide a fixed rate of return. When the lease does not provide for a fixed rate of return on a property under development or expansion, the initial weighted average cash lease yield is computed as follows: estimated cash net operating income (determined by the lease) for the first full year of each lease, divided by our projected total investment in the property, including land, construction and capitalized interest costs.

 (1) Our ownership interest reflects legal ownership interest. Legal ownership may, at times, not equal our economic interest in the listed properties because of various provisions in certain entity agreements regarding capital contributions, distributions of cash flow based on capital account balances, allocations of profits and losses and payments of preferred returns. As a result, our actual economic interest (as distinct from its legal ownership interest) in certain of the properties could fluctuate from time to time and may not wholly align with legal ownership interests. 
 (2) All assets held by our industrial partnerships were sold during the year ended December 31, 2022.

 (1) In connection with our merger with VEREIT, we completed our debt exchange offer to exchange all outstanding notes issued by VEREIT OP on November 9, 2021 for notes of identical terms issued by Realty Income, pursuant to which approximately of the outstanding notes issued by VEREIT OP were exchanged. We issued principal amount of Realty Notes for each validly tendered VEREIT Notes with principal amount. For this reason, we denote our Price of par value as . Prior to the completion of our merger with VEREIT on November 1, 2021, these notes were not the obligation of Realty Income. With respect to the notes originally issued by VEREIT OP that remained outstanding, we amended the indenture governing such notes to, among other things, eliminate substantially all of the restrictive covenants in such indenture. 
 
 To induce holders of the VEREIT OP notes to participate in the exchange, Realty Income offered noteholders electing to exchange their notes a cash payment equal to basis points of the note principal amount held. This resulted in a cash payment of million to participating noteholders. The exchange was accounted for as a modification of the existing VEREIT OP notes assumed in our merger with VEREIT. With respect to the notes originally issued by VEREIT OP that remained outstanding, we amended the indenture governing such notes to, among other things, eliminate substantially all of the restrictive covenants in such indenture. 
 
 (2) In July 2020, we issued million of senior unsecured notes due January 2031 (the "2031 Notes"), which constituted a further issuance of, and formed a single series with, the million of 2031 Notes issued in May 2020. 
 
 The proceeds from each of these offerings were used to repay borrowings outstanding under our credit facility, to fund investment opportunities, and for other general corporate purposes. 
 In January 2023, we issued million of senior unsecured notes due January 2026 and million of senior unsecured notes due March 2030. See note 19, Subsequent Events for further details.

 B. Issuances of Common Stock in Underwritten Public Offerings 
 In July 2021, we issued shares of common stock, including shares purchased by the underwriters upon the exercise of their option to purchase additional shares. After deducting underwriting discounts of million, the net proceeds of million were primarily used to repay borrowings under our commercial paper programs, to fund potential investment opportunities and for other general corporate purposes. 
 In January 2021, we issued shares of common stock, including shares purchased by the underwriters upon the exercise of their option to purchase additional shares. After deducting underwriting discounts of million, the net proceeds of million were used to fund property acquisitions, for general corporate purposes and working capital. 
 In March 2020, we issued shares of common stock, including shares purchased by the underwriters upon the exercise of their option to purchase additional shares. The net proceeds of million were used to repay borrowings under our credit facility, to fund investment opportunities, and for other general corporate purposes. 
 There were comparative offerings during the year ended December 31, 2022. 
 C. At-the-Market ("ATM") Program 
 In June 2022, we replaced our prior ATM program, which authorized us to offer and sell up to shares of common stock, with a new "at-the-market" equity distribution program, or our ATM program, pursuant to which we may offer and sell up to shares of common stock (1) by us to, or through, a consortium of banks acting as our sales agents or (2) by a consortium of banks acting as forward sellers on behalf of any forward purchasers contemplated thereunder, in each case by means of ordinary brokers' transactions on the NYSE under the ticker symbol "O" at prevailing market prices or at negotiated prices. After deducting shares sold pursuant to forward sale confirmations that remained open at December 31, 2022, we had additional shares remaining for future issuance under our ATM program. We anticipate maintaining the availability of our ATM program in the future, including the replenishment of authorized shares issuable thereunder.

 (1) During the year ended December 31, 2022, shares were sold and settled pursuant to forward sale confirmations. In addition, as of December 31, 2022, shares of common stock subject to forward sale confirmations have been executed at a weighted average initial price of per share but not settled. Upon settlement, subject to certain exceptions, we may elect, in our sole discretion, to cash settle or net share settle all or any portion of our obligations under any forward sale agreement, in which cases we may not receive any proceeds (in the case of cash settlement) or will not receive any proceeds (in the case of net share settlement), and we may owe cash (in the case of cash settlement) or shares of our common stock (in the case of net share settlement) to the relevant forward purchaser. We currently expect to fully physically settle any forward sale agreement with the respective forward purchaser on one or more dates specified by us on or prior to the maturity date of such forward sale agreement, in which case we expect to receive aggregate net cash proceeds at settlement equal to the number of shares specified in such forward sale agreement multiplied by the relevant forward price per share. We currently expect to fully settle the outstanding forward sale agreements during the three months ended March 31, 2023, representing billion in net proceeds, for which the weighted average forward price at December 31, 2022 was per share. Our forward sale confirmations are accounted for as equity instruments, as we have determined the agreements meet the derivatives and hedging guidance scope exception. shares were sold pursuant to forward sale confirmations during years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020. 
 
 D. Dividend Reinvestment and Stock Purchase Plan ("DRSPP") 
 Our DRSPP, provides our common stockholders, as well as new investors, with a convenient and economical method of purchasing our common stock and reinvesting their distributions. Our DRSPP also allows our current stockholders to buy additional shares of common stock by reinvesting all or a portion of their distributions. Our DRSPP authorizes up to common shares to be issued. At December 31, 2022, we had shares remaining for future issuance under our DRSPP program. 
 Gross proceeds 
 Our DRSPP includes a waiver approval process, allowing larger investors or institutions, per a formal approval process, to purchase shares at a small discount, if approved by us. We did t issue shares under the waiver approval process during the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021 or 2020.

due to the Orion Divestiture, subject to certain exceptions. Prior to the Orion Divestiture, the conversion ratio was one to one. These issuances with redemption provisions that permit the issuer to settle in either cash or common stock, at the option of the issuer, were evaluated to determine whether temporary or permanent equity classification on the balance sheet was appropriate. We determined that the units meet the requirements to qualify for presentation as permanent equity. 
 In May 2021 and December 2020, we completed the respective acquisition of a development property by acquiring a controlling interest in a joint venture. We are the managing member of these joint ventures, and possess the ability to control the business and manage the affairs of these entities.

 The estimated fair values of our mortgages payable assumed in connection with acquisitions and private senior notes payable have been calculated by discounting the future cash flows using an interest rate based upon the relevant forward interest rate curve, plus an applicable credit-adjusted spread. Because this methodology includes unobservable inputs that reflect our own internal assumptions and calculations, the measurement of estimated fair values related to our mortgages payable is categorized as level three on the three-level valuation hierarchy. 
 The estimated fair values of our publicly-traded senior notes and bonds payable are based upon indicative market prices and recent trading activity of our senior notes and bonds payable. Because this methodology includes inputs that are less observable by the public and are not necessarily reflected in active markets, the measurement of the estimated fair values related to our notes and bonds payable is categorized as level two on the three-level valuation hierarchy.

 Derivative Designated as Hedging Instruments 
 In order to hedge the foreign currency risk associated with interest payments on intercompany loans denominated in British Pound Sterling ("GBP") and Euros, we have a hedging strategy to enter into foreign currency forward contracts to sell GBP, USD, and Euro and buy Euro, USD, and GBP. These foreign currency forwards are designated as cash flow hedges. Forward points on the forward contracts are included in the assessment of hedge effectiveness. Amounts reported in other comprehensive income (loss) related to foreign currency derivative contracts will be reclassified to other gain and (loss) in the same period during which the hedged forecasted transactions affect earnings.

cross-currency swaps to exchange million for million maturing in May 2034, in order to hedge the foreign currency risk associated with our Sterling-denominated intercompany loan receivable from our consolidated foreign subsidiaries. These cross-currency swaps were designated as cash flow hedges on their trade date. In June 2022, following the early prepayment of our Sterling-denominated intercompany loan receivable from our consolidated foreign subsidiaries, we terminated the cross-currency swaps used to hedge the foreign currency exposure of the intercompany loan. As the hedge relationship was terminated and the future principal and interest associated with the prepaid intercompany loan did not occur, a million gain was reclassified from AOCI to 'Foreign currency and derivative (loss) gain, net' during the three months ended June 30, 2022. 
 In October 2022, we entered into cross-currency swaps to exchange million for million maturing in October 2032, in order to hedge the foreign currency risk associated with our Euro-denominated intercompany loans receivable from our consolidated foreign subsidiaries. We designated of the cross-currency swaps, exchanging million for million, as fair value hedges of foreign denominated intercompany loans receivable (the "hedged assets"). The hedged assets are eliminated in consolidation, but remeasurement gains and losses pertaining to the hedged assets impact earnings as part of 'Foreign currency and derivative (loss) gain, net'. For these hedges, we have elected to exclude the change in fair value of the cross-currency swaps related to both time value and cross currency basis spread from the assessment of hedge effectiveness (the "excluded component"). Changes in the fair value of the cross-currency swaps attributable to changes in the spot rates on the final notional exchanges and changes in the value of the hedged assets due to changes in the spot rates are recorded in 'Foreign currency and derivative (loss) gain, net'. Changes in the fair value of the cross-currency swaps attributable to the excluded components are recorded to Other comprehensive income and will be recognized in Foreign currency and derivative (loss) gain, net on a systematic and rational basis, as net cash settlements and interest accruals on the respective cross currency swaps occur, over the remaining life of the hedging instruments. 
 In February 2020, we entered into forward starting treasury rate locks with notional amounts totaling million. The treasury rate locks were entered into to hedge our exposure to the changes in the 10-year US treasury rates in anticipation of potential future debt offerings during the first half of 2020. The treasury rate locks were designated as cash flow hedges, with any changes in fair value recorded in AOCI. Upon the initial issuance of the 2031 Notes in May 2020, we amortized the AOCI balance over the term of the 2031 Notes. In June 2020, all treasury rate locks were terminated and we entered into forward starting interest rate swaps with notional amounts totaling million in a cashless settlement of the terminated treasury rate locks. The forward starting swaps were entered into to hedge our exposure to the changes in the 3-month USD-LIBOR swap rate in anticipation of potential future debt offerings through a current estimated range ending in 2023. The forward starting swaps are designated as cash flow hedges, with any changes in fair value recorded in AOCI. Upon issuance of the 2031 Notes during July 2020, the AOCI balance associated with of the forward starting swaps with a notional amount of million we amortized over the term of the notes. However, we elected not to terminate the forward starting interest rate swaps, and redesignated the swaps in a new hedging relationship for a future debt issuance to hedge our exposure to the changes in the 10-year US treasury rates in anticipation of potential future debt offerings between May 2020 and December 2023. Upon the December 2020 issuance of million of notes due March 2026 and million of notes due March 2033, the AOCI balance associated with of the forward starting swaps with a notional amount of million began amortizing over the term. The AOCI balance being amortized represents the change in fair value on swaps with a notional amount of million from the July issuance of the 2031 notes through the December note issuances and the change in fair value from the remaining forward starting swaps with a notional amount of million from their June 2020 inception through the December note issuances. The notional amounts of the swaps were first applied to the million of notes due March 2033, with the remaining million of notional applied to the million of notes due March 2026. In connection with our October 2022 offering of million of unsecured notes, due October 13, 2032, we terminated the forward starting interest rate swaps. Upon the issuance of the October 2022 offering, the change in fair value on the forward starting interest rate swaps with notional amounts totaling million is being amortized through the AOCI balance through the term of the notes. 
 As of December 31, 2022, we had interest rate swap in place on our million unsecured term loan. Our objective in using derivatives is to add stability to interest expense and to manage our exposure to interest rate movements. We designated this interest rate swap as a cash flow hedge in accordance with Topic 815, Derivatives and Hedging . This interest rate swap is recorded on the consolidated balances sheets at fair value. Changes to fair value are recorded to accumulated other comprehensive income (loss), or AOCI, and subsequently reclassified into interest expense in the same periods during which the hedged transaction affects earnings.

The converted awards issued by Realty Income have identical terms to the original VEREIT, Inc. award grant. On November 1, 2021, we issued shares of Realty Income common stock in settlement of equity awards that vested upon the separation of certain former-VEREIT employees and directors in connection with the merger.

The following disclosures are inclusive of converted awards for former VEREIT employees continuing as employees of Realty Income, which are reflected as grants, as the replacement awards represent newly issued awards settled in Realty Income common shares. 
 In connection with the Orion Divestiture, each stock option, restricted stock unit and performance award outstanding at November 12, 2021 was entitled to an equitable adjustment equal to the ratio of the five-day volume weighted average per-share price of Realty Income common stock prior to the Orion Divestiture divided by the five-day volume weighted average per-share of Realty Income common stock following the Orion Divestiture, resulting in an adjustment factor of approximately . The equitable adjustment was considered a modification in accordance with the provisions of ASC 718, Compensation-Stock Compensation . As a result, we compared the fair value of each award immediately prior to the equitable adjustment to the fair value immediately after the equitable adjustment to measure incremental compensation cost, if any. The equitable adjustment did not result in any incremental fair value. Therefore, no stock-based compensation expense was recorded as of result of the modification. The following disclosures are inclusive of these adjustments, which has been labeled 'Equitable adjustment - Orion Divestiture' throughout.

Item 9: Changes In and Disagreements With Accountants on Accounting and Financial Disclosure 
 We have had no disagreements with our independent registered public accounting firm on accounting matters or financial disclosure, nor have we changed accountants in the two most recent fiscal years. 
 
 Item 9A: Controls and Procedures 
 Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures 
 We maintain disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended) that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in our Exchange Act reports is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the Securities and Exchange Commission s rules and forms, and that such information is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. In designing and evaluating the disclosure controls and procedures, management recognizes that any controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving the desired control objectives, and management necessarily was required to apply its judgment in evaluating the cost-benefit relationship of possible controls and procedures. 
 As of and for the quarter ended December 31, 2022, we carried out an evaluation of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures, under the supervision and with the participation of management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer. 
 Based on the foregoing, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that as of December 31, 2022 our disclosure controls and procedures were effective and were operating at a reasonable assurance level. 
 Management s Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting 
 Internal control over financial reporting refers to the process designed by, or under the supervision of, our Chief Executive Officer, Chief Financial Officer, and effected by our Board of Directors, management and other personnel, to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and includes those policies and procedures that: 
 (1) Pertain to the maintenance of records that in reasonable detail accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the Company; 
 (2) Provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the Company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the Company; and 
 (3) Provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of the Company s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements. 
 Management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting for the Company. 
 Management has used the framework set forth in the report entitled Internal Control--Integrated Framework (2013) published by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission to evaluate the effectiveness of the Company s internal control over financial reporting. Management has concluded that the Company s internal control over financial reporting was effective as of the end of the most recent fiscal year. KPMG LLP has issued an attestation report on the effectiveness of the Company s internal control over financial reporting.

Changes in Internal Controls 
 As a result of our merger with VEREIT in November 2021, we were operating two separate enterprise resource planning (ERP) systems to generate our financial statements. During the three months ended June 30, 2022, we integrated these two ERP platforms into one primary system. We have updated our internal controls over financial reporting, as necessary, to accommodate modifications to our business processes for the integration of these parallel ERP systems into a central platform. Except as described above, there have been no changes in our internal control over financial reporting that occurred during the quarter ended December 31, 2022, that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting. 
 Limitations on the Effectiveness of Controls 
 Internal control over financial reporting cannot provide absolute assurance of achieving financial reporting objectives because of its inherent limitations. Internal control over financial reporting is a process that involves human diligence and compliance and is subject to lapses in judgment and breakdowns resulting from human failures. Internal control over financial reporting also can be circumvented by collusion or improper management override. Because of such limitations, there is a risk that material misstatements may not be prevented or detected on a timely basis by internal control over financial reporting. However, these inherent limitations are known features of the financial reporting process. Therefore, it is possible to design into the process safeguards to reduce, though not eliminate, this risk.

Exhibit 4.59 
 DESCRIPTION OF SECURITIES 
 As of December 31, 2022, Realty Income Corporation, a Maryland corporation Realty Income, we, us, and the Company ), had six classes of securities registered under Section 12 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the Exchange Act (i) our common stock, 0.01 par value per share common stock (ii) our 1.125 Notes due 2027 (the July 2027 notes (iii) our 1.875 Notes due 2027 (the January 2027 notes (iv) our 1.625 Notes due 2030 (the 2030 notes (v) our 1.750 Notes due 2033 (the 2033 notes and (vi) our 2.500 Notes due 2042 (the 2042 notes , together with the July 2027 notes, January 2027 notes, 2030 notes, and 2033 notes, the notes ). Our common stock and notes are listed on The New York Stock Exchange NYSE under the ticker symbols O, O27A, O27B, O30, O33A, and O42, respectively . 
 DESCRIPTION OF COMMON STOCK 
 The following description of some of the terms of the common stock, our charter (as amended or restated from time to time, the charter and our amended and restated bylaws (as further amended or restated from time to time, the bylaws ), and the Maryland General Corporation Law (the MGCL does not purport to be complete and is subject to and qualified in its entirety by reference to the MGCL and our charter and the bylaws. Copies of our most recent charter and bylaws, and any subsequent amendments thereto, have been filed or incorporated by reference as exhibits to our most recent Annual Report on Form 10-K or a subsequent Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q or Current Report on Form 8-K filed by us with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the SEC ). You may obtain copies of any of those documents by visiting the SEC website at http www.sec.gov. 
 General 
 We have authority to issue 1,300,000,000 shares of our common stock and 69,900,000 shares of preferred stock, 0.01 par value per share preferred stock ). 
 Common Stock 
 Subject to the preferential rights of any other class or series of our stock and to the provisions of our charter regarding the restrictions on ownership and transfer of stock, holders of our common stock are entitled to receive dividends when, as and if authorized by our board of directors and declared by us out of assets legally available therefor. The terms of any preferred stock we may issue in the future may provide for restrictions or prohibitions on the payment of dividends on, and the purchase of, our common stock and may also provide for holders of that class or series of preferred stock to receive preferential distributions in the event of our liquidation, dissolution or winding up before any payments may be made on our common stock. 
 For information concerning any class or series of our preferred stock that may be outstanding from time to time, see the articles supplementary classifying and designating the shares of such class or series of preferred stock, which have been or will be, as the case may be, filed or incorporated by reference as an exhibit to our most recent Annual Report on Form 10-K or a subsequent Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q or Current Report on Form 8-K filed by us with the SEC, and the description of any such class or series of our preferred stock contained in the applicable Registration Statement on Form 8-A, including any amendments and reports filed for the purpose of updating such description, which have been or will be filed by us with the SEC. You may obtain copies of any of these documents by visiting the SEC's website at http www.sec.gov. 
 Our charter authorizes our board of directors to classify and reclassify any unissued shares of our common stock or preferred stock into other classes or series of stock and to establish the number of shares in each class or series and to set the terms, preferences, conversion and other rights, voting powers, restrictions, limitations as to dividends or other distributions, qualifications or terms or conditions of redemption for each such class or series. Thus, the board of directors could cause the issuance of shares of preferred stock with dividend rights, rights to distributions in the event of our liquidation, dissolution or winding up, voting rights or other rights that could adversely affect the rights of holders of our common stock or delay or prevent a tender offer or change of control of the Company that might involve a premium price for shares of our common stock or otherwise be in their best interests, any of which could adversely affect the market price of our common stock. 
 Subject to the provisions of our charter regarding the restrictions on ownership and transfer of our common stock (see Restrictions on Ownership and Transfers of Stock below), each outstanding share of our common stock 
 1 

entitles the holder to one vote on all matters submitted to a vote of stockholders, including the election of directors (other than any directors to be elected exclusively by holders of our outstanding preferred stock or any other class or series of our stock). Except as provided with respect to any other class or series of stock, the holders of shares of our common stock will possess the exclusive voting power. 
 Holders of our common stock do not have cumulative voting rights in the election of directors, which means that holders of more than 50 of all the shares of our common stock voting for the election of directors can elect all the directors standing for election (other than any directors to be elected exclusively by holders of our outstanding preferred stock or any other class or series of our stock) at the time if they choose to do so, and the holders of the remaining shares of our common stock cannot elect any such directors. All of our directors currently serve for a term ending at the next annual meeting of stockholders and when his or her successor is duly elected and qualifies. Holders of shares of common stock do not have preemptive rights, which means they have no right under the charter, bylaws, or Maryland law to acquire any additional shares of common stock that may be issued by us at a subsequent date. Holders of shares of common stock have no preference, conversion, exchange, sinking fund or redemption rights. Under Maryland law, stockholders generally are not liable for the corporation s debts or obligations. 
 Under the MGCL, a Maryland corporation generally cannot dissolve, amend its charter, merge, convert into another entity, sell all or substantially all of its assets, engage in a share exchange or engage in similar transactions outside the ordinary course of business unless approved by its stockholders by the affirmative vote of two-thirds of the votes entitled to be cast on the matter unless a lesser percentage (but not less than a majority of all of the votes entitled to be cast on the matter) is set forth in the corporation s charter. Our charter provides that any such action shall be effective if approved by the affirmative vote of holders of shares entitled to cast a majority of all the votes entitled to be cast on the matter. Because the term substantially all of a corporation s assets is not defined in the MGCL, it is subject to Maryland common law and to judicial interpretation and review in the context of the unique facts and circumstances of any particular transaction. Accordingly, there may be uncertainty as to whether a sale of substantially all of our assets has taken place within the meaning of the MGCL provisions described above. 
 Restrictions on Ownership and Transfers of Stock 
 To maintain our status as a real estate investment trust (a REIT under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the Code ), no more than 50 in value of our outstanding shares of stock may be owned, actually or constructively, by or for five or fewer individuals (as defined in the Code to include certain entities) during the last half of a taxable year. In addition, if we, or an owner of 10 or more of our stock, actually or constructively owns 10 or more of a tenant of ours (or a tenant of any partnership or limited liability company that is treated as a partnership for federal income tax purposes in which we are a partner or member), the rent received by us (either directly or through one or more subsidiaries) from that tenant will not be qualifying income for purposes of the REIT gross income tests of the Code. A REIT s stock must also be beneficially owned by 100 or more persons during at least 335 days of a taxable year of twelve months or during a proportionate part of a shorter taxable year. 
 Because we expect to continue to qualify as a REIT, our charter contains restrictions on the ownership and transfer of our common stock which, among other purposes, are intended to assist us in complying with applicable Code requirements. Our charter provides that, subject to certain specified exceptions, no person or entity may own, or be deemed to own by virtue of the applicable constructive ownership provisions of the Code, more than 9.8 (by value or by number of shares, whichever is more restrictive) of our outstanding shares of common stock. We refer to this restriction as the ownership limit. The constructive ownership rules of the Code are complex, and may cause shares of common stock owned actually or constructively by a group of related individuals and or entities to be constructively owned by one individual or entity. As a result, the acquisition of less than 9.8 of the shares of our common stock (or the acquisition of an interest in an entity that owns, actually or constructively, shares of our common stock) by an individual or entity, could nevertheless cause that individual or entity, or another individual or entity, to constructively own more than 9.8 of our outstanding shares of common stock and thus violate the ownership limit, or any other limit as provided in our charter or as otherwise permitted by our board of directors. Our board of directors may, but in no event is required to, exempt from the ownership limit a particular stockholder if it determines that such ownership will not jeopardize our status as a REIT. As a condition of such exemption, the board of directors may require a ruling from the Internal Revenue Service or an opinion of counsel satisfactory to it and or undertakings or representations from the applicant with respect to preserving our REIT status. 
 Our charter further prohibits (1) any person from actually or constructively owning shares of our common stock that would result in our being closely held under Section 856(h) of the Code or otherwise cause us to fail to qualify as a REIT, and (2) any person from transferring shares of our common stock if such transfer would result in 
 2 

shares of our capital stock being beneficially owned by fewer than 100 persons (determined without reference to any rules of attribution). 
 Any person who acquires or attempts to acquire actual or constructive ownership of shares of our common stock that would violate any of the foregoing restrictions on transferability and ownership is required to give written notice to us immediately and provide us with such other information as we may request in order to determine the effect of such transfer on our status as a REIT. The foregoing restrictions on transferability and ownership will not apply if our board of directors determines that it is no longer in our best interest to attempt to qualify, or to continue to qualify, as a REIT and such determination is approved by the affirmative vote of holders of not less than two-thirds of all votes entitled to be cast on the matter, as required by our charter. Except as otherwise described above, any change in the ownership limit would require an amendment to our charter. We anticipate that any class or series of preferred stock that we issue in the future will be subject to similar restrictions. 
 Pursuant to our charter, if any purported transfer of common stock or any other event would result in any person violating the ownership limit or such other limit as provided in our charter, or as otherwise permitted by our board of directors, or result in our being closely held under Section 856(h) of the Code, or otherwise cause us to fail to qualify as a REIT, then the number of shares that would otherwise cause such violation or result (rounded up to the nearest whole share) will be transferred automatically to a trust, the beneficiary of which will be a qualified charitable organization selected by us. Such automatic transfer shall be deemed to be effective as of the close of business on the business day prior to the date of such violative transfer. 
 Within 20 days of receiving notice from us of the transfer of shares to the trust, the trustee of the trust (who shall be designated by us and be unaffiliated with us and any prohibited transferee or prohibited owner) will be required to sell such shares to a person or entity who could own the shares without violating the ownership limit, or any other limit as provided in our charter or as otherwise permitted by our board of directors, and distribute to the prohibited transferee or prohibited owner, as applicable, an amount equal to the lesser of (1) the price paid by the prohibited transferee or prohibited owner for such shares or (2) the net sales proceeds received by the trust for such shares. In the case of any event other than a transfer, or in the case of a transfer for no consideration (such as a gift), the trustee will be required to sell such shares to a qualified person or entity and distribute to the prohibited owner an amount equal to the lesser of (1) the market price (determined as provided in our charter) of such shares as of the date of the event resulting in the transfer or (2) the net sales proceeds received by the trust for such shares. In either case, any proceeds in excess of the amount distributable to the prohibited transferee or prohibited owner, as applicable, will be distributed to the beneficiary. Prior to a sale of any such shares by the trust, the trustee will be entitled to receive, in trust for the beneficiary, all dividends and other distributions paid by us with respect to such shares, and also will be entitled to exercise all voting rights with respect to such shares. 
 Subject to Maryland law, effective as of the date that such shares have been transferred to the trust, the trustee shall have the authority (at the trustee s sole discretion) (1) to rescind as void any vote cast by a prohibited transferee or prohibited owner, as applicable, prior to the discovery by us that such shares have been transferred to the trust and (2) to recast such vote in accordance with the desires of the trustee acting for the benefit of the beneficiary. However, if we have already taken irreversible corporate action, then the trustee shall not have the authority to rescind and recast that vote. Any dividend or other distribution paid to the prohibited transferee or prohibited owner prior to the discovery by us that such shares had been automatically transferred to a trust as described above will be required to be repaid to the trustee upon demand for distribution to the beneficiary. In the event that the transfer to the trust as described above is not automatically effective (for any reason) to prevent violation of the ownership limit or any other limit as provided in our charter or as otherwise permitted by our board of directors, then, per our charter, the transfer of such shares will be void. 
 In addition, shares of our common stock held in the trust shall be deemed to have been offered for sale to us, or our designee, at a price per share equal to the lesser of (1) the price per share in the transaction that resulted in such transfer to the trust (or, in the case of a devise or gift, the market price at the time of such devise or gift) and (2) the market price on the date we, or our designee, accept such offer. We shall have the right to accept such offer until the trustee has sold the shares of common stock held in the trust. Upon such a sale to us, the interest of the beneficiary in the shares sold shall terminate and the trustee shall distribute the net proceeds of the sale to the prohibited transferee or prohibited owner, and any dividends or other distributions held by the trustee with respect to such shares will be paid to the beneficiary. 
 If any purported transfer of shares of common stock would cause us to be beneficially owned by fewer than 100 persons, such transfer will be null and void in its entirety and the intended transferee will acquire no rights to the stock.

All certificates representing shares of our common stock will bear a legend referring to the restrictions described above. The foregoing ownership limitations could delay, defer or prevent a transaction or a change in control of the Company that might involve a premium price for our common stock or otherwise be in the best interests of stockholders. 
 As set forth in the U.S. Treasury (the Treasury regulations promulgated under the Code, every owner of a specified percentage (or more) of the outstanding shares of our stock (including both common stock and preferred stock) must file a completed questionnaire with us containing information regarding their ownership of such shares. Under current Treasury regulations, the percentage will be set between 0.5 and 5.0 , depending upon the number of record holders of our shares of stock. Under our charter, each common stockholder shall upon demand be required to disclose to us in writing such information as we may request, in good faith, in order to determine the effect, if any, of such common stockholder s actual and constructive ownership of common stock on our status as a REIT and to ensure compliance with the ownership limit, or any other limit as provided in our charter or as otherwise permitted by our board of directors. 
 The transfer restrictions and limitations described above could delay or prevent a tender offer or change in control of the Company or reduce the possibility that a third party will attempt such a transaction, even if a tender offer or a change in control were in our stockholders best interests or involved a premium price for our stock, which could adversely affect the market price of our common stock or any class or series of our preferred stock. 
 Election and Removal of Directors 
 Our charter and bylaws provide that our board of directors may establish the number of directors of the Company as long as the number is not fewer than the minimum number required under the MGCL, which is one, nor, unless our bylaws are amended, more than 15. 
 Pursuant to our charter, each of our directors is elected by our stockholders to serve until the next annual meeting following his or her election and until his or her successor is duly elected and qualifies. 
 Pursuant to our bylaws, directors in uncontested elections are elected upon the affirmative vote of a majority of the total votes cast for and against such nominee at a duly called meeting of stockholders, and directors in contested elections are elected by the affirmative vote of a plurality of the votes cast. In both uncontested and contested elections, holders of shares of our common stock have no right to cumulative voting in the election of directors. Consequently, at each annual meeting of stockholders, the holders of a majority of the shares of our common stock will be able to elect all of our directors. 
 Under the MGCL and our bylaws, except as otherwise provided in the terms of any class or series of our stock, vacancies on our board of directors created by any reason other than an increase in the number of directors may be filled by a majority of the remaining directors, even if the remaining directors do not constitute a quorum, and any vacancy in the number of directors created by an increase in the number of directors may be filled by a majority vote of the entire board. Any individual elected to fill a vacancy will serve until the next annual meeting of stockholders and until his or her successor is duly elected and qualifies. 
 Our charter provides that, subject to the rights of holders of shares of one or more classes or series of preferred stock to elect or remove one or more directors, a director may be removed only for cause and by the affirmative vote of stockholders entitled to cast a majority of the votes entitled to be cast generally in the election of directors. 
 Amendment to Charter and Bylaws 
 Except as provided in the MGCL, amendments to our charter must be advised by our board of directors and approved by the affirmative vote of our stockholders entitled to cast a majority of all of the votes entitled to be cast on the matter. Our board of directors generally has the power to amend our bylaws provided, that, amendments to certain provisions in our bylaws related to a written statement required to be furnished to stockholders in the event of certain distributions, our investment policy and restrictions, an annual report to stockholders and the definitions used in those sections of our bylaws must be approved by the affirmative vote of our stockholders entitled to cast a majority of all of the votes entitled to be cast on the matter. Additionally, stockholders may alter or repeal any provision of our bylaws and adopt new bylaw provisions with the approval by a majority of all votes entitled to be cast on the matter.

Maryland Business Combination Act 
 Under the MGCL, certain business combinations (including certain issuances of equity securities) between a Maryland corporation and any person who beneficially owns ten percent or more of the voting power of the corporation s outstanding voting stock, or an affiliate or associate of the corporation who beneficially owned ten percent or more of the voting power at any time within the preceding two years, in each case referred to as an interested stockholder, or an affiliate thereof, are prohibited for five years after the most recent date on which the interested stockholder becomes an interested stockholder. Thereafter, any such business combination must be approved by two super-majority stockholder votes unless, among other conditions, the corporation s common stockholders receive a minimum price (as defined in the MGCL) for their shares and the consideration is received in cash or in the same form as previously paid by the interested stockholder for its shares of common stock. The business combination provisions of the MGCL do not apply, however, to business combinations that are approved or exempted by the board of directors prior to the time that the interested stockholder becomes an interested stockholder. These provisions of the MGCL may delay, defer or prevent a transaction or a change of control of our Company that might involve a premium price for our common stock or any class or series of our preferred stock, or otherwise be in the best interests of our stockholders. 
 Maryland Control Share Acquisition Act 
 The MGCL provides that holders of control shares of a Maryland corporation acquired in a control share acquisition have no voting rights except to the extent approved by a vote of two-thirds of the votes entitled to be cast on the matter, excluding shares of stock owned by the acquirer, by officers of the corporation or by employees who are directors of the corporation. Control shares are voting shares of stock which, if aggregated with all other such shares of stock previously acquired by the acquiror or in respect of which the acquiror is able to exercise or direct the exercise of voting power (except solely by virtue of a revocable proxy), would entitle the acquiror to exercise voting power in electing directors within one of the following ranges of voting power (1) one-tenth or more but less than one-third, (2) one-third or more but less than a majority, or (3) a majority or more of all voting power. Control shares do not include shares the acquiring person is then entitled to vote as a result of having previously obtained stockholder approval. A control share acquisition means the acquisition of issued and outstanding control shares, subject to certain exceptions. 
 A person who has made or proposes to make a control share acquisition, upon satisfaction of certain conditions (including an undertaking to pay expenses), may compel the board of directors of the corporation to call a special meeting of stockholders to be held within 50 days of demand to consider the voting rights of the shares. If no request for a meeting is made, the corporation may itself present the question at any stockholders meeting. 
 If voting rights are not approved at the meeting or if the acquiring person does not deliver an acquiring person statement as required by the statute, then, subject to certain conditions and limitations, the corporation may redeem for fair value any and all of the control shares (except those for which voting rights have previously been approved). Fair value is determined, without regard to the absence of voting rights for the control shares, as of the date of the last control share acquisition by the acquiror or, if a meeting of stockholders is held at which the voting rights of such shares are considered and not approved, as of the date of the meeting. If voting rights for control shares are approved at a stockholders meeting and the acquiror becomes entitled to vote a majority of the shares entitled to vote, all other stockholders may exercise appraisal rights, meaning that they may require us to repurchase their shares for their appraised value as determined pursuant to the MGCL. The fair value of the shares as determined for purposes of such appraisal rights may not be less than the highest price per share paid by the acquiror in the control share acquisition. 
 The control share acquisition statute does not apply to (1) shares acquired in a merger, consolidation or share exchange if the corporation is a party to the transaction, or (2) acquisitions exempted by the charter or bylaws of the corporation, adopted at any time before the acquisition of the shares. 
 As permitted by the MGCL, our bylaws contain a provision exempting us from the control share acquisition statute. That bylaw provision states that the control share statute shall not apply to any acquisition by any person of shares of our stock. Our board of directors may, without the consent of any of our stockholders, amend or eliminate this bylaw provision at any time, which means that we would then become subject to the Maryland control share acquisition statute, and there can be no assurance that such provision will not be amended or eliminated by our board of directors at any time in the future. 
 Subtitle 8 
 Subtitle 8 of Title 3 of the MGCL permits a Maryland corporation with a class of equity securities registered under the Exchange Act, and at least three independent directors to elect, by provision in its charter or bylaws or a 
 5 

resolution of its board of directors and notwithstanding any contrary provision in the charter or bylaws, to be subject to any or all of five provisions, including 
 a classified board 
 a two-thirds vote requirement for removing a director 
 a requirement that the number of directors be fixed only by vote of the board of directors 
 a requirement that a vacancy on the board of directors be filled only by a vote of the remaining directors in office and for the remainder of the full term of the class of directors in which the vacancy occurred and until a successor is elected and qualifies and 
 a majority requirement for the calling of a stockholder-requested special meeting of stockholders. 
 We have not elected to be subject to any of the provisions of Subtitle 8, including the provisions that would permit us to classify our board of directors or increase the vote required to remove a director without stockholder approval. Through provisions in our charter and bylaws unrelated to Subtitle 8, we (1) vest in our board of directors the exclusive power to fix the number of directors and (2) require, unless called by our chairman, our chief executive officer, our president or our board of directors, the request of stockholders entitled to cast not less than a majority of all the votes entitled to be cast at the meeting to call a special meeting of stockholders. The provisions of Subtitle 8 expressly provide that Subtitle 8 does not limit the power of a Maryland corporation, by provision in its charter, to confer on the holders of any class or series of preferred stock the right to elect one or more directors or designate the terms and voting powers of directors, which may vary among directors. 
 Special Meetings of Stockholders 
 Pursuant to our bylaws, our chairman, our chief executive officer, our president or our board of directors may call a special meeting of our stockholders. Subject to the provisions of our bylaws, a special meeting of our stockholders to act on any matter that may properly be considered by our stockholders will also be called by our secretary upon the written request of stockholders entitled to cast not less than a majority of all the votes entitled to be cast at the meeting on such matter, accompanied by the information required by our bylaws. Our secretary will inform the requesting stockholders of the reasonably estimated cost of preparing and delivering the notice of meeting (including our proxy materials), and the requesting stockholder must pay such estimated cost before our secretary may prepare and deliver the notice of the special meeting. 
 Proxy Access 
 Our bylaws include provisions permitting, subject to certain eligibility, procedural and disclosure requirements, qualifying stockholders, or a qualifying group of no more than 20 stockholders, who have maintained continuous ownership of at least three percent of our outstanding shares of common stock for at least three years to require us to include in our proxy materials for an annual meeting of stockholders a number of director nominees not to exceed the greater of two nominees or 20 percent of the number of directors up for election. 
 Advance Notice of Director Nomination and New Business 
 Our bylaws provide that nominations of individuals for election as directors and proposals of business to be considered by stockholders at any annual meeting may be made only (1) pursuant to our notice of the meeting, (2) by or at the direction of our board of directors or (3) by any stockholder who was a stockholder of record as of the record date set by the board for the annual meeting, at the time of giving the notice required by our bylaws and at the time of the meeting, who is entitled to vote at the meeting in the election of each individual so nominated or on such other proposed business and who has complied with the advance notice procedures and, if applicable, the proxy access provisions, of our bylaws. Stockholders generally must provide notice to our secretary not earlier than the 150th day or later than 5 00 p.m., Pacific Time, on the 120th day before the first anniversary of the date our proxy statement was released for the preceding year s annual meeting. 
 Only the business specified in the notice of the meeting may be brought before a special meeting of our stockholders. Nominations of individuals for election as directors at a special meeting of stockholders may be made only (1) by or at the direction of our board of directors, (2) by a stockholder that has requested that a special meeting be called for the purpose of electing directors in compliance with our bylaws or (3) if the special meeting has been called in accordance with our bylaws for the purpose of electing directors, by a stockholder who is a stockholder of record as of the record date set by the board for the special meeting, at the time of giving the notice required by our bylaws and at the time of the special meeting, who is entitled to vote at the meeting in the election of each individual so nominated and who has complied with the advance notice procedures of our bylaws. Stockholders generally must provide notice to our secretary not earlier than the 120th day before such special 
 6 

meeting or later than 5 00 p.m., Pacific Time, on the later of the 90th day before the special meeting or the tenth day after the first public announcement of the date of the special meeting and the nominees of our board of directors to be elected at the meeting. 
 A stockholder s notice must contain certain information specified by our bylaws about the stockholder, its affiliates and any proposed business or nominee for election as a director, including information about the economic interest of the stockholder, its affiliates and any proposed nominee in us. 
 Effect of Certain Provisions of Maryland Law and our Charter and Bylaws 
 Our charter contains restrictions on ownership and transfer of our stock intended to, among other purposes, assist us in maintaining our status as a REIT for United States federal and or state income tax purposes. For example, our charter restricts any person or entity from acquiring actual or constructive ownership of more than 9.8 (by value or by number of shares, whichever is more restrictive) of our outstanding shares of common stock. See Restrictions on Ownership and Transfers of Stock . These restrictions could delay or prevent a tender offer or change in control of our Company or reduce the possibility that a third party will attempt such a transaction, even if a tender offer or a change of control were in our stockholders interests or involved a premium price for our common stock, which could adversely affect the market price of our common stock. 
 Our charter authorizes our board of directors to issue preferred stock of the Company, including convertible preferred stock, without stockholder approval. The board of directors may establish the terms, preferences, conversion or other rights, voting powers, restrictions, limitations as to dividends or other distributions, qualifications and terms or conditions of redemption of any class or series of preferred stock we may issue, which may include voting rights and rights to convert such preferred stock into common stock. The issuance of preferred stock could delay or prevent a tender offer or change in control of the Company or reduce the possibility that a third party will attempt such a transaction, even if a tender offer or a change of control were in our stockholders interests or involved a premium price for our common stock or any class or series of our preferred stock, which could adversely affect the market price of our common stock and any such class or series of preferred stock. 
 Our charter and bylaws also provide that the number of directors may be established only by our board of directors, which prevents our stockholders from increasing the number of our directors and filling any vacancies created by such increase with their own nominees. The provisions of our bylaws discussed above under the captions Special Meetings of Stockholders and Advance Notice of Director Nomination and New Business require stockholders seeking to call a special meeting, nominate an individual for election as a director or propose other business at an annual or special meeting to comply with certain notice and information requirements. These provisions, alone or in combination, could make it more difficult for our stockholders to remove incumbent directors or fill vacancies on our board of directors with their own nominees and could delay or prevent a proxy contest, tender offer or change in control of the Company or reduce the possibility that a third party will attempt such a contest or transaction, even if a proxy contest, tender offer or a change of control were in our stockholders interests or involved a premium price for our common stock or any class or series of our preferred stock, which could adversely affect the market price of our common stock and any such class or series of preferred stock. 
 Indemnification of Officers and Directors. 
 The MGCL permits a Maryland corporation to include in its charter a provision limiting the liability of its directors and officers to the corporation and its stockholders for money damages except for liability resulting from 
 actual receipt of an improper benefit or profit in money, property or services, or 
 active and deliberate dishonesty established by a final judgment as being material to the cause of action. 
 Our charter contains such a provision which eliminates such liability to the maximum extent permitted by the MGCL. 
 Our charter authorizes us, and our bylaws obligate us, to the maximum extent permitted by Maryland law, to indemnify and to pay or reimburse reasonable expenses in advance of final disposition of a proceeding to any present or former director or officer who is made or threatened to be made a party to, or witness in, the proceeding by reason of his or her service in that capacity or any individual who, while serving as one of our directors or officers and at our request, serves or has served as a director, officer, partner, trustee, member or manager of another corporation, real estate investment trust, partnership, limited liability company, joint venture, trust, employee benefit plan or any other enterprise and who is made or threatened to be made a party to, or witness in, the proceeding by reason of his or her service in that capacity. Our charter and bylaws also permit us to indemnify and advance expenses to any person who served a predecessor of ours in any of the capacities described above and to any employee or agent of ours or our predecessor. 
 7 

The MGCL requires a corporation (unless its charter provides otherwise, which our charter does not) to indemnify a director or officer who has been successful, on the merits or otherwise, in the defense of any proceeding to which he or she is made or threatened to be made a party by reason of his or her service in that capacity. The MGCL permits a corporation to indemnify its present and former directors and officers, among others, against judgments, penalties, fines, settlements and reasonable expenses actually incurred by them in connection with any proceeding to which they may be made or are threatened to be made a party by reason of their service in those or other capacities unless it is established that (a) the act or omission of the director or officer was material to the matter giving rise to the proceeding and (i) was committed in bad faith or (ii) was the result of active and deliberate dishonesty, (b) the director or officer actually received an improper personal benefit in money, property or services or (c) in the case of any criminal proceeding, the director or officer had reasonable cause to believe that the act or omission was unlawful. However, under the MGCL, a Maryland corporation may not indemnify for an adverse judgment in a suit by or in the right of the corporation or for a judgment of liability on the basis that personal benefit was improperly received, unless in either case a court orders indemnification and then only for expenses. In addition, the MGCL permits a corporation to advance reasonable expenses to a director or officer upon the corporation s receipt of (a) a written affirmation by the director or officer of his or her good faith belief that he or she has met the standard of conduct necessary for indemnification by the corporation and (b) a written undertaking by him or her or on his or her behalf to repay the amount paid or reimbursed by the corporation if it shall ultimately be determined that the standard of conduct was not met. 
 Transfer Agent 
 The registrar and transfer agent for our common stock is Computershare Trust Company, N.A. 
 DESCRIPTION OF NOTES 
 The following description of each of the series of the notes and the indenture dated as of October 28, 1998 (the Indenture between Realty Income and The Bank of New York Mellon Trust Company, N.A. (successor trustee to The Bank of New York), as trustee (the Trustee pursuant to which the notes were issued is a summary and is not complete. These statements are qualified in their entirety by reference to the provisions of each respective series of the notes, the officers certificate establishing the form and terms of each respective series of the notes and the Indenture, including the definitions in the notes of each series and Indenture of certain terms, and which have been filed as exhibits to our most recent Annual Report on Form 10-K. The terms of the notes include those provisions contained in the Indenture and the officers certificates establishing the form and terms of each respective series of the notes (each, an Officers Certificate and those made part of the Indenture by reference to the Trust Indenture Act of 1939, as amended (the TIA ). The notes are subject to all those terms, and investors are referred to the Indenture, such officers' certificates and the TIA for a statement of those terms. Unless otherwise expressly stated or the context otherwise requires, all references to the Company, Realty Income, our, we, and us appearing under this caption Description of Notes mean Realty Income Corporation, a Maryland corporation, excluding its subsidiaries. Unless otherwise expressly stated or the context otherwise requires, references to debt securities under this caption Description of Notes include the notes, each of which are a separate series of our debt securities issued under the Indenture. Other capitalized terms used under this caption, but not otherwise defined, shall have the meanings given to them in the Indenture. Copies of the Indenture, the Officers Certificates and the form of notes have been filed or incorporated by reference as exhibits to our most recent Annual Report on Form 10-K or a subsequent Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q or Current Report on Form 8-K filed by us with the SEC. You may obtain copies of any of those documents by visiting the SEC website at http www.sec.gov. 
 General 
 We are permitted by the Indenture to issue our debt securities thereunder from time to time in one or more series. On October 1, 2020, we issued 400.0 million aggregate principal amount of the 2030 notes as a new, separate series of our debt securities under the Indenture. On July 8, 2021, we issued 400.0 million aggregate principal amount of the July 2027 notes and 350.0 million aggregate principal amount of the 2033 notes, each as a new, separate series of our debt securities under the Indenture. On January 11, 2022, we issued 250.0 million aggregate principal amount of the January 2027 notes and 250.0 million aggregate principal amount of the 2042 notes, each as new, separate series of our debt securities under the Indenture. The Indenture does not limit the amount of debt securities that we may issue under the Indenture, and we may from time to time issue debt securities in one or more series up to the aggregate amount authorized by us for each series. We may, without the consent of the holders of the notes, re-open this series of notes and issue additional notes of this series under the Indenture in addition to the notes previously issued, and any such additional notes shall be part of the same series of debt securities under the Indenture as this series of notes. 
 8 

The notes have been issued in fully registered form, without interest coupons, in denominations of 100,000 and integral multiples of 1,000 in excess thereof. The notes are denominated in GBP (as defined below). The principal of, and premium, if any, and interest on, and Additional Amounts (as defined below), if any, in respect of, the notes are payable in GBP, except under the circumstances described below under -Issuance in GBP and -Discharge, Defeasance and Covenant Defeasance of the Notes. The notes are evidenced by one or more global notes (collectively, the Global Note in book-entry form, except under the limited circumstances described below under -Certificated Notes. The Global Note is registered in the name of a nominee of, and deposited with or on behalf of, a common depositary (the common depositary for Euroclear Bank SA NV Euroclear , which term includes any successor securities clearing agency thereto) and Clearstream Banking S.A. Clearstream , which term includes any successor securities clearing agency thereto). Except in the limited circumstances described below under -Certificated Notes , owners of beneficial interests in the Global Note are not entitled to have notes registered in their names and do not receive and are not entitled to receive notes in definitive certificated form. 
 For purposes of the notes, unless otherwise expressly stated under this caption Description of Notes, (i) a Business Day means any day, other than a Saturday or a Sunday, that is not a day on which banking institutions in The City of New York or in London, England are authorized or required by law, regulation or executive order to close, (ii) sterling, and GBP mean the lawful currency of the United Kingdom and (iii) U.S. dollars, USD and mean United States dollars. 
 Reference is made to the section titled -Certain Covenants below for a description of certain covenants applicable to the notes of each series. Compliance with these covenants generally may be waived, insofar as concerns the notes of each series, if the holders of a majority in principal amount of the outstanding notes of each series consent to such waiver. 
 Except to the limited extent described under -Merger, Consolidation or Sale of Assets or -Certain Covenants below, the Indenture does not contain any provisions that would afford holders of the notes protection in the event of (1) a highly leveraged or similar transaction involving Realty Income, (2) a change of control or management of Realty Income, or (3) a reorganization, restructuring, merger or similar transaction involving Realty Income that may adversely affect the holders of the notes. In addition, subject to compliance with the covenants set forth under -Certain Covenants below and, if applicable, covenants in other debt instruments and the covenant set forth under -Merger, Consolidation or Sale of Assets below, Realty Income may, in the future, enter into certain transactions such as the sale of all or substantially all of its assets or the merger or consolidation of Realty Income with another entity that could substantially increase the amount of Realty Income s indebtedness or substantially reduce Realty Income s assets, which may have an adverse effect on Realty Income s ability to service its indebtedness, including the notes. 
 Paying Agent and Transfer Agent 
 The Bank of New York Mellon, London Branch, acts as the paying agent for the notes of each series. The Bank of New York Mellon Trust Company, N.A. acts as the trustee and the transfer agent for the notes of each series. We may change any paying agent or transfer agent and appoint additional paying agents and transfer agents with respect to the notes of either series, so long as we at all times maintain a paying agent for the notes of such series in London, England and a transfer agent for the notes of such series in Chicago, Illinois. 
 Issuance in GBP 
 Investors that purchased the notes were required to pay for those notes in GBP. 
 Except as described in the next paragraph and in the proviso to this sentence, all payments of principal of, and premium, if any, and interest on, and Additional Amounts, if any, in respect of, the notes must be made in GBP provided that if GBP is unavailable to us due to the imposition of exchange controls or other circumstances beyond our control, then all payments in respect of the notes of each series will be made in U.S. dollars until GBP is again available to us. In such circumstances, the amount payable on any date in GBP will be converted into U.S. dollars at the rate mandated by the Board of Governors of the U.S. Federal Reserve System (or any successor thereto) as of the close of business on the second Business Day prior to the relevant payment date or, if the Board of Governors of the U.S. Federal Reserve System (or any successor thereto) has not mandated a rate of conversion, on the basis of the most recent U.S. dollar GBP exchange rate published in The Wall Street Journal (or any successor thereto) on or prior to the second Business Day, prior to the relevant payment date. Any payment in respect of the notes of each series so made in U.S. dollars under such circumstances will not constitute an event of default (as defined see -Events of Default below) with respect to the notes of each series under the Indenture. Neither the Trustee nor the paying agent shall have any responsibility for any calculation or conversion in connection with the foregoing. 
 9 

See -Discharge, Defeasance and Covenant Defeasance of the Notes below for a discussion of certain other circumstances (which would apply only after we effected defeasance or covenant defeasance of the notes of the applicable series) under which the notes of such series could be payable in a currency other than GBP. 
 Ranking 
 The notes are our senior unsecured obligations and rank equally in right of payment with all of our other existing and future senior unsecured indebtedness. The notes are our obligations exclusively, however, and are not the obligations of, and are not guaranteed by, any of our subsidiaries, nor are any of our subsidiaries required to provide funds to us, whether by dividend, loan or otherwise, to make payments on the notes. The notes are therefore effectively subordinated in right of payment to all existing and future indebtedness and other liabilities of our subsidiaries from time to time outstanding, including any guarantees of our indebtedness by any of our subsidiaries, and are also subordinated in right of payment to all existing and future secured indebtedness of us and our subsidiaries to the extent of the value of the collateral pledged as security therefor. Our revolving credit facility, term loan facility and privately placed Sterling notes include other provisions that, under specified circumstances, may in the future require subsidiaries of ours to guarantee those facilities and privately placed Sterling notes, and we may voluntarily cause any of our subsidiaries to become a guarantor under our revolving credit facility, term loan facility, privately placed Sterling notes or any other indebtedness of ours to the extent we consider appropriate to remain in compliance with certain covenants thereunder or for any other reasons. Although the Indenture and other debt instruments to which we are a party limit our ability and the ability of our subsidiaries to incur additional indebtedness, both we and our subsidiaries have the right to incur substantial additional secured and unsecured indebtedness.

 (2) any holder that is not the sole beneficial owner of the note of such series, or a portion thereof, or that is a fiduciary, limited liability company or partnership, but only to the extent that a beneficiary or settlor with respect to the fiduciary or a beneficial owner or member of the partnership or limited liability company would not have been entitled to the payment of an Additional Amount had the beneficiary, settlor, beneficial owner or member received directly its beneficial or distributive share of the payment 
 (3) any Taxes that are imposed or withheld by reason of the failure to (a) comply with certification, identification or information reporting requirements concerning the nationality, residence, identity or connection with a Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction of the holder or beneficial owner of such note of such series, if compliance is required by statute or by regulation of the Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction as a precondition to relief or exemption from such Taxes (including the submission, if applicable, of a United States Internal Revenue Service IRS Form W-8 (with any required attachments)) or (b) comply with any information gathering and reporting requirements or to take any similar action (including entering into any agreement with the IRS), in each case, that are required to obtain the maximum available exemption from withholding by a Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction that is available to payments received by or on behalf of the holder or beneficial owner

 (9) any backup withholding or any Taxes imposed under Sections 1471 through 1474 of the Code (or any successor provisions thereto), any current or future regulations or official interpretations thereof, any agreements entered into pursuant to Section 1471(b)(1) of the Code (or any successor provision thereto), or any fiscal or regulatory legislation, rules or practices adopted pursuant to any intergovernmental agreement entered into in connection with the implementation of such sections of the Code (or any successor thereto) or 
 (10) any combination of any items (1) through (9). 
 The notes of each series are subject in all cases to any tax, fiscal or other law or regulation or administrative or judicial interpretation applicable thereto. Except as specifically provided under this heading -Payment of Additional Amounts, Realty Income shall not be required to make any payment with respect to any tax, assessment or governmental charge imposed by any government or a political subdivision or taxing authority thereof or therein on any payment of principal of, premium, if any, or interest on, or Additional Amounts in respect of, the notes of any series. 
 If Realty Income becomes aware that it will be obligated to pay Additional Amounts with respect to any payment under or with respect to the notes of any series, Realty Income will deliver to the Trustee and each paying agent for the notes of such series on a date that is at least 30 days prior to the date of that payment (unless the obligation to pay Additional Amounts arises less than 30 days prior to that payment date, in which case Realty Income shall notify the Trustee and each paying agent promptly after Realty Income becomes aware that such obligation has arisen) an officers certificates stating the fact that Additional Amounts will be payable and the amount to be so payable. The officers certificates must also set forth any other information reasonably necessary to enable the paying agents to pay such Additional Amounts to Holders on the relevant payment date. The Trustee and each paying agent shall be entitled to rely solely on such officers certificates as conclusive proof that such payments are necessary. 
 As used under this caption -Payment of Additional Amounts, the term United States Person means any individual who is a citizen or resident of the United States for U.S. federal income tax purposes, a corporation, partnership or other entity created or organized in or under the laws of the United States, any state of the United States or the District of Columbia (other than a partnership that is not treated as a United States Person under any applicable U.S. Treasury Regulations), any estate the income of which is subject to United States federal income taxation regardless of its source, or any trust if a court within the United States is able to exercise primary supervision over the administration of the trust or one or more United States fiduciaries have the authority to control all substantial decisions of the trust and the term United States shall have the meaning set forth above under -Redemption for Changes in Taxes. 
 Whenever there is mentioned, in any context (except as otherwise provided in the proviso to this sentence), under this caption Description of Notes, the payment of principal of, or premium, if any, or interest on, or in respect of, any note of any series, such mention shall be deemed to include mention of the payment of Additional Amounts to the extent that, in such context, Additional Amounts are, were or would be payable in respect thereof pursuant to the terms of the notes of such series or the Indenture, and express mention of the payment of Additional Amounts anywhere under such captions shall not be construed as excluding Additional Amounts elsewhere under such captions where such express mention is not made provided that, notwithstanding the foregoing and also 
 20 

notwithstanding anything in the Indenture to the contrary, the references to principal and premium appearing in clause (2) of the first paragraph under the caption -Events of Default, Notice and Waiver below shall not include any Additional Amounts that may be payable in respect of the principal of or premium, if any, on the notes of any series. Because, as described above, all Additional Amounts, if any, payable in respect of the notes of any series will be treated as additional interest on the notes of such series, the proviso to the foregoing sentence means that, for purposes of determining whether an event of default has occurred with respect to the notes of such series, any failure by us to pay any Additional Amounts that are payable in respect of the notes of such series when due will be entitled to the same 30 day grace period to which a failure to pay interest on the notes of such series when due would be entitled as described in clause (1) of the first paragraph under the caption -Events of Default, Notice and Waiver below. As a result, any failure by us to pay Additional Amounts in respect of the notes of any series (including, without limitation, Additional Amounts payable in respect of principal of or premium, if any, on the notes of such series) when due will not be an event of default with respect to the notes of such series under the Indenture unless that default continues for 30 days. 
 Notwithstanding any discharge, defeasance or covenant defeasance of the notes of any series or the Indenture as described under -Discharge, Defeasance and Covenant Defeasance below, the provisions described under this caption -Payment of Additional Amounts shall survive any such discharge, defeasance or covenant defeasance, as the case may be, and remain in full force and effect and shall also survive any transfer by a Holder or beneficial owner of its notes of such series or its beneficial interest in the Global Note of such series. 
 Discharge, Defeasance and Covenant Defeasance 
 Upon our request the Indenture shall cease to be of further effect with respect to the notes of any series (except as to certain limited provisions of the Indenture which shall survive) when either (a) all of the notes of such series have been delivered to the trustee for cancellation or (b) all of the notes of such series have become due and payable or will become due and payable within one year (or are scheduled for redemption within one year) and we have irrevocably deposited with the applicable trustee, in trust, funds in the currency or currencies, currency unit or units or composite currency or currencies in which the notes of such series are payable an amount sufficient to pay the entire indebtedness on the notes of such series in respect of principal (and premium, if any) and interest to the date of the deposit (if the notes have become due and payable) or to the stated maturity or redemption date, as the case may be. 
 The Indenture provides that we may elect either to 
 defease and be discharged from any and all obligations with respect to the notes (except for the obligation, if any, to pay additional amounts in respect of certain taxes imposed on non-U.S. holders of the notes and the obligations to register the transfer or exchange of the notes, to replace temporary or mutilated, destroyed, lost or stolen notes, to maintain an office or agency in respect of the notes and to hold money for payment in trust) defeasance or 
 be released from our obligations with respect to certain covenants applicable to the notes under the Indenture (including, subject to a limited exception, with respect to Realty Income's obligation to preserve and keep in full force and effect its corporate existence, the covenants described under -Certain Covenants ), and any omission to comply with these obligations shall not constitute a default or an event of default with respect to the notes covenant defeasance ), 
 in either case upon our irrevocable deposit with the applicable trustee, in trust, of an amount, in the currency or currencies, currency unit or units or composite currency or currencies in which the notes are payable at stated maturity, or Government Obligations (as defined below), or both, applicable to the notes that through the scheduled payment of principal and interest in accordance with their terms will provide money in an amount sufficient to pay the principal of (and premium, if any) and interest on the notes, and any mandatory sinking fund or analogous payments on the notes, on the scheduled due dates. 
 A trust may only be established if, among other things, we have delivered to the applicable trustee an opinion of counsel (as specified in the Indenture) to the effect that the holders of the notes will not recognize income, gain or loss for United States federal income tax purposes as a result of the defeasance or covenant defeasance and will be subject to United States federal income tax on the same amounts, in the same manner and at the same times as would have been the case if the defeasance or covenant defeasance had not occurred. Additionally, in the case of defeasance, an opinion of counsel must refer to and be based on a ruling of the Internal Revenue Service (the IRS or a change in applicable United States federal income tax law occurring after the date 
 21 

of the Indenture. In the event of defeasance, the holders of the notes will thereafter be able to look only to the trust fund for payment of principal (and premium, if any) and interest. 
 Government Obligations means securities that are (a) direct obligations of the United States of America or the government which issued the foreign currency in which the notes are payable, for the payment of which its full faith and credit is pledged, or (b) obligations of a person controlled or supervised by and acting as an agency or instrumentality of the United States of America or the government which issued the foreign currency in which the notes are payable, the payment of which is unconditionally guaranteed as a full faith and credit obligation by the United States of America or the other government, which, in either case, are not callable or redeemable at the option of the issuer thereof, and shall also include a depository receipt issued by a bank or trust company as custodian with respect to any Government Obligation or a specific payment of interest on or principal of any Government Obligation held by a custodian for the account of the holder of a depository receipt provided, however, that (except as required by law) the custodian is not authorized to make any deduction from the amount payable to the holder of the depository receipt from any amount received by the custodian in respect of the Government Obligation or the specific payment of interest on or principal of the Government Obligation evidenced by the depository receipt. 
 If, after we have deposited funds and or Government Obligations to effect defeasance or covenant defeasance with respect to the notes 
 the holder of any note is entitled to, and does, elect pursuant to the Indenture or the terms of the note to receive payment in a currency, currency unit or composite currency other than that in which the deposit has been made in respect of that note, or 
 a Conversion Event (as defined below) occurs in respect of the currency, currency unit or composite currency in which the deposit has been made, then the indebtedness represented by that note will be deemed to have been, and will be, fully discharged and satisfied through the payment of the principal of (and premium, if any) and interest on that note as they become due out of the proceeds yielded by converting the amount or other property so deposited in respect of that note into the currency, currency unit or composite currency in which that note becomes payable as a result of the election or Conversion Event based on the applicable market exchange rate in effect on the second business day prior to each payment date. Conversion Event means the cessation of use of 
 a currency, currency unit or composite currency both by the government of the country which issued the currency and for the settlement of transactions by a central bank or other public institution of or within the international banking community or 
 any currency unit or composite currency for the purposes for which it was established. 
 In the event we effect a covenant defeasance with respect to the notes and the notes are declared due and payable because of the occurrence of any event of default, other than an event of default due to a breach of any of the covenants as to which there has been covenant defeasance (which covenants would no longer be applicable to the notes as a result of such covenant defeasance), the cash and Government Obligations on deposit with the applicable trustee may not be sufficient to pay amounts due on the notes at the time of the acceleration resulting from the event of default. We would, however, remain obligated to make payment of the amounts due at the time of acceleration. 
 Notwithstanding the foregoing, our obligation to pay Additional Amounts on the notes pursuant to the provisions described above under -Payment of Additional Amounts shall survive any such discharge, defeasance or covenant defeasance and remain in full force and effect. In addition, covenant defeasance will be applicable, insofar as concerns the notes, with respect to the covenants described under -Certain Covenants (except the covenant requiring Realty Income to preserve and keep in full force and effect its corporate existence). 
 Events of Default, Notice and Waiver 
 The following events are events of default pursuant to the terms of the notes and the Indenture 
 (1) default for 30 days in the payment of any installment of interest on any of the notes 
 (2) default in the payment of the principal of (or premium, if any, on) any of the notes when due, whether at stated maturity or by declaration of acceleration, notice of redemption, notice of option to elect repayment or otherwise 
 22 

(3) default in the deposit of any sinking fund payment, when and as due by the terms of any of the notes 
 (4) default in the performance of any of our other covenants contained in the Indenture or in the notes (other than any covenant added to the Indenture solely for the benefit of a series of debt securities issued thereunder other than the notes), which continues for 60 days after written notice is given to us by the trustee or to us and the trustee by the holders of at least 25 in principal amount of the notes 
 (5) default under any bond, debenture, note or other evidence of indebtedness for money borrowed by us or any of our Subsidiaries (including obligations under leases required to be capitalized on the balance sheet of the lessee under generally accepted accounting principles, but not including any indebtedness or obligations for which recourse is limited to property purchased) in an aggregate principal amount in excess of 25,000,000 or under any mortgage, indenture or instrument under which there may be issued or by which there may be secured or evidenced any indebtedness for money borrowed by us or any of our Subsidiaries (including such leases, but not including such indebtedness or obligations for which recourse is limited to property purchased) in an aggregate principal amount in excess of 25,000,000, whether the indebtedness exists at the date of the relevant indenture or shall thereafter be created, which default shall have resulted in the indebtedness becoming or being declared due and payable prior to the date on which it would otherwise have become due and payable or which default shall have resulted in the obligation being accelerated, without the acceleration having been rescinded or annulled or 
 (6) certain events of bankruptcy, insolvency or reorganization with respect to us or any of our Significant Subsidiaries. 
 The term Significant Subsidiary as used above has the meaning ascribed to the term in Rule 1-02 of Regulation S-X promulgated under the Securities Act, as the Regulation was in effect on January 1, 1996. 
 If an event of default with respect to the notes of any series occurs and is continuing, then the Trustee or the holders of not less than 25 in principal amount of the notes of such series may declare the principal amount of all the notes to be due and payable immediately by written notice thereof to us (and to the Trustee if given by the holders). However, at any time after the declaration of acceleration with respect to the notes of such series has been made, but before a judgment or decree for payment of the money due has been obtained by the Trustee, the holders of not less than a majority of the principal amount of the outstanding notes, as applicable, may rescind and annul the declaration and its consequences if 
 we shall have deposited with the applicable trustee all required payments of the principal of (and premium, if any) and interest on the notes (other than principal that has become due solely as a result of the acceleration), plus certain fees, expenses, disbursements and advances of the applicable trustee and 
 all events of default, other than the nonpayment of accelerated principal (or specified portion thereof), premium, if any, and interest with respect to the notes, have been cured or waived as provided in the indenture. 
 The holders of not less than a majority in principal amount of the outstanding notes of such series may waive any past default with respect to the notes of such series and its consequences, except 
 a default in the payment of the principal of (or premium, if any) or interest on any of the notes or 
 a default in respect of a covenant or provision contained in the Indenture that cannot be modified or amended without the consent of the holder of each outstanding note affected by the default. 
 The Trustee must give notice of a default under the Indenture to the holders of the notes within 90 days unless the default shall have been cured or waived, subject to certain exceptions provided, however, that the Trustee may withhold notice to the holders of the notes of any default with respect to the notes (except a default in the payment of the principal of (or premium, if any) or interest on any of the notes or in the payment of any sinking fund installment in respect of any of the notes) if specified Responsible Officers of the Trustee consider a withholding to be in those holders interest. 
 No holders of the notes may institute any proceedings, judicial or otherwise, with respect to the Indenture or for any remedy thereunder, except in the case of failure of the Trustee, for 60 days, to act after it has received a written request to institute proceedings in respect of an event of default from the holders of not less than 25 in principal amount of the outstanding notes, as well as an offer of indemnity reasonably satisfactory to it, and no 
 23 

direction inconsistent with the written request has been given to the Trustee during the 60-day period by holders of a majority in principal amount of the outstanding notes. This provision will not prevent, however, any holder of notes from instituting suit for the enforcement of payment of the principal of (and premium, if any) and interest on those notes at the respective due dates thereof. 
 Subject to provisions in the TIA relating to its duties in case of default, the Trustee is under no obligation to exercise any of its rights or powers under the Indenture at the request or direction of any holders of the notes, unless those holders shall have offered to the Trustee reasonable security or indemnity. The holders of not less than a majority in principal amount of the outstanding notes shall have the right to direct the time, method and place of conducting any proceeding for any remedy available to the Trustee, or of exercising any trust or power conferred upon the Trustee provided that the direction shall not conflict with any rule of law or the Indenture, and provided further that the Trustee may refuse to follow any direction that may involve the Trustee in personal liability or that may be unduly prejudicial to the holders of the notes not joining in the direction to the Trustee. 
 Within 120 days after the close of each fiscal year, we are required to deliver to the Trustee a certificate, signed by one of several specified officers, stating whether or not the officer has knowledge of any default under the Indenture and, if so, specifying each default and the nature and status thereof. 
 As described above under -Payments of Additional Amounts, because all Additional Amounts, if any, payable in respect to the notes of any series will be treated as additional interest on the notes of such series, any failure by us to pay Additional Amounts in respect to the notes of such series when due will be entitled to the same 30 day grace period to which a failure to pay interest on the notes of such series when due would be entitled as described in clause (1) of the first paragraph under this caption -Events of Default, Notice and Waiver. As a result, any failure by us to pay Additional Amounts in respect of the notes of any series (including, without limitation, Additional Amounts payable in respect of principal of or premium, if any, on the notes of any series) when due will not be an event of default with respect to the notes of such series under the Indenture unless that default continues for 30 days. For additional information, see -Payment of Additional Amounts above. 
 Modification of the Indenture 
 Modifications and amendments of the Indenture will be permitted with the consent of the holders of not less than a majority in principal amount of all outstanding debt securities of each series issued under the Indenture, including the notes, affected by the modification or amendment provided, however, that no modification or amendment may, without the consent of the holder of each debt security affected thereby 
 change the stated maturity of the principal of, or any installment of principal of, or interest (or premium, if any) on any debt security, including the notes 
 reduce the principal amount of, or the rate or amount of interest on, or any premium payable on redemption of any debt security, including the notes, or reduce the amount of principal of an Original Issue Discount Security that would be due and payable upon declaration of acceleration of the maturity of the Original Issue Discount Security or would be provable in bankruptcy, or adversely affect any right of repayment at the option of the holder of any debt security (or reduce the amount of premium payable upon any repayment) 
 change the place of payment, or the coin or currency, for payment of principal of (or premium, if any) or interest on any debt security, including the notes 
 impair the right to institute suit for the enforcement of any payment on or with respect to any debt security, including the notes, when due 
 reduce the above-stated percentage of outstanding debt securities of any series, including the notes, necessary to modify or amend the Indenture to waive compliance with certain provisions of the Indenture or certain defaults and consequences under the Indenture or to reduce the quorum or voting requirements set forth in the Indenture or 
 modify any of the foregoing provisions or any of the provisions relating to the waiver of certain past defaults or certain covenants, except to increase the required percentage to effect the action or to provide that certain other provisions may not be modified or waived without the consent of the holder of each outstanding debt security affected thereby. 
 24 

The holders of a majority in aggregate principal amount of the outstanding notes may, on behalf of all holders of the notes, waive (insofar as that series is concerned) our compliance with certain restrictive covenants in the Indenture with respect to the notes. 
 We, along with the Trustee, shall be permitted to modify and amend the Indenture without the consent of any holder of debt securities, in each case, including the notes, for any of the following purposes 
 to evidence the succession of another person to our obligations under the Indenture 
 to add to our covenants for the benefit of the holders of all or any series of debt securities or to surrender any right or power conferred upon us in the Indenture 
 to add events of default for the benefit of the holders of all or any series of debt securities 
 to add or change any provisions of the indenture to provide that debt securities in bearer form may be registerable as to principal or to change or eliminate any restrictions on the payment of principal of or any premium or interest on debt securities in bearer form or to make certain other provisions relating to debt securities in bearer form, provided that such action shall not adversely affect the interests of the holders of the debt securities of any series in any material respect 
 to change or eliminate any provisions of the Indenture, provided that any such change or elimination does not apply to any outstanding debt securities of a series created prior to the date of the amendment or supplement that are entitled to the benefit of that provision 
 to secure the debt securities 
 to establish the form or terms of debt securities of any series, including the provisions and procedures, if applicable, for the conversion of debt securities into common stock or preferred stock 
 to provide for the acceptance of appointment by a successor trustee or facilitate the administration of the trusts under the indenture by more than one trustee 
 to cure any ambiguity or to correct any defect or inconsistency in the Indenture, or to make any other provisions with respect to matters or questions arising under the Indenture which shall not be inconsistent with the provisions of the indenture, provided, however, that such action shall not adversely affect the interests of holders of debt securities of any series in any material respect or 
 to supplement any of the provisions of the Indenture to the extent necessary to permit or facilitate defeasance, covenant defeasance and discharge of any series of debt securities, provided, however, that this action shall not adversely affect the interests of the holders of the debt securities of any series in any material respect. 
 In determining whether the holders of the requisite principal amount of outstanding debt securities of a series, in each case, including the notes, have given any request, demand, authorization, direction, notice, consent or waiver described in the indenture or whether a quorum is present at a meeting of holders of debt securities 
 the principal amount of an Original Issue Discount Security that shall be deemed to be outstanding shall be the amount of the principal of that security that would be due and payable as of the date of the determination upon declaration of acceleration of the maturity thereof 
 with respect to the notes, the principal amount of any debt security denominated in a foreign currency that shall be deemed outstanding shall be the U.S. dollar equivalent of the principal amount of such debt security, determined as of the second business day prior to the date of determining whether the requisite principal amount of the outstanding debt securities of the applicable series have given such request, demand, authorization, direction, notice, consent or waiver or whether such a quorum is present 
 with respect to any series of debt securities other than the notes, the principal amount of any debt security denominated in a foreign currency that shall be deemed outstanding shall be the U.S. dollar equivalent, determined on the issue date for the debt security, of the principal amount (or, in the case of an Original Issue Discount Security, the U.S. dollar equivalent on the issue date of the debt security of the amount determined as provided in the first bullet above) 
 25 

the principal amount of an Indexed Security that shall be deemed outstanding shall be the principal face amount of the Indexed Security at original issuance and 
 debt securities owned by us or any other obligor upon the debt securities or any affiliate of ours or of the other obligor shall be disregarded. 
 A meeting of the holders of the notes may be called at any time by the Trustee, and also, upon our request or request of the holders of at least 10 in principal amount of the outstanding notes, in any case upon notice given as provided in the Indenture. Except for any consent or waiver that must be given by the holder of each debt security affected thereby, any resolution presented at a meeting or at an adjourned meeting duly reconvened at which a quorum is present, may be adopted by the affirmative vote of the holders of a majority in principal amount of the outstanding notes provided, however, that, except as referred to above, any resolution with respect to any request, demand, authorization, direction, notice, consent, waiver or other action that may be made, given or taken by the holders of a specified percentage, which is less than a majority, in principal amount of the outstanding notes may be adopted at a meeting or adjourned meeting duly reconvened at which a quorum is present by the affirmative vote of the holders of the specified percentage in principal amount of the outstanding notes. Any resolution passed or decision taken at any meeting of holders of the notes duly held in accordance with the Indenture will be binding on all holders of the notes. The persons holding or representing a majority in principal amount of the outstanding notes shall constitute a quorum for a meeting of holders of the notes provided, however, that if any action is to be taken at a meeting with respect to a consent or waiver that may be given by the holders of not less than a specified percentage in principal amount of the outstanding notes, the persons holding or representing the specified percentage in principal amount of the outstanding notes will constitute a quorum. 
 Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions, the Indenture provides that if any action is to be taken at a meeting of holders of the notes with respect to any request, demand, authorization, direction, notice, consent, waiver or other action that the Indenture expressly provides may be made, given or taken by the holders of the notes and one or more additional series (a) there shall be no minimum quorum requirement for the meeting and (b) the principal amount of the outstanding debt securities of all those series that are entitled to vote in favor of the request, demand, authorization, direction, notice, consent, waiver or other action shall be taken into account in determining whether the request, demand, authorization, direction, notice, consent, waiver or other action has been made, given or taken under the Indenture. 
 Merger, Consolidation or Sale of Assets 
 Pursuant to the terms of the Indenture and the notes, we will not consolidate with, sell, lease or convey all or substantially all of our assets to, or merge with or into, any person unless 
 either we shall be the continuing entity, or the successor person (if not us) formed by or resulting from the consolidation or merger or which shall have received the transfer of the assets shall be a corporation organized and existing under the laws of the United States or any State thereof and shall expressly assume (1) our obligation to pay the principal of (and premium, if any) and interest on all the debt securities issued under the Indenture, including the notes, and (2) the due and punctual performance and observance of all the covenants and conditions contained in the Indenture and in the notes to be performed or observed by us 
 immediately after giving effect to the transaction and treating any indebtedness that becomes our obligation or the obligation of any Subsidiary as a result of the transaction as having been incurred, and treating any liens on any property or assets of ours or any Subsidiary that are incurred, created or assumed as a result of the transaction as having been created, incurred or assumed, by us or the Subsidiary at the time of the transaction, no event of default under the Indenture, and no event that, after notice or the lapse of time, or both, would become an event of default, shall have occurred and be continuing and 
 an officers certificates and legal opinion covering these conditions shall be delivered to the Trustee. 
 Payment 
 All payments of principal of, premium, if any, interest on, and Additional Amounts, if any, in respect of the Global Notes of each series will be made by the paying agent for the notes of such series on behalf of Realty Income by wire transfer of immediately available funds to an account maintained by the payee. 
 26 

If notes of either series are issued in definitive certificated form under the limited circumstances described below, under -Certificated Notes, payments of interest on the certificated notes of such series may be made, at our option, by check mailed to the addresses of the persons entitled thereto, as such addresses appear in the register for the notes of such series, or by wire transfer to accounts maintained by the payees provided, however, that a holder of 4 million or more in aggregate principal amount of notes of such series in definitive certificated form will be entitled to receive payments of interest due on any interest payment date by wire transfer of immediately available funds to an account specified by such holder so long as such holder has given appropriate wire transfer instructions to the Trustee or a paying agent for the notes of such series at least 10 calendar days prior to the applicable interest payment date. Any such wire transfer instructions will remain in effect until revoked by such holder or until such person ceases to be a holder of 4 million or more in aggregate principal amount of notes of such series in definitive certificated form. 
 Payments of principal of, and premium, if any, and interest on, and Additional Amounts, if any, in respect of, the notes of any series in definitive certificated form that are due and payable on the maturity date of the notes of such series, any redemption date for the notes of such series or any other date on which principal of the notes of such series is due and payable will be made by wire transfer of immediately available funds to accounts specified by the holders thereof, so long as such holders have given appropriate wire transfer instructions to the Trustee or a paying agent for the notes of such series, against surrender of such notes to the Trustee or any such paying agent provided that installments of interest on notes of such series in definitive certificated form that are due and payable on any interest payment date falling on or prior to such maturity date, redemption date or other date on which principal of the notes of such series is payable will be paid in the manner described in the preceding paragraph to the persons who were the holders of the notes of such series (or one or more predecessor notes of such series) registered as such at the close of business on the relevant regular record dates according to the terms and provisions of the notes of such series and the Indenture. 
 Book-Entry System 
 The notes of each series were offered and sold only in denominations of 100,000 and integral multiples of 1,000 in excess thereof. The notes of each series were initially represented by the Global Note of such series. Upon issuance, the Global Notes of any series were deposited with, or on behalf of, a common depositary and registered in the name of the nominee of the common depositary for the accounts of Euroclear and Clearstream. Except as set forth below, the Global Notes of each series may be transferred, in whole and not in part, only to the common depositary or its nominee or to a successor common depositary or its nominee. You may hold your interests in the Global Notes of each series in Europe through Euroclear or Clearstream, either as a participant in such systems or indirectly through organizations that are participants in such systems. Euroclear and Clearstream hold interests in the Global Notes of any series on behalf of their respective participating organizations or customers through customers securities accounts in Euroclear s or Clearstream s names on the books of their respective depositaries. Book-entry interests in the notes and all transfers relating to the notes are and will be reflected in the book-entry records of Euroclear and Clearstream. 
 The distribution of the notes were cleared through Euroclear and Clearstream. Any secondary market trading of book-entry interests in the notes will take place through Euroclear and Clearstream participants and will settle in same-day funds. Owners of book-entry interests in the notes will receive payments relating to their notes in GBP, except as described above under -Issuance in GBP and -Discharge, Defeasance and Covenant Defeasance. 
 Euroclear and Clearstream have established electronic securities and payment transfer, processing, depositary and custodial links among themselves and others, either directly or through custodians and depositaries.

Accordingly, each person owning a beneficial interest in a Global Note must rely on the procedures of Euroclear and Clearstream, as applicable, and, if such person is not a participant, on the procedures of the participant through which such person owns its interest, in order to exercise any rights of a holder. 
 Euroclear . Euroclear was created in 1968 to hold securities for its participants Euroclear Participants and to clear and settle transactions between Euroclear Participants through simultaneous electronic book-entry delivery against payment, thereby eliminating the need for physical movement of certificates and eliminating risk from lack of simultaneous transfers of securities and cash. Euroclear provides various other services, including securities lending and borrowing and interfaces with domestic markets in several countries. 
 Euroclear is operated by Euroclear Bank SA NV (the Euroclear Operator ). All operations are conducted by the Euroclear Operator, and all Euroclear securities clearance accounts and Euroclear cash accounts are accounts with the Euroclear Operator. Euroclear Participants include banks (including central banks), securities brokers and dealers and other professional financial intermediaries and may include the underwriters. Indirect access to Euroclear is also available to other firms that clear through or maintain a custodial relationship with a Euroclear Participant, either directly or indirectly. 
 The Terms and Conditions Governing Use of Euroclear and the related Operating Procedures of the Euroclear System, or the Euroclear Terms and Conditions, and applicable Belgian law govern securities clearance accounts and cash accounts with the Euroclear Operator. Specifically, these terms and conditions govern transfers of securities and cash within Euroclear, withdrawals of securities and cash from Euroclear, and receipt of payments with respect to securities in Euroclear. All securities in Euroclear are held on a fungible basis without attribution of specific certificates to specific securities clearance accounts. The Euroclear Operator acts under the terms and conditions only on behalf of Euroclear Participants, and has no record of or relationship with persons holding securities through Euroclear Participants. 
 Distributions with respect to interests in the Global Note held beneficially through Euroclear will be credited to the cash accounts of Euroclear Participants in accordance with the Euroclear Terms and Conditions. 
 Clearstream. Clearstream is incorporated under the laws of Luxembourg as a professional depositary. Clearstream holds securities for its participating organizations Clearstream Participants ).

 Global Clearance and Settlement Procedures 
 Realty Income understands that investors that hold their notes through Euroclear and Clearstream accounts will follow the settlement procedures that are applicable to conventional sterling-denominated bonds in registered form. Notes of the applicable series will be credited to the securities custody accounts of Euroclear and Clearstream Participants on the business day following the settlement date, for value on the settlement date.

Secondary market trading will be settled using procedures applicable to conventional sterling-denominated bonds in registered form. 
 You should be aware that investors will only be able to make and receive deliveries, payments and other communications involving notes through Euroclear and Clearstream on days when those systems are open for business. Those systems may not be open for business on days when banks, brokers and other institutions are open for business in the United States. 
 In addition, because of time-zone differences, there may be problems with completing transactions involving Euroclear and Clearstream on the same business day as in the United States. U.S. investors who wish to transfer their interests in the notes, or to make or receive a payment or delivery of the notes, on a particular day, may find that the transactions will not be performed until the next business day in Luxembourg or Brussels, depending on whether Euroclear and Clearstream is used. 
 Euroclear and Clearstream will credit payments to the cash accounts of Euroclear or Clearstream Participants, as applicable, in accordance with the relevant system s rules and procedures, to the extent received by its depositary. Euroclear and or Clearstream, as the case may be, will take any other action permitted to be taken by a holder under the Indenture on behalf of a Euroclear Participant or Clearstream Participant only in accordance with its relevant rules and procedures. 
 Euroclear and Clearstream have agreed to the foregoing procedures in order to facilitate transfers of the notes among participants of Euroclear and Clearstream. However, they are under no obligation to perform or continue to perform those procedures, and they may discontinue those procedures at any time. 
 Certificated Notes 
 If (1) Euroclear or Clearstream notifies Realty Income that it is unwilling or unable to continue as a clearing agency for the Global Notes of any series or if Euroclear or Clearstream ceases to be a clearing agency registered as such under the Exchange Act at any time when it is required to be so registered in order to act as a clearing system for the Global Notes of such series and a successor clearing agency is not appointed within 90 days after Realty Income receives such notice or learns of such ineligibility, (2) Realty Income determines that the notes of any series shall no longer be represented by the Global Note and executes and delivers to the Trustee an officers certificates to that effect or (3) an event of default (as defined see -Events of Default above) with respect to the notes of any series has occurred and is continuing and beneficial owners representing a majority in aggregate principal amount of the outstanding notes of such series advise Euroclear and Clearstream to cease acting as clearing agencies for the Global Note of such series, Realty Income will issue notes of such series in definitive certificated form in exchange for interests in the outstanding Global Notes of such series. Any notes of any series issued in definitive certificated form in exchange for interests in a Global Note of such series will be issued in denominations of 100,000 and integral multiples of 1,000 in excess thereof and will be registered in such name or names as Euroclear or Clearstream, as applicable, shall instruct the registrar for the notes of such series. It is expected that the instructions of Euroclear and Clearstream will be based upon directions received from their respective participants with respect to ownership of beneficial interests in the Global Notes of the applicable series.

 3.14 Section 409A . 
 (a) General . To the extent applicable, this Agreement shall be interpreted in accordance with Section 409A of the Code and Department of Treasury regulations and other interpretive guidance issued thereunder Section 409A ), including without limitation any such regulations or other guidance that may be issued after the effective date of this Agreement. Notwithstanding any other provision of the Plan, the Grant Notice or this Agreement, if at any time the Administrator determines that the Performance Shares or the Dividend Equivalents (or, in each case, any portion thereof) may be subject to Section 409A, the Administrator shall have the right in its sole discretion (without any obligation to do so or to indemnify the Participant or any other person for failure to do so) to adopt such amendments to the Plan, the Grant Notice or this Agreement, or adopt other policies and procedures (including amendments, policies and procedures with retroactive effect), or take any other actions, as the Administrator determines are necessary or appropriate either for the Performance Shares and or Dividend Equivalents to be exempt from the application of Section 409A or to comply with the requirements of Section 409A. 
 (b) Potential Six-Month Delay . Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, no amounts shall be paid to the Participant under this Agreement during the six (6)-month period following the Participant s Separation from Service to the extent that the Administrator determines that the Participant is a specified employee (within the meaning of Section 409A) at the time of such Separation from Service and that paying such amounts at the time or times indicated in this Agreement would be a prohibited distribution under Section 409A(a)(2)(B)(i) of the Code. If the payment of any such amounts is delayed as a result of the previous sentence, then on the first business day following the end of such six (6)-month period (or such earlier date upon which such amount can be paid under Section 409A without being subject to such additional taxes), the Company shall pay to the Participant in a lump-sum all amounts that would have otherwise been payable to the Participant during such six (6)-month period under this Agreement.

To the extent permitted by Applicable Law, this Agreement shall be deemed amended to the extent necessary to conform to such applicable exemptive rule. 
 3.16 Limitation on the Participant s Rights . Participation in the Plan confers no rights or interests other than as herein provided. This Agreement creates only a contractual obligation on the part of the Company as to amounts payable and shall not be construed as creating a trust. The Plan, in and of itself, has no assets. The Participant shall have only the rights of a general unsecured creditor of the Company and its Subsidiaries with respect to amounts credited and benefits payable, if any, with respect to the Shares issuable hereunder.

 3 

5.2 Participants Bound Limited Applicability . Any determination or other action taken by the Administrator with respect to the Retirement Policy, or any action authorized by or taken at the direction of the Administrator, in any case, in good faith, shall be binding and conclusive upon all Participants and all other interested parties under the Retirement Policy. Unless otherwise expressly provided in a written agreement between the Company and any individual, in no event shall this Retirement Policy apply to any right other than an Award, including without limitation, any severance right or other incentive equity or other award not subject to the Retirement Policy. 
 5.3 Governing Law . The Retirement Policy will be governed by and interpreted in accordance with the laws of the State of Maryland, disregarding any state s choice-of-law principles requiring the application of a jurisdiction s laws other than the State of Maryland. 
 5.4 Severability . If any portion of the Retirement Policy or any action taken under it is held illegal or invalid for any reason, the illegality or invalidity will not affect the remaining parts of the Retirement Policy, and the Retirement Policy will be construed and enforced as if the illegal or invalid provisions had been excluded, and the illegal or invalid action will be null and void. 
 5.5 Section 409A . The Company intends that this Retirement Policy be structured to comply with, or be exempt from, Section 409A, such that no adverse tax consequences, interest or penalties under Section 409A apply. The Company makes no representations or warranties as to an Award s tax treatment under Section 409A or otherwise. The Company will have no obligation under this Section 5.5 or otherwise to avoid the taxes, penalties or interest under Section 409A with respect to any Award and will have no liability to any Participant or any other person if any Award is determined to constitute noncompliant nonqualified deferred compensation subject to taxes, penalties or interest under Section 409A. Notwithstanding any contrary provision in the Retirement Policy, any payment(s) of nonqualified deferred compensation required to be made under an Award pursuant to this Retirement Policy to a specified employee (as defined under Section 409A and as the Administrator determines) due to his or her separation from service will, to the extent necessary to avoid taxes under Section 409A(a)(2)(B)(i) of the Code, be delayed for the six-month period immediately following such separation from service (or, if earlier, until the specified employee s death) and will instead be paid on the day immediately following such six-month period or as soon as administratively practicable thereafter (without interest). Any payments of nonqualified deferred compensation made pursuant to this Retirement Policy that are payable more than six months following the Participant s separation from service will be paid at the time or times the payments are otherwise scheduled to be made. In any case where a Participant s separation from service and the date the release becomes effective and irrevocable fall in two separate taxable years, any payment(s) of nonqualified deferred compensation required to be made under an Award pursuant to this Retirement Policy shall be made in the latter taxable year. 
 5.6 Unfunded Status . The Retirement Policy is intended to be an unfunded plan for incentive compensation. With respect to any payments not yet made to a Participant pursuant to an Award, nothing contained in the Retirement Policy shall give the Participant any rights that are greater than those of a general creditor of the Company or any Subsidiary. 
 5.7 Indemnification . Notwithstanding any other provisions of the Retirement Policy, no individual acting as a director, officer, other employee or agent of the Company or any Subsidiary will be liable to any Participant, former Participant, spouse, beneficiary or any other person for any claim, loss, liability or expense incurred in connection with the Retirement Policy, and such individual will not be personally liable with respect to the Retirement Policy because of any act or omission, or any contract or other instrument executed, in his or her capacity as an Administrator, director, officer, other employee or agent of the Company or any Subsidiary. The Company will indemnify and hold harmless each director, officer, other employee and agent of the Company or any Subsidiary that has been or will be granted or delegated any duty or power relating to the Retirement Policy s administration or interpretation, against any cost or expense (including attorneys fees) or liability (including any sum paid in settlement of a claim with the Administrator s approval) arising from any act or omission concerning this Retirement Policy unless arising from such person s own fraud or bad faith. 
 5.8 Relationship to Other Benefits . No payment under the Retirement Policy will be taken into account in determining any benefits under any pension, retirement, savings, profit sharing, 
 4 

group insurance, welfare or other benefit plan of the Company or any Subsidiary except as expressly provided in writing in such other plan or an agreement thereunder. 
 5.9 Expenses . The expenses of administering the Retirement Policy shall be borne by the Company and its Subsidiaries. 
 5.10 No Contract of Employment . The adoption and maintenance of this Retirement Policy shall not be deemed to be a contract between the Company and any person or to be consideration for the employment of or service by any person. Nothing herein contained shall be deemed to give any person the right to be a Service Provider of the Company or its Subsidiaries or to restrict the right of the Company or its Subsidiaries to terminate the employment or service of such person at any time, with or without cause, nor shall this Retirement Policy be deemed to give the Company the right to require any person to remain as a Service Provider of the Company or to restrict any person s right to resign at any time. 
 5.11 Titles and Headings . The titles and headings in the Retirement Policy are for convenience of reference only and, if any conflict, the Retirement Policy s text, rather than such titles or headings, will control. 
 5.12 Number and Gender . Any reference in this Retirement Policy to the singular includes the plural where appropriate, and any reference in this Retirement Policy to the masculine gender includes the feminine and neuter genders where appropriate.
