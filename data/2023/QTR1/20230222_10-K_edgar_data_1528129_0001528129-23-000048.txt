 Part I 
 
 Item 1. Business 
 Except where the context indicates otherwise, amounts, numbers, dollars and percentages presented in this Annual Report are rounded and therefore approximate. Unless the context otherwise requires, references in this Annual Report to "Vital," the "Company," "we," "our," "us," or similar terms refer to Vital Energy, Inc. and its subsidiaries at the applicable time, including former subsidiaries and predecessor companies, as applicable. For a full discussion of the development of our business, see "Part I, Item 1. Business" in our 2019 Annual Report on Form 10-K . 
 Overview 
 Vital Energy, Inc., together with its wholly-owned subsidiaries, is an independent energy company focused on the acquisition, exploration and development of oil and natural gas properties in the Permian Basin of West Texas. The oil and liquids-rich Permian Basin is characterized by multiple target horizons, extensive production histories, long-lived reserves, high drilling success rates and high initial production rates. As of December 31, 2022, we had assembled 163,286 net acres in the Permian Basin, all of which were held in 371 sections. Our acreage is largely contiguous in the neighboring Texas counties of Borden, Howard, Glasscock, Reagan, and Sterling. We have identified one operating segment: exploration and production. 
 Business Strategy and 2022 Operational Highlights 
 Our strategy is to create long-term value through the efficient development and acquisition of high-margin properties, combined with prudent balance sheet management and sustainable environmental practices. We have operated in the Permian Basin since 2008, drilling almost 650 operated horizontal wells. Our extensive operating experience in the basin underpins our ability to successfully develop our properties, assess acquisition opportunities and operate safely and efficiently, ultimately maximizing our rates of return on our development program. 
 Beginning in late 2019, we acquired oil-weighted properties to the north and west of our existing Permian Basin acreage and quickly transitioned our development activities to these capital-efficient areas. We have significantly increased our oil production as a percentage of total production, improved our operating margin and, as a result, generated Free Cash Flow and significantly reduced debt in 2022. 
 Our results in 2022 were driven by our development program in Howard County. We focused on developing large packages of wells at conservative spacing to maximize both current and future productivity. Combined with continued efficiency gains in our drilling and completions operations and sustained strength in oil prices, our development program generated high returns and Free Cash Flow. Additionally, we divested non-operated properties in Howard County for 110.0 million, generating additional cash flow and enhancing control of our capital investments. 
 We seek to proactively manage our financial risks and maintain a strong balance sheet. During 2022, we utilized Free Cash Flow and divestiture proceeds to repurchase, and retire, a total of 284.8 million in aggregate principal amount of our senior unsecured notes, thereby reducing our consolidated total leverage ratio to 1.2 times. We increased our borrowing base to 1.3 billion and our elected commitment to 1.0 billion, increasing our liquidity and financial flexibility. Additionally, in May 2022 we instituted an equity repurchase program as a method to return cash to shareholders. During 2022 we repurchased 37.3 million of equity, reducing shares outstanding by 490,536 shares. We have historically hedged our production to protect cash flows, achieve strong rates of return on our capital investments and protect the Company in times of declining commodity prices. We entered 2022 with approximately 73 of our expected oil production hedged to protect cash flow and we will continue to seek hedging opportunities on a multi-year basis, subject to the terms of our Senior Secured Credit Facility, to further protect our capital plan, interest payments, and Free Cash Flow generation. 
 We integrate robust environmental, social and governance ("ESG") practices into our operations and describe these practices in the three ESG and Climate Risk Reports we have published to date, covering operations which occurred in 2019, 2020 and 2021, respectively. The disclosures in these three reports are aligned to the Sustainability Accounting Standards Board, the Task Force on Climate Related Financial Disclosures, the International Petroleum Industry Environmental Conservation Association, the American Petroleum Institute, and the American Exploration and Production Council frameworks. Our 2020

Table of Contents 

 report, related to our 2019 operations, announced ambitious emissions reductions targets and outlined goals for reducing both greenhouse gas intensity and methane emissions, as well as eliminating routine flaring by 2025. Additionally, our 2022 report expanded our emissions reduction targets to include a 2025 target for the percentage of recycled water to be used in our completions operations as well as a 2030 combined Scope 1 and Scope 2 greenhouse gas intensity target. Beyond our emissions reduction targets, we also disclosed climate-related scenario analysis, Scope 3 emissions estimates, and EEO-1 workforce diversity data. Furthermore, we described our pilot program for continuous emissions monitoring and the certification of portions of our oil and natural gas production as responsibly sourced through the Project Canary TrustWell TM Certification pilot project, the first operator in the Permian Basin to achieve this certification. Relatedly, we continue to incorporate environmental measures into our executive compensation program. 
 Our business strategy is both clear and sustainable. We will continue to focus on safely developing our highest return oil-weighted inventory while opportunistically adding more high-margin acreage as we seek to improve our margins and profitability. We are highly selective in the projects that we consider, and we will continue to monitor the market for strategic opportunities that we believe could be accretive and enhance shareholder value. These opportunities may take the form of acquisitions, divestitures, mergers, redemptions, equity or debt repurchases, or other similar transactions, any of which could result in the utilization of our Senior Secured Credit Facility and/or further accessing the capital markets. 
 Operating Areas 
 We currently focus our exploration, development and production efforts in one geographic operating area, the Permian Basin. 
 Well Data 
 We are currently focusing our development activities on horizontal drilling targets in the Wolfcamp and Spraberry formations. As of December 31, 2022, we had an average working interest of 73 in Vital-operated active productive wells and 67 in all wells in which Vital has an interest, and our leases are 98 held by production. 
 The following table sets forth certain information regarding productive wells as of December 31, 2022. Wells are classified as oil or natural gas wells according to the predominant production stream. All but sixteen of our wells are classified as oil wells, all of which also produce liquids-rich natural gas and condensate when in a producing status. We also own royalty and overriding royalty interests in a small number of wells in which we do not own a working interest.

 Drilling Activity 
 On December 31, 2022, we had two drilling rigs drilling horizontal wells and one completions crew. We anticipate running two drilling rigs and two completions crews in the first quarter of 2023. For the remainder of 2023, we anticipate running two drilling rigs and one completions crew. We will adjust our drilling rig count and/or completions crews to maximize efficiencies and cash flow. If we decrease our drilling rig count and/or completions crews, it will have a negative impact on our production. See "Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Liquidity and capital resources" and Note 15 to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report for additional information. 
 The following table summarizes our drilling activity with respect to the number of wells completed and turned-in line for the periods presented. Gross wells reflect the sum of all wells in which we own an interest. Net wells reflect the sum of our working interests in gross wells.

 (1) See " Our operations Estimated proved reserves" for discussion of the prices utilized to estimate our reserves. 
 Our estimated proved reserves as of December 31, 2022 assume our ability to fund the capital costs necessary for their development and are affected by pricing assumptions. See Note 6 to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report for additional discussion of our Realized Prices. See "Item 1A. Risk Factors Risks related to our business Estimating reserves and future net cash flows involves uncertainties. Negative revisions to reserve estimates, decreases in oil, NGL and natural gas prices or increases in service costs, may lead to decreased earnings and increased losses or impairment of oil and natural gas properties." The following table sets forth additional information regarding our estimated proved reserves as of the dates presented:

 Technology used to establish proved reserves 
 Under SEC rules, proved reserves are those quantities of oil, NGL and natural gas that by analysis of geoscience and engineering data can be estimated with "reasonable certainty" to be economically producible from a given date forward from known reservoirs, and under existing economic conditions, operating methods and government regulations. Reasonable certainty implies a high degree of confidence that the quantities of oil, NGL and/or natural gas actually recovered will equal or exceed the estimate. Reasonable certainty can be established using techniques that have been proven effective by actual 
 12 

Table of Contents 

 production from projects in the same reservoir or an analogous reservoir or by other evidence using reliable technology that establishes reasonable certainty. Reliable technology is a grouping of one or more technologies (including computational methods) that has been field tested and has been demonstrated to provide reasonably certain results with consistency and repeatability in the formation being evaluated or in an analogous formation. 
 To establish reasonable certainty with respect to our estimated proved reserves, our internal reserve engineers and Ryder Scott, our independent reserve engineers, employed reliable technologies that have been demonstrated to yield results with consistency and repeatability. 
 Qualifications of technical persons and internal controls over reserves estimation process 
 In accordance with the Standards Pertaining to the Estimating and Auditing of Oil and Gas Reserves Information promulgated by the Society of Petroleum Engineers ("SPE Reserves Auditing Standards") and guidelines established by the SEC, Ryder Scott, our independent reserve engineers, estimated 100 of our proved reserve information as of December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020 included in this Annual Report. The technical persons responsible for preparing the reserve estimates presented herein meet the requirements regarding qualifications, independence, objectivity and confidentiality set forth in the SPE Reserves Auditing Standards. 
 We maintain an internal staff of petroleum engineers and geoscience professionals who work closely with our independent reserve engineers to ensure the integrity, accuracy and timeliness of data furnished to Ryder Scott in their reserves estimation process. Our technical team meets regularly with representatives of Ryder Scott to review properties and discuss methods and assumptions used in Ryder Scott's preparation of the year-end reserve estimates. The Ryder Scott reserve report is reviewed with representatives of Ryder Scott and our internal technical staff before dissemination of the information. 
 Our Director of Reserves serves as the technical person primarily responsible for overseeing the preparation of our reserves estimates. She has more than 20 years of practical experience, with 8 years of this experience being in the estimation and evaluation of reserves. She has a Bachelor of Science in Petroleum Engineering from the Missouri University of Science and Technology. Our Director of Reserves reports to our Chief Financial Officer. Reserve estimates are reviewed and approved by our senior engineering staff, other members of senior management and our technical staff, our audit committee and our Chief Executive Officer. 
 Proved undeveloped reserves 
 We limit the portion of reserves categorized as "proved undeveloped" or "PUD" in order to emphasize operations on our most economic investments, maximize operational flexibility and maintain conservative assurance that all PUD locations will be converted despite potential commodity price volatility. 
 Our proved undeveloped reserves decreased from 86,592 MBOE as of December 31, 2021 to 79,401 MBOE as of December 31, 2022. We estimate that we incurred 337.9 million of costs to convert 23,722 MBOE of proved undeveloped reserves from 44 locations into proved developed reserves in 2022. New proved undeveloped reserves of 30,291 MBOE were added during the year from 34 Spraberry and 32 Wolfcamp locations. 13,155 MBOE of negative revisions consisted of 9,785 MBOE of negative revisions due to 16 proved undeveloped locations that were removed due to change in the development plan and 3,370 MBOE of negative revisions from a decrease in previously estimated quantities due to performance, price and other changes. A final investment decision has been made on all 153 proved undeveloped locations, and they are scheduled to be developed within five years from the date they were initially recorded. 
 Estimated total future development and abandonment costs related to the development of proved undeveloped reserves as shown in our December 31, 2022 reserve report are 1.3 billion. Based on this report and our PUD booking methodology, the capital estimated to be spent to develop the proved undeveloped reserves from spud date through production is 529.0 million in 2023, 321.0 million in 2024, 222.7 million in 2025, 128.6 million in 2026 and 14.6 million in 2027. Based on our anticipated cash flows and capital expenditures, as well as the availability of capital markets transactions, all of the proved undeveloped locations are expected to be drilled and completed from 2023 to 2026. Reserve calculations at any end-of-year period are representative of our development plans at that time. Changes in circumstance, including commodity pricing, oilfield service costs, drilling and production results, technology, acreage position and availability and other economic and regulatory factors may lead to changes in development plans.

 Acreage 
 The following table sets forth our developed and undeveloped acreage as of December 31, 2022, including acreage HBP. A majority of our developed acreage is subject to liens securing our Senior Secured Credit Facility.

 Of the total undeveloped acreage identified as potentially expiring over the next five years as of December 31, 2022, 1,881 net acres have associated PUD reserves included in our reserve report as of December 31, 2022, which we anticipate drilling to hold or renewing the associated leases. These PUD reserves represent 35 of our total PUD reserves as of December 31, 2022. 
 Of the total undeveloped acreage identified as potentially expiring over the next five years as of December 31, 2021, 2,355 net acres had associated PUD reserves on our reserve report as of December 31, 2021. Of the total undeveloped acreage identified as potentially expiring in 2022, zero net acres were not retained through either lease renewals or operations. 
 Marketing 
 We market the majority of production from properties we operate for both our account and the account of the other working interest owners. We sell substantially all of our production under contracts ranging from terms of one month to multiple years, all at monthly calculated market prices. We typically sell production to a relatively limited number of customers, as is customary in the exploration, development and production business; however, we believe that our customer diversification affords us optionality in our sales destination. 
 We are committed to deliver, for sale or transportation, fixed volumes of product under certain contractual arrangements that specify the delivery of a fixed and determinable quantity. The following table presents our material firm sale and transportation commitments as of December 31, 2022: 
 Total 2023 2024 2025 2026 and after Crude oil (MBbl): Sales commitments 7,875 7,875 Transportation commitments: Field 21,930 10,950 10,980 To U.S. Gulf Coast 54,285 12,775 12,810 12,775 15,925 Natural gas (MMcf): Sales commitments 54,378 11,402 8,435 7,378 27,163 Total commitments (MBOE) (1)

 We have firm field transportation agreements that enable us or the purchasers of our oil production to transport oil from our production area to major market hubs, including Midland, Texas and Crane, Texas. If not fulfilled, we are subject to transportation payments on excess pipeline capacity and other contractual penalties. These commitments are normal and customary for our business. Our firm field transportation agreements are related to transportation commitments extending into 2024 with Medallion Pipeline Company, LLC ("Medallion") under which Medallion provides firm transportation capacity from our established Reagan County and Glasscock County acreage for redelivery to various major market hubs. In addition, we have a transportation commitment with Gray Oak Pipeline, LLC extending into 2027 to transport 35,000 barrels of oil per day of our production, or the oil purchased from third parties, from Crane, Texas to the U.S. Gulf Coast. We believe these commitments enhance our ability to efficiently market our crude oil at various locations both in and out of the Permian Basin and give us access to multiple pricing points for the sale of our crude oil. 
 We have committed to deliver, for sale or transportation, fixed volumes of product under certain contractual arrangements that specify the delivery of a fixed and determinable quantity. See Note 15 to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report for further discussion of our transportation commitments. 
 We believe that we could sell our production to numerous companies, so that the loss of any one of our major purchasers would not have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations solely by reason of such loss. For discussion on purchasers that individually accounted for 10 or more of each (i) oil, NGL and natural gas sales and (ii) sales of purchased oil in at least one of the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020, see Note 14 to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report. See also "Item 1A. Risk Factors Risks related to our business The inability of our significant customers to meet their obligations to us may materially adversely affect our financial results." 
 Title to properties 
 We believe that we have satisfactory title to all of our producing properties in accordance with generally accepted industry standards. As is customary in the industry, in the case of undeveloped properties, often cursory investigation of record title is made at the time of lease acquisition. Investigations are made before the consummation of an acquisition of producing properties and before commencement of drilling operations on undeveloped properties. Individual properties may be subject to burdens that we believe do not materially interfere with the use or affect the value of the properties. Burdens on properties may include customary royalty interests, liens incident to operating agreements and for current taxes, obligations or duties under applicable laws, development obligations under oil and gas leases or net profit interests. 
 The typical oil and natural gas lease agreement covering our properties provides for the payment of royalties to the mineral owner for all oil, NGL and natural gas produced from any wells drilled on the leased premises. The lessor royalties and other leasehold burdens on our properties generally range from 12.5 to 25 , resulting in a net revenue interest to us generally ranging from 75 to 87.5 . 
 Seasonality 
 Demand for oil and natural gas generally decreases during the spring and fall months and increases during the summer and winter months. However, seasonal anomalies such as mild winters or mild summers sometimes lessen this fluctuation. In addition, certain natural gas users utilize natural gas storage facilities and purchase some of their anticipated winter requirements during the summer. This can also lessen seasonal demand fluctuations. These seasonal anomalies can increase competition for equipment, supplies and personnel during the spring and summer months, which could lead to shortages and increase costs or delay our operations. 
 Regulation of the oil and natural gas industry 
 Our operations are substantially affected by federal, state and local laws and regulations. In particular, the production of oil and natural gas is subject to regulation under a wide range of local, state and federal statutes, rules, orders and regulations. Federal, state and local statutes and regulations require permits for drilling operations, drilling bonds and reports concerning operations. The State of Texas has regulations governing environmental and conservation matters, including provisions for the pooling of oil and natural gas properties, the permitting of allocation wells, the establishment of maximum allowable rates of production from oil and natural gas wells (including the proration of production to the market demand for oil, NGL and natural gas), the regulation of well spacing, the handling and disposal or discharge of waste materials and plugging and 
 15 

Table of Contents 

 abandonment of wells. The effect of these regulations is to limit the amount of oil, NGL and natural gas that we can produce from our wells and to limit the number of wells or the locations at which we can drill, although we can apply for exceptions to such regulations or to have reductions in well spacing. Moreover, Texas imposes a production or severance tax with respect to the production and sale of oil, NGL and natural gas within its jurisdiction. Texas further regulates drilling and operating activities by, among other things, requiring permits and bonds for the drilling and operation of wells and regulating the location of wells, method of drilling and casing wells, surface use and restoration of properties upon which wells are drilled and plugging and abandonment of wells. The failure to comply with these rules and regulations can result in substantial penalties. Our competitors in the oil and natural gas industry are subject to the same regulatory requirements and restrictions that affect our operations. 
 The regulatory burden on the industry increases the cost of doing business and affects profitability. Additional proposals and proceedings that affect the natural gas industry are regularly considered by the current administration, Congress, the states, the Environmental Protection Agency ("EPA"), the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission ("FERC") and the courts. We cannot predict when or whether any such proposals may become effective, under the current or any future administration. 
 Oil and gas pipelines 
 Our oil and gas pipelines are subject to construction, installation, operation and safety regulation by the U.S. Department of Transportation ("DOT") and various other federal, state and local agencies. Congress has enacted several pipeline safety acts over the years. Currently, the Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety Administration ("PHMSA") under DOT administers pipeline safety requirements for natural gas and hazardous liquid pipelines. These regulations, among other things, address pipeline integrity management and pipeline operator qualification rules. In June 2016, Congress approved pipeline safety legislation, the "Protecting Our Infrastructure of Pipelines and Enhancing Safety Act of 2016" (the 2016 PIPES Act ), which provides the PHMSA with additional authority to address imminent hazards by imposing emergency restrictions, prohibitions and safety measures on owners and operators of gas or hazardous liquids pipeline facilities. In December 2020, the Protecting Our Infrastructure of Pipelines and Enhancing Safety Act of 2020 (the 2020 PIPES Act ), was signed into law. The 2020 PIPES Act extends the PHMSA s statutory mandate through 2023. It continues the legislative and regulatory mandates that were established in the 2016 PIPES Act and creates new mandates for PHMSA to abide by. Some of the key PHMSA regulations enacted in response to these pieces of legislation include final rules published on October 1, 2019, which took effect on July 1, 2020 to expand PHMSA s integrity management requirements and impose new pressure testing requirements on regulated pipelines, including certain segments outside high consequence areas. The rules also extend reporting requirements to certain previously unregulated hazardous liquid gravity and rural gathering lines. Also, on June 7, 2021, the PHMSA issued an advisory bulletin reminding pipeline owners and operators that they must take several steps to eliminate hazardous leaks and minimize releases of natural gas by December 27, 2021 pursuant to directives set forth in the 2020 PIPES Act. In addition, on November 15, 2021, the PHMSA published a final rule extending reporting requirements to all onshore gas gathering operators and establishing a set of minimum safety requirements for certain gas gathering pipelines with large diameters and high operating pressures. Additional final rules were announced in 2022, including a final rule regarding the installation of rupture-mitigation valves, published on April 8, 2022. Further, on August 24, 2022, the PHMSA published a final rule strengthening integrity management requirements for onshore gas transmission lines, bolstering corrosion control standards and repair criteria, and imposing new requirements for inspections after extreme weather events. Compliance with these regulations could require us to install new or modified safety controls, pursue additional capital projects or conduct maintenance programs on an accelerated basis, any or all of which tasks could result in our incurring increased operating costs that could have a material adverse effect on our results of operation or financial position. In addition, any material penalties or fines issued to us under these or other statutes, rules, regulations or orders could have an adverse impact on our business, financial condition, results of operation and cash flow. 
 States are largely pre-empted by federal law from regulating pipeline safety but may assume responsibility for enforcing intrastate pipeline regulations at least as stringent as the federal standards, and many states have undertaken responsibility to enforce the federal standards. The RRC is the agency vested with intrastate natural gas pipeline regulatory and enforcement authority in Texas. The Commission's regulations adopt by reference the minimum federal safety standards for the transportation of natural gas. In addition, on December 17, 2019, the Commission adopted rules requiring that operators of gathering lines take "appropriate" actions to fix safety hazards.

 Environmental and occupational health and safety matters 
 Our operations are subject to numerous stringent federal, state and local statutes and regulations governing the discharge of materials into the environment or otherwise relating to protection of the environment or occupational health and safety. Numerous governmental agencies, such as the EPA, issue regulations that often require difficult and costly compliance measures, the noncompliance with which carries substantial administrative, civil and criminal penalties and may result in injunctive obligations to remediate noncompliance. These laws and regulations may require the acquisition of a permit before drilling commences, restrict the types, quantities and concentrations of various substances that can be released into the environment in connection with drilling, production and transporting through pipelines, govern the sourcing and disposal of water used in the drilling, completion and production process, limit or prohibit drilling activities in certain areas and on certain lands lying within wilderness, wetlands, frontier, seismically active areas and other protected areas, require some form of remedial action to prevent or mitigate pollution from current or former operations such as plugging abandoned wells or closing earthen pits, result in the suspension or revocation of necessary permits, licenses and authorizations, require that additional pollution controls be installed and impose substantial liabilities for pollution resulting from operations or failure to comply with regulatory filings. In addition, these laws and regulations may restrict the rate of production. 
 Certain of these laws and regulations impose strict liability (i.e., no showing of "fault" is required) that, in some circumstances, may be joint and several. Public interest in the protection of the environment has tended to increase over time. The trend of more expansive and stringent environmental legislation and regulations applied to the oil and natural gas industry could continue, resulting in increased costs of doing business and consequently affecting profitability. Changes in environmental laws and regulations occur frequently, and to the extent laws are enacted or other governmental action is taken that restricts drilling or imposes more stringent and costly operating, waste handling, disposal and clean-up requirements, our business and prospects, as well as the oil and natural gas industry in general, could be materially adversely affected. 
 Hazardous substance and waste handling 
 Our operations are subject to environmental laws and regulations relating to the management and release of hazardous substances, solid and hazardous wastes, and petroleum hydrocarbons. These laws generally regulate the generation, storage, treatment, transportation and disposal of solid and hazardous waste and may impose strict and, in some cases, joint and several liability for the investigation and remediation of affected areas where hazardous substances may have been released or disposed. The Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act, as amended (referred to as "CERCLA" or the "Superfund law") and comparable state laws, impose liability, without regard to fault or the legality of the original conduct, on certain classes of persons deemed "responsible parties." These persons include current owners or operators of the site where a release of hazardous substances occurred, prior owners or operators that owned or operated the site at the time of the release or disposal of hazardous substances, and companies that disposed or arranged for the disposal of the hazardous substances found at the site. Under CERCLA, these persons may be subject to strict, joint and several liability for the costs of cleaning up the hazardous substances that have been released into the environment, for damages to natural resources and for the costs of certain health studies. CERCLA also authorizes the EPA and, in some instances, third parties to act in response to threats to the public health or the environment and to seek to recover the costs they incur from the responsible classes of persons. Despite the "petroleum exclusion" of Section 101(14) of CERCLA, which currently encompasses natural gas, we may nonetheless handle hazardous substances within the meaning of CERCLA, or similar state statutes, in the course of our ordinary operations and, as a result, may be jointly and severally liable under CERCLA for all or part of the costs required to clean up sites at which these hazardous substances have been released into the environment. In addition, we may have liability for releases of hazardous substances at our properties by prior owners or operators or other third parties. Finally, it is not uncommon for neighboring landowners and other third parties to file common law based claims for personal injury and property damage allegedly caused by hazardous substances or other pollutants released into the environment. 
 The Oil Pollution Act of 1990 (the "OPA") is the primary federal law imposing oil spill liability. The OPA contains numerous requirements relating to the prevention of and response to petroleum releases into waters of the United States, including the requirement that operators of offshore facilities and certain onshore facilities near or crossing waterways must maintain certain significant levels of financial assurance to cover potential environmental cleanup and restoration costs. Under the OPA, strict, joint and several liability may be imposed on "responsible parties" for all containment and clean-up costs and certain other damages arising from a release, including, but not limited to, the costs of responding to a release of oil to 
 17 

Table of Contents 

 surface waters and natural resource damages, resulting from oil spills into or upon navigable waters, adjoining shorelines or in the exclusive economic zone of the United States. A "responsible party" includes the owner or operator of an onshore facility. The OPA establishes a liability limit for onshore facilities, but these liability limits may not apply if: a spill is caused by a party's gross negligence or willful misconduct; the spill resulted from a violation of a federal safety, construction or operating regulation; or a party fails to report a spill or to cooperate fully in a clean-up. We are also subject to analogous state statutes that impose liabilities with respect to oil spills. 
 We also generate solid wastes, including hazardous wastes, which are subject to the requirements of the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act ("RCRA") and comparable state statutes. Although RCRA regulates both solid and hazardous wastes, it imposes strict requirements on the generation, storage, treatment, transportation and disposal of hazardous wastes. Certain petroleum production wastes are excluded from RCRA's hazardous waste regulations. These wastes, instead, are regulated under RCRA's less stringent solid waste provisions, state laws or other federal laws. It is also possible that these wastes, which could include wastes currently generated during our operations, will be designated as "hazardous wastes" in the future and, therefore, be subject to more rigorous and costly disposal requirements. Indeed, legislation has been proposed from time to time in Congress to re-categorize certain oil and natural gas exploration and production wastes as "hazardous wastes." Also, in December 2016, the EPA agreed in a consent decree to review its regulation of oil and gas waste. However, in April 2019, the EPA concluded that revisions to the federal regulations for the management of oil and gas waste are not necessary at this time. Any such changes in the laws and regulations could have a material adverse effect on our maintenance capital expenditures and operating expenses. 
 Water and other waste discharges and spills 
 The Federal Water Pollution Control Act, as amended, also known as the Clean Water Act, the Safe Drinking Water Act ("SDWA"), the OPA and comparable state laws impose restrictions and strict controls regarding the discharge of pollutants, including produced waters and other natural gas wastes, into federal and state waters. The discharge of pollutants into regulated waters is prohibited, except in accordance with the terms of a permit issued by the EPA or the state. The discharge of dredge and fill material in regulated waters, including wetlands, is also prohibited, unless authorized by a permit issued by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers ("Corps"). 
 The scope of waters regulated under the Clean Water Act has fluctuated in recent years. On June 29, 2015, the EPA and the Corps jointly promulgated final rules expanding the scope of waters protected under the Clean Water Act. However, on October 22, 2019, the agencies repealed the 2015 rules, and on April 21, 2020, the EPA and the Corps published a final rule replacing the 2015 rules, and significantly reduced the waters subject to federal regulation under the Clean Water Act. On August 30, 2021, a federal court struck down the replacement rule and on January 18, 2023, the EPA and the Corps published a final rule that would restore water protections that were in place prior to 2015. Meanwhile, in October 2022, the Supreme Court heard oral argument in a case addressing the scope of federal jurisdiction under the Clean Water Act. As a result of such recent developments, substantial uncertainty exists regarding the scope of waters protected under the Clean Water Act. To the extent the rules expand the range of properties subject to the Clean Water Act's jurisdiction, we could face increased costs and delays with respect to obtaining permits for dredge and fill activities in wetland areas. 
 The EPA has also adopted regulations requiring certain oil and natural gas exploration and production facilities to obtain individual permits or coverage under general permits for storm water discharges. Costs may be associated with the treatment of wastewater or developing and implementing storm water pollution prevention plans, as well as for monitoring and sampling the storm water runoff from certain of our facilities. The State of Texas also maintains groundwater protection programs that require permits for discharges or operations that may impact groundwater conditions. The underground injection of fluids is subject to permitting and other requirements under state laws and regulation. Obtaining permits has the potential to delay the development of oil and natural gas projects. These same regulatory programs also limit the total volume of water that can be discharged, hence limiting the rate of development, and require us to incur compliance costs. 
 These laws and any implementing regulations provide for administrative, civil and criminal penalties for any unauthorized discharges of oil and other substances and may impose substantial potential liability for the costs of removal, remediation and damages. Pursuant to these laws and regulations, we may be required to obtain and maintain approvals or permits for the discharge of wastewater or storm water and the underground injection of fluids and are required to develop and implement spill prevention, control and countermeasure plans, also referred to as "SPCC plans," in connection with on-site storage of significant quantities of oil.

 Hydraulic fracturing 
 We use hydraulic fracturing as a means to maximize the productivity of almost every well that we drill and complete. Hydraulic fracturing is a necessary part of the completion process for our producing properties in Texas because our properties are dependent upon our ability to effectively fracture the producing formations in order to produce at economic rates. While hydraulic fracturing is not required to maintain any of our leasehold acreage that is currently held by production from existing wells, it will be required in the future to develop the provided non-producing and proved undeveloped reserves associated with this acreage. Nearly all of our proved undeveloped reserves associated with future completion, recompletion and refracture stimulation projects require hydraulic fracturing. 
 Hydraulic fracturing is a practice that is used to stimulate production of hydrocarbons from tight formations. The process involves the injection of water, sand and chemicals under pressure into the formation to fracture the surrounding rock and stimulate production. We have and continue to follow standard industry practices and applicable legal requirements. These protective measures include setting surface casing at a depth sufficient to protect fresh water formations and cementing the well to create a permanent isolating barrier between the casing pipe and surrounding geological formations. This well design is intended to eliminate a pathway for the fracturing fluid to contact any aquifers. For recompletions of existing wells, the production casing is pressure tested prior to perforating the new completion interval. Injections rates and pressures are monitored in real time at the surface during our hydraulic fracturing operations. Pressure is monitored on both the injection string and the immediate annulus to the injection string. Our hydraulic fracturing operations are designed to be shut down immediately if an abrupt change occurred to the injection pressure or annular pressure. 
 Approximately 99 of the hydraulic fracturing fluids we use are made up of water and sand. The remainder of the constituents in the fracturing fluid are managed and used in accordance with applicable requirements. In accordance with Texas regulations, we report the constituents of the hydraulic fracturing fluids utilized in our well completions on FracFocus (www.fracfocus.org). Hydraulic fracture stimulation requires the use of a significant volume of water. Upon flowback of the water, we dispose of it by recycling or by discharging into the approved disposal wells. We currently do not discharge water to the surface. Based upon results of testing the performance of recycled flowback/produced water in our fracking operations, we endeavor to maximize the utilization of recycled flowback/produced water via our owned and operated recycling facilities in Glasscock and Reagan County or via contractual arrangements with third parties in Howard County. 
 The SDWA regulates the underground injection of substances through the Underground Injection Control Program (the "UIC"). However, hydraulic fracturing is generally exempt from regulation under the UIC, and thus the process is typically regulated by state oil and gas commissions. Nevertheless, the EPA has asserted federal regulatory authority over hydraulic fracturing involving diesel additives under the UIC. On February 12, 2014, the EPA published a revised UIC Program permitting guidance for oil and natural gas hydraulic fracturing activities using diesel fuel. The guidance document describes how Class II regulations may be tailored to address the purported unique risks of diesel fuel injection during the hydraulic fracturing process. Although the EPA is not the permitting authority for UIC Class II programs in Texas, where we maintain acreage, the EPA is encouraging state programs to review and consider use of this permit guidance. Furthermore, legislation has been proposed in recent sessions of Congress to repeal the hydraulic fracturing exemption from the SDWA, provide for federal regulation of hydraulic fracturing and require public disclosure of the chemicals used in the fracturing process. 
 In addition, on June 28, 2016, the EPA published a final rule prohibiting the discharge of wastewater from onshore unconventional oil and gas extraction facilities to publicly owned wastewater treatment plants. The EPA is also conducting a study of private wastewater treatment facilities (also known as centralized waste treatment, or CWT, facilities) accepting oil and gas extraction wastewater. The EPA is collecting data and information related to the extent to which CWT facilities accept such wastewater, available treatment technologies (and their associated costs), discharge characteristics, financial characteristics of CWT facilities, and the environmental impacts of discharges from CWT facilities. We cannot predict the impact that these actions may have on our business at this time, but further regulation of hydraulic fracturing activities could have a material impact on our business, financial condition and results of operation. 
 Also, on March 26, 2015, the Bureau of Land Management (the "BLM") published a final rule governing hydraulic fracturing on federal and Indian lands. The rule requires public disclosure of chemicals used in hydraulic fracturing, implementation of a casing and cementing program, management of recovered fluids, and submission to the BLM of detailed information about the proposed operation, including wellbore geology, the location of faults and fractures, and the depths of all usable water. On March 28, 2017, the Trump Administration issued an executive order directing the BLM to review the rule, and, if 
 19

 appropriate, to initiate a rulemaking to rescind or revise it. Accordingly, on December 29, 2017, the BLM published a final rule to rescind the 2015 hydraulic fracturing rule; however, a coalition of environmentalists, tribal advocates and the State of California filed lawsuits challenging the rule rescission. At this time, it is uncertain when, or if, the hydraulic fracturing rule will be implemented, and what impact it would have on our operations. 
 Furthermore, there are certain governmental reviews either under way or being proposed that focus on environmental aspects of hydraulic fracturing practices. On February 6, 2015, the EPA released a report with findings and recommendations related to public concern about induced seismic activity from disposal wells. The report recommends strategies for managing and minimizing the potential for significant injection-induced seismic events. Also, on December 13, 2016, the EPA released a study examining the potential for hydraulic fracturing activities to impact drinking water resources, finding that, under some circumstances, the use of water in hydraulic fracturing activities can impact drinking water resources. Other governmental agencies, including the U.S. Department of Energy and the U.S. Department of the Interior, have evaluated or are evaluating various other aspects of hydraulic fracturing. These ongoing or proposed studies, depending on their degree of pursuit and any meaningful results obtained, could spur initiatives to further regulate hydraulic fracturing under the SDWA or other regulatory mechanism. 
 Some states have adopted, and other states are considering adopting, regulations that could restrict hydraulic fracturing in certain circumstances, impose additional requirements on hydraulic fracturing activities or otherwise require the public disclosure of chemicals used in the hydraulic fracturing process. For example, pursuant to legislation adopted by the State of Texas in June 2011, beginning February 1, 2012, companies were required to disclose to the RRC and the public the chemical components used in the hydraulic fracturing process, as well as the volume of water used. Also, in May 2013, the RRC adopted new rules governing well casing, cementing and other standards for ensuring that hydraulic fracturing operations do not contaminate nearby water resources. The new rules took effect in January 2014. Additionally, on October 28, 2014, the RRC adopted disposal well rule amendments designed, among other things, to require applicants for new disposal wells that will receive non-hazardous produced water and hydraulic fracturing flowback fluid to conduct seismic activity searches utilizing the U.S. Geological Survey. The searches are intended to determine the potential for earthquakes within a circular area of 100 square miles around a proposed, new disposal well. The disposal well rule amendments, which became effective on November 17, 2014, also clarify the RRC's authority to modify, suspend or terminate a disposal well permit if scientific data indicates a disposal well is likely to contribute to seismic activity. The RRC has used this authority to deny permits and temporarily suspend operations for waste disposal wells and, in September 2021, the RRC curtailed the amount of water companies were permitted to inject into some wells near Midland and Odessa in the Permian Basin and has since indefinitely suspended some permits there and expanded the restrictions to other areas. These restrictions on the disposal of produced water could result in increased operating costs, forcing us or our service providers to truck produced water, recycle it or pump it through the pipeline network or other means, all of which could be costly. 
 A number of lawsuits and enforcement actions have been initiated across the country alleging that hydraulic fracturing practices have induced seismic activity and adversely impacted drinking water supplies, use of surface water, and the environment generally. Several states and municipalities have adopted, or are considering adopting, regulations that could restrict or prohibit hydraulic fracturing in certain circumstances. If these or any other new laws or regulations that significantly restrict hydraulic fracturing are adopted, such laws could make it more difficult or costly for us to drill and produce from tight formations as well as make it easier for third parties opposing the hydraulic fracturing process to initiate legal proceedings. In addition, if hydraulic fracturing is regulated at the federal level, fracturing activities could become subject to additional permitting and financial assurance requirements, more stringent construction specifications, increased monitoring, reporting and recordkeeping obligations, plugging and abandonment requirements and also to attendant permitting delays and potential increases in costs. These developments, as well as new laws or regulations, could cause us to incur substantial compliance costs, and compliance or the consequences of failure to comply by us could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations. At this time, it is not possible to estimate the potential impact on our business that may arise if federal or state legislation governing hydraulic fracturing is enacted into law. 
 Air quality 
 The federal Clean Air Act, as amended, and comparable state laws restrict the emission of air pollutants from many sources, including production facilities, salt water disposal facilities, and compressor stations, through the issuance of permits and the imposition of other requirements. In addition, the EPA has developed, and continues to develop, strict and stringent regulations governing emissions of toxic air pollutants at specified sources; emissions from specific sources such as tanks, 
 20 

Table of Contents 

 engines, dehydration units, and heaters; and maintenance requirements for such equipment. Also, on June 3, 2016, the EPA published a final rule regarding the criteria for aggregating multiple small surface sites into a single source for air-quality permitting purposes applicable to the oil and gas industry. This rule clarified the term adjacent and defined when sources are required to be aggregated. The consequences of these requirements are that smaller sites may need to be combined, triggering more stringent air permitting processes and requirements. Current air permitting regulations require us to obtain pre-approval for the construction or modification of projects or facilities expected to produce or increase air emissions. Once obtained these air permits require compliance with strict and stringent requirements and utilize specific equipment or technologies to control and monitor emissions of certain pollutants. The need to obtain air permits and emission control equipment prior to construction requires timely planning to ensure that the development of oil and natural gas projects is not delayed. 
 In August 2012, the EPA published New Source Performance Standards ("NSPS") and National Emission Standards for Hazardous Air Pollutants for oil and natural gas production, processing, transmission, and storage operations. The rules include NSPS for completions of hydraulically fractured gas wells and establish specific new requirements for emissions from compressors, pneumatic controllers, dehydrators, storage vessels, natural gas processing plants and certain other equipment. This rule was promulgated and implemented to reduce emissions from volatile organic compounds ("VOC"). On June 3, 2016 the EPA published additional standards for methane and VOC emissions for certain new, modified, and reconstructed equipment, processes, and activities across the oil and natural gas sector, including Leak Detection and Repair ("LDAR") programs, emission controls for tanks, verification of closed vent systems, and compressor requirements. Regulation of oil and natural gas facilities continues to expand and become more rigorous. On November 15, 2021, the EPA published a proposed rule for oil and natural gas facilities that would expand control requirements, increase LDAR inspection frequencies, prohibit venting of natural gas in certain situations, require equipment retrofits, and regulate older facilities. Also, on December 6, 2022, the EPA published a supplemental proposal to strengthen the emission reduction requirements, which would, among other things, expand LDAR requirements and tighten flaring restrictions. 
 In addition, on November 18, 2016, the BLM finalized a waste prevention rule to reduce the flaring, venting and leaking of methane from oil and gas operations on federal and Indian lands. The rule requires operators to use currently available technologies and equipment to reduce flaring, periodically inspect their operations for leaks, and replace outdated equipment that vents large quantities of gas into the air. The rule also clarifies when operators owe the government royalties for flared gas. On March 28, 2017, the Trump Administration issued an executive order directing the BLM to review the above rule and, if appropriate, to initiate a rulemaking to rescind or revise it. On September 28, 2018, the BLM finalized revisions to the waste prevention rule to reduce "unnecessary compliance burdens." However, a federal court struck down the scaled-back rule on July 15, 2020, and shortly thereafter, on October 8, 2020, another federal court struck down the 2016 waste prevention rule. On November 30, 2022, the BLM published a proposed replacement rule to reduce the waste of natural gas from venting, flaring and leaks during oil and gas production activities on federal and Indian lands, which would require the use of upgraded equipment in some cases and would place time and volume limits on royalty-free flaring. At this time, it is uncertain when, and to what extent, the waste prevention rule will be implemented, and what impact it will have on our operations. 
 The above standards, as well as any future laws and their implementing regulations, require us to obtain pre-approval for the expansion or modification of existing facilities or the construction of new facilities expected to produce air emissions and impose stringent air permit requirements. These regulations also mandate the use of specific equipment or technologies to minimize, eliminate, or control emissions. Our failure to comply with these requirements could subject us to monetary penalties, injunctions, conditions or restrictions on operations and, potentially, criminal enforcement actions. 
 We have incurred additional capital expenditures, which were not material, to comply with these new regulations as they come into effect. We may also be required to incur additional capital expenditures in the next few years for air pollution control equipment needed to comply with new air regulations, maintaining or obtaining operating permits addressing other air emission related issues, which may have a material adverse effect on our operations and has the potential to delay the development of oil and natural gas projects. 
 "Greenhouse gas" emissions 
 In recent years, federal, state and local governments have taken steps to reduce emissions of greenhouse gases ("GHGs"). In August 2022, President Biden signed the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 IRA into law. The IRA contains billions of dollars in incentives for the development of renewable energy, clean hydrogen, clean fuels, electric vehicles, investments in advanced 
 21 

Table of Contents 

 biofuels and supporting infrastructure and carbon capture and sequestration, amongst other provisions. These incentives could accelerate the transition of the economy away from the use of fossil fuels towards lower- or zero-carbon emissions alternatives, which could decrease demand for, and in turn the prices of, the oil and natural gas that we produce and sell. In addition, the IRA imposes the first ever federal fee on the emission of GHGs through a methane emissions charge. The IRA amends the Clean Air Act to impose a fee on the emission of methane that exceeds an applicable waste emissions threshold from sources required to report their GHG emissions to the EPA, including those sources in the offshore and onshore petroleum and natural gas production and gathering and boosting source categories. The methane emissions charge would start in calendar year 2024 at 900 per ton of methane, increase to 1,200 in 2025, and be set at 1,500 for 2026 and each year after. Calculation of the fee is based on certain thresholds established in the IRA. 
 The EPA has also finalized a series of GHG monitoring, reporting and emission control rules for the oil and natural gas industry and almost one-half of the states have taken measures to reduce GHG emissions primarily through the development of GHG emission inventories and/or regional GHG cap-and-trade programs. Also, states have imposed increasingly stringent requirements related to the venting or flaring of gas during oil and gas operations. In addition, several states have enacted renewable portfolio standards, which require utilities to purchase a certain percentage of their energy from renewable fuel sources. 
 At the international level, in December 2015, the United States participated in the 21st Conference of the Parties of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change in Paris, France. The resulting Paris Agreement calls for the parties to undertake "ambitious efforts" to limit the average global temperature and to conserve and enhance sinks and reservoirs of GHGs. The Paris Agreement went into effect on November 4, 2016. Although the United States withdrew from the Paris Agreement, effective November 4, 2020, President Biden issued an Executive Order on January 20, 2021 to rejoin the Paris Agreement, which took effect on February 19, 2021. On April 21, 2021, the United States announced that it was setting an economy-wide target of reducing its GHG emissions by 50-52 percent below 2005 levels in 2030. In November 2021, in connection with the 26th Conference of the Parties in Glasgow, Scotland, the United States and other world leaders made further commitments to reduce GHGs, including reducing global methane emissions by at least 30 by 2030. In relation, many state and local leaders have stated their intent to intensify efforts to support the international climate commitments. 
 Restrictions on GHG emissions that may be imposed could adversely affect the oil and gas industry. The adoption of legislation or regulatory programs to reduce GHG emissions could require us to incur increased operating costs, such as costs to purchase and operate emissions control systems, to acquire emissions allowances or comply with new regulatory requirements. Any GHG emissions legislation or regulatory programs applicable to power plants or refineries could also increase the cost of consuming, and thereby reduce demand for, the oil, NGL and natural gas we produce. Consequently, legislation and regulatory programs to reduce GHG emissions could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. 
 In addition, there have also been efforts in recent years to influence the investment community, including investment advisors and certain sovereign wealth, pension and endowment funds promoting divestment of fossil fuel equities and pressuring lenders to limit funding to companies engaged in the extraction of fossil fuel reserves. Such environmental activism and initiatives aimed at limiting climate change and reducing air pollution could interfere with our business activities, operations and ability to access capital. Furthermore, claims have been made against certain energy companies alleging that greenhouse gas emissions from oil and natural gas operations constitute a public nuisance under federal and/or state common law. As a result, private individuals or public entities may seek to enforce environmental laws and regulations against us and could allege personal injury, property damages or other liabilities. While our business is not a party to any such litigation, we could be named in actions making similar allegations. An unfavorable ruling in any such case could significantly impact our operations and could have an adverse impact on our financial condition. 
 Occupational Safety and Health Act 
 Certain of our operations are subject to applicable requirements of the federal Occupational Safety and Health Act, as amended ("OSHA") and comparable state laws that regulate the protection of the health and safety of employees. In addition, OSHA's hazard communication standard requires that information be maintained about hazardous materials used or produced in our operations and that certain information be provided to employees, state and local government authorities and citizens.

 National Environmental Policy Act 
 Oil and natural gas exploration and production activities on federal lands are subject to the National Environmental Policy Act ("NEPA"). NEPA requires federal agencies, including the Departments of Interior and Agriculture, to evaluate major agency actions having the potential to significantly impact the environment. In the course of such evaluations, an agency prepares an environmental assessment to evaluate the potential direct, indirect and cumulative impacts of a proposed project. If impacts are considered significant, the agency will prepare a more detailed environmental impact study that is made available for public review and comment. Any exploration and production activities, as well as proposed exploration and development plans, on federal lands would require governmental permits that are subject to the requirements of NEPA. This environmental impact assessment process has the potential to delay the development of oil and natural gas projects. Authorizations under NEPA also are subject to protest, appeal or litigation, which can delay or halt projects. 
 Endangered Species Act 
 The Endangered Species Act ("ESA") was established to protect endangered and threatened species. Pursuant to the ESA, if a species is listed as threatened or endangered, restrictions may be imposed on activities adversely affecting that species or its habitat. Similar protections are offered to migratory birds under the Migratory Bird Treaty Act. The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service may designate critical habitat and suitable habitat areas that it believes are necessary for survival of a threatened or endangered species. A critical habitat or suitable habitat designation could result in further material restrictions to federal land use and may materially delay or prohibit land access for oil and natural gas development. If newly listed species, such as the lesser prairie chicken, are located in areas where we operate or previously unprotected species, such as the dunes sagebrush lizard, are designated as endangered or threatened, or if we were to have a portion of our leases designated as critical or suitable habitat, it could cause us to incur additional costs or become subject to operating restrictions or bans in the affected areas, which could adversely impact the value of our leases. 
 Summary 
 We believe we are in substantial compliance with currently applicable environmental federal, state and local laws and regulations and that we hold all necessary, valid and up-to-date permits, registrations and other authorizations required under such laws and regulations or are in the process of obtaining such items. However, current regulatory requirements may change, currently unforeseen incidents may occur or past non-compliance with laws or regulations may be discovered, and such laws and regulations are frequently amended or reinterpreted. Therefore, we are unable to predict the future costs or impacts of compliance. Although we have not experienced any material adverse effect from compliance with environmental requirements and believe that the current costs of compliance are appropriately reflected in our budget, there is no assurance that this will continue. We did not have any material capital or other non-recurring expenditures in connection with complying with environmental laws and regulations or environmental remediation matters during the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021 or 2020. 
 Regulation of derivatives 
 The July 2010 Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (the "Dodd-Frank Act") provides for federal oversight of the over-the-counter derivatives market and entities that participate in that market and mandates that the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (the "CFTC"), the SEC, and federal regulators of financial institutions (the "Prudential Regulators") adopt rules or regulations implementing the Dodd-Frank Act and providing definitions of terms used in the Dodd-Frank Act. The Dodd-Frank Act establishes margin requirements and requires clearing and trade execution practices for certain market participants and may result in certain market participants needing to curtail or cease their derivatives activities. 
 The CFTC, the SEC and the Prudential Regulators have issued many rules to implement the Dodd-Frank Act, including rules (the "Adopted Derivatives Rules") (i) requiring clearing of hedges, or swaps, that are subject to the Dodd-Frank Act (currently, only certain interest rate and credit default swaps, which we do not presently have) (the "Mandatory Clearing Rule"), and also establishing an "end user" exception to the Mandatory Clearing Rule (the "End User Exception"), (ii) setting forth collateral requirements in connection with swaps that are not cleared (the "Margin Rule") and also an exception to the Margin Rule for end users that are not financial end users (the "Non-Financial End User Exception") and (iii) imposing position limits on certain 
 23 

Table of Contents 

 futures contracts, including the NYMEX "Henry Hub" gas contract and "Light Sweet Crude" oil contract, and economically equivalent swaps (the "Position Limit Rule"). The Position Limit Rule took effect March 15, 2021 and the position limits, other than those for economically equivalent swaps provided for in the Position Limit Rule, took effect on January 1, 2022; the position limits for economically equivalent swaps took effect on January 1, 2023. The Position Limit Rule provides an exemption from the position limits for swaps that constitute "bona fide hedging positions" within the definition of such term under the Position Limit Rule, subject to the party claiming the exemption complying with the applicable filing, recordkeeping and reporting requirements of the Position Limit Rule. 
 We qualify for the End User Exception and will utilize it if the Mandatory Clearing Rule is expanded to cover swaps in which we participate. We qualify for the Non-Financial End User Exception and will not be required to post margin in connection with uncleared swaps under the Margin Rule. Our existing and anticipated hedging positions constitute "bona fide hedging positions" under the Position Limit Rule, and we intend to undertake the filing, recordkeeping and reporting necessary to utilize the bona fide hedging position exemption under the Position Limit Rule, so we do not expect to be directly affected by any such rules. However, most if not all of our hedge counterparties will be subject to mandatory clearing in connection with their hedging activities with parties who do not qualify for the End User Exception and will be required to post margin in connection with their hedging activities with other swap dealers, major swap participants, financial end users and other persons that do not qualify for the Non-Financial End User Exception. In addition, the European Union and other non-U.S. jurisdictions have enacted laws and regulations (including laws and regulations giving the European Union financial authorities the power to write down amounts we may be owed on hedging agreements with counterparties subject to such laws and regulations and/or require that we accept equity interests in such counterparties in lieu of cash in satisfaction of such amounts, collectively the "Foreign Regulations"), which may apply to our transactions with counterparties subject to such Foreign Regulations (the "Foreign Counterparties") and the U.S. adopted law and rules (the "U.S. Resolution Stay Rules") clarifying similar rights of U.S. banking authorities with respect to banking institutions subject to their regulation.

 Item 1A. Risk Factors 
 Our business involves a high degree of risk. If any of the following risks, or any risks described elsewhere in this Annual Report, were actually to occur, our business, financial condition or results of operations could be materially adversely affected and the trading price of our shares could decline resulting in the loss of part or all of your investment. The risks described below are not the only ones facing us. Additional risks not presently known to us or which we currently consider immaterial may also adversely affect us. 
 Risks related to our business 
 Continuing or worsening inflationary pressures and associated changes in monetary policy have resulted in and may result in additional increases to our drilling and completions costs and costs of oilfield services, equipment, and materials, which in turn have caused and may continue to cause our capital expenditures and operating costs to rise. 
 The U.S. inflation rate increased in 2021 and 2022 and may continue to increase in 2023. These inflationary pressures have resulted in and may result in additional increases to our drilling and completions costs and costs of oilfield services, equipment, and materials, which in turn have caused and may continue to cause our capital expenditures and operating costs to rise. Sustained levels of high inflation have likewise caused the Federal Reserve and other central banks to increase interest rates, which could have the effects of raising the cost of capital and depressing economic growth, either of which or the combination thereof could hurt the financial and operating results of our business. 
 As a result of the volatility in prices for oil, NGL and natural gas, we have taken and may be required to take further write-downs of the carrying values of our properties. 
 Accounting rules require that we periodically review the carrying value of our properties for possible impairment. Based on prevailing commodity prices and specific market factors and circumstances at the time of prospective impairment reviews, and the continuing evaluation of development plans, production data, economics and other factors, we have been required to, and may be required to further, write-down the carrying value of our properties. A write-down constitutes a non-cash charge to earnings. See "Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Pricing and reserves" and Note 6 to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report for additional information. 
 Oil, NGL and natural gas prices are volatile. Volatility in oil, NGL and natural gas prices has adversely affected, and may continue to adversely affect, our business, financial condition and results of operations and may in the future affect our ability to meet our capital expenditure obligations and financial commitments as well as negatively impact our stock price. 
 The prices we receive for our oil, NGL and natural gas production heavily influence our revenue, profitability, access to capital and future rate of growth. Commodity prices are subject to wide fluctuations in response to relatively minor changes in supply and demand. Historically, the market for oil, NGL and natural gas has been volatile and will likely continue to be volatile in the future. The prices we receive for our production, and the levels of our production, depend on numerous factors beyond our control. See "Cautionary Statement Regarding Forward-Looking Statements for a list of the factors that significantly impact our business and could impact our business in the future, including those specifically related to pricing and production. 
 Lower oil, NGL and natural gas prices have reduced, and may in the future continue to reduce, our cash flows and borrowing ability. We may be unable to obtain needed capital or financing on satisfactory terms, which could lead to a decline in our oil, NGL and natural gas reserves as existing reserves are depleted. A further decrease in oil, NGL and natural gas prices could render uneconomic a large portion of our exploration, development and exploitation projects. This has already resulted in us having to make significant downward adjustments to our estimated proved reserves, and we may need to make further downward adjustments in the future. Furthermore, lower oil, NGL and natural gas prices could lead to a reduced borrowing base under our Senior Secured Credit Facility, which could trigger repayments under such facility. Also, lower oil, NGL and natural gas prices would likely cause a decline in our stock price.

 Conservation measures, technological advances and negative shift in market perception towards the oil and natural gas industry could reduce demand for oil and natural gas. 
 Fuel conservation measures, alternative fuel requirements, increasing consumer demand for alternatives to oil and natural gas, technological advances in fuel economy and energy generation devices, and the increased competitiveness of alternative energy sources (such as electric vehicles, wind, solar, geothermal, tidal, fuel cells and biofuels) could reduce demand for oil and natural gas and, therefore, our revenues. 
 Additionally, certain segments of the investor community have recently expressed negative sentiment towards investing in the oil and natural gas industry. In the past, equity returns in the sector versus other industry sectors have led to lower oil and natural gas representation in certain key equity market indices. Some investors, including certain pension funds, university endowments and family foundations, have stated policies to reduce or eliminate their investments in the oil and natural gas sector based on social and environmental considerations. Furthermore, certain other stakeholders have pressured commercial and investment banks to stop funding oil and gas projects. With the volatility in oil and natural gas prices, and the likelihood that interest rates will continue to rise in the near term, increasing the cost of borrowing, certain investors have emphasized capital efficiency and free cash flow from earnings as key drivers for energy companies, especially shale producers. This may also result in a reduction of available capital funding for potential development projects, further impacting our future financial results. 
 The impact of the changing demand for oil and natural gas services and products, together with a change in investor sentiment, may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. Furthermore, if we are unable to achieve the desired level of capital efficiency or free cash flow within the timeframe expected by the market, our stock price may be adversely affected. 
 There is no guarantee that we will be successful in optimizing our spacing, drilling and completions techniques in order to maximize our rate of return, cash flows from operations and shareholder value. 
 As we accumulate and process geological and production data, we attempt to create a development plan, including well spacing and completion design, that maximizes our rate of return, cash flows from operations and shareholder value. However, due to many factors, including some beyond our control, there is no guarantee that we will be able to find the optimal plan or one that provides continuous improvement. If we are unable to design and implement an effective spacing, drilling and completions strategy, it may have a material adverse effect on our production results, financial performance, stock price and net asset value. 
 In addition, we use 3D seismic and other advanced technologies, which are relatively unproven and require greater pre-drilling expenditures than traditional drilling strategies, which may result in a reduction in our returns. As a result, our drilling activities may not be successful or economical, and our overall drilling success rate or our drilling success rate for activities in a particular area could decline. 
 Competition in the oil and natural gas industry is intense, making it difficult for us to acquire properties, market oil, NGL and natural gas and secure trained personnel. 
 Our ability to acquire additional locations and to find and develop reserves in the future may depend on our ability to evaluate and select suitable properties and to consummate transactions in a highly competitive, concentrated geographic environment for acquiring properties, marketing oil, NGL and natural gas and securing trained personnel. Also, there is substantial competition for capital available for investment in the oil, NGL and natural gas industry, especially in our focus areas. Many of our competitors possess and employ financial, technical and personnel resources substantially greater than ours. Those companies may be able to pay more for productive oil, NGL and natural gas properties and exploratory locations and to evaluate, bid for and purchase a greater number of properties and locations than our financial or personnel resources permit. In addition, other companies may be able to offer better compensation packages to attract and retain qualified personnel than we are able to offer. We may not be able to compete successfully in the future in acquiring prospective reserves, developing reserves, marketing hydrocarbons, attracting and retaining quality personnel and raising additional capital, which could have a material adverse effect on our business.

 We may be subject to risks in connection with acquisitions and disposition of assets. 
 The successful acquisition of producing properties requires an assessment of several factors, including (i) recoverable reserves; (ii) future oil, NGL and natural gas prices and their applicable differentials; (iii) timing of development; (iv) capital and operating costs; and (v) potential environmental and other liabilities. 
 The successful disposition of assets requires an assessment of several factors, including historical operations, potential environmental and other liabilities and impact on our business. The accuracy of these assessments is inherently uncertain. Our assessment will not reveal all existing or potential problems nor will it permit us to become sufficiently familiar with the properties to fully assess their deficiencies and capabilities. Inspections may not always be performed on every well, and environmental problems are not necessarily observable even when an inspection is undertaken. Even when problems are identified, the seller or buyer may be unwilling or unable to provide effective contractual protection against all or part of the problems. We often are not entitled to contractual indemnification for environmental liabilities and acquire or sell assets on an "as is" basis. Even in those circumstances in which we have contractual indemnification rights for pre-closing liabilities, it remains possible that the seller or buyer will not be able to fulfill its contractual obligations. Problems with assets we acquire or dispose of could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. 
 Acquisitions may not achieve the intended results and our results may suffer if we do not effectively manage our expanded operations following such transactions. 
 Some of the assumptions that we have made, such as the nature of assets to be acquired, may not be realized. There could also be undisclosed or unknown liabilities and unforeseen expenses associated with the acquisition that were not discovered in the due diligence review conducted by us prior to entering into the transaction agreements. 
 We may use more cash and other financial resources on integration and implementation activities than we expect. We may not be able to successfully integrate the assets acquired into our existing operations or realize the expected economic benefits of the acquisition, which may have a material and adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. 
 In instances where a portion of the acreage we are acquiring is undeveloped, our plans, development schedule and production schedule associated with the acreage may fail to materialize. As a result, our investment in these areas may not be as economic as we anticipate, and we could incur material write-downs of unevaluated properties. 
 Recent transactions may expose us to contingent liabilities. 
 We have agreed to indemnify the sellers of assets in recent transactions against certain liabilities related to (i) production, processing and other imbalances, (ii) obligations to pay working interests and related payments, (iii) obligations for plugging and abandonment of applicable wells and (iv) certain other items. In addition, we have agreed to indemnify the buyer of assets for breaches of certain specified fundamental representations and warranties and failure to perform covenants or obligations contained in the respective transaction agreement, subject to certain limitations, and certain other indemnities. 
 Our indemnification obligations are, in some cases, subject to limitations, but the amount of our maximum exposure could be material. In some instances, our indemnification obligations are not subject to any limitations. Significant indemnification claims by such sellers or buyers could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. 
 We may be unable to quickly adapt to changes in market/investor priorities. 
 Historically, one of the key drivers in the unconventional resource industry has been growth in production and reserves. With historical volatility in oil and natural gas prices and the likelihood that rising interest rates will increase the cost of borrowing, capital efficiency and free cash flow from earnings have become the key drivers for energy companies, particularly shale producers. Such shifts in focus sometimes require changes in planning and resource management, which may not occur instantaneously. Any delay in responding to such changes in market sentiment or perception may result in the investment community having a negative sentiment regarding our business plan, potential profitability and our ability to operate in a manner deemed "efficient," which may have a negative impact on the price of our common stock.

 Estimating reserves and future net cash flows involves uncertainties. Negative revisions to reserve estimates, decreases in oil, NGL and natural gas prices or increases in service costs, may lead to decreased earnings and increased losses or impairment of oil and natural gas properties. 
 The reserves data included in this Annual Report represent estimates. Reserves estimation is a subjective process of evaluating underground accumulations of oil, NGL and natural gas that cannot be measured in an exact manner. Reserves that are "proved reserves" are those estimated quantities of oil, NGL and natural gas that geological and engineering data demonstrate with reasonable certainty are recoverable in future years from known reservoirs under existing economic and operating conditions and that relate to specific locations for which the extraction of hydrocarbons must have commenced or the operator must be reasonably certain will commence within a five-year period. 
 The estimation process relies on interpretations of available geological, geophysical, engineering and production data. There are numerous uncertainties inherent in estimating quantities of proved reserves and in projecting future rates of production and timing of developmental expenditures, including more rapid production declines than previously expected and many other factors beyond the control of the operator. Further, initial production rates reported by us or other operators may not be indicative of future or long-term production rates. Production declines may be rapid and irregular when compared to a well's initial production or initial estimates. In addition, the estimates of future net cash flows from our proved reserves and the present value of such estimates are based upon certain assumptions about future production levels, prices and costs that may not prove to be correct. 
 Negative revisions in the estimated quantities of proved reserves have the effect of increasing the rates of depletion on the affected properties, which decrease earnings or result in losses through higher depletion expense. These revisions, as well as revisions in the assumptions of future cash flows of these reserves, may also trigger impairment losses on certain properties, which would result in a non-cash charge to earnings. See Note 19 to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report. 
 Unless we replace our oil, NGL and natural gas production, our reserves and production will continue to decline, which would adversely affect our future cash flows and results of operations. 
 Producing oil, NGL and natural gas reservoirs are generally characterized by rapidly declining production rates that vary depending upon reservoir characteristics and other factors. Unless we conduct successful ongoing exploration, development and exploitation activities and/or continually acquire properties containing proved reserves, our proved reserves will continue to decline as those reserves are produced. Our future oil, NGL and natural gas reserves and production, and therefore our future cash flow and results of operations, are highly dependent on our success in efficiently developing and exploiting our current reserves and economically finding or acquiring additional recoverable reserves. We may not be able to develop, exploit, find or acquire sufficient additional reserves to replace our current and future production. If we are unable to replace our current and future production, the value of our reserves will decrease, and our business, financial condition and results of operations would be adversely affected. 
 Insufficient transportation capacity in the Permian Basin, and the challenges to alleviating such transportation constraints, could cause significant fluctuations in our realized oil prices and our results of operations. 
 In our area of operation, the Permian Basin has been characterized by periods when oil and/or natural gas production has surpassed local transportation capacity, resulting in substantial discounts to the price received for commodity prices quoted for WTI oil and Henry Hub natural gas. The expansion and construction of pipeline facilities are affected by the availability and costs of necessary equipment, supplies, labor and other services, as well as the length of time to complete such projects. In addition, these projects can be affected by changes in international trade relationships, including the imposition of trade restrictions or tariffs relating to crude oil and natural gas and any materials or products used to expand or construct pipeline facilities, such as certain imported steel mill products that may be subject to a 25 tariff. All of these factors could negatively impact our realized oil prices, as well as actual results of our operations. 
 The marketability of our production is dependent upon transportation, processing and storage, certain of which we do not control. If these services are unavailable, our operations could be interrupted and our revenues reduced. 
 The marketability of our oil, NGL and natural gas production depends on a variety of factors, including the availability, proximity, capacity and quality constraints of transportation, compression, natural gas processing, fractionation, export terminals and storage facilities owned by us or third parties. We do not control third-party facilities and pipelines that may be 
 29 

Table of Contents 

 utilized for the transportation to market of the products originating at our leases. Our failure to provide or obtain such services on acceptable terms could materially harm our business. 
 Insufficient production from our wells to support the construction of pipeline facilities by third parties or a significant disruption in the availability of our or third-party transportation facilities or other production facilities could adversely impact our ability to deliver to market or produce our oil, NGL and natural gas and thereby cause a significant interruption in our operations. If we are unable, for any sustained period, to implement acceptable delivery or transportation arrangements or specifications or encounter production-related difficulties, we may be required to shut in or curtail production. Any such shut-in or curtailment, or an inability to obtain favorable terms for delivery of the oil, NGL and natural gas produced from our fields, could materially and adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations. 
 A decrease in our production of oil, NGL and natural gas could negatively impact our ability to meet our contractual obligations to deliver oil, NGL and natural gas and our ability to retain our leases. 
 A portion of our oil, NGL and gas production in any region may be interrupted, or shut in, from time to time for numerous reasons, including as a result of extreme weather conditions, such as the freezing of wells and pipelines in the Permian Basin or a decision by the Electric Reliability Council of Texas ("ERCOT") to implement statewide electricity blackouts due to supply/demand imbalances in the electricity grid caused by the extreme cold weather, accidents, loss or unavailability of pipeline or gathering system access and capacity, field labor issues or strikes. Alternatively, we might voluntarily curtail production in response to market conditions, including low oil, NGL and gas prices. If a substantial amount of our production is interrupted at the same time, it could temporarily adversely affect our cash flow. Furthermore, if we were required to shut in wells, we might also be obligated to pay shut-in royalties to certain mineral interest owners to maintain our leases. 
 In addition, we have entered into agreements with third party pipelines and purchasers that require us to deliver for transportation or sale minimum amounts of oil and natural gas. Pursuant to these agreements, we must deliver specific amounts of oil or gas over the next eight years. If we are unable to fulfill all of our contractual delivery obligations from our own production, we may be required to pay penalties or damages pursuant to these agreements or we may have to purchase oil from third parties to fulfill our delivery obligations. This could adversely impact our cash flows, profit margins and net income. 
 The potential drilling locations that we have tentatively internally identified for our future wells will be drilled, if at all, over many years. This makes them susceptible to uncertainties that could materially alter the occurrence or timing of their drilling. 
 Although our management team has established certain potential drilling locations as a part of our long-range development plan, our ability to drill and develop these locations depends on a number of uncertainties, including oil, NGL and natural gas prices, the availability and cost of capital, drilling and production costs, our ability to leverage our data and development experience, the availability of drilling services and equipment, lease expirations, gathering systems, marketing and pipeline transportation constraints, regulatory approvals and other factors. Because of these uncertainties, we do not know if the numerous potential drilling locations we have currently identified will ever be drilled or if we will be able to produce oil, NGL or natural gas from these or any other potential drilling locations. As such, it is likely that our actual drilling activities, especially in the long term, could materially differ from those presently anticipated. 
 The inability of our significant customers to meet their obligations to us may materially adversely affect our financial results. 
 Our oil, NGL and natural gas production sales are made to a variety of purchasers, including intrastate and interstate pipelines or their marketing affiliates and independent marketing companies. Certain purchasers individually account for 10 or more of our oil, NGL and natural gas sales in a given year. The inability or failure of our significant customers to meet their obligations to us or their insolvency or liquidation may adversely affect our financial results. See Notes 2 and 14 to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report for further discussion of our accounts receivable and credit risk, respectively.

 The unavailability or high cost of additional oilfield services, including personnel, drilling rigs, equipment and supplies, as well as fees for the cancellation of such services, could adversely affect our ability to execute our exploration and development plans within our budget and on a timely basis. 
 The demand for and availability of qualified and experienced personnel to drill and complete wells and conduct field operations, including, but not limited to, frac crews, geologists, geophysicists, engineers and other professionals in the oil and natural gas industry can fluctuate significantly, often in correlation with oil, NGL and natural gas prices, causing periodic shortages. From time to time, there have also been shortages of drilling and workover rigs, pipe, sand, water and equipment as demand for such items has increased along with the number of wells being drilled. We have committed in the past, and we may in the future commit, to drilling rig contracts with various third parties that contain penalties for early terminations. These penalties could negatively impact our financial statements upon contract termination. Shortages in rigs, crews, supplies and equipment, as well as related fees could result in delays or cause us to incur significant expenditures that are not provided for in our capital budget, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations. 
 Our business and operations may be further affected by the COVID-19 pandemic and responses. 
 Since 2020, the spread of the COVID-19 coronavirus caused, and is continuing to cause, disruptions in the worldwide and U.S. economy. There are many variables and uncertainties regarding the COVID-19 pandemic, including the emergence and severity of new and different strains of the virus; the effectiveness of treatments or vaccines against the virus or its new strains; the extent of travel restrictions, business closures and other measures that are or may be imposed in affected areas or countries by governmental authorities; disruptions in the supply chain; a competitive labor market due to sustained labor shortage or increased turnover caused by the COVID-19 pandemic; increased logistics costs; additional costs due to remote working arrangements, adherence to social distancing practices and other COVID-19 related challenges; and decreases in the price of oil due to remote working arrangements. Further, there remain increased risks of cyberattacks on information technology systems used in remote working environment; increased privacy-related risks due to processing health-related personal information; absence of workforce due to illness; the impact of the pandemic on any of our contractual counterparties; and other factors that are currently unknown or considered immaterial. It is difficult to assess the ultimate impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on our business, financial condition and results of operations. 
 Our business could be negatively impacted by disruption of electronic systems, security threats, including cyber-security threats, and other disruptions. 
 We are heavily dependent on our information systems and computer-based programs, including our well operations information, seismic data, electronic data processing and accounting data. If any of such systems or programs were to fail or we were subject to cyberspace breaches or attacks, possible consequences include our loss of communication links, inability to find, produce, process and sell oil, NGL and natural gas and inability to automatically process commercial transactions or engage in similar automated or computerized business activities. Any such consequence could have a material adverse effect on our business. 
 As an oil and natural gas producer, we face various security threats, including cyber-security threats to gain unauthorized access to sensitive information or to render data or systems unusable, threats to the safety of our employees, threats to the security of our or third-party facilities and infrastructure, and threats from terrorist acts. In particular, cyber-security attacks are evolving and include, but are not limited to, malicious software, attempts to gain unauthorized access to data, and other electronic security breaches that could lead to disruptions in critical systems, unauthorized release of confidential or otherwise protected information and corruption of data. Although we utilize various procedures and controls to monitor and protect against these threats and to mitigate our exposure to such threats, there can be no assurance that these procedures and controls will be sufficient in preventing security threats from materializing. If any of these events were to materialize, they could lead to losses of sensitive information, critical infrastructure, personnel or capabilities essential to our operations and could have a material adverse effect on our reputation, financial position, results of operations or cash flows.

 Our business could be negatively impacted by hydrocarbon price volatility as the result of, or with the intensification of, Russian activities in Ukraine and as the result of, or as a result of the threat of, Russia expanding its production of oil and gas to finance its activities in Ukraine and destabilize world energy markets. 
 Our revenues and our profitability are heavily dependent on the prices we receive from our sales of oil and natural gas. Oil prices are particularly sensitive to actual and perceived threats to global political stability and to changes in production from OPEC member states. Russia's activities in Ukraine have caused, and could intensify, volatility in global oil and gas prices and increases in oil production by Russia to finance its activities in Ukraine or to destabilize global oil and gas prices could reduce the price we receive from our sales of oil and natural gas and adversely affect our profitability. 
 The loss of senior management or technical personnel and the failure to attract, train and retain qualified personnel could adversely affect our operations. 
 Effective succession planning is important to our long-term success. Failure to ensure effective transfer of knowledge and smooth transitions involving senior management and technical personnel could hinder our strategic planning and execution and could have a material adverse impact on our operations. We do not maintain any key-man or similar insurance for any officer or other employee. 
 We may not always foresee new operational/technical issues as new technology enables greater operational capabilities. 
 The unconventional oil and natural gas industry has seen a large increase in new technologies to enhance all aspects of operations. This has arguably accelerated as a result of the extended downturn in commodity prices, forcing companies to find new ways to more efficiently produce oil and natural gas. While such technologies can and often ultimately enhance operations, production and profitability, the utilization of such technologies, especially in their early phases, may result in unforeseen consequences and operational issues, resulting in negative consequences. 
 Our producing properties are in a concentrated geographic area, making us vulnerable to risks associated with operating in one major geographic area. 
 Our producing properties are geographically concentrated in the Permian Basin. As of December 31, 2022, all of our total estimated proved reserves were attributable to properties located in this area. As a result of this concentration, we may be disproportionately exposed to the impact of regional transportation constraints, supply and demand factors, delays or interruptions of production from wells in this area caused by governmental regulation, processing and storage capacity constraints, market limitations, water shortages, interruption of the processing or transportation of oil or natural gas, as well as impacts from extreme weather or other natural disasters impacting the Permian Basin, such as the freezing of wells and pipelines in the Permian Basin or a decision by ERCOT to implement statewide electricity blackouts due to supply/demand imbalances in the electricity grid caused by the extreme cold weather. 
 If we were to experience an ownership change, we could be limited in our ability to use net operating losses arising prior to the ownership change to offset future taxable income. In addition, our ability to use net operating loss carryforwards to reduce future tax payments may be limited if our taxable income does not reach sufficient levels. 
 As of December 31, 2022, we had federal net operating loss ("NOL") carryforwards totaling 1.5 billion and state of Oklahoma NOL carryforwards totaling 34.4 million. If we were to experience an "ownership change," as determined under Section 382 of the Internal Revenue Code, to which Oklahoma conforms, our ability to offset taxable income arising after the ownership change with NOLs arising prior to the ownership change would be limited, possibly substantially. An ownership change would establish an annual limitation on the amount of our pre-change NOLs we could utilize to offset our taxable income in any future taxable year to an amount generally equal to the value of our stock immediately prior to the ownership change multiplied by the long-term tax-exempt rate, periodically promulgated by the IRS. In general, an ownership change will occur if there is a cumulative increase in our ownership of more than 50 percentage points by one or more "5 shareholders" (as defined in the Internal Revenue Code) at any time during a rolling three-year period This annual litigation however, may be significantly increased if there is "net unrealized built-in gain" in the assets of the corporation undergoing the ownership change. 
 In addition, as a result of a comprehensive tax reform bill commonly referred to as the Tax Cuts and the Jobs Act (the "Tax Act"), NOLs arising before January 1, 2018, and NOLs arising on or after January 1, 2018, are subject to different rules. NOLs arising before January 1, 2018, can generally be carried forward to offset future taxable income for a period of 20 years. Any 
 32 

Table of Contents 

 NOL arising on or after January 1, 2018, while subject to additional limitations, can generally be carried forward indefinitely. Our ability to use our NOLs during this 20-year period will be dependent on our ability to generate taxable income, and the NOLs could expire before we generate sufficient taxable income. As of December 31, 2022, based on evidence available to us, including projected future cash flows from our oil, NGL and natural gas reserves and the timing of those cash flows, we believe a portion of our NOLs is not fully realizable. As a result, as of December 31, 2022, a valuation allowance has been recorded against our net deferred tax assets. See Note 13 to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report for additional information. 
 We may incur substantial losses and be subject to substantial liability claims as a result of our operations. Additionally, we may not be insured for, or our insurance may be inadequate to protect us against, these risks. 
 We could be impacted by the outcome of pending litigation as well as unexpected litigation or proceedings. Certain litigation claims may not be covered under our insurance policies, or our insurance carriers may seek to deny coverage. Because we cannot accurately predict the outcome of any action, it is possible that, as a result of pending and/or unexpected litigation, we will be subject to adverse judgments or settlements that could significantly reduce our earnings or result in losses. See "Item 3. Legal Proceedings" for a description of our pending litigation. 
 We are not insured against all risks. Losses and liabilities arising from uninsured and underinsured events could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition or results of operations. Our oil, NGL and natural gas exploration and production activities are subject to all of the operating risks associated with drilling for and producing oil, NGL and natural gas, including the possibility of (i) environmental hazards, such as uncontrollable flows of oil, natural gas, brine, well fluids, toxic gas or other pollution into the environment, including groundwater and shoreline contamination, (ii) abnormally pressured formations, (iii) mechanical difficulties, such as stuck oilfield drilling and service tools and casing collapse, (iv) fires, explosions and ruptures of pipelines, (v) disagreements regarding the royalty due to our royalty owners, (vi) personal injuries and death, (vii) electronic system disruption and cyber-security threats, (viii) natural disasters and (ix) terrorist attacks targeting oil, NGL and natural gas related facilities and infrastructure. 
 Any of these risks could adversely affect our ability to conduct operations or result in substantial losses to us. 
 We may elect not to obtain insurance if we believe that the cost of available insurance is excessive relative to the risks presented. In addition, pollution and environmental risks generally are not fully insurable. The impact of litigation as well as the occurrence of an event that is not fully covered by insurance could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. 
 Our targets related to sustainability and emissions reduction initiatives, including our public statements and disclosures regarding them, may expose us to numerous risks. 
 We have developed, and will continue to develop, targets related to ESG initiatives, including our emissions reduction targets and strategy. Public statements related to these initiatives reflect our current plans and are not a guarantee the targets will be achieved or achieved on the stated timeline. Our efforts to research, establish, accomplish, and accurately report on these targets may expose us to operational, reputational, financial, legal, and other risks. Our ability to achieve our stated targets, including emissions reductions, is subject to numerous factors and conditions, some of which are outside of our control. 
 Our business may face increased scrutiny from investors and other stakeholders related to our ESG initiatives, including our publicly announced targets, as well as our methodologies and timelines for pursuing those initiatives. If our ESG initiatives do not meet evolving investor or other stakeholder expectations and standards, our reputation, ability to attract or retain employees, and attractiveness as an investment or business partner may be negatively impacted. Similarly, our failure to achieve our announced targets within the announced timelines, or at all or comply with ethical, environmental, or other standards, including reporting standards, may adversely impact our business or reputation, or may expose us to government enforcement actions or private litigation. 
 Risks related to our financing and indebtedness 
 Our business requires significant capital expenditures and we may be unable to obtain needed capital or financing on satisfactory terms or at all. 
 Our exploration, development, marketing, transportation and acquisition activities require substantial capital expenditures. 
 33 

Table of Contents 

 Historically, we have funded our capital expenditures through a combination of cash flows from operations, proceeds from equity offerings, proceeds from senior unsecured note offerings, borrowings under our Senior Secured Credit Facility and proceeds from asset dispositions. We do not have commitments from anyone to contribute equity capital to us. Future cash flows are subject to a number of variables, including the level of production from existing wells, prices of oil, NGL and natural gas and our success in developing and producing new reserves. If our cash flow from operations is not sufficient to fund our capital expenditure budget, we may have limited ability to obtain the additional capital necessary to sustain our operations at current levels. We may not be able to obtain debt or equity financing on terms favorable to us or at all. The failure to obtain additional capital could result in a curtailment of our operations relating to exploration and development of our prospects, which in turn could lead to a decline in our oil, NGL and natural gas production or reserves and, in some areas, a loss of properties. 
 Currently, we receive a level of cash flow stability as a result of our hedging activity. To the extent we are unable to obtain future hedges at beneficial prices or our commodity derivative activities are not effective, our cash flows and financial condition may be adversely impacted. 
 To achieve more predictable cash flows and reduce our exposure to adverse fluctuations in the prices of oil, NGL and natural gas, we enter into commodity derivative instrument contracts for a portion of our oil, NGL and natural gas production, including puts, swaps, collars, basis swaps and, in the past, call spreads. In accordance with applicable accounting principles, we are required to record our derivatives at fair market value, and they are included on our consolidated balance sheet as assets or liabilities and in our consolidated statements of operations as gain (loss) on derivatives. Gain (loss) on derivatives are included in our cash flows from operating activities. Accordingly, our earnings may fluctuate significantly as a result of changes in the fair market value of our derivative instruments, including a decrease in earnings if the price of commodities increases above the price of hedges that we have in place. As our current hedges expire, there is a significant uncertainty that we will be able to put new hedges in place that satisfy our hedge philosophy. 
 Derivative instruments also expose us to the risk of financial loss in some circumstances, including when (i) production is less than the volume covered by the commodity derivative instruments; (ii) the counter-party to the commodity derivative instrument defaults on its contractual obligations; (iii) there is an increase in the differential between the underlying price in the derivative instrument and actual prices received; or (iv) there are issues with regard to legal enforceability of such instruments. 
 In addition, government regulation may adversely impact our ability to hedge these risks. 
 For additional information regarding our hedging activities, please see "Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations" and Notes 11 and 12 to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report. 
 We may incur significant additional amounts of debt. 
 As of December 31, 2022, we had total long-term indebtedness of 1.12 billion. We may be able to incur substantial additional indebtedness, including secured indebtedness, in the future. The restrictions on the incurrence of additional indebtedness contained in the indentures governing our senior unsecured notes and in our Senior Secured Credit Facility are subject to a number of significant qualifications and exceptions, and under certain circumstances, the amount of indebtedness that could be incurred in compliance with these restrictions could be substantial. If new debt is added to our existing debt levels, the related risks that we face would increase and may make it more difficult to satisfy our existing financial obligations. In addition, the restrictions on the incurrence of additional indebtedness contained in the indentures governing the senior unsecured notes apply only to debt that constitutes indebtedness under the indentures. However, such increased debt may reduce the amount of outstanding debt allowed under the Senior Secured Credit Facility. 
 Increases in our cost of and ability to access capital could adversely affect our business. 
 We require continued access to capital. Our business and operating results can be harmed by factors such as the availability, terms of and cost of capital, increases in interest rates or a reduction in credit rating. These changes could cause our cost of doing business to increase, limit our ability to pursue acquisition opportunities, reduce our cash flow and/or liquidity available for drilling and place us at a competitive disadvantage. Disruptions and volatility in the global financial markets and a downgrade in our credit ratings could negatively impact our costs of capital and ability to raise debt in the public debt markets, and the cost of any new debt could be much higher than our outstanding debt. A significant reduction in our cash

 flows from operations or the availability of credit could materially and adversely affect our ability to achieve our planned growth and operating results. See "Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk Interest rate risk" for additional information regarding interest rate risk. See Note 7 to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report for additional information regarding our debt and borrowing base. 
 Borrowings under our Senior Secured Credit Facility expose us to interest rate risk. 
 Our earnings are exposed to interest rate risk associated with borrowings under our Senior Secured Credit Facility. The terms of our Senior Secured Credit Facility provide for interest on borrowings at a floating rate equal to an adjusted base rate tied to Term SOFR, a forward-looking term rate that is based on the secure overnight financing rate determined by the Federal Reserve bank of New York. SOFR is a volume weighted measure of the cost of overnight borrowings collateralized by treasury securities and can fluctuate based on multiple factors. In response to inflation, the U.S. Federal Reserve increased rates several times in 2022 and signaled that additional interest rate increases should be expected in 2023. On December 14, 2022, it raised interest rates by 0.50 , representing the seventh increase in interest rates during 2022 to date. Raising or lowering of interest rates by the U.S. Federal Reserve generally causes an increase or decrease, respectively, in SOFR and other floating interest rate benchmarks. As such, if interest rates increase, so will our interest costs. From time to time, we use interest rate swaps to reduce interest rate exposure with respect to our fixed and/or floating rate debt. If interest rates increase, so will our interest costs, which may have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition. 
 We require a significant amount of cash to service our indebtedness. Our ability to generate cash depends on many factors beyond our control. 
 Our ability to make payments on and to refinance our indebtedness and to fund planned capital expenditures depends on our ability to generate cash in the future. This, to a certain extent, is subject to general economic, financial, competitive, legislative, regulatory and other factors that are beyond our control. We cannot assure that we will generate sufficient cash flows from operations or that future funding will be available to us under our Senior Secured Credit Facility, equity or debt offerings or other actions in an amount sufficient to enable us to pay our indebtedness or to fund our other liquidity needs. We may need to refinance all or a portion of our indebtedness at or before maturity. We cannot assure that we will be able to refinance any of our indebtedness on commercially reasonable terms or at all. 
 Any significant reduction in our borrowing base under our Senior Secured Credit Facility as a result of a periodic borrowing base redetermination or otherwise will negatively impact our liquidity and, consequently, our ability to fund our operations, as well as our ability to repay borrowings under our Senior Secured Credit Facility or any other obligation if required. 
 Availability under our Senior Secured Credit Facility is currently subject to a borrowing base which is subject to scheduled semiannual (May 1 and November 1) and other elective borrowing base redeterminations based upon, among other things, projected revenues from, and asset values of, the oil and natural gas properties securing the Senior Secured Credit Facility. The lenders under our Senior Secured Credit Facility can unilaterally adjust the borrowing base and the borrowings permitted to be outstanding under our Senior Secured Credit Facility. Reductions in estimates of our oil, NGL and natural gas reserves will result in a reduction in our borrowing base (if prices are kept constant). Reductions in our borrowing base could also arise from other factors, including but not limited to (i) lower commodity prices or production, (ii) increased leverage ratios, (iii) inability to drill or unfavorable drilling results, (iv) changes in oil, NGL and natural gas reserves engineering, (v) increased operating and/or capital costs, (vi) the lenders' inability to agree to an adequate borrowing base or (vii) adverse changes in the lenders' practices (including required regulatory changes) regarding estimation of reserves. 
 We anticipate borrowing under our Senior Secured Credit Facility in the future. Any significant reduction in our borrowing base as a result of such borrowing base redeterminations or otherwise will negatively impact our liquidity and our ability to fund our operations and, as a result, would have a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operation and cash flow. Further, if the outstanding borrowings under our Senior Secured Credit Facility were to exceed the borrowing base as a result of any such redetermination, we could be required to repay the excess. We may not have sufficient funds to make such repayments. If we do not have sufficient funds and we are otherwise unable to negotiate renewals of our borrowings or arrange new financing, we may have to sell significant assets. Any such sale could have a material adverse effect on our business and financial results. In addition, we keep cash at certain banks that are not FDIC insured or such deposits that exceed the FDIC insured amount. See "Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Liquidity and capital resources" for additional information regarding our liquidity. See Note 7 to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report for additional information regarding our debt and borrowing

 base. 
 We have incurred losses from operations for various periods since our inception and may do so in the future. 
 We incurred net losses in certain years of operation since our inception. Our development of and participation in an increasingly larger number of locations has required and will continue to require substantial capital expenditures. The uncertainty and factors described throughout this section may impede our ability to economically find, develop, exploit and acquire oil, NGL and natural gas reserves. As a result, we may not be able to achieve or sustain profitability or positive cash flows from operating activities in the future. See "Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Critical accounting estimates." 
 Our debt agreements contain restrictions that limit our flexibility in operating our business. 
 Our debt agreements contain, and any future indebtedness we incur may contain, various covenants that limit the manner in which we operate our business and our ability to engage in specified types of transactions. These covenants limit our ability to, among other things (i) incur additional indebtedness; (ii) pay dividends on, repurchase or redeem stock; (iii) make certain investments; (iv) sell, transfer or dispose of assets; (v) hedge our production; (vi) consolidate or merge; and (vii) enter into certain transactions with our affiliates. 
 A breach of any of these covenants could result in a default under one or more of these agreements and, in the case of our Senior Secured Credit Facility, permit the lenders to cease making loans to us. A default, if not waived, could result in acceleration of our indebtedness, in which case the debt would become immediately due and payable. If this occurs, we may not be able to repay our debt or borrow sufficient funds to refinance it on terms acceptable to us. Furthermore, we have pledged substantially all of our assets as collateral to secure the debt under our Senior Secured Credit Facility and if we were unable to repay such debt, the lenders could proceed against such collateral. The proceeds from the sale or foreclosure upon such collateral will first be used to repay debt under our Senior Secured Credit Facility, and we may not have sufficient assets to repay such debt to our unsecured indebtedness thereafter. 
 Risks related to regulation of our business 
 If we are unable to drill new allocation wells, it could have a material adverse impact on our future production results. 
 In the State of Texas, allocation wells allow an oil and gas producer to drill a horizontal well under two or more leaseholds that are not pooled. We are active in drilling and producing allocation wells. If regulations regarding allocation wells are made, the RRC denies or significantly delays the permitting of allocation wells or if legislation is enacted that negatively impacts the current process under which allocation wells are permitted, it could have an adverse impact on our ability to drill long horizontal lateral wells on some of our leases, which in turn could have a material adverse impact on our anticipated future production, rates of return and other projected capital efficiencies. 
 Federal and state legislation and regulatory initiatives relating to hydraulic fracturing and water disposal wells could prohibit projects or result in materially increased costs and additional operating restrictions or delays because of the significance of hydraulic fracturing and water disposal wells in our business. 
 Hydraulic fracturing is a practice that is used to stimulate production of oil and/or natural gas from tight formations. The process, which involves the injection of water, proppants and chemicals under pressure into the formation to fracture the surrounding rock and stimulate production, is typically regulated by state oil and natural gas commissions. However, federal, state and local jurisdictions have adopted, or are considering adopting, regulations that could further restrict or prohibit hydraulic fracturing in certain circumstances, impose more stringent operating standards and/or require the disclosure of the composition of hydraulic fracturing fluids. See "Item 1. Business Regulation of the oil and natural gas industry Hydraulic fracturing" for a further description of federal and state regulations addressing hydraulic fracturing. Additionally, there are certain governmental reviews either under way or being proposed that focus on environmental aspects of hydraulic fracturing practices, which could spur initiatives to further regulate hydraulic fracturing. Additional levels of regulation and permits required through the adoption of new laws and regulations at the federal, state or local level could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations. At this time, it is not possible to estimate the potential impact on our business that may arise if federal or state legislation or regulations governing hydraulic fracturing or water disposal wells are enacted into law.

 Our operations are substantially dependent on the availability, use and disposal of water. New legislation and regulatory initiatives or restrictions relating to water disposal wells could have a material adverse effect on our future business, financial condition, operating results and prospects. 
 Water is an essential component of both the drilling and hydraulic fracturing processes. Historically, we have been able to purchase water from local land owners and other sources for use in our operations. Texas has previously experienced, and may experience again, low inflows of water. As a result of these conditions, some local water districts may begin restricting the use of water subject to their jurisdiction for drilling and hydraulic fracturing in order to protect the local water supply. If we are unable to obtain water to use in our operations from local sources, we may be unable to economically produce oil, NGL and natural gas, which could have an adverse effect on our results of operations, cash flows and financial condition. 
 Additionally, our operational and production procedures produce large volumes of water that we must properly dispose. The Clean Water Act, the Safe Drinking Water Act, the Oil Pollution Act, and comparable state laws impose restrictions and strict controls regarding the discharge of pollutants, including produced waters and other natural gas wastes, into federal and state waters. The discharge of pollutants into regulated waters is prohibited, except in accordance with the terms of a permit issued by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (the "EPA") or the state. Furthermore, the State of Texas maintains groundwater protection programs that require permits for discharges or operations that may impact groundwater conditions. 
 Because of the necessity to safely dispose of water produced during operational and production activities, these regulations, or others like them, could have a material adverse effect on our future business, financial condition, operating results and prospects. See "Item 1. Business Regulation of the oil and natural gas industry" for a further description of the laws and regulations that affect us. 
 Legislation or regulatory initiatives intended to address seismic activity could restrict our drilling and production activities, as well as our ability to dispose of produced water gathered from such activities, which could have a material adverse effect on our business. 
 State and federal regulatory agencies have recently focused on a possible connection between hydraulic fracturing-related activities, particularly the underground injection of wastewater into disposal wells, and the increased occurrence of seismic activity, and regulatory agencies at all levels are continuing to study the possible linkage between oil and gas activity and induced seismicity. In addition, a number of lawsuits have been filed in some states alleging that disposal well operations have caused damage to neighboring properties or otherwise violated state and federal rules regulating waste disposal. In an effort to control induced seismic activity and recent increase in earthquakes in the Permian Basin, which have been linked by the U.S. and local seismologist to wastewater disposal in oil fields, in September 2021, the RRC curtailed the amount of produced water companies were permitted to inject into some wells in the Permian Basin, and has since indefinitely suspended some permits there and expanded the restrictions to other areas. 
 Because we dispose of large volumes of produced water gathered from our drilling and production operations, these restrictions on the use of produced water and a moratorium on new produced water wells, together with the adoption and implementation of any new laws or regulations, could result in increased operating costs, requiring us or our service providers to truck produced water, recycle it or pump it through the pipeline network or other means, all of which could be costly. We or our service providers may also need to limit disposal well volumes, disposal rates and pressures or locations, which may require us or our service providers to shut down or curtail the injection of produced water into disposal wells. These factors may make drilling activity in the affected parts of the Permian Basin less economical and adversely impact our business, financial condition and results of operations. See "Item 1. Business Regulation of the oil and natural gas industry Hydraulic fracturing" for a further description of local regulations addressing seismic activity. 
 A change in the jurisdictional characterization of some of our assets by federal, state or local regulatory agencies or a change in policy by those agencies may result in increased regulation of our assets, which may cause our revenues to decline and operating expenses to increase. 
 Section 1(b) of the Natural Gas Act of 1938 (the "NGA") exempts natural gas gathering facilities from regulation by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission ("FERC"). We believe that the natural gas pipelines in our gathering systems meet the traditional tests FERC has used to establish whether a pipeline performs a gathering function and, therefore, are exempt from the FERC's jurisdiction under the NGA. However, the distinction between FERC-regulated transmission services and federally unregulated gathering services is a fact-based determination. The classification of facilities as unregulated gathering is the 
 37 

Table of Contents 

 subject of ongoing litigation, so the classification and regulation of our gathering facilities are subject to change based on future determinations by FERC, the courts or Congress, which could cause our revenues to decline and operating expenses to increase and may materially adversely affect our business, financial condition or results of operations. In addition, FERC has adopted regulations that may subject certain of our otherwise non-FERC jurisdictional facilities to FERC annual reporting and daily scheduled flow and capacity posting requirements. Additional rules and legislation pertaining to those and other matters may be considered or adopted by FERC from time to time. Failure to comply with those regulations in the future could subject us to civil penalty liability, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations. 
 The adoption of climate change legislation or regulations restricting emissions of "greenhouse gases" could result in increased operating costs and reduced demand for the oil, NGL and natural gas we produce, while potential physical effects of climate change could disrupt our operations and cause us to incur significant costs in preparing for or responding to those effects. 
 In August 2022, President Biden signed into law the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 ("IRA"). The IRA contains billions of dollars in incentives for the development of renewable energy, clean hydrogen, clean fuels, electric vehicles, investments in advanced biofuels and supporting infrastructure and carbon capture and sequestration, amongst other provisions. In addition, the IRA imposes the first ever federal fee on emission of GHGs through a methane emissions charge, which will be phased-in starting in 2024. The IRA could accelerate the transition of the economy away from the use of fossil fuels towards lower-or-zero-carbon emissions alternatives, which could decrease demand for, and in turn the prices of, the oil and natural gas that we produce and sell, which could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. 
 Additional restrictions on GHG emissions that may be imposed could adversely affect the oil and gas industry. The adoption of legislation or regulatory programs to reduce GHG emissions could require us to incur increased operating costs, such as costs to purchase and operate emissions control systems, acquire emissions allowances or comply with new regulatory requirements. Any GHG emissions legislation or regulatory programs applicable to power plants or refineries could also increase the cost of consuming, and thereby reduce demand for, the oil, NGL and natural gas we produce. Consequently, legislation and regulatory programs to reduce GHG emissions could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. 
 See "Item 1. Business Regulation of the oil and natural gas industry Greenhouse gas" emissions" for a further discussion of the laws and regulations related to greenhouse gases. Extreme weather conditions can interfere with our production and increase our costs, and damage resulting from extreme weather may not be fully insured. 
 Our operations may be exposed to significant delays, costs and liabilities as a result of environmental, health and safety requirements applicable to our business activities. 
 We may incur significant delays, costs and liabilities as a result of federal, state and local environmental, health and safety requirements applicable to our exploration, development, marketing, transportation and production activities. These laws and regulations may require us to obtain and maintain a variety of permits, approvals, certificates or other authorizations governing our air emissions, water discharges, waste disposal or other environmental impacts associated with drilling, production and transporting product pipelines or other operations; regulate the sourcing and disposal of water used in the drilling, fracturing and completion processes; limit or prohibit drilling activities in certain areas and on certain lands lying within wilderness, wetlands, frontier, seismically active areas and other protected areas; require remedial action to prevent or mitigate pollution from former operations such as plugging abandoned wells or closing earthen pits; and/or impose substantial liabilities for spills, pollution or failure to comply with regulatory filings. In addition, these laws and regulations may restrict the rate of oil or natural gas production. These laws and regulations are complex, change frequently and have tended to become increasingly stringent over time. Failure to comply with these laws and regulations may result in the assessment of administrative, civil and criminal penalties, imposition of cleanup and site restoration costs and liens, the suspension or revocation of necessary permits, licenses and authorizations, the requirement that additional pollution controls be installed, and, in some instances, the issuance of orders or injunctions limiting or requiring discontinuation of certain operations. 
 Under certain environmental laws that impose strict as well as joint and several liability, we may be required to remediate contaminated properties currently or formerly operated by us or facilities of third parties that received waste generated by our operations regardless of whether such contamination resulted from the conduct of others or from consequences of our 
 38 

Table of Contents 

 own actions that were in compliance with all applicable laws at the time those actions were taken. In addition, claims for damages to persons or property, including natural resources, may result from the environmental, health and safety impacts of our operations. In addition, accidental spills or releases from our operations could expose us to significant liabilities under environmental laws. Moreover, public interest in the protection of the environment has tended to increase over time. The trend of more expansive and stringent environmental legislation and regulations applied to the oil, NGL and natural gas industry could continue, resulting in increased costs of doing business and consequently affecting profitability. To the extent laws are enacted or other governmental actions are taken that restricts drilling or imposes more stringent and costly operating, waste handling, disposal and cleanup requirements, our business, prospects, financial condition or results of operations could be materially adversely affected. 
 See "Item 1. Business Regulation of the oil and natural gas industry" for a further description of the laws and regulations that affect us. 
 Derivatives reform legislation and related regulations could have an adverse effect on our ability to hedge risks associated with our business. 
 The Dodd-Frank Act, the Adopted Derivatives Rules, and the U.S. Resolution Stay Rules could significantly increase the cost of our derivative contracts, materially alter the terms of our derivative contracts, reduce the availability of derivatives to us that we have historically used to protect against risks that we encounter in our business, reduce our ability to monetize or restructure our existing derivative contracts and increase our exposure to less creditworthy counterparties. The Foreign Regulations could have similar effects. We have stopped entering into new hedging transactions with Foreign Counterparties and do not currently intend to resume hedging with Foreign Counterparties. If we reduce our use of derivatives as a result of the Dodd-Frank Act, the Adopted Derivatives Rules, the U.S. Resolution Stay Rules, and Foreign Regulations, our results of operations may become more volatile and our cash flows may be less predictable, which could adversely affect our ability to plan for and fund capital expenditures. Any of these consequences could have a material adverse effect on us, our financial condition and our results of operations. See "Item 1. Business Regulation of derivatives" for a further description of the laws and regulations that affect us. 
 Tax laws and regulations may change over time, and any such changes could adversely affect our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flow. 
 From time to time, legislation has been proposed that, if enacted into law, would make significant changes to U.S. federal and state income tax laws, including (i) the elimination of the immediate deduction for intangible drilling and development costs, (ii) the repeal of the percentage depletion allowance for oil and natural gas properties and (iii) an extension of the amortization period for certain geological and geophysical expenditures. No accurate prediction can be made as to whether any such legislative changes will be proposed or enacted in the future or, if enacted, what the specific provisions or the effective date of any such legislation would be. The elimination of such U.S. federal tax deductions, as well as any other changes to or the imposition of new federal, state, local or non-U.S. taxes (including the imposition of, or increases in production, severance or similar taxes) could adversely affect our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flow. 
 In addition, the IRA imposes a 15 corporate alternative minimum tax ("CAMT") on the "adjusted financial statement income" of certain large corporations (generally, corporations reporting at least 1 billion average adjusted pre-tax net income in their consolidated financial statements) as well as an excise tax of 1 on the fair market value of certain public company stock repurchases for tax years beginning after December 31, 2022. The U.S. Treasury Department, the Internal Revenue Service and other standard-setting bodies are expected to issue guidance on how the CAMT, stock buyback excise tax, and other provisions of the IRA will be applied or otherwise administered. We continue to evaluate the IRA and its effect on our financial results and operating cash flow. 
 Restrictions on drilling activities intended to protect certain species of wildlife may adversely affect our ability to conduct drilling activities in some of the areas where we operate. 
 Oil, NGL and natural gas operations in our operating areas can be adversely affected by seasonal or permanent restrictions on drilling activities designed to protect various wildlife. Seasonal restrictions may limit our ability to operate in protected areas and can intensify competition for drilling rigs, oilfield equipment, services, supplies and qualified personnel, which may lead to periodic shortages when drilling is allowed. These constraints and the resulting shortages or high costs could delay our 
 39 

Table of Contents 

 operations and materially increase our operating and capital costs. Permanent restrictions imposed to protect threatened or endangered species could prohibit drilling in certain areas or require the implementation of expensive mitigation measures. The presence of newly listed species, such as the lesser prairie chicken, or designation of previously unprotected species in areas where we operate, such as the dunes sagebrush lizard could cause us to incur increased costs arising from species protection measures or could result in limitations on our exploration and production activities that could have an adverse impact on our ability to develop and produce our reserves. 
 Risks related to our common stock 
 Our amended and restated certificate of incorporation, amended and restated bylaws, and Delaware state law contain provisions that may have the effect of delaying or preventing a change in control and may adversely affect the market price of our capital stock. 
 Our amended and restated certificate of incorporation authorizes our board of directors to issue preferred stock without any further vote or action by the stockholders. The rights of the holders of our common stock will be subject to the rights of the holders of any preferred stock that may be issued in the future. The issuance of preferred stock could delay, deter or prevent a change in control and could adversely affect the voting power or economic value of our shares. 
 In addition, some provisions of our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and amended and restated bylaws could make it more difficult for a third party to acquire control of us, even if the change of control would be beneficial to our stockholders. 
 Delaware law prohibits us from engaging in any business combination with any "interested stockholder," meaning generally that a stockholder who owns 15 of our stock cannot acquire us for a period of three years from the date such stockholder became an interested stockholder, unless various conditions are met, such as the approval of the transaction by our board of directors. Provisions such as these are also not favored by various institutional investor services, which may periodically "grade" us on various factors, including stockholder rights and corporate governance policies. Certain institutional investors may have internal policies that prohibit investments in companies receiving a certain grade level from such services, and if we fail to meet such criteria, it could limit the number or type of certain investors which might otherwise be attracted to an investment in the Company, potentially negatively impacting the public float and/or market price of our common stock. 
 The availability of shares for sale in the future could reduce the market price of our common stock. 
 Our board of directors has the authority, without action or vote of our stockholders, to issue our authorized but unissued shares of common stock. In the future, we may issue securities to raise cash for acquisitions, to pay down debt, to fund capital expenditures or general corporate expenses, in connection with the exercise of stock options or to satisfy our obligations under our incentive plans. We may also acquire interests in other companies by using a combination of cash and our common stock or just our common stock. We may also issue securities convertible into, exchangeable for, or that represent the right to receive, our common stock. Any of these events may dilute your ownership interest in our Company, reduce our earnings per share and have an adverse impact on the price of our common stock. 
 Because we have no plans to pay and are currently restricted from paying dividends on our common stock, investors must look solely to stock appreciation for a return on their investment in us. 
 We do not anticipate paying any cash dividends on our common stock in the foreseeable future. We currently intend to retain all future earnings to fund the development and growth of our business. Any payment of future dividends will be at the discretion of our board of directors and will depend on, among other things, our earnings, financial condition, capital requirements, level of indebtedness, statutory and contractual restrictions applying to the payment of dividends and other considerations that our board of directors deems relevant. Covenants contained in our Senior Secured Credit Facility and the indentures governing our senior unsecured notes restrict the payment of dividends. Investors must rely on sales of their common stock after price appreciation, which may never occur, as the only way to realize a return on their investment. Investors seeking cash dividends should not purchase our common stock.

 Executive overview 
 We are an independent energy company focused on the acquisition, exploration and development of oil and natural gas properties in the Permian Basin of West Texas. We have grown primarily through our drilling program, coupled with select strategic acquisitions and joint ventures. 
 As of December 31, 2022, we were operating two drilling rigs and one completions crew. We expect to operate two drilling rigs during 2023, with two completions crews during the first quarter of 2023 and returning to one completions crew for the remainder of 2023. Our expected capital expenditures for full-year 2023 are expected to be in the approximate range of 625.0 million to 675.0 million. However, we will continue to monitor commodity prices and service costs and adjust activity levels in order to proactively manage our cash flows and preserve liquidity. Below is a summary of our financial and operating performance for the periods presented:

 Recent developments 
 Vital Energy rebranding 
 Effective January 9, 2023, the Company changed its corporate name from Laredo Petroleum, Inc. to Vital Energy, Inc., pursuant to a certificate of amendment to its certificate of incorporation filed with the Delaware Secretary of State on January 6, 2023. The Company also amended and restated its bylaws to reflect the name change, effective as of January 9, 2023. 
 Volatility in commodity prices 
 Commodity prices remained steady during the fourth quarter of 2022, sustaining levels reached at the end of the first quarter as increased commodity demand has continued to outpace relative supply. While recessionary concerns have placed some downward pressure on commodity prices, causing oil and gas prices to retreat from their earlier highs in 2022, worldwide commodity demand continues to exceed pre-COVID-19 pandemic levels. Although supply has increased, it has been constrained and pricing has been affected, in part, by the impact of the Russian-Ukrainian military conflict on global commodity and financial markets, and the resulting effect of sanctions by the European Union, United Kingdom and U.S. on imports of oil and natural gas from Russia, as well as a recent announcement by OPEC+ of oil production cuts of two million barrels per day beginning in November of 2022. However, because any of the above factors could suddenly change or reverse, global commodity and financial markets remain subject to heightened levels of uncertainty and volatility, and future disruptions and industry-specific impacts could result. 
 Rising inflation and interest rates 
 Reversing a trend experienced in 2020 in connection with the impact of COVID-19 and historically low crude oil prices, drilling and completions costs and costs of oilfield services, equipment and materials began to rise in 2021 and continued to persist at elevated levels in 2022 in conjunction with the significant increase in commodity prices, labor tightening, supply chain disruptions caused by the COVID-19 pandemic and the resulting limited availability of certain materials and products manufactured using such materials and heightened levels of inflation. In addition to the effect of such inflationary pressures on our operating and capital costs, rising interest rates as a result of the Federal Reserve s tightening monetary policy have increased our borrowing costs on debt under our Senior Secured Credit Facility and may limit our ability to access debt capital markets. Additional increases in interest rates have the potential to increase our costs of borrowing even more. We remain committed to our ongoing efforts to increase the efficiency of our operations and improve costs, which may, in part, offset cost increases from inflation and reduce our borrowing needs. 
 See Note 18 to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report for discussion of recent developments that have occurred subsequent to December 31, 2022. 
 Pricing and reserves 
 Our results of operations are heavily influenced by oil, NGL and natural gas prices. Historically, commodity prices have experienced significant fluctuations; however, the volatility in the prices has substantially increased in recent years. We maintain an active commodity derivatives strategy to minimize commodity price volatility and support cash flows for operations. We have entered into a number of commodity derivative contracts that have enabled us to offset a portion of the changes in our cash flow caused by fluctuations in price and basis differentials for our sales of oil, NGL and natural gas, as discussed in "Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk." See Notes 11, 12 and 18 to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report for additional discussion of our commodity derivatives. Not withstanding our derivatives strategy, another collapse in commodity prices may affect the economic viability of, and our ability to fund, our drilling projects, as well as the economic valuation and economic recovery of oil, NGL and natural gas reserves. See "Critical accounting estimates" for further discussion of our oil, NGL and natural gas reserve quantities and standardized measure of discounted future net cash flows.

 Our reserves are reported in three streams: oil, NGL and natural gas. The Realized Prices, which are utilized to value our proved reserves and calculated using the average first-day-of-the-month prices for each month within the 12-month period prior to the end of the reporting period, adjusted for factors affecting price received at the delivery point, as of December 31, 2022 were 96.21 for oil, 29.84 for NGL and 4.24 for natural gas. The unamortized cost of evaluated oil and natural gas properties being depleted did not exceed the full cost ceiling for any of the quarterly periods in 2022 and 2021. As such, no full cost ceiling impairments were recorded during the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021. Oil prices have declined from mid-2022 levels, however, even with this decline if oil prices remain at current levels, we do not anticipate recording full cost ceiling impairments for the foreseeable future. See Notes 2 and 6 to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report for discussion of the full cost method of accounting and our Realized Prices.

 Sales of purchased oil are a function of the volumes and prices of purchased oil sold to customers and are offset by the volumes and costs of purchased oil. We are a firm shipper on the Gray Oak pipeline and we utilize purchased oil to fulfill portions of our commitments. In previous periods, we also utilized purchased oil to fulfill portions of our Bridgetex pipeline commitment, which ended during the first quarter of 2022. The continuance of this practice in the future is based upon, among other factors, our pipeline capacity as a firm shipper and the quantity of our lease production which may contribute to our pipeline commitments. Sales of purchased oil decreased during the year ended December 31, 2022 compared to 2021 primarily due to a decrease in the volumes of purchased oil as our Bridgetex pipeline commitment ended during the first quarter of 2022, partially offset by an increase in sales prices. 
 We enter into purchase transactions with third parties and separate sale transactions. These transactions are presented on a gross basis as we act as the principal in the transaction by assuming control of the commodities purchased and the responsibility to deliver the commodities sold. The transportation costs associated with these transactions are presented as a component of costs of purchased oil. See " Costs and expenses - Costs of purchased oil."

 Lease operating expenses ("LOE") 
 LOE, which includes workover expenses, increased for the year ended December 31, 2022 compared to 2021. LOE are daily expenses incurred to bring oil, NGL and natural gas out of the ground and to market, together with the daily expenses incurred to maintain our producing properties. Such costs also include maintenance, repairs and non-routine workover expenses related to our oil and natural gas properties. LOE increased during 2022 due to inflationary pressures and costs associated with integrating our assets from the Sabalo/Shad Acquisition and Pioneer Acquisition, primarily driven by costs related to artificial lift and flowback management. We continue to focus on economic efficiencies associated with the usage and procurement of products and services related to LOE. Total LOE is expected to increase for 2023 as more of our production shifts to high-value Howard County wells, where, among other things, we have higher water production, resulting in increased water handling and lifting costs.

 Production and ad valorem taxes 
 Production and ad valorem taxes increased for the year ended December 31, 2022 compared to 2021 due to increased oil, NGL and natural gas sales revenues. Production taxes are based on and fluctuate in proportion to our oil, NGL and natural gas sales revenues, and are established by federal, state or local taxing authorities. We take advantage of all credits and exemptions in our various taxing jurisdictions. Ad valorem taxes are based on and fluctuate in proportion to the taxable value assessed by the various counties where our oil and natural gas properties are located. 
 Transportation and marketing expenses 
 Transportation and marketing expenses increased for the year ended December 31, 2022 compared to 2021. These are expenses incurred for the delivery of produced oil to customers in the U.S. Gulf Coast market via the Gray Oak pipeline and, in previous years and the first quarter of 2022, the Bridgetex pipeline. We ship the majority of our produced oil to the U.S. Gulf Coast, which we believe provides a long-term pricing advantages versus the Midland market. Additionally, firm transportation payments on excess pipeline capacity associated with transportation agreements are included in transportation and marketing expenses. See Note 15 to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report for additional discussion of our transportation commitments. 
 Costs of purchased oil 
 During the year ended December 31, 2022, we were a firm shipper on the Gray Oak pipeline and we utilized purchased oil to fulfill portions of our commitments. In previous years and the first quarter of 2022, we also utilized purchased oil to fulfill portions of our Bridgetex pipeline commitment, which ended during the first quarter of 2022. In the event our long-haul transportation capacity on the Gray Oak pipeline is expected to exceed our net production, consistent with our historic practice, we expect to continue to purchase third-party oil at the trading hubs to satisfy the deficit in our associated long-haul transportation commitments. Costs of purchased oil decreased for the year ended December 31, 2022, compared to the same period in 2021 primarily due to a decrease in the volumes of purchased oil on pipelines as our Bridgetex pipeline commitment ended during the first quarter of 2022 and an increase in produced oil volumes, partially offset by an increase in sales prices. 
 General and administrative ("G A") 
 G A are expenses incurred for overhead, including payroll and benefits for our corporate staff, costs of maintaining our headquarters, non-production based franchise taxes, audit and other fees for professional services, legal compliance and equity-based compensation. 
 G A, excluding employee compensation expense from our long-term incentive plan ("LTIP"), increased for the year ended December 31, 2022 compared to 2021 mainly due to (i) increases in workforce and professional expenses and (ii) inflationary pressures. 
 LTIP cash expense decreased for the year ended December 31, 2022 compared to 2021. These decreases are primarily due to (i) forfeitures of cash-settled performance unit awards in connection with the departure of our former Senior Vice President and Chief Operating Officer during the third quarter of 2022 and (ii) a decrease in the fair values of our cash-settled LTIP awards during the year ended December 31, 2022, mainly due to the performance of our stock during the period. 
 LTIP non-cash expense increased for the year ended December 31, 2022 compared to 2021, mainly due to new share-settled LTIP awards granted to our employees during the second half of 2021 and the first half of 2022, and partially offset by forfeitures of share-settled LTIP awards in connection with the departure of our former Senior Vice President and Chief Operating Officer during the third quarter of 2022. See Notes 2, 9 and 17 to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report for information regarding our equity-based compensation. 
 Organizational restructuring expenses 
 Organizational restructuring expenses increased for the year ended December 31, 2022 compared to 2021. Such expenses were incurred for (i) the departure our former Senior Vice President and Chief Operating Officer during the third quarter of 2022 and (ii) a workforce reduction during the second quarter of 2021. See Note 17 to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report for further discussion of the organizational restructurings.

 Depletion expense per BOE increased for the year ended December 31, 2022 compared to 2021 primarily due to an increase in the book value of our oil and natural gas properties as a result of the Sabalo/Shad Acquisition and Pioneer Acquisition and the associated development costs, which includes the effects of inflationary pressures. 
 See Note 6 to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report for additional information regarding the full cost method of accounting. 
 Gain (loss) on disposal of assets, net 
 Gain (loss) on disposal of assets, net, decreased for the year ended December 31, 2022 compared to 2021, primarily due to the gain recorded in third-quarter 2021 in connection with the Working Interest Sale. See Note 4 to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report for additional discussion regarding the gain on the Working Interest Sale. From time to time, we dispose of inventory, midstream service assets and other fixed assets. The associated gain or loss recorded during the period fluctuates depending on the volume of the assets disposed, their associated net book value and, in the case of a disposal by sale, the sale price.

 Non-cash gain (loss) on derivatives, net is the result of (i) new and matured contracts, including contingent consideration derivatives for the period subsequent to the initial valuation date and through the end of the contingency period, and the changing relationship between our outstanding contract prices and the future market prices in the forward curves, which we use to calculate the fair value of our derivatives and (ii) matured interest rate swaps and the changing relationship between the contract interest rate and the LIBOR interest rate forward curve. In general, if outstanding commodity contracts are held 
 51 

Table of Contents 

 constant, we experience gains during periods of decreasing market prices and losses during periods of increasing market prices. 
 Settlements paid for matured derivatives, net are for our (i) commodity derivatives, which are based on the settlement prices compared to the prices specified in the derivative contracts, (ii) interest rate derivative and (iii) contingent consideration derivatives. 
 We classify the derivatives gains and losses as operating activities and cash received for contingent consideration derivatives as investing activities in our consolidated statements of cash flows. See Notes 2, 4, 11, 12 and 18 to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report and see "Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk" below for additional information regarding our derivatives. 
 Interest expense 
 Interest expense increased for the year ended December 31, 2022 compared to 2021. We finance a portion of our working capital requirements, capital expenditures and acquisitions with borrowings under our Senior Secured Credit Facility and our senior unsecured notes. As a result, we incur interest expense that is affected by both fluctuations in interest rates and our financing decisions. We reflect interest paid to the lenders and bondholders in interest expense, net of amounts capitalized. In addition, we include the amortization of: (i) debt issuance costs (including origination, amendment and professional fees), (ii) commitment fees and (iii) annual agency fees in interest expense. During the third quarter of 2021, we completed the offering of the July 2029 Notes, with interest payable semi-annually commencing January 31, 2022 with interest from closing to that date. The increase during the year ended December 31, 2022 reflects a full year-to-date of interest expense incurred for the July 2029 Notes and higher interest expense on outstanding balances under our Senior Secured Credit Facility resulting from increases in interest rates by the U.S. Federal Reserve. See Note 7 to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report for additional information regarding our debt and interest expense. 
 Income tax (expense) benefit 
 The following table presents income tax (expense) benefit for the periods presented and corresponding changes for such periods: 
 Years ended December 31, 2022 compared to 2021 (in thousands) 2022 2021 Change ) Change ) Current (6,121) (1,324) (4,797) (362) Deferred 619 (2,321) 2,940 127 
 We are subject to federal and state income taxes and the Texas franchise tax. The income tax (expense) benefit for the year ended December 31, 2022 is attributed to Texas franchise tax, due to a full valuation allowance recorded against the federal and Oklahoma deferred tax assets. 
 If we were to experience an "ownership change" as determined under Section 382 of the Internal Revenue Code, our ability to offset taxable income arising after the ownership change with net operating losses ("NOL carryforwards") arising prior to the ownership change would be limited. As of December 31, 2022, no such ownership change has occurred. 
 With the rise in oil prices and the addition of oily, high-margin inventory, we have seen positive indications that we will use our NOLs. We utilized 281.6 million of our NOLs on our 2021 tax return and expect to utilize a comparable amount on our 2022 tax return. However, as of December 31, 2022, we believe it is more likely than not that a portion of the NOL carryforwards are not fully realizable. We continue to consider new evidence, both positive and negative, in determining whether, based on the weight of that evidence, a valuation allowance is needed. Such consideration includes projected future cash flows from our oil, NGL and natural gas reserves (including the timing of those cash flows), the reversal of deferred tax liabilities recorded as of December 31, 2022, and our ability to capitalize intangible drilling costs, rather than expensing these costs and future projections of Oklahoma sourced income. Significant items of objective negative evidence considered were the cumulative historical three-year pre-tax loss and a net deferred tax asset position at December 31, 2022. 
 We currently believe it is reasonably possible we could achieve a three-year cumulative level of profitability within the next 12 months, which would enhance our ability to conclude that it is more likely than not that the deferred tax assets would be 
 52 

Table of Contents 

 realized and support a release of the valuation allowance. However, the exact timing and amount of the release is unknown at this time. As long as we continue to conclude that the valuation allowance recorded against our net deferred tax assets is necessary, we will not have significant deferred income tax expense or benefit. The valuation allowance does not preclude us from utilizing the tax attributes if we recognize taxable income. 
 
 Liquidity and capital resources 
 Historically, our primary sources of liquidity have been cash flows from operations, proceeds from equity offerings, proceeds from senior unsecured note offerings, borrowings under our Senior Secured Credit Facility and proceeds from asset dispositions. Our primary operational uses of capital have been for the acquisition, exploration and development of oil and natural gas properties and infrastructure development. During the year ended December 31, 2022, we have utilized our cash flows to fund the repurchase of portions of our senior unsecured notes and our share repurchase program. For additional discussion of the repurchase of our senior unsecured notes and our share repurchase program, see Notes 7 and 8, respectively to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report. 
 We continually seek to maintain a financial profile that provides operational flexibility and monitor the markets to consider which financing alternatives, including debt and equity capital resources, joint ventures and asset sales, are available to meet our future planned capital expenditures, a significant portion of which we are able to adjust and manage. We also continually evaluate opportunities with respect to our capital structure, including issuances of new securities, as well as transactions involving our outstanding senior notes, which could take the form of open market or private repurchases, exchange or tender offers, or other similar transactions, and our common stock, which could take the form of open market or private repurchases. We may make changes to our capital structure from time to time, with the goal of maintaining financial flexibility, preserving or improving liquidity and/or achieving cost efficiency. Such financing alternatives, or combination of alternatives, if any, will depend on prevailing market conditions, our liquidity requirements, contractual restrictions and other factors. The amounts involved may be material. We continuously look for other opportunities to maximize shareholder value. For further discussion of our financing activities related to debt instruments, see Notes 7 and 18 to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report. 
 Due to the inherent volatility in the prices of oil, NGL and natural gas and the sometimes wide pricing differentials between where we produce and sell such commodities, we engage in commodity derivative transactions to hedge price risk associated with a portion of our anticipated sales volumes. Due to the inherent volatility in interest rates, we will, from time to time, enter into interest rate derivative swaps to hedge interest rate risk associated with our debt under the Senior Secured Credit Facility. By removing a portion of the price volatility associated with future sales volumes, we expect to mitigate, but not eliminate, the potential effects of variability in cash flows from operations. As of December 31, 2022, the Company has not entered into any interest rate derivative swaps, and therefore our outstanding debt balance under our Senior Secured Credit Facility is subject to interest rate fluctuations. See "Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk" below. See Notes 11 and 18 to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report for discussion of our open commodity positions. 
 As of December 31, 2022, we had cash and cash equivalents of 44.4 million and available capacity under the Senior Secured Credit Facility of 930.0 million, resulting in total liquidity of 974.4 million. As of February 17, 2023, we had cash and cash equivalents of 15.6 million and available capacity under the Senior Secured Credit Facility of 865.0 million, resulting in total liquidity of 880.6 million. We believe that our operating cash flows and the aforementioned liquidity sources provide us with sufficient liquidity and financial resources to manage our cash needs and contractual obligations, to implement our currently planned capital expenditure budget and, at our discretion, fund any share repurchases, pay down, repurchase or refinance debt or adjust our planned capital expenditure budget.

 Cash flows 
 The following table presents our cash flows for the periods presented and corresponding changes for such periods: 
 Years ended December 31, 2022 compared to 2021 (in thousands) 2022 2021 Change ) Change ) Net cash provided by operating activities 829,620 496,671 332,949 67 Net cash used in investing activities (475,952) (796,811) 320,859 40 Net cash (used in) provided by financing activities (366,031) 308,181 (674,212) (219) Net (decrease) increase in cash and cash equivalents (12,363) 8,041 (20,404) (254) 
 Cash flows from operating activities 
 Net cash provided by operating activities increased during the year ended December 31, 2022, compared to 2021. Notable cash changes include (i) an increase in total oil, NGL and natural gas sales revenues of 647.2 million, (ii) a decrease of 174.3 million due to changes in net settlements received for matured, net of premiums paid, mainly due to increases in commodity prices and (iii) a decrease of 16.4 million due to net changes in operating assets and liabilities. Other significant changes include an increase in lease operating expense and production and ad valorem taxes. The increase in total oil, NGL and natural gas sales revenues is due to a 55 increase in average sales price per BOE as well as a 19 increase in oil volumes sold. See " Results of operations" for additional discussion of our oil, NGL and natural gas sales revenues, derivatives and expenses. 
 Our operating cash flows are sensitive to a number of variables, the most significant of which are the volatility of oil, NGL and natural gas prices, mitigated to the extent of our commodity derivatives' exposure, and sales volume levels. Regional and worldwide economic activity, weather, infrastructure, transportation capacity to reach markets, costs of operations, legislation and regulations, including potential government production curtailments, and other variable factors significantly impact the prices of these commodities. For additional information on risks related to our business, see "Part I. Item 1A. Risk Factors" and "Part I. Item 7a. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk" included elsewhere in this Annual Report. 
 Cash flows from investing activities 
 Net cash used in investing activities decreased during the year ended December 31, 2022, compared to 2021, mainly due to (i) a decrease in acquisitions of oil and natural gas properties and (ii) an increase in capital expenditures, which includes the effects of inflationary pressures. Such items are partially offset by a decrease in proceeds from the sale of capital assets, which includes proceeds of 106.5 million for 2022 related to the sale of the Company's working interests in certain specified

 non-operated oil and gas properties. See Note 4 to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report for further discussion of our acquisitions and divestiture of oil and natural gas properties. 
 Expected capital expenditures 
 We currently expect capital expenditures for 2023 to be in the approximate range of 625.0 million to 675.0 million. We are prepared to adjust our capital expenditures further if oil, NGL and natural gas prices continue to exhibit volatility. We do not have a specific acquisition budget since the timing and size of acquisitions cannot be accurately forecasted. 
 The following table presents the components of our incurred capital expenditures, excluding non-budgeted acquisition costs, for the periods presented and corresponding changes for such periods: 
 Years ended December 31, 2022 compared to 2021 (in thousands) 2022 2021 Change ) Change ) Oil and natural gas properties (1) 
 566,831 444,337 122,494 28 Midstream service assets 1,595 2,842 (1,247) (44) Other fixed assets 12,150 6,807 5,343 78 Total incurred capital expenditures, excluding non-budgeted acquisition costs 580,576 453,986 126,590 28 
 _____________________________________________________________________________ 
 (1) See Note 19 to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report for additional information regarding our incurred capital expenditures in the exploration and development of oil and natural gas properties. 
 The amount, timing and allocation of capital expenditures are largely discretionary and within management's control. If oil, NGL and natural gas prices are below our acceptable levels, or costs are above our acceptable levels, we may choose to defer a portion of our capital expenditures until later periods to achieve the desired balance between sources and uses of liquidity and prioritize capital projects that we believe have the highest expected returns and potential to generate near-term cash flow. Subject to financing alternatives, we may also increase our capital expenditures significantly to take advantage of opportunities we consider to be attractive. We continually monitor and may adjust our projected capital expenditures in response to world developments, as well as success or lack of success in drilling activities, changes in prices, availability of financing and joint venture opportunities, drilling and acquisition costs, industry conditions, the timing of regulatory approvals, the availability of rigs and supplies, changes in service costs, contractual obligations, internally generated cash flow and other factors both within and outside our control. 
 Cash flows from financing activities 
 Net cash provided by financing activities was 308.2 million during the year ended December 31, 2021, compared to net cash used in financing activities of 366.0 million during the year ended December 31, 2022. In 2022, we began executing our strategy to return cash to shareholders through redemption of our senior unsecured notes and repurchasing our equity, which consisted of extinguishment of debt on our senior unsecured notes of 282.9 million and share repurchases of 37.3 million during the year ended December 31, 2022. Other notable 2022 activity includes (i) borrowings on our Senior Secured Credit Facility of 455.0 million, (ii) payments on our Senior Secured Credit Facility of 490.0 million and (iii) stock exchanged for tax withholding of 7.4 million. Notable 2021 activity includes borrowings on our Senior Secured Credit Facility, proceeds from the issuance of our July 2029 Notes and proceeds from our "at-the-market" equity program (the "ATM Program"), partially offset by payments on our Senior Secured Credit Facility. For further discussion of our financing activities related to debt instruments, see Notes 7 and 18 to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report. For further discussion of our financing activities related to stockholders' equity, see Note 8 to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report.

 Sources of liquidity 
 We are the borrower under our Senior Secured Credit Facility and a party to the indentures governing our senior unsecured notes. 
 Senior Secured Credit Facility 
 As of December 31, 2022, our Fifth Amended and Restated Credit Agreement (as amended, the "Senior Secured Credit Facility") had a maximum credit amount of 2.0 billion, a borrowing base of 1.3 billion and an aggregate elected commitment of 1.0 billion, with 70.0 million outstanding, and was subject to an interest rate of 6.897 . The Senior Secured Credit Facility provides for the issuance of letters of credit, limited to the lesser of total capacity or 80.0 million. As of December 31, 2022 and 2021, we had no letters of credit outstanding and one letter of credit outstanding of 44.1 million, respectively under the Senior Secured Credit Facility. 
 See Notes 7 and 18 to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report for further discussion of our Senior Secured Credit Facility. 
 January 2025 Notes, January 2028 Notes and July 2029 Notes 
 The following table presents principal amounts and applicable interest rates for our outstanding January 2025 Notes, January 2028 Notes and July 2029 Notes as of December 31, 2022: 
 (in millions, except for interest rates) Principal Interest rate January 2025 Notes 455.6 9.500 January 2028 Notes 300.3 10.125 July 2029 Notes 298.2 7.750 Total senior unsecured notes 1,054.1 
 During the year ended December 31, 2022, we repurchased a total of 284.8 million in aggregate principal amount of our senior unsecured notes. See Note 7 to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report for further discussion of these repurchases. 
 Supplemental Guarantor information 
 As of December 31, 2022, approximately 1.1 billion of our senior unsecured notes remained outstanding. Our wholly-owned subsidiary Vital Midstream Services, LLC ("VMS") (the "Guarantor"), jointly and severally, and fully and unconditionally, guarantees the January 2025 Notes, January 2028 Notes and July 2029 Notes. On February 3, 2023, Garden City Minerals, LLC ("GCM"), our former other wholly-owned subsidiary, was merged with and into Vital Energy, Inc. and is therefore no longer a guarantor under any of our debt arrangements. 
 The guarantees are senior unsecured obligations of the Guarantor and rank equally in right of payment with other existing and future senior indebtedness of such Guarantor, and senior in right of payment to all existing and future subordinated indebtedness of such Guarantor. The guarantees of the senior unsecured notes by the Guarantor are subject to certain Releases. The obligations of the Guarantor under its note guarantee are limited as necessary to prevent such note guarantee from constituting a fraudulent conveyance under applicable law. Further, the rights of holders of the senior unsecured notes against the Guarantor may be limited under the U.S. Bankruptcy Code or state fraudulent transfer or conveyance law. Vital is not restricted from making investments in the Guarantor and the Guarantor is not restricted from making intercompany distributions to Vital. 
 The assets, liabilities and results of operations of the combined issuer and the Guarantor are not materially different than the corresponding amounts presented in our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report. Accordingly, we have omitted the summarized financial information of the issuer and the Guarantor that would otherwise be required.

 Non-GAAP financial measures 
 The non-GAAP financial measures of Free Cash Flow and Adjusted EBITDA, as defined by us, may not be comparable to similarly titled measures used by other companies. Furthermore, these non-GAAP financial measures should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for GAAP measures of liquidity or financial performance, but rather should be considered in conjunction with GAAP measures, such as net income or loss, operating income or loss or cash flows from operating activities. 
 Free Cash Flow 
 Free Cash Flow is a non-GAAP financial measure that we define as net cash provided by operating activities (GAAP) before changes in operating assets and liabilities, net, less incurred capital expenditures, excluding non-budgeted acquisition costs. Management believes Free Cash Flow is useful to management and investors in evaluating operating trends in our business that are affected by production, commodity prices, operating costs and other related factors. There are significant limitations to the use of Free Cash Flow as a measure of performance, including the lack of comparability due to the different methods of calculating Free Cash Flow reported by different companies. 
 The following table presents a reconciliation of net cash provided by operating activities (GAAP) to Free Cash Flow (non-GAAP) for the periods presented: 
 Years ended December 31 (in thousands) 2022 2021 Net cash provided by operating activities 829,620 496,671 Less: Change in current assets and liabilities, net 54,260 49,321 Change in noncurrent assets and liabilities, net (25,157) (3,807) Cash flows from operating activities before changes in operating assets and liabilities, net 800,517 451,157 Less incurred capital expenditures, excluding non-budgeted acquisition costs: Oil and natural gas properties (1)

 _____________________________________________________________________________ 
 (1) Includes capitalized share-settled equity-based compensation and asset retirement costs. 
 Adjusted EBITDA 
 Adjusted EBITDA is a non-GAAP financial measure that we define as net income or loss (GAAP) plus adjustments for share-settled equity-based compensation; depletion, depreciation and amortization; impairment expense; gains or losses on disposal of assets; mark-to-market on derivatives; premiums paid or received for commodity derivatives that matured during the period; accretion expense; interest expense; income taxes and other non-recurring income and expenses. Adjusted EBITDA provides no information regarding a company's capital structure, borrowings, interest costs, capital expenditures, working capital movement or tax position. Adjusted EBITDA does not represent funds available for future discretionary use because it excludes funds required for debt service, capital expenditures, working capital, income taxes, franchise taxes and other commitments and obligations. However, our management believes Adjusted EBITDA is useful to an investor in evaluating our operating performance because this measure: 
 is widely used by investors in the oil and natural gas industry to measure a company's operating performance without regard to items that can vary substantially from company to company depending upon accounting methods, the book value of assets, capital structure and the method by which assets were acquired, among other factors; 
 57 

Table of Contents 

 helps investors to more meaningfully evaluate and compare the results of our operations from period to period by removing the effect of our capital structure from our operating structure; and 
 is used by our management for various purposes, including as a measure of operating performance, in presentations to our board of directors and as a basis for strategic planning and forecasting. 
 There are significant limitations to the use of Adjusted EBITDA as a measure of performance, including the inability to analyze the effect of certain recurring and non-recurring items that materially affect our net income or loss and the lack of comparability of results of operations to different companies due to the different methods of calculating Adjusted EBITDA reported by different companies. Our measurements of Adjusted EBITDA for financial reporting as compared to compliance under our debt agreements differ. 
 The following table presents a reconciliation of net income (GAAP) to Adjusted EBITDA (non-GAAP) for the periods presented: 
 Years ended December 31, (in thousands) 2022 2021 Net income 631,512 145,008 Plus: Share-settled equity-based compensation, net 8,403 7,675 Depletion, depreciation and amortization 311,640 215,355 Impairment expense 40 1,613 Organizational restructuring expenses 10,420 9,800 (Gain) loss on disposal of assets, net 1,079 (84,551) Mark-to-market on derivatives: Loss on derivatives, net 298,723 452,175 Settlements paid for matured derivatives, net (486,753) (320,868) Settlements received for contingent consideration 2,457 Net premiums paid for commodity derivatives that matured during the period (1)

 (1) Reflects net premiums paid previously or upon settlement that are attributable to derivatives settled in the respective periods presented. 
 Critical accounting estimates 
 The discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with GAAP. The preparation of our financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. Certain accounting policies involve judgments and uncertainties to such an extent that there is reasonable likelihood that materially different amounts could have been reported under different conditions or if different assumptions had been used. We evaluate our estimates and assumptions on a regular basis. We base our estimates on historical experience and various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates and assumptions used in preparation of our consolidated financial statements. 
 In management's opinion, the most critical accounting estimates impacted by our judgments and estimates are (i) volumes of our reserves of oil, NGL and natural gas and (ii) future cash flows from oil and natural gas properties. 
 58 

Table of Contents 

 There have been no material changes in our critical accounting estimates during the year ended December 31, 2022. 
 Oil, NGL and natural gas reserve quantities and standardized measure of discounted future net cash flows 
 On an annual basis, our independent reserve engineers prepare the estimates of oil, NGL and natural gas reserves and associated future net cash flows. The SEC has defined proved reserves as the estimated quantities of oil, NGL and natural gas that geological and engineering data demonstrate with reasonable certainty to be recoverable in future years from known reservoirs under existing economic and operating conditions. The process of estimating oil, NGL and natural gas reserves is complex, requiring significant judgment in the evaluation of available geological, geophysical, engineering and economic data. The data for a given property may also change substantially over time as a result of numerous factors, including additional development activity, evolving production history and a continual reassessment of the viability of production under changing economic conditions. As a result, material revisions to existing reserve estimates occur from time to time. Although every reasonable effort is made to ensure that reserve estimates reported represent the most accurate assessments possible, the subjective assumptions and variances in available data for various properties increase the likelihood of significant changes in these estimates. If such changes are material, they could significantly affect future amortization of capitalized costs and result in impairment of assets that may be material. See Note 19 to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report for additional discussion of our net proved oil, NGL and natural gas reserves and standardized measure of discounted future net cash flows, respectively. 
 New accounting standards 
 There are no new accounting standards not yet adopted and meaningful to disclose as of December 31, 2022. Additionally, we did not adopt any new accounting standards during the year ended December 31, 2022.

 Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk 
 The primary objective of the following information is to provide forward-looking quantitative and qualitative information about our potential exposure to market risk. The term "market risk," in our case, refers to the risk of loss arising from adverse changes in oil, NGL and natural gas prices and in interest rates. The disclosures are not meant to be precise indicators of expected future losses, but rather indicators of how we view and manage our ongoing market risk exposures. All of our market risk-sensitive derivative instruments were entered into for hedging purposes, rather than for speculative trading. 
 Commodity price exposure 
 Due to the inherent volatility in oil, NGL and natural gas prices and the sometimes wide pricing differentials between where we produce and where we sell such commodities, we engage in commodity derivative transactions, such as puts, swaps, collars and basis swaps to hedge price risk associated with a portion of our anticipated sales volumes. By removing a portion of the price volatility associated with future sales volumes, we expect to mitigate, but not eliminate, the potential effects of variability in cash flows from operations. 
 The fair values of our open commodity positions are largely determined by the relevant forward commodity price curves of the indexes associated with our open derivative positions. The following table provides a sensitivity analysis of the projected incremental effect on income or loss before income taxes of a hypothetical 10 change in the relevant forward commodity price curves of the indexes associated with our open commodity positions as of December 31, 2022: 
 (in thousands) As of December 31, 2022 
 Commodity derivative asset position 16,433 Impact of a 10 increase in forward commodity prices (27,299) Impact of a 10 decrease in forward commodity prices 25,878 
 See Notes 2, 11, 12 and 18 to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report for further discussion of our commodity derivatives. 
 Interest rate risk 
 Our Senior Secured Credit Facility bears interest at a floating rate and our senior unsecured notes bear interest at fixed rates. The interest rate on our Senior Secured Credit Facility as of December 31, 2022 was 6.897 . See Note 7 to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report for further discussion of our debt. The interest rate on borrowings may be based on an alternate base rate or term secured overnight financing rate ("Term SOFR"), at our option. Interest on alternate base rate loans is equal to the sum of (a) the highest of (i) the "prime rate" (as publically announced by Wells Fargo Bank, N.A.) in effect on such day, (ii) the federal funds effective rate in effect on such day plus 0.5 and (iii) the Adjusted Term SOFR (as defined in our Senior Secured Credit Facility) for a one-month tenor in effect on such a day plus 1 and (b) the applicable margin. Interest on Term SOFR loans is equal to the sum of (a)(i) the Term SOFR (as defined in our Senior Secured Credit Facility) rate for such period plus (ii) the Term SOFR Adjustment (as defined in our Senior Secured Credit Facility) of 0.1 (in the case of clause (a), subject to a floor of 0 plus (b) the applicable margin. The applicable margin varies form 1.5 to 2.5 on alternate base rate borrowings and from 2.5 to 3.5 on Term SOFR borrowings, in each case, depending on our utilization ratio. At December 31, 2022, the applicable margin on our borrowings were 1.5 for alternate base rate borrowings and 2.5 for Term SOFR borrowings.

 Management's Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting 
 Management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting. The Company's internal control over financial reporting is a process designed under the supervision of the Company's Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of the Company's financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. 
 As of December 31, 2022, management assessed the effectiveness of the Company's internal control over financial reporting based on the criteria for effective internal control over financial reporting established in the 2013 "Internal Control - Integrated Framework," issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. Based on this assessment and those criteria, management determined that the Company maintained effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2022. 
 Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. 
 Ernst Young LLP, the independent registered public accounting firm that audited the consolidated financial statements of the Company included in this Annual Report, has issued their report on the effectiveness of the Company's internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2022. The report, which expresses an unqualified opinion on the effectiveness of the Company's internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2022, is included in this Item under the heading "Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm."

 Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm 
 To the Stockholders and the Board of Directors of Vital Energy, Inc. 
 Opinion on internal control over financial reporting 
 We have audited Vital Energy, Inc.'s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2022, based on criteria established in Internal Control Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (2013 framework) (the COSO criteria). In our opinion, Vital Energy, Inc. (the Company) maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2022, based on the COSO criteria. 
 We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the 2022 consolidated financial statements of the Company and our report dated February 22, 2023 expressed an unqualified opinion thereon. 
 Basis for opinion 
 The Company's management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting included in the accompanying Management's Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company's internal control over financial reporting based on our audit. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. 
 We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. 
 Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk, and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion. 
 Definition and limitations of internal control over financial reporting 
 A company's internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company's internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company's assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements. 
 Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

 Item 9. Changes in and Disagreements with Accountants on Accounting and Financial Disclosure 
 On June 3, 2022, following the completion of a comprehensive evaluation process, our Audit Committee dismissed Grant Thornton LLP Grant Thornton and appointed Ernst Young LLP EY as the Company s independent registered public accounting firm for the fiscal year ending December 31, 2022. The change was effective immediately. 
 Grant Thornton s audit report on the Company s consolidated financial statements for the fiscal years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020 did not contain an adverse opinion or a disclaimer of opinion and was not qualified or modified as to uncertainty, audit scope or accounting principle. 
 During the fiscal years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020 and through the subsequent interim period ending June 3, 2022, there were (i) no disagreements (as that term is defined in Item 304(a)(1)(iv) of Regulation S-K and the related instructions) between the Company and Grant Thornton on any matter of accounting principles or practices, financial statement disclosure, or auditing scope or procedure, which, if not resolved to the satisfaction of Grant Thornton would have caused Grant Thornton to make reference to the subject matter thereof in connection with its reports on the consolidated financial statements of the Company for such years, and (ii) no reportable events (as that term is defined in Item 304(a)(1)(v) of Regulation S-K). 
 During the fiscal years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020 and through the subsequent interim period ending June 3, 2022, neither the Company, nor any party on behalf of the Company, consulted with EY with respect to either (i) the application of accounting principles to a specified transaction, either completed or proposed, or the type of the audit opinion that might be rendered with respect to the Company s consolidated financial statements, and no written report or oral advice was provided to the Company by EY that was an important factor considered by the Company in reaching a decision as to any accounting, auditing or financial reporting issue, or (ii) any matter that was subject to any disagreement (as that term is defined in Item 304(a)(1)(iv) of Regulation S-K and the related instructions) or a reportable event (as that term is defined in Item 304(a)(1)(v) of Regulation S-K). 
 
 Item 9A. Controls and Procedures. 
 Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures 
 As required by Rule 13a-15(b) of the Exchange Act, we have evaluated, under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our principal executive officer and principal financial officer, the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act) as of the end of the period covered by this Annual Report. Our disclosure controls and procedures are designed to provide reasonable assurance that the information required to be disclosed by us in reports that we file under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our principal executive officer and principal financial officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure and is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the rules and forms of the SEC. Based upon the evaluation, our principal executive officer and principal financial officer have concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of December 31, 2022 at the reasonable assurance level. 
 Design and Evaluation of Internal Control Over Financial Reporting 
 Pursuant to Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, our management has included a report of their assessment of the design and operating effectiveness of our internal controls over financial reporting as part of this Annual Report for the year ended December 31, 2022. Ernst Young LLP, the Company's independent registered public accounting firm, has issued an attestation report on the effectiveness of the Company's internal control over financial reporting. Management's report and the independent registered public accounting firm's attestation report are included in "Item 8.

Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm 
 To the Stockholders and the Board of Directors of Vital Energy, Inc. 
 Opinion on the Financial Statements 
 We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheet of Vital Energy, Inc. (the Company) as of December 31, 2022, the related consolidated statements of operations, stockholders' equity and cash flows for the year ended December 31, 2022, and the related notes (collectively referred to as the "consolidated financial statements"). In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company at December 31, 2022, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for the year ended December 31, 2022, in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. 
 We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the Company's internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2022, based on criteria established in Internal Control-Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (2013 framework), and our report dated February 22, 2023 expressed an unqualified opinion thereon. 
 Basis for opinion 
 These financial statements are the responsibility of the Company's management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company's financial statements based on our audit. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. 
 We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. Our audit included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audit also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion. 
 Critical Audit Matter 
 The critical audit matter communicated below is a matter arising from the current period audit of the financial statements that was communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that: (1) relates to accounts or disclosures that are material to the financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective or complex judgments. The communication of the critical audit matter does not alter in any way our opinion on the consolidated financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matter below, providing a separate opinion on the critical audit matter or on the accounts or disclosures to which it relates.

Depreciation, Depletion, and Amortization (DD A) of proved properties Description of the Matter At December 31, 2022, the carrying value of the Company's oil and natural gas properties was 2,283 million, and depreciation, depletion and amortization (DD A) expense was 312 million for the year then ended. As described in Note 2, the Company follows the full cost method of accounting for its oil and gas properties. The cost of oil and natural gas properties, net is amortized using the unit-of-production method based on total proved oil, NGL and natural gas reserves, as estimated by the independent reserve engineers. Proved oil, NGL and natural gas reserves are those quantities of crude oil, natural gas liquids, and natural gas, which by analysis of geoscience and engineering data, can be estimated with reasonable certainty to be economically producible from a given date forward, from known reservoirs, and under existing economic and operating conditions. Significant judgment is required by the independent reserve engineers in interpreting the data used to estimate proved oil, NGL and natural gas reserves. Estimating reserves also requires the selection of inputs, including historical production, oil and gas price assumptions, and future operating and capital costs assumptions, among others. Because of the complexity in estimating oil, NGL and natural gas reserves, management used independent reserve engineers to prepare the proved oil, NGL and natural gas reserve estimates as of December 31, 2022. Auditing the Company's DD A expense is complex because of the use of the work of the independent reserve engineers and the evaluation of management's determination of the inputs described above used by the engineers in estimating proved oil, NGL and natural gas reserves. How We Addressed the Matter in Our Audit We obtained an understanding, evaluated the design, and tested the operating effectiveness of the Company's controls that address the risks of material misstatement relating to the DD A expense calculation for oil and natural gas properties. This includes controls over the completeness and accuracy of the financial data used in estimating proved oil, NGL and natural gas reserves. Our audit procedures included, among others, evaluating the professional qualifications and objectivity of the Company's independent reserve engineers used to prepare the proved oil, NGL and natural gas reserve estimates. In addition, in assessing whether we can use the work of the independent reserve engineers, we evaluated the completeness and accuracy of the financial data and inputs described above used by the engineers in estimating oil, NGL and natural gas reserves by agreeing them to source documentation, and we identified and evaluated corroborative and contrary evidence. For proved undeveloped reserves, we evaluated management's development plan for compliance with SEC requirements. We also tested that the DD A expense calculation is based on the appropriate proved oil, NGL and natural gas reserve amounts as estimated by the Company's independent reserve engineers.

 2021 Asset acquisitions and divestiture 
 Pioneer Acquisition 
 On September 17, 2021, the Company entered into a purchase and sale agreement (the "Pioneer PSA") with Pioneer Natural Resources USA, Inc ("PXD"), DE Midland III, LLC ("DEM"), Parsley Minerals, LLC ("PM") and Parsley Energy, L.P. ("PE" and collectively with PXD, DEM, and PM, "the Seller") pursuant to which the Company agreed to purchase (the "Pioneer Acquisition"), effective as of July 1, 2021, certain oil and natural gas properties in the Midland Basin, including approximately net acres, and approximately gross net) operated locations, located in western Glasscock County, Texas, as well as related assets and contracts (the "Pioneer Assets"). 
 On October 18, 2021 ("Pioneer Closing Date"), the Company closed the Pioneer Acquisition for an aggregate purchase price of million, comprised of (i) million in cash, (ii) shares of the Company's common stock, par value

 million in transaction related expenses, inclusive of post-closing adjustments. 
 The Company determined that the Pioneer Acquisition was an asset acquisition, as substantially all of the gross assets acquired are concentrated in a group of similar identifiable assets. Accordingly, the consideration paid was allocated to the individual assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on their relative fair values and all transaction costs associated were capitalized.

 The Company funded the cash portion of the aggregate purchase price and related transaction costs with respect to the Pioneer Acquisition with cash on hand and borrowings under its Senior Secured Credit Facility. 
 During the year ended December 31, 2021, in connection with the Pioneer Acquisition, the Company acquired additional interests in the Pioneer Assets through additional sellers that exercised their "tag-along" sales rights, for total cash consideration of million, excluding customary purchase price adjustments. These acquisitions were accounted for as asset acquisitions. 
 Sabalo/Shad Acquisition 
 On May 7, 2021, the Company entered into separate purchase and sale agreements, one (the "Sabalo PSA") with Sabalo Energy, LLC and its subsidiary, Sabalo Operating, LLC (collectively, "Sabalo"), and the other (the "Shad PSA" and together with the Sabalo PSA, the "Sabalo/Shad PSAs") with Shad Permian, LLC ("Shad") to acquire certain Midland Basin oil and natural gas properties, including approximately net acres and approximately gross net) operated locations and approximately gross net) non-operated locations, located in Howard and Borden Counties, Texas, (collectively, the "Sabalo/Shad Acquisition"). Sabalo and Shad are unaffiliated, but owned interest in the same assets. 
 On July 1, 2021 ("Sabalo/Shad Closing Date"), the Company closed the Sabalo/Shad Acquisition, effective April 1, 2021, for an aggregate purchase price of million, comprised of (i) million in cash (ii) shares of the Company's common stock, based upon the share price as of the Sabalo/Shad Closing Date, and (iii) million in transaction related expenses, inclusive of customary closing adjustments. 
 The Sabalo/Shad Acquisition was accounted for as a single transaction because the Sabalo PSA and Shad PSA were entered into at the same time and in contemplation of one another to form a single transaction designed to achieve an overall economic effect. The Company determined that the Sabalo/Shad Acquisition was an asset acquisition, as substantially all of the gross assets acquired are concentrated in a group of similar identifiable assets. Accordingly, the consideration paid was allocated to the individual assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on their relative fair values and all transaction costs associated were capitalized.

 The Company funded the cash portion of the aggregate purchase price and related transaction costs with respect to the Sabalo/Shad Acquisition with proceeds from borrowings under its Senior Secured Credit Facility (as defined in Note 7) and the Working Interest Sale described below. 
 Working Interest Sale 
 On May 7, 2021, the Company entered into a purchase and sale agreement (the "Sixth Street PSA") with Piper Investments Holdings, LLC, an affiliate of Sixth Street Partners, LLC ("Sixth Street"), to sell of the Company's working interest in certain producing wellbores and the related properties primarily located within Glasscock and Reagan Counties, Texas, subject to certain excluded assets and title diligence procedures (the "Working Interest Sale"). 
 On July 1, 2021 (the "Sixth Street Closing Date") the Company closed the Working Interest Sale for cash proceeds of million. In addition to such proceeds, the Sixth Street PSA also provided the Company with the right to receive up to a maximum of million in additional cash consideration if certain cash flow targets related to divested oil and natural gas property operations are met ("Sixth Street Contingent Consideration"). The Sixth Street Contingent Consideration is made up of quarterly payments through June 2027 totaling up to million and a potential balloon payment of million in June 2027. On the Sixth Street Closing Date, the fair value of the Sixth Street Contingent Consideration was determined to be million. The Sixth Street Contingent Consideration is accounted for as a contingent consideration derivative, with all gains and losses as a result of changes in the fair value of the contingent consideration derivative recognized in earnings in the period in which the changes occur. See Notes 11 and 12 for further discussion of the Sixth Street Contingent Consideration. 
 Subsequent to the Sixth Street Closing Date, the Company continues to own and operate its remaining working interest in the properties sold to Sixth Street; however, the results of operations and cash flows related to the working interests sold were eliminated from the Company's financial statements. This divestiture did not represent a strategic shift and will not have a major effect on the Company's future operations or financial results. 
 Pursuant to the rules governing full cost accounting, the Company recorded a gain on the Working Interest Sale of million, net of transaction expenses of million, on the Company's consolidated statements of operations, inclusive of post-closing adjustments, as this divestment represented more than of the Company's June 30, 2021 proved reserves. For the purposes of calculating the gain, total capitalized costs were allocated between reserves sold and reserves retained as of the Sixth Street Closing Date.

 Exchange of unevaluated oil and natural gas properties 
 From time to time, the Company exchanges undeveloped acreage with third parties. The exchanges are recorded at fair value and the difference is accounted for as an adjustment of capitalized costs with no gain or loss recognized pursuant to the rules governing full cost accounting, unless such adjustment would significantly alter the relationship between capitalized costs and proved reserves of oil, NGL and natural gas.

For portions of awards with performance criteria, the fair value is equal to the Company's closing stock price on the grant date (or modification date), and for each reporting period, the associated expense fluctuates and is adjusted based on an estimated payout of the number of shares of common stock to be delivered on the payment date for the performance period, which begins at the start of the calendar year in which the award is granted. 
 For performance share awards granted in 2022, the market criteria consists of: (i) annual relative total shareholder return comparing the Company's shareholder return to the shareholder return of the exploration and production companies listed in the Russell 2000 Index and (ii) annual absolute total shareholder return. The performance criteria for these awards consists of: (i) earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, amortization and exploration expense and three-year total debt reduction, (ii) growth in inventory and (iii) emissions reduction targets. Any shares earned are expected to be issued in the first quarter following the completion of the respective requisite service periods based on the achievement of certain market and performance criteria, and the payout can range from to . 
 For performance share awards granted in 2019, the market criteria consists of: (i) the relative total shareholder return ("TSR") comparing the Company's shareholder return to the shareholder return of the peer group specified in each award agreement ("RTSR Performance Percentage"), and (ii) the Company's absolute total shareholder return ("ATSR Appreciation"). The performance criteria for these awards consists of the Company's three-year return on average capital employed ("ROACE Percentage"). Potential payout of these awards ranged from to . In the first quarter of 2022, following the completion of the requisite service period and achievement of certain market and performance criteria, these shares were issued at payout.

 Commodity 
 Due to the inherent volatility in oil, NGL and natural gas prices and the sometimes wide pricing differentials between where the Company produces and where the Company sells such commodities, the Company engages in commodity derivative transactions, such as puts, swaps, collars and basis swaps to hedge price risk associated with a portion of the Company's anticipated sales volumes. By removing a portion of the price volatility associated with future sales volumes, the Company expects to mitigate, but not eliminate, the potential effects of variability in cash flows from operations. During the year ended December 31, 2022, the Company's derivatives were settled based on reported prices on commodity exchanges, with (i) oil

 Contingent consideration 
 The Sixth Street PSA provided for potential contingent payments to be paid to the Company if certain cash flow targets are met related to divested oil and natural gas property operations. The Sixth Street Contingent Consideration provides the Company with the right to receive up to a maximum of million in additional cash consideration, comprised of potential quarterly payments through June 2027 totaling up to million and a potential balloon payment of million in June 2027. As of December 31, 2022, the maximum remaining additional cash consideration of the contingent consideration was million. The fair value of the Sixth Street Contingent Consideration was determined to be million as of December 31, 2022 and million as of December 31, 2021.

 Contingent consideration 
 The Working Interest Sale provided for potential contingent payments to be paid to the Company. The Sixth Street Contingent Consideration associated with the Working Interest Sale was categorized as Level 3, as the Company utilized its own cash flow projections along with a risk-adjusted discount rate generated by a third-party valuation specialist to determine the valuation. The Company reviewed the third-party specialist's valuation, including the related inputs, and analyzed changes in fair values between the divestiture closing date and the reporting dates. The fair value of the Sixth Street Contingent Consideration was recorded as part of the basis in the oil and natural gas properties divested and as a contingent consideration asset. At each quarterly reporting period, the Company remeasures contingent consideration with the change in fair values recognized in "Gain (loss) on derivatives, net" under "Non-operating income (expense)" on the consolidated statement of operations.

 The Company is required to estimate the federal and state income taxes in each of the jurisdictions it operates in. This process involves estimating the actual current tax exposure together with assessing temporary differences resulting from differing treatment of items for tax and financial accounting purposes. These differences and the Company's net operating loss carryforwards result in deferred tax assets and liabilities.

 As of December 31, 2022, the Company had federal net operating loss carryforwards totaling billion which expire between 2033 and 2037 and state of Oklahoma net operating loss carryforwards totaling million that will begin expiring in 2032. Due to the passing of the Tax Act, million of the federal net operating loss carryforwards will not expire but may be limited in future periods. If the Company were to experience an "ownership change" as determined under Section 382 of the Internal Revenue Code, the Company's ability to offset taxable income arising after the ownership change with net operating losses arising prior to the ownership change would be limited. As of December 31, 2022, no ownership change has occurred. 
 Since September 30, 2015, the Company has recorded a full valuation allowance against its federal and Oklahoma net deferred tax position. As such, the Company's effective tax rate is , due to the Texas franchise tax. The Company's effective tax rate is affected by changes in valuation allowances, recurring permanent differences and discrete items that may occur in any given year, but are not consistent from year to year. For the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020, the Company s items of discrete income tax expense or benefit were not material. 
 A valuation allowance is established to reduce deferred tax assets if it is determined that it is more likely than not that the related tax benefit will not be realized. On a quarterly basis, management evaluates the need for and adequacy of valuation allowances based on the expected realizability of the deferred tax assets and adjusts the amount of such allowances, if necessary. To the extent a valuation allowance is established or is increased or decreased during a period, there is a corresponding expense or reduction of expense within the tax provision in the consolidated statement of operations. 
 During the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, in evaluating whether it was more likely than not that the Company's net deferred tax assets were realizable through future net income, the Company considered all available positive and negative evidence, including projected future cash flows from its oil, NGL and natural gas reserves (including the timing of those cash flows), the reversal of deferred tax liabilities recorded as of December 31, 2022 and the Company's ability to capitalize intangible drilling costs, rather than expensing these costs and future projections of taxable income. Significant items of objective negative evidence considered were the cumulative historical three-year pre-tax loss and net deferred tax asset position. Such objective evidence limits the ability to consider other subjective evidence such as the Company s potential for future growth. Based on all the evidence available, the Company determined it was more likely than not that the net deferred tax assets were not realizable. 
 The Company files a single return. The Company's income tax returns for the years 2019 through 2022 remain open and subject to examination by federal tax authorities and/or the tax authorities in Oklahoma and Texas, which are the jurisdictions

 The Company typically sells production to a relatively limited number of customers, as is customary in the exploration, development and production business. The Company's sales of purchased oil are generally made to a few customers. The Company's joint operations accounts receivable are from a number of oil and natural gas companies, partnerships, individuals and others who own interests in the oil and natural gas properties operated by the Company. 
 The majority of the Company's accounts receivable are unsecured. On occasion the Company requires its customers to post collateral, and the inability or failure of the Company's significant customers to meet their obligations to the Company or their insolvency or liquidation may adversely affect the Company's financial results. In the current market environment, the Company believes that it could sell its production to numerous companies, so that the loss of any one of its major purchasers would not have a material adverse effect on its financial condition and results of operations solely by reason of such loss. Additionally, management believes that any credit risk imposed by a concentration in the oil and natural gas industry is offset by the creditworthiness of the Company's customer base and industry partners. The Company routinely assesses the recoverability of all material trade and other receivables to determine collectability. See Note 2 for additional information regarding the Company's accounts receivable and revenue recognition.

 Net proved oil, NGL and natural gas reserves 
 Ryder Scott Company, L.P. ("Ryder Scott"), the Company's independent reserve engineers, estimated of the Company's proved reserves as of December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020. In accordance with SEC regulations, the reserves as of December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020 were estimated using the Realized Prices, which reflect adjustments to the Benchmark Prices for quality, certain transportation fees, geographical differentials, marketing bonuses or deductions and other factors affecting the price received at the delivery point. See Note 6 for these Realized Prices. The Company's reserves are reported in streams: oil, NGL and natural gas. 
 The SEC has defined proved reserves as the estimated quantities of oil, NGL and natural gas that geological and engineering data demonstrate with reasonable certainty to be recoverable in future years from known reservoirs under existing economic and operating conditions. The process of estimating oil, NGL and natural gas reserves is complex, requiring significant decisions in the evaluation of available geological, geophysical, engineering and economic data. The data for a given property may also change substantially over time as a result of numerous factors, including additional development activity, evolving production history and a continual reassessment of the viability of production under changing economic conditions. As a result, material revisions to existing reserve estimates occur from time to time. Although every reasonable effort is made to ensure that reserve estimates reported represent the most accurate assessments possible, the subjective decisions and variances in available data for various properties increase the likelihood of significant changes in these estimates. If such changes are material, they could significantly affect future amortization of capitalized costs and result in impairment of assets that may be material.

 Standardized measure of discounted future net cash flows 
 The standardized measure of discounted future net cash flows does not purport to be, nor should it be interpreted to present, the fair value of the oil, NGL and natural gas reserves of the property. An estimate of fair value would take into account, among other things, the recovery of reserves not presently classified as proved, the value of proved properties and consideration of expected future economic and operating conditions. 
 The estimates of future cash flows and future production and development costs as of December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020 are based on the Realized Prices, which reflect adjustments to the Benchmark Prices for quality, certain transportation fees, geographical differentials, marketing bonuses or deductions and other factors affecting the price received at the delivery point. All Realized Prices are held flat over the forecast period for all reserve categories in calculating the discounted future net cash flows. Any effect from the Company's commodity hedges is excluded. In accordance with SEC regulations, the proved reserves were anticipated to be economically producible from the "as of date" forward based on existing economic conditions, including prices and costs at which economic producibility from a reservoir was determined. These costs, held flat over the forecast period, include development costs, operating costs, ad valorem and production taxes and abandonment costs after salvage. Future income tax expenses are computed using the appropriate year-end statutory tax rates applied to the future pretax net cash flows from proved oil, NGL and natural gas reserves, less the tax basis of the Company's oil and natural gas properties. The estimated future net cash flows are then discounted at a rate of . The Company's unamortized cost of evaluated oil and natural gas properties being depleted exceeded the full cost ceiling for each of the quarterly periods in 2020 and, as such, the Company recorded non-cash full cost ceiling impairments totaling million during the year ended December 31, 2020. full cost ceiling impairment was recorded for the years ended December 31, 2022 and December 31, 2021. See Note 6 for discussion of the Benchmark Prices, Realized Prices and the 2020 full cost ceiling impairment recorded.

 It is not intended that the FASB's standardized measure of discounted future net cash flows represent the fair market value of the Company's proved reserves. The Company cautions that the disclosures shown are based on estimates of proved reserve quantities and future production schedules which are inherently imprecise and subject to revision, and the discount rate is arbitrary. In addition, prices and costs as of the measurement date are used in the determinations, and no value may be assigned to probable or possible reserves.

 Estimates of economically recoverable oil, NGL and natural gas reserves and of future net cash flows are based upon a number of variable factors and assumptions, all of which are, to some degree, subjective and may vary considerably from actual results. Therefore, actual production, revenues, development and operating expenditures may not occur as estimated. The reserve data are estimates only, are subject to many uncertainties and are based on data gained from production histories and on assumptions as to geologic formations and other matters. Actual quantities of oil, NGL and natural gas may differ materially from the amounts estimated.

 Anti-Takeover Effects of Provisions of our Charter, Bylaws and Delaware Law 
 Some provisions of Delaware law, and our Charter and Bylaws described below, contain provisions that may be deemed to have an anti-takeover effect. Such provisions could make the following transactions more difficult (i) acquisition of us by means of a tender offer, a proxy contest or otherwise and (ii) removal of our incumbent officers and directors. These provisions may also have the effect of preventing changes in our management. It is possible that these provisions could delay, make it more difficult to accomplish or deter transactions that stockholders may otherwise consider to be in their best interest or in our best interests, including transactions that might result in a premium over the market price for shares of our Common Stock. 
 These provisions, summarized below, are expected to discourage coercive takeover practices and inadequate takeover bids. These provisions are also designed to encourage persons seeking to acquire control of us to first negotiate with us. We believe that the benefits of increased protection and our potential ability to negotiate with the proponent of an unfriendly or unsolicited proposal to acquire or restructure us outweigh the disadvantages of discouraging these proposals because, among other things, negotiation of these proposals could result in an improvement of their terms. 
 Advance Notice of Stockholder Proposals and Nominations 
 Our Bylaws provide for advance notice procedures with regard to stockholder nomination of candidates for election as directors or proposals of business to be brought before meetings of our stockholders. These procedures provide that notice of stockholder nominations or proposals must be timely given in writing to our corporate secretary prior to the meeting at which the action is to be taken. Generally, to be timely, notice must be received at our principal executive offices not less than 45 days nor more than 75 days prior to the first anniversary date of the date on which we first mailed our proxy materials for the annual meeting for the preceding year. Our Bylaws specify the requirements as to form and content of all stockholders notices. 
 Issuance of Preferred Stock 
 Our Charter authorizes the Board of Directors with the ability to establish the terms of undesignated Preferred Stock. This ability makes it possible for our Board of Directors to issue, without stockholder approval, Preferred Stock with voting or other rights or preferences that could impede the success of any attempt to change control of us. 
 Issuance of Rights 
 The Board of Directors is expressly authorized to cause the Company to issue, whether or not in connection with the issue and sale of any shares of Common Stock, rights to enter into any agreements necessary or convenient for such issuance, and to enter into other agreements necessary and convenient to the conduct of the business of the Company. 

Control of Board of Directors 
 Our Board of Directors is divided into three classes with each class serving staggered three year terms, and the authorized number of directors may be changed only by resolution of the Board of Directors without consent of the stockholders. Additionally, all vacancies, including newly created directorships, shall, except as otherwise required by law or by resolution of the Board of Directors and subject to the rights of the holders of any series of Preferred Stock, be filled by the affirmative vote of a majority of directors then in office, even if less than a quorum. Subject to the rights of the holders of any series of Preferred Stock, a director may only be removed from office for cause by the affirmative vote of the stockholders of at least 75 of our then outstanding Common Stock. 
 Meeting Requirement 
 Any action required or permitted to be taken by the stockholders must be effected at a duly called annual or special meeting of stockholders and may not be effected by any consent in writing in lieu of a meeting of such stockholders, subject to the rights of the holders of any series of Preferred Stock. 
 Supermajority Approval Requirements 
 Certain provisions of our Charter may be amended only with the affirmative vote of the stockholders of at least 75 of our then outstanding Common Stock. Our Bylaws may be amended by the affirmative vote of the stockholders of at least 75 of our then outstanding Common Stock or our Board of Directors.

 Section 203 of the DGCL 
 We are subject to the provisions of Section 203 of the DGCL, which regulates corporate takeovers. In general, those provisions prohibit a Delaware corporation, including those whose securities are listed for trading on the NYSE, from engaging in any business combination with any interested stockholder for a period of three years following the date that the stockholder became an interested stockholder, unless 

the business combination or transaction in which the person became interested is approved by the board of directors before the date the interested stockholder attained that status 
 upon consummation of the transaction that resulted in the stockholder becoming an interested stockholder, the interested stockholder owned at least 85 of the voting stock of the corporation outstanding at the time the transaction commenced other than, for purposes of determining the voting stock outstanding (but not the outstanding stock owned by the interested stockholder), shares owned by persons who are directors and also officers of us and by certain employee stock plans or 
 on or after such time the business combination is approved by the board of directors and authorized at a meeting of stockholders by an affirmative vote of at least two-thirds of the outstanding voting stock that is not owned by the interested stockholder. 
 In general, Section 203 defines a business combination to include the following 
 certain mergers or consolidations involving the corporation and the interested stockholder 
 any sale, transfer, pledge or other disposition of 10 or more of the assets of the corporation to or with the interested stockholder 
 subject to certain exceptions, any transaction that results in the issuance or transfer by the corporation of any stock of the corporation to the interested stockholder 
 subject to certain exceptions, any transaction involving the corporation that has the effect of increasing the proportionate share of the stock of any class or series of the corporation beneficially owned by the interested stockholder or 
 the receipt by the interested stockholder of the benefit of loans, advances, guarantees, pledges or other financial benefits provided by or through the corporation. 
 In general, Section 203 defines an interested stockholder as any entity or person beneficially owning 15 or more of the outstanding voting stock of the corporation and any entity or person affiliated with or controlling or controlled by any of these entities or persons. Affiliates of Warburg Pincus owned their equity in us at the time we completed our corporate reorganization in December 2011 in connection with our initial public offering, and, therefore, Warburg Pincus is not subject to the restrictions of Section 203.

If for any reason an Option intended to be an Incentive Stock Option (or any portion thereof) shall not qualify as an Incentive Stock Option, then, to the extent of such nonqualification, such Option or portion thereof shall be regarded as a Nonqualified Stock Option appropriately granted under the Plan.

Any fractional shares of Common Stock shall be settled in cash. The Committee may specify a reasonable minimum number of shares of Common Stock or a percentage of the shares subject to an Option that may be purchased on any exercise of an Option provided , that such minimum number will not prevent Optionee from exercising the full number of shares of Common Stock as to which the Option is then exercisable.

discretion, accelerate the exercisability of any SAR in the event of the Participant s death or Disability, which acceleration shall not affect the terms and conditions of such SAR other than with respect to exercisability. Unless otherwise provided by the Committee in an Award agreement (i) the unvested portion of a SAR shall expire upon termination of employment or service of the Participant granted the SAR, and the vested portion of such SAR shall remain exercisable for (A) one year following termination of employment or service by reason of such Participant s death or Disability, but not later than the expiration of the SAR Period or (B) ninety (90) days following termination of employment or service for any reason other than such Participant s death or Disability, and other than such Participant s termination of employment or service for Cause, but not later than the expiration of the SAR Period and (ii) both the unvested and the vested portion of a SAR shall expire upon the termination of the Participant s employment or service by the Company for Cause. SARs that vest based on a Participant s continued service shall not become vested or exercisable prior to the first anniversary following the Date of Grant other than in connection with the Participant s death, Disability or pursuant to Section 12 of the Plan.

Upon the exercise of a SAR, the Company shall pay to the Participant an amount equal to the number of shares subject to the SAR that are being exercised multiplied by the excess, if any, of the Fair Market Value of a share of Common Stock on the exercise date over the Strike Price, less an amount equal to any federal, state, local and non-U.S. income and employment taxes required to be withheld. The Company shall pay such amount in cash, in shares of Common Stock with a Fair Market Value equal to such amount, or any combination thereof, as determined by the Committee in an Award agreement.

Dividends, if any, that may have been withheld by the Company and attributable to any particular share of Restricted Stock shall be distributed to the Participant in cash or, at the sole discretion of the Committee, in shares of Common Stock having a Fair Market Value equal to the amount of such dividends, upon the release of restrictions on such share and, if such share is forfeited, the Participant shall have no right to such dividends (except as otherwise set forth by the Committee in the applicable Award agreement). 
 (ii) Unless otherwise provided by the Committee in an Award agreement, upon the expiration of the Restricted Period with respect to any outstanding Restricted Stock Units, the Company shall deliver to the Participant, or his beneficiary, without charge, one share of Common Stock for each such outstanding Restricted Stock Unit provided , however , that the Committee may, in its sole discretion, elect to (i) pay cash or part cash and part Common Stock in lieu of delivering only shares of Common Stock in respect of such Restricted Stock Units or (ii) defer the delivery of shares of Common Stock (or cash or part Common Stock and part cash, 
 14 

as the case may be) beyond the expiration of the Restricted Period if such delivery would result in a violation of applicable law until such time as is no longer the case.

 (iii) The terms of any Award transferred in accordance with the immediately preceding sentence shall apply to the Permitted Transferee, and any reference in the Plan, or in any applicable Award agreement, to a Participant shall be deemed to refer to the Permitted Transferee, except that (A) Permitted Transferees shall not be entitled to transfer any Award, other than by will or the laws of descent and distribution (B) Permitted Transferees shall not be entitled to exercise any transferred Option unless there shall be in effect a registration statement on an appropriate form covering the Common Stock to be acquired pursuant to the exercise of such Option if the Committee determines, consistent with any applicable Award agreement, that such a registration statement is necessary or appropriate (C) the Committee or the Company shall not be required to provide any notice to a Permitted Transferee, whether or not such notice is or would otherwise have been required to be given to the Participant under the Plan or otherwise and (D) the consequences of the termination of the Participant s employment by, or services to, the Company or an Affiliate under the terms of the Plan and the applicable Award agreement shall continue to be applied with respect to the Participant, including, without limitation, that an Option shall be exercisable by the Permitted Transferee only to the extent, and for the periods, specified in the Plan and the applicable Award agreement. 
 (c) Tax Withholding . 
 (i) A Participant shall be required to pay to the Company or any Affiliate, and the Company or any Affiliate shall have the right and is hereby authorized to withhold, from any cash, shares of Common Stock, other securities or other property deliverable under any Award or from any compensation or other amounts owing to a Participant, the amount (in cash, shares of Common Stock, other securities or other property) of any required withholding taxes in respect of an Award, its exercise, or any payment or transfer under an Award or under the Plan and to take such other action as may be necessary in the opinion of the Committee or the Company to satisfy all obligations for the payment of such withholding taxes. 
 (ii) Without limiting the generality of clause (i) above, the Committee may, in its sole discretion, permit a Participant to satisfy, in whole or in part, the foregoing withholding liability by (A) the delivery of shares of Common Stock (which are not subject to any pledge or other security interest and are held for the applicable period as determined by the 
 20 

Company s auditors to avoid adverse accounting charges) owned by the Participant having a fair market value equal to such withholding liability or (B) having the Company withhold from the number of shares of Common Stock otherwise issuable or deliverable pursuant to the exercise or settlement of the Award a number of shares with a fair market value equal to such withholding liability (but no more than the minimum required statutory withholding liability). 
 (d) No Claim to Awards No Rights to Continued Employment Waiver . No employee of the Company or an Affiliate, or other person, shall have any claim or right to be granted an Award under the Plan or, having been selected for the grant of an Award, to be selected for a grant of any other Award. There is no obligation for uniformity of treatment of Participants or holders or beneficiaries of Awards. The terms and conditions of Awards and the Committee s determinations and interpretations with respect thereto need not be the same with respect to each Participant and may be made selectively among Participants, whether or not such Participants are similarly situated. Neither the Plan nor any action taken hereunder shall be construed as giving any Participant any right to be retained in the employ or service of the Company or an Affiliate, nor shall it be construed as giving any Participant any rights to continued service on the Board. The Company or any of its Affiliates may at any time dismiss a Participant from employment or discontinue any consulting relationship, free from any liability or any claim under the Plan, unless otherwise expressly provided in the Plan or any Award agreement. By accepting an Award under the Plan, a Participant shall thereby be deemed to have waived any claim to continued exercise or vesting of an Award or to damages or severance entitlement related to non-continuation of the Award beyond the period provided under the Plan or any Award agreement, notwithstanding any provision to the contrary in any written employment contract or other agreement between the Company and its Affiliates and the Participant, whether any such agreement is executed before, on or after the Date of Grant. 
 (e) International Participants . With respect to Participants who reside or work outside of the United States of America, the Committee may in its sole discretion amend the terms of the Plan or outstanding Awards (or adopt a subplan) with respect to such Participants in order to conform such terms with the requirements of local law or to obtain more favorable tax or other treatment for a Participant, the Company or its Affiliates. 
 (f) Designation and Change of Beneficiary . Each Participant may file with the Committee a written designation of one or more persons as the beneficiary(ies) who shall be entitled to receive the amounts payable with respect to an Award, if any, due under the Plan upon his death. A Participant may, from time to time, revoke or change his beneficiary designation without the consent of any prior beneficiary by filing a new designation with the Committee. The last such designation received by the Committee shall be controlling provided , however , that no designation, or change or revocation thereof, shall be effective unless received by the Committee prior to the Participant s death, and in no event shall it be effective as of a date prior to such receipt. If no beneficiary designation is filed by a Participant, the beneficiary shall be deemed to be his or her spouse or, if the Participant is unmarried at the time of death, his or her estate. Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, to the extent that a Participant s beneficiary designation would result in a duplication of, or unintended, benefits payable under this Plan or would otherwise violate applicable law, the Committee shall have the authority to disregard such designation and payments shall be made in accordance with applicable law. 
 
 21 

(g) Termination of Employment Service . Unless determined otherwise by the Committee at any point following such event or as otherwise provided in an Award agreement, service shall not be considered terminated in the case of (i) any approved leave of absence, (ii) transfers among the Company, any Affiliate, or any successor, in any capacity of any employee, director or consultant, or (iii) any change in status as long as the individual remains in the service of the Company or an Affiliate in any capacity of employee, director or consultant. An approved leave of absence shall include sick leave, military leave, or any other authorized personal leave. For purposes of each Incentive Stock Option, if such leave exceeds three (3) months, and reemployment upon expiration of such leave is not guaranteed by statute or contract, then the Incentive Stock Option shall be treated as a Non-Qualified Stock Option on the day following the expiration of such three (3) month period. 
 (h) No Rights as a Stockholder . Except as otherwise specifically provided in the Plan or any Award agreement, no person shall be entitled to the privileges of ownership in respect of shares of Common Stock that are subject to Awards hereunder until such shares have been issued or delivered to that person. 
 (i) Government and Other Regulations . 
 (i) The obligation of the Company to settle Awards in shares of Common Stock or other consideration shall be subject to all applicable laws, rules, and regulations, and to such approvals by governmental agencies as may be required. Notwithstanding any terms or conditions of any Award to the contrary, the Company shall be under no obligation to offer to sell or to sell, and shall be prohibited from offering to sell or selling, any shares of Common Stock pursuant to an Award unless such shares have been properly registered for sale pursuant to the Securities Act with the Securities and Exchange Commission or unless the Company has received an opinion of counsel, satisfactory to the Company, that such shares may be offered or sold without such registration pursuant to an available exemption therefrom and the terms and conditions of such exemption have been fully complied with. The Company shall be under no obligation to register for sale under the Securities Act any of the shares of Common Stock to be offered or sold under the Plan. The Committee shall have the authority to provide that all certificates for shares of Common Stock or other securities of the Company or any Affiliate delivered under the Plan shall be subject to such stop transfer orders and other restrictions as the Committee may deem advisable under the Plan, the applicable Award agreement, the federal securities laws, or the rules, regulations and other requirements of the Securities and Exchange Commission, any securities exchange or inter-dealer quotation system upon which such shares or other securities are then listed or quoted and any other applicable federal, state, local or non-U.S. laws, and, without limiting the generality of Section 9 of the Plan, the Committee may cause a legend or legends to be put on any such certificates to make appropriate reference to such restrictions. Notwithstanding any provision in the Plan to the contrary, the Committee reserves the right to add any additional terms or provisions to any Award granted under the Plan that it in its sole discretion deems necessary or advisable in order that such Award complies with the legal requirements of any governmental entity to whose jurisdiction the Award is subject. 
 (ii) The Committee may cancel an Award or any portion thereof if it determines, in its sole discretion, that legal or contractual restrictions and or blockage and or other market considerations would make the Company s acquisition of shares of Common Stock from 
 22 

the public markets, the Company s issuance of shares of Common Stock to the Participant, the Participant s acquisition of shares of Common Stock from the Company and or the Participant s sale of shares of Common Stock to the public markets, illegal, impracticable or inadvisable. If the Committee determines to cancel all or any portion of an Award in accordance with the foregoing, the Company shall pay to the Participant an amount equal to the excess of (A) the aggregate Fair Market Value of the shares of Common Stock subject to such Award or portion thereof canceled (determined as of the applicable exercise date, or the date that the shares would have been vested or delivered, as applicable), over (B) the aggregate Exercise Price or Strike Price (in the case of an Option or SAR, respectively) or any amount payable as a condition of delivery of shares of Common Stock (in the case of any other Award). Such amount shall be delivered to the Participant as soon as practicable following the cancellation of such Award or portion thereof. 
 (iii) Notwithstanding any provision in this Plan or any Award agreement to the contrary, Awards granted hereunder shall be subject, to the extent applicable, (A) to any clawback policy adopted by the Company, and (B) to the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act, as amended, and rules, regulations and binding, published guidance thereunder, which legislation provides for the clawback and recovery of incentive compensation in the event of certain financial statement restatements. If, pursuant to Section 10D of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, the Company would not be eligible for continued listing, if applicable, under Section 10D(a) of the Exchange Act if it did not adopt policies consistent with Section 10D(b) of the Exchange Act, then, in accordance with those policies that are so required, any incentive-based compensation payable to a Participant under this Plan shall be subject to claw-back in the circumstances, to the extent, and in the manner, required by Section 10D(b)(2) of the Exchange Act, as interpreted by rules of the Securities Exchange Commission. 
 (j) Payments to Persons Other Than Participants . If the Committee shall find that any person to whom any amount is payable under the Plan is unable to care for his affairs because of illness or accident, or is a minor, or has died, then any payment due to such person or his estate (unless a prior claim therefor has been made by a duly appointed legal representative) may, if the Committee so directs the Company, be paid to his spouse, child, relative, an institution maintaining or having custody of such person, or any other person deemed by the Committee to be a proper recipient on behalf of such person otherwise entitled to payment. Any such payment shall be a complete discharge of the liability of the Committee and the Company therefor. 
 (k) Nonexclusivity of the Plan . Neither the adoption of this Plan by the Board nor the submission of this Plan to the shareholders of the Company for approval shall be construed as creating any limitations on the power of the Board to adopt such other incentive arrangements as it may deem desirable, including, without limitation, the granting of stock options or other equity-based awards otherwise than under this Plan, and such arrangements may be either applicable generally or only in specific cases. 
 (l) No Trust or Fund Created . Neither the Plan nor any Award shall create or be construed to create a trust or separate fund of any kind or a fiduciary relationship between the Company or any Affiliate, on the one hand, and a Participant or other person or entity, on the other hand. No provision of the Plan or any Award shall require the Company, for the purpose of satisfying any obligations under the Plan, to purchase assets or place any assets in a trust or other entity to which contributions are made or otherwise to segregate any assets, nor shall the Company 
 23 

maintain separate bank accounts, books, records or other evidence of the existence of a segregated or separately maintained or administered fund for such purposes. Participants shall have no rights under the Plan other than as unsecured general creditors of the Company, except that insofar as they may have become entitled to payment of additional compensation by performance of services, they shall have the same rights as other employees under general law. 
 (m) Reliance on Reports . Each member of the Committee and each member of the Board shall be fully justified in acting or failing to act, as the case may be, and shall not be liable for having so acted or failed to act in good faith, in reliance upon any report made by the independent public accountant of the Company and its Affiliates and or any other information furnished in connection with the Plan by any agent of the Company or the Committee or the Board, other than himself. 
 (n) Relationship to Other Benefits . No payment under the Plan shall be taken into account in determining any benefits under any pension, retirement, profit sharing, group insurance or other benefit plan of the Company except as otherwise specifically provided in such other plan. 
 (o) Governing Law . The Plan shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the internal laws of the State of Delaware, without giving effect to the conflict of laws provisions thereof. 
 (p) Severability . If any provision of the Plan or any Award or Award agreement is or becomes or is deemed to be invalid, illegal, or unenforceable in any jurisdiction or as to any person or entity or Award, or would disqualify the Plan or any Award under any law deemed applicable by the Committee, such provision shall be construed or deemed amended to conform to the applicable laws, or if it cannot be construed or deemed amended without, in the determination of the Committee, materially altering the intent of the Plan or the Award, such provision shall be construed or deemed stricken as to such jurisdiction, person or entity or Award and the remainder of the Plan and any such Award shall remain in full force and effect. 
 (q) Obligations Binding on Successors . The obligations of the Company under the Plan shall be binding upon any successor corporation or organization resulting from the merger, amalgamation, consolidation or other reorganization of the Company, or upon any successor corporation or organization succeeding to substantially all of the assets and business of the Company. 
 (r) Shareholder Approval . The Plan, as amended and restated herein, is effective as of May 20, 2021, subject to approval by the Company s shareholders. 
 (s) Expenses Gender Titles and Headings . The expenses of administering the Plan shall be borne by the Company and its Affiliates. Masculine pronouns and other words of masculine gender shall refer to both men and women. The titles and headings of the sections in the Plan are for convenience of reference only, and in the event of any conflict, the text of the Plan, rather than such titles or headings shall control. 
 (t) Other Agreements . Notwithstanding the above, the Committee may require, as a condition to the grant of and or the receipt of shares of Common Stock under an Award, that 
 24 

the Participant execute lock-up, shareholder or other agreements, as it may determine in its sole and absolute discretion. 
 (u) Payments. Participants shall be required to pay, to the extent required by applicable law, any amounts required to receive shares of Common Stock under any Award made under the Plan. 
 (v) Section 409A. The Plan and the Awards hereunder are intended to either comply with, or be exempt from, the requirements of Section 409A of the Code. To the extent that the Plan or any Award is not exempt from the requirements of Section 409A of the Code, the Plan and any such Award intended to comply with the requirements of Section 409A of the Code shall be limited, construed and interpreted in accordance with such intent. Notwithstanding the foregoing, in no event whatsoever shall the Company be liable for any additional tax, interest or penalty that may be imposed by Section 409A of the Code or any damages relating to any failure to comply with Section 409A of the Code. To the extent required under Section 409A of the Code, (i) the provisions of Treasury Regulations Section 1.409A-3(i)(2) will apply to an Award granted hereunder and (ii) any reference to a termination of employment or service (or any similar term) shall mean a separation from service as defined in Section 409A of the Code.

Exhibit A 
 Performance Goals 
 Performance Goals 
 The Performance Goals established by the Administrator are based on five criteria (i) relative total shareholder return comparing the Company s shareholder return to the shareholder return of the E&P companies listed in the Russell 2000 index identified below Relative TSR ), (ii) absolute total shareholder return Absolute Return ), (iii) earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, amortization and exploration expense (EBITDAX) and three-year total debt reduction (the EBITDAX Total Debt Component stated below), (iv) growth in inventory (the Inventory Growth Component stated below) and (v) emissions reductions (the ESG Component stated below). The Relative TSR and Absolute Return will be used to identify the PSU Matrix Component as stated below. The PSU Matrix Component, the EBITDAX Total Debt Component, the Inventory Growth Component and the ESG Component shall be used to compute the Performance Multiple. The Performance Multiple shall be used to determine the final amount of cash or number of shares, as applicable, delivered with respect to each Performance Share Unit settled at the Maturity Date. 
 In computing the Performance Multiple, each of the PSU Matrix Component, the EBITDAX Total Debt Component, the Inventory Growth Component and the ESG Component shall be weighted as follows 
 PSU Matrix 50 
 EBITDAX Total Debt 20 
 Inventory Growth 15 
 ESG 15 
 such that the Performance Multiple is calculated as follows 
 Performance Multiple (.5) PSU Matrix Component + (.20) EBITDAX Total Debt Component + (.15) Inventory Growth Component + (.15) ESG Component 
 By way of example, if the PSU Matrix Component is 100 , the EBITDAX Total Debt Component is 65 , the Inventory Growth Component is 0 and the ESG Component is 50 , then the Performance Multiple would be 0.5(1.0) + 0.20(0.65) + 0.15(0.0) + 0.15(.50) 0.705. With a Performance Multiple of 0.705, each Performance Share Unit would be settled for the cash or stock equivalent of 0.705 shares such that a holder of 600 Performance Share Units would receive either (i) a cash payment equal to the Fair Market Value of 423 shares of Common Stock or (ii) 423 shares of Common Stock. 
 Notwithstanding anything in this Exhibit A to the contrary, if in the Administrator s discretion there is a need to adjust the Performance Multiple to more accurately reflect the 
 A-1 

Company s performance than is calculated by using the criteria included on this Exhibit A due to the occurrence of extraordinary, nonrecurring and or significant corporate events (including but not limited to a transaction approved by the Board that results in an increase in the Company s EBITDAX Total Debt multiple), then the Administrator may make any such adjustments to the Performance Multiple as it deems advisable. 
 A-2 

PSU Matrix Component is calculated on the basis of the following matrix 
 Relative TSR (quartile) 1 st 
 2 nd 
 3 rd

 1-Year 8 75 50 25 0 Absolute 8 and 14 100 75 50 25 Return 14 and 20 200 100 75 50 20 250 200 100 75 
 
 Each individual year s results are interpolated between points calculated using the grid. The 3-year average will be used for the final PSU calculation (2023 result + 2024 result + 2025 result) 3, to be paid in total at the third anniversary of the Grant Date 
 The 1-Year Absolute Return is calculated as (last 20 trading days average stock price of December + Total Dividends prior December last 20 trading days average stock price) (prior December last 20 trading days average stock price) 100 
 The Relative TSR performance will be measured against the E&P companies listed in the Russell 2000 index. Relative TSR 1 (Vital Energy Rank 24) 100. Vital Energy Rank for each year is sorted from high to low against the peer group with the following calculation (last 20 trading days average stock price of December of each year + Total Dividends prior December last 20 trading days average stock price) prior December last 20 trading days average stock price 100 
 Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Administrator may adjust the Relative TSR calculation to reflect changes in the membership of the E&P companies listed in the Russell 2000 index, as it deems reasonable in the exercise of its discretion.

 Inventory Growth Component is calculated on the basis of the following 
 
 165 wells to be drilled over the next three years 
 Goal is to build out additional inventory and or production additions to sustain Vital Energy s long-term goals and create opportunity for future growth. Compensation Committee to have discretion to award value for production additions that are not wells added. 
 Additional wells added over January 1, 2023 initial count 
 Threshold 165 
 Target 275 
 Stretch 385 
 Definition of a well 
 Well count will be the cumulative aggregation of the short term incentive plan STIP count. If there is a technical reason to remove a well during the performance period, the total well count can be adjusted downward. 
 If for any reason the STIP inventory goal is eliminated during the three-year performance period, the definition for adding wells will be determined by the Compensation Committee and will be materially similar to the 2023 STIP definition. 
 
 Inventory Growth Payout Percentage 165 50 275 100 385 200 

A-5 

ESG Component is calculated on the basis of the following 

Emissions reduction targets are for current assets and will be adjusted as needed for future acquisitions if they negatively impact the calculation due to the acquitted company s lower environmental standards. 
 The emission result will be the number reported in the Company s 2025 ESG report, which covers 2024 operations

Ladies and Gentlemen 
 
 At your request, Ryder Scott Company, L.P. (Ryder Scott) has prepared an estimate of the proved reserves, future production, and income attributable to certain leasehold and royalty interests of Vital Energy, Inc. (Vital Energy) as of December 31, 2022. The subject properties are located in the state of Texas. The reserves and income data were estimated based on the definitions and disclosure guidelines of the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) contained in Title 17, Code of Federal Regulations, Modernization of Oil and Gas Reporting, Final Rule released January 14, 2009 in the Federal Register (SEC regulations). Our third party study, completed on January 13, 2023 and presented herein, was prepared for public disclosure by Vital Energy in filings made with the SEC in accordance with the disclosure requirements set forth in the SEC regulations. 
 
 The properties evaluated by Ryder Scott represent 100 percent of the total net proved liquid hydrocarbon reserves and 100 percent of the total net proved gas reserves of Vital Energy as of December 31, 2022. 
 
 The estimated reserves and future net income amounts presented in this report, as of December 31, 2022 are related to hydrocarbon prices. The hydrocarbon prices used in the preparation of this report are based on the average prices during the 12-month period prior to the as of date of this report, determined as the unweighted arithmetic averages of the prices in effect on the first-day-of-the-month for each month within such period, unless prices were defined by contractual arrangements, as required by the SEC regulations. Actual future prices may vary considerably from the prices required by SEC regulations. The reserves volumes and the income attributable thereto have a direct relationship to the hydrocarbon prices actually received therefore, volumes of reserves actually recovered and the amounts of income actually received may differ significantly from the estimated quantities presented in this report. The results of this study are summarized as follows.

Liquid hydrocarbons are expressed in standard 42 U.S. gallon barrels and shown herein as thousands of barrels (Mbbl). All gas volumes are reported on an as sold basis expressed in millions of cubic feet (MMcf) at the official temperature and pressure bases of the areas in which the gas reserves are located. The net reserves are also shown herein on an equivalent unit basis wherein natural gas is converted to oil equivalent using a factor of 6,000 cubic feet of natural gas per one barrel of oil equivalent. MBOE means thousand barrels of oil equivalent. In this report, the revenues, deductions, and income data are expressed as thousands of U.S. dollars M). 
 
 The estimates of the reserves, future production, and income attributable to properties in this report were prepared using the economic software package ARIES TM Petroleum Economics and Reserves Software, a copyrighted program of Halliburton. The program was used at the request of Vital Energy. Ryder Scott has found this program to be generally acceptable, but notes that certain summaries and calculations may vary due to rounding and may not exactly match the sum of the properties being summarized. Furthermore, one line economic summaries may vary slightly from the more detailed cash flow projections of the same properties, also due to rounding. The rounding differences are not material. 
 
 The future gross revenue is after the deduction of production taxes. The deductions incorporate the normal direct costs of operating the wells, ad valorem taxes, recompletion costs, development costs, and certain abandonment costs net of salvage. Other costs include variable costs associated with transportation and processing fees. The future net income is before the deduction of state and federal income taxes and general administrative overhead, and has not been adjusted for outstanding loans that may exist nor does it include any adjustment for cash on hand or undistributed income. 
 
 Liquid hydrocarbon reserves account for approximately 86 percent and gas reserves account for the remaining 14 percent of total future gross revenue from proved reserves. 
 
 The discounted future net income shown above was calculated using a discount rate of 10 percent per annum compounded monthly. Future net income was discounted at four other discount rates which were also compounded monthly. These results are shown in summary form as follows.

Reserves Included in This Report 
 
 The proved reserves included herein conform to the definition as set forth in the Securities and Exchange Commission s Regulations Part 210.4-10(a). An abridged version of the SEC reserves definitions from 210.4-10(a) entitled PETROLEUM RESERVES DEFINITIONS is included as an attachment to this report. 
 
 The various reserves status categories are defined in the attachment entitled PETROLEUM RESERVES STATUS DEFINITIONS AND GUIDELINES in this report. 
 
 No attempt was made to quantify or otherwise account for any accumulated gas production imbalances that may exist. The proved gas volumes presented herein do not include volumes of gas consumed in operations as reserves. 
 
 Reserves are estimated remaining quantities of oil and gas and related substances anticipated to be economically producible, as of a given date, by application of development projects to known accumulations. All reserves estimates involve an assessment of the uncertainty relating the likelihood that the actual remaining quantities recovered will be greater or less than the estimated quantities determined as of the date the estimate is made. The uncertainty depends primarily on the amount of reliable geologic and engineering data available at the time of the estimate and the interpretation of these data. The relative degree of uncertainty may be conveyed by placing reserves into one of two principal categories, either proved or unproved. Unproved reserves are less certain to be recovered than proved reserves and may be further sub-categorized as probable and possible reserves to denote progressively increasing uncertainty in their recoverability. At Vital Energy s request, this report addresses only the proved reserves attributable to the properties evaluated herein. 
 
 Proved oil and gas reserves are those quantities of oil and gas which, by analysis of geoscience and engineering data, can be estimated with reasonable certainty to be economically producible from a given date forward. The proved reserves included herein were estimated using deterministic methods. The SEC has defined reasonable certainty for proved reserves, when based on deterministic methods, as a high degree of confidence that the quantities will be recovered. 
 
 Proved reserves estimates will generally be revised only as additional geologic or engineering data become available or as economic conditions change. For proved reserves, the SEC states that as changes due to increased availability of geoscience (geological, geophysical, and geochemical), engineering, and economic data are made to the estimated ultimate recovery (EUR) with time, reasonably certain EUR is much more likely to increase or remain constant than to decrease. Moreover, estimates 
 RYDER SCOTT COMPANY PETROLEUM CONSULTANTS 

Vital Energy, Inc. 
 January 16, 2023 
 Page 4 

of proved reserves may be revised as a result of future operations, effects of regulation by governmental agencies or geopolitical or economic risks. Therefore, the proved reserves included in this report are estimates only and should not be construed as being exact quantities, and if recovered, the revenues therefrom, and the actual costs related thereto, could be more or less than the estimated amounts. 
 
 Vital Energy s operations may be subject to various levels of governmental controls and regulations. These controls and regulations may include, but may not be limited to, matters relating to land tenure and leasing , the legal rights to produce hydrocarbons, drilling and production practices, environmental protection, marketing and pricing policies, royalties, various taxes and levies including income tax and are subject to change from time to time. Such changes in governmental regulations and policies may cause volumes of proved reserves actually recovered and amounts of proved income actually received to differ significantly from the estimated quantities. 
 
 The estimates of proved reserves presented herein were based upon a detailed study of the properties in which Vital Energy owns an interest however, we have not made any field examination of the properties. No consideration was given in this report to potential environmental liabilities that may exist nor were any costs included for potential liabilities to restore and clean up damages, if any, caused by past operating practices. 

Estimates of Reserves 
 
 The estimation of reserves involves two distinct determinations. The first determination results in the estimation of the quantities of recoverable oil and gas and the second determination results in the estimation of the uncertainty associated with those estimated quantities in accordance with the definitions set forth by the Securities and Exchange Commission s Regulations Part 210.4-10(a). The process of estimating the quantities of recoverable oil and gas reserves relies on the use of certain generally accepted analytical procedures. These analytical procedures fall into three broad categories or methods (1) performance-based methods, (2) volumetric-based methods and (3) analogy. These methods may be used individually or in combination by the reserves evaluator in the process of estimating the quantities of reserves. Reserves evaluators must select the method or combination of methods which in their professional judgment is most appropriate given the nature and amount of reliable geoscience and engineering data available at the time of the estimate, the established or anticipated performance characteristics of the reservoir being evaluated, and the stage of development or producing maturity of the property. 
 
 In many cases, the analysis of the available geoscience and engineering data and the subsequent interpretation of this data may indicate a range of possible outcomes in an estimate, irrespective of the method selected by the evaluator. When a range in the quantity of reserves is identified, the evaluator must determine the uncertainty associated with the incremental quantities of the reserves. If the reserves quantities are estimated using the deterministic incremental approach, the uncertainty for each discrete incremental quantity of the reserves is addressed by the reserves category assigned by the evaluator. Therefore, it is the categorization of reserves quantities as proved, probable and or possible that addresses the inherent uncertainty in the estimated quantities reported. For proved reserves, uncertainty is defined by the SEC as reasonable certainty wherein the quantities actually recovered are much more likely to be achieved than not. The SEC states that probable reserves are those additional reserves that are less certain to be recovered than proved reserves but which, together with proved reserves, are as likely as not to be recovered. The SEC states that possible reserves are those additional reserves that are less certain to be recovered than probable reserves and the total quantities ultimately recovered from a project have a low probability of exceeding proved plus probable plus possible reserves. All quantities of reserves within the same reserves category must meet the SEC definitions as noted above.

Estimates of reserves quantities and their associated reserves categories may be revised in the future as additional geoscience or engineering data become available. Furthermore, estimates of reserves quantities and their associated reserves categories may also be revised due to other factors such as changes in economic conditions, results of future operations, effects of regulation by governmental agencies or geopolitical or economic risks as previously noted herein. 
 
 The reserves for the properties included herein were estimated by performance methods, analogy, or a combination of methods. In general, the reserves attributable to producing wells and or reservoirs were estimated by performance methods or a combination of methods. These performance methods include, but may not be limited to, decline curve analysis, which utilized extrapolations of historical production and pressure data available through December 2022 in those cases where such data were considered to be definitive. The data used in these analyses were furnished to Ryder Scott by Vital Energy or obtained from public data sources and were considered sufficient for the purpose thereof. In certain cases, producing reserves were estimated by analogy. This method was used where there were inadequate historical performance data to establish a definitive trend and where the use of production performance data as a basis for the estimates was considered to be inappropriate. 
 
 The reserves for the properties included herein attributable to the undeveloped status category were estimated by analogy. The data utilized from the analogues were considered sufficient for the purpose thereof. 
 
 To estimate economically producible proved oil and gas reserves and related future net cash flows, we consider many factors and assumptions including, but not limited to, the use of reservoir parameters derived from geological, geophysical and engineering data which cannot be measured directly, economic criteria based on current costs and SEC pricing requirements, and forecasts of future production rates. Under the SEC regulations 210.4-10(a)(22)(v) and (26), proved reserves must be anticipated to be economically producible from a given date forward based on existing economic conditions including the prices and costs at which economic producibility from a reservoir is to be determined. While it may reasonably be anticipated that the future prices received for the sale of production and the operating costs and other costs relating to such production may increase or decrease from those under existing economic conditions, such changes were, in accordance with rules adopted by the SEC, omitted from consideration in making this evaluation. 
 
 Vital Energy has informed us that they have furnished us all of the material accounts, records, geological and engineering data, and reports and other data required for this investigation. In preparing our forecast of future proved production and income, we have relied upon data furnished by Vital Energy with respect to property interests owned, production and well tests from examined wells, normal direct costs of operating the wells or leases, other costs such as transportation and or processing fees, ad valorem and production taxes, workover and development costs, development plans, abandonment costs after salvage, product prices based on the SEC regulations, adjustments or differentials to product prices, geological structural and isochore maps, well logs, core analyses, and pressure measurements. Ryder Scott reviewed such factual data for its reasonableness however, we have not conducted an independent verification of the data furnished by Vital Energy. We consider the factual data used in this report appropriate and sufficient for the purpose of preparing the estimates of reserves and future net revenues herein. 
 
 In summary, we consider the assumptions, data, methods and analytical procedures used in this report appropriate for the purpose hereof, and we have used all such methods and procedures that we consider necessary and appropriate to prepare the estimates of reserves herein. The proved reserves included herein were determined in conformance with the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) Modernization of Oil and Gas Reporting Final Rule, including all references to 
 RYDER SCOTT COMPANY PETROLEUM CONSULTANTS 

Vital Energy, Inc. 
 January 16, 2023 
 Page 6 

Regulation S-X and Regulation S-K, referred to herein collectively as the SEC Regulations. In our opinion, the proved reserves presented in this report comply with the definitions, guidelines and disclosure requirements as required by the SEC regulations. 

Future Production Rates 
 
 For wells currently on production, our forecasts of future production rates are based on historical performance data. If no production decline trend has been established, future production rates were held constant until a decline in ability to produce was anticipated. An estimated rate of decline was then applied until depletion of the reserves. If a decline trend has been established, this trend was used as the basis for estimating future production rates. 
 
 Test data and other related information were used to estimate the anticipated initial production rates for those wells or locations that are not currently producing. For reserves not yet on production, sales were estimated to commence at an anticipated date furnished by Vital Energy. Wells or locations that are not currently producing may start producing earlier or later than anticipated in our estimates due to unforeseen factors causing a change in the timing to initiate production. Such factors may include delays due to weather, the availability of rigs, the sequence of drilling, completing and or recompleting wells and or constraints set by regulatory bodies. 
 
 The future production rates from wells currently on production or wells or locations that are not currently producing may be more or less than estimated because of changes including, but not limited to, reservoir performance, operating conditions related to surface facilities, compression and artificial lift, pipeline capacity and or operating conditions, producing market demand and or allowables or other constraints set by regulatory bodies. 

Hydrocarbon Prices 
 
 The hydrocarbon prices used herein are based on SEC price parameters using the average prices during the 12-month period prior to the as of date of this report, determined as the unweighted arithmetic averages of the prices in effect on the first-day-of-the-month for each month within such period, unless prices were defined by contractual arrangements. For hydrocarbon products sold under contract, the contract prices, including fixed and determinable escalations, exclusive of inflation adjustments, were used until expiration of the contract. Upon contract expiration, the prices were adjusted to the 12-month unweighted arithmetic average as previously described. 
 
 Vital Energy furnished us with the above mentioned average benchmark prices in effect on December 31, 2022. These initial SEC hydrocarbon prices were determined using the 12-month average first-day-of-the-month benchmark prices appropriate to the geographic area where the hydrocarbons are sold. These benchmark prices are prior to the adjustments for differentials as described herein. The table below summarizes the benchmark prices and price reference used for the geographic area included in the report. In certain geographic areas, the price reference and benchmark prices may be defined by contractual arrangements. 
 
 The product prices that were actually used to determine the future gross revenue for each property reflect adjustments to the benchmark prices for gravity, quality, local conditions, and or distance from market, referred to herein as differentials. The differentials used in the preparation of this report were furnished to us by Vital Energy.

Costs 
 
 Operating costs for the leases and wells in this report were furnished by Vital Energy and are based on the operating expense reports of Vital Energy and include only those costs directly applicable to the leases or wells. The operating costs include a portion of general and administrative costs allocated directly to the leases and wells. For operated properties, the operating costs include an appropriate level of corporate general administrative and overhead costs. The operating costs for non-operated properties include the COPAS overhead costs that are allocated directly to the leases and wells under terms of operating agreements. The operating costs furnished by Vital Energy were reviewed by us for their reasonableness using information furnished by Vital Energy for this purpose. No deduction was made for loan repayments, interest expenses, or exploration and development prepayments that were not charged directly to the leases or wells. 
 
 Development costs were furnished to us by Vital Energy and are based on authorizations for expenditure for the proposed work or actual costs for similar projects. The development costs furnished by Vital Energy were reviewed by us for their reasonableness using information furnished by Vital Energy for this purpose. The estimated net cost of abandonment after salvage was included for properties where abandonment costs net of salvage were material. The estimates of the net abandonment costs furnished by Vital Energy were accepted without independent verification. 
 
 Current costs used by Vital Energy were held constant throughout the life of the properties. 
 
 The proved undeveloped reserves in this report have been incorporated herein in accordance with Vital Energy s plans to develop these reserves as of December 31, 2022. The implementation of Vital Energy s development plans as presented to us and incorporated herein is subject to the approval process adopted by Vital Energy s management. As the result of our inquiries during the course of preparing this report, Vital Energy has informed us that the development activities included herein have been subjected to and received the internal approvals required by Vital Energy s management at the appropriate local, regional and or corporate level.

PETROLEUM RESERVES DEFINITIONS 
 
 As Adapted From 
 RULE 4-10(a) of REGULATION S-X PART 210 
 UNITED STATES SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION (SEC) 

PREAMBLE 
 
 On January 14, 2009, the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) published the Modernization of Oil and Gas Reporting Final Rule in the Federal Register of National Archives and Records Administration (NARA). The Modernization of Oil and Gas Reporting Final Rule includes revisions and additions to the definition section in Rule 4-10 of Regulation S-X, revisions and additions to the oil and gas reporting requirements in Regulation S-K, and amends and codifies Industry Guide 2 in Regulation S-K. The Modernization of Oil and Gas Reporting Final Rule , including all references to Regulation S-X and Regulation S-K, shall be referred to herein collectively as the SEC regulations . The SEC regulations take effect for all filings made with the United States Securities and Exchange Commission as of December 31, 2009, or after January 1, 2010. Reference should be made to the full text under Title 17, Code of Federal Regulations, Regulation S-X Part 210, Rule 4-10(a) for the complete definitions (direct passages excerpted in part or wholly from the aforementioned SEC document are denoted in italics herein). 
 
 Reserves are estimated remaining quantities of oil and gas and related substances anticipated to be economically producible, as of a given date, by application of development projects to known accumulations. All reserve estimates involve an assessment of the uncertainty relating the likelihood that the actual remaining quantities recovered will be greater or less than the estimated quantities determined as of the date the estimate is made. The uncertainty depends primarily on the amount of reliable geologic and engineering data available at the time of the estimate and the interpretation of these data. The relative degree of uncertainty may be conveyed by placing reserves into one of two principal categories, either proved or unproved. Unproved reserves are less certain to be recovered than proved reserves and may be further sub-categorized as probable and possible reserves to denote progressively increasing uncertainty in their recoverability. Under the SEC regulations as of December 31, 2009, or after January 1, 2010, a company may optionally disclose estimated quantities of probable or possible oil and gas reserves in documents publicly filed with the SEC. The SEC regulations continue to prohibit disclosure of estimates of oil and gas resources other than reserves and any estimated values of such resources in any document publicly filed with the SEC unless such information is required to be disclosed in the document by foreign or state law as noted in 229.1202 Instruction to Item 1202. 
 
 Reserves estimates will generally be revised only as additional geologic or engineering data become available or as economic conditions change. 
 
 Reserves may be attributed to either natural energy or improved recovery methods. Improved recovery methods include all methods for supplementing natural energy or altering natural forces in the reservoir to increase ultimate recovery. Examples of such methods are pressure maintenance, natural gas cycling, waterflooding, thermal methods, chemical flooding, and the use of miscible and immiscible displacement fluids. Other improved recovery methods may be developed in the future as petroleum technology continues to evolve. 
 
 Reserves may be attributed to either conventional or unconventional petroleum accumulations. Petroleum accumulations are considered as either conventional or unconventional based on the nature of their in-place characteristics, extraction method applied, or degree of processing prior to sale. Examples of unconventional petroleum accumulations include coalbed or coalseam methane (CBM CSM), basin-centered gas, shale gas, gas hydrates, natural bitumen and oil shale deposits. These

unconventional accumulations may require specialized extraction technology and or significant processing prior to sale. 
 
 Reserves do not include quantities of petroleum being held in inventory. 
 
 Because of the differences in uncertainty, caution should be exercised when aggregating quantities of petroleum from different reserves categories. 

RESERVES (SEC DEFINITIONS) 
 
 Securities and Exchange Commission Regulation S-X 210.4-10(a)(26) defines reserves as follows 
 
 Reserves. Reserves are estimated remaining quantities of oil and gas and related substances anticipated to be economically producible, as of a given date, by application of development projects to known accumulations. In addition, there must exist, or there must be a reasonable expectation that there will exist, the legal right to produce or a revenue interest in the production, installed means of delivering oil and gas or related substances to market, and all permits and financing required to implement the project. 
 
 Note to paragraph (a)(26) Reserves should not be assigned to adjacent reservoirs isolated by major, potentially sealing, faults until those reservoirs are penetrated and evaluated as economically producible. Reserves should not be assigned to areas that are clearly separated from a known accumulation by a non-productive reservoir i.e. , absence of reservoir, structurally low reservoir, or negative test results). Such areas may contain prospective resources i.e. , potentially recoverable resources from undiscovered accumulations). 

PROVED RESERVES (SEC DEFINITIONS) 
 
 Securities and Exchange Commission Regulation S-X 210.4-10(a)(22) defines proved oil and gas reserves as follows 
 
 Proved oil and gas reserves. Proved oil and gas reserves are those quantities of oil and gas, which, by analysis of geoscience and engineering data, can be estimated with reasonable certainty to be economically producible from a given date forward, from known reservoirs, and under existing economic conditions, operating methods, and government regulations prior to the time at which contracts providing the right to operate expire, unless evidence indicates that renewal is reasonably certain, regardless of whether deterministic or probabilistic methods are used for the estimation. The project to extract the hydrocarbons must have commenced or the operator must be reasonably certain that it will commence the project within a reasonable time. 
 
 (i) The area of the reservoir considered as proved includes 
 
 (A) The area identified by drilling and limited by fluid contacts, if any, and 
 
 (B) Adjacent undrilled portions of the reservoir that can, with reasonable certainty, be judged to be continuous with it and to contain economically producible oil or gas on the basis of available geoscience and engineering data. 
 
 (ii) In the absence of data on fluid contacts, proved quantities in a reservoir are limited by the lowest known hydrocarbons (LKH) as seen in a well penetration unless geoscience, engineering,

PETROLEUM RESERVES DEFINITIONS 
 Page 3 

or performance data and reliable technology establishes a lower contact with reasonable certainty. 
 
 (iii) Where direct observation from well penetrations has defined a highest known oil (HKO) elevation and the potential exists for an associated gas cap, proved oil reserves may be assigned in the structurally higher portions of the reservoir only if geoscience, engineering, or performance data and reliable technology establish the higher contact with reasonable certainty. 
 
 (iv) Reserves which can be produced economically through application of improved recovery techniques (including, but not limited to, fluid injection) are included in the proved classification when 
 (A) Successful testing by a pilot project in an area of the reservoir with properties no more favorable than in the reservoir as a whole, the operation of an installed program in the reservoir or an analogous reservoir, or other evidence using reliable technology establishes the reasonable certainty of the engineering analysis on which the project or program was based and 
 
 (B) The project has been approved for development by all necessary parties and entities, including governmental entities. 
 
 (v) Existing economic conditions include prices and costs at which economic producibility from a reservoir is to be determined. The price shall be the average price during the 12-month period prior to the ending date of the period covered by the report, determined as an unweighted arithmetic average of the first-day-of-the-month price for each month within such period, unless prices are defined by contractual arrangements, excluding escalations based upon future conditions.

Reserves status categories define the development and producing status of wells and reservoirs. Reference should be made to Title 17, Code of Federal Regulations, Regulation S-X Part 210, Rule 4-10(a) and the SPE-PRMS as the following reserves status definitions are based on excerpts from the original documents (direct passages excerpted from the aforementioned SEC and SPE-PRMS documents are denoted in italics herein). 

DEVELOPED RESERVES (SEC DEFINITIONS) 
 
 Securities and Exchange Commission Regulation S-X 210.4-10(a)(6) defines developed oil and gas reserves as follows 
 
 Developed oil and gas reserves are reserves of any category that can be expected to be recovered 
 
 (i) Through existing wells with existing equipment and operating methods or in which the cost of the required equipment is relatively minor compared to the cost of a new well and 
 
 (ii) Through installed extraction equipment and infrastructure operational at the time of the reserves estimate if the extraction is by means not involving a well. 
 
 Developed Producing (SPE-PRMS Definitions) 
 
 While not a requirement for disclosure under the SEC regulations, developed oil and gas reserves may be further sub-classified according to the guidance contained in the SPE-PRMS as Producing or Non-Producing. 
 
 Developed Producing Reserves 
 Developed Producing Reserves are expected quantities to be recovered from completion intervals that are open and producing at the effective date of the estimate.

PETROLEUM RESERVES STATUS DEFINITIONS AND GUIDELINES 
 Page 2 

Improved recovery reserves are considered producing only after the improved recovery project is in operation. 
 
 Developed Non-Producing 
 Developed Non-Producing Reserves include shut-in and behind-pipe Reserves. 
 
 Shut-In 
 Shut-in Reserves are expected to be recovered from 
 (1) completion intervals that are open at the time of the estimate but which have not yet started producing 
 (2) wells which were shut-in for market conditions or pipeline connections or 
 (3) wells not capable of production for mechanical reasons. 
 
 Behind-Pipe 
 Behind-pipe Reserves are expected to be recovered from zones in existing wells that will require additional completion work or future re-completion before start of production with minor cost to access these reserves. 
 
 In all cases, production can be initiated or restored with relatively low expenditure compared to the cost of drilling a new well. 

UNDEVELOPED RESERVES (SEC DEFINITIONS) 
 
 Securities and Exchange Commission Regulation S-X 210.4-10(a)(31) defines undeveloped oil and gas reserves as follows 
 
 Undeveloped oil and gas reserves are reserves of any category that are expected to be recovered from new wells on undrilled acreage, or from existing wells where a relatively major expenditure is required for recompletion. 
 
 (i) Reserves on undrilled acreage shall be limited to those directly offsetting development spacing areas that are reasonably certain of production when drilled, unless evidence using reliable technology exists that establishes reasonable certainty of economic producibility at greater distances. 
 
 (ii) Undrilled locations can be classified as having undeveloped reserves only if a development plan has been adopted indicating that they are scheduled to be drilled within five years, unless the specific circumstances, justify a longer time. 
 
 (iii) Under no circumstances shall estimates for undeveloped reserves be attributable to any acreage for which an application of fluid injection or other improved recovery technique is contemplated, unless such techniques have been proved effective by actual projects in the same reservoir or an analogous reservoir, as defined in paragraph (a)(2) of this section, or by other evidence using reliable technology establishing reasonable certainty.
