 PART I 
 
 Item 1. Business. 
 General 
 Isabella Bank Corporation is a registered financial services holding company that was incorporated in September 1988 under Michigan law. The Corporation's wholly owned subsidiary, Isabella Bank, has 29 banking offices located throughout Clare, Gratiot, Isabella, Mecosta, Midland, Montcalm, and Saginaw counties. The area includes significant agricultural production, manufacturing, retail, gaming and tourism, and several colleges and universities. 
 As used in Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations as well as in Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, references to the Corporation , Isabella , we , our , us , and similar terms refer to the consolidated entity consisting of Isabella Bank Corporation and its subsidiary. References to Isabella Bank or the Bank refers to Isabella Bank Corporation s subsidiary, Isabella Bank. 
 We are a community bank with a focus on providing high quality, personalized service at a fair price. We offer a broad array of banking and wealth management services to businesses, institutions, individuals and their families. We compete with other commercial banks, savings and loan associations, mortgage brokers, finance companies, credit unions, retail brokerage firms, and other companies providing financial services. 
 Lending activities include loans for commercial and agricultural operations and real estate purposes, residential real estate loans, and consumer loans. We limit lending activities primarily to local markets and purchased loans from the secondary market are minimal. We do not make loans to fund leveraged buyouts, have no foreign corporate or government loans, and have limited holdings of corporate debt securities. Our general lending philosophy is to limit concentrations to individuals and business segments. For additional information related to our lending strategies and policies, see Note 4 Loans and ALLL of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data. 
 Deposit services offered include checking accounts, savings accounts, certificates of deposit, direct deposits, cash management services, mobile and internet banking, electronic bill pay services, and automated teller machines. We also offer full service investment management, trust and estate services.

 Available Information 
 Our SEC filings (including our Annual Report on Form 10-K, Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q, Definitive Proxy Statements, Current Reports on Form 8-K and amendments to those reports) are available through our website (www.isabellabank.com). We will provide paper copies of our SEC reports free of charge upon request by a shareholder. 
 The SEC maintains a website (www.sec.gov) that contains reports, proxy and information statements and other information regarding Isabella Bank Corporation (CIK #0000842517) and other issuers. 
 Supervision and Regulation 
 The earnings and growth of the banking industry are affected by the credit policies of monetary authorities, including the FRB. An important function of the FRB is to regulate the national supply of bank credit in order to combat recessions and respond to inflationary pressures. Among the instruments of monetary policy used by the FRB to implement these objectives are open market operations in U.S. Treasury and U.S. Government Agency securities, changes in the discount rate on member bank borrowings, and changes in reserve requirements against member bank deposits. These methods are used in varying combinations to influence overall growth of bank loans, investments and deposits and also affect interest rates charged on loans or paid for deposits. The monetary policies of the FRB have had a significant effect on the operating results of commercial banks and related financial service providers in the past and are expected to continue to do so in the future. The effect of such policies upon our future business and earnings cannot be predicted. 
 We, as a financial holding company, are regulated under the BHC Act, and are subject to the supervision of the FRB. We are registered as a financial services holding company with the FRB and are subject to reporting requirements and inspections and audits. Under FRB policy, we are expected to act as a source of financial strength to the Bank and to commit resources to support its subsidiaries. This support may be required at times when, in the absence of such FRB policy, it would not otherwise be required to provide support.

 Under Michigan law, if the capital of a Michigan state chartered bank has become impaired by losses or otherwise, the Commissioner of the DIFS may require that the deficiency in capital be met by assessment upon the bank s shareholders. Each shareholder would be responsible for a pro rata share of the deficiency, based on the amount of capital stock held by each shareholder. If an assessment is not paid by any shareholder within 30 days of the date of notice to the shareholder, sale of their stock will occur in order to pay such assessment. 
 Any capital loans by a bank holding company to any of its subsidiary banks are subordinate in right of payment to deposits and to certain other indebtedness of such subsidiary bank. In the event of a bank holding company s bankruptcy, any commitment by the bank holding company to a federal bank regulatory agency to maintain the capital of a subsidiary bank will be assumed by the bankruptcy trustee and entitled to a priority of payment. This priority would apply to guarantees of capital plans under the FDIC Improvement Act of 1991. 
 SOX contains important requirements for public companies in the area of financial disclosure and corporate governance. In accordance with Section 302(a) of SOX, written certifications by our principal executive, financial, and accounting officers are required. These certifications attest that our quarterly and annual reports filed with the SEC do not contain any untrue statement of a material fact (see the certifications filed as Exhibits 31.1 and 31.2 to this Form 10-K for such certification of consolidated financial statements and other information for this 2022 Form 10-K). We have also implemented a program designed to comply with Section 404 of SOX, which included the identification of significant processes and accounts, documentation of the design effectiveness over process and entity level controls, and testing of the operating effectiveness of key controls. See Item 9A. Controls and Procedures for our evaluation of disclosure controls and procedures and internal control over financial reporting. 
 Certain additional information concerning regulatory guidelines for capital adequacy and other regulatory matters is presented herein under the caption Capital in Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations and in Note 9 Off-Balance-Sheet Activities, Commitments and Other Matters and Note 10 Minimum Regulatory Capital Requirements of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data. 
 Isabella Bank 
 The Bank is supervised and regulated by DIFS and the FRB. These agencies and federal and state laws extensively regulate various aspects of the banking business including, among other things, permissible types and amounts of loans, investments and other activities, capital adequacy, branching, interest rates on loans and deposits, and the safety and soundness of banking practices. 
 Our deposits are insured up to applicable limits by the DIF of the FDIC and are subject to deposit insurance assessments to maintain the DIF. The FDIC assesses insurance premiums based upon a financial ratios method that takes into account asset and capital levels and supervisory ratings. 
 Banking laws and regulations restrict transactions by insured banks owned by a bank holding company. These restrictions include loans to and certain purchases from the parent holding company, non-bank and bank subsidiaries of the parent holding company. Additional restrictions apply to principal shareholders, officers, directors and their affiliates, and investments by the subsidiary bank in the shares or securities of the parent holding company (or any of the other non-bank or bank affiliates), or acceptance of such shares or securities as collateral security for loans to any borrower. 
 The Bank is subject to legal limitations on the frequency and amount of dividends that can be paid to Isabella Bank Corporation. For example, a Michigan state chartered bank may not declare a cash dividend or a dividend in kind except out of net profits then on hand after deducting all losses and bad debts, and then only if it will have a surplus amounting to not less than 20 of its capital after the payment of the dividend. Moreover, a Michigan state chartered bank may not declare or pay any cash dividend or dividend in kind until the cumulative dividends on its preferred stock, if any, have been paid in full. Further, if the surplus of a Michigan state chartered bank is at any time less than the amount of its capital, before the declaration of a cash dividend or dividend in kind, it must transfer to surplus not less than 10 of its net profits for the preceding six months (in the case of quarterly or semi-annual dividends) or the preceding two consecutive six month periods (in the case of annual dividends). 
 The payment of dividends by Isabella Bank Corporation and the Bank is also affected by various regulatory requirements and policies, such as the requirement to keep adequate capital in compliance with regulatory guidelines. Federal laws impose further restrictions on the payment of dividends by insured banks that fail to meet specified capital levels. The FDIC may prevent an insured bank from paying dividends if the bank is in default of payment of any assessment due to the FDIC. In addition, payment of dividends by a bank may be prevented by the applicable federal regulatory authority if such payment is determined, by reason of the financial condition of such bank, to be an unsafe and unsound banking practice. The FRB and the 
 5 

Table of Contents 

 FDIC have issued policy statements providing that bank holding companies and insured banks should generally pay dividends only out of current operating earnings. Additionally, the FRB Board of Governors requires a bank holding company to notify the FRB prior to increasing its cash dividend by more than 10 over the prior year. 
 The aforementioned regulations and restrictions may limit our ability to obtain funds from the Bank for our cash needs, including payment of dividends and operating expenses. 
 The activities and operations of the Bank are also subject to various federal and state laws and regulations. 
 
 Item 1A. Risk Factors. 
 In the normal course of business, we are exposed to various risks. These risks, if not managed correctly, could have a significant impact on our earnings, capital, share price, and ability to pay dividends. In order to effectively monitor and control the following risks, we utilize an enterprise risk model. We balance our strategic goals, including revenue and profitability objectives, with associated risks through the use of policies, systems, and procedures which have been adopted to identify, assess, control, monitor, and manage each risk area. We continually review the adequacy and effectiveness of these policies, systems, and procedures. 
 Our enterprise risk process covers each of the following areas. 
 The COVID-19 pandemic may adversely affect our business 
 Unexpected and unprecedented changes have occurred since early 2020 as the result of COVID-19. The World Health Organization declared the situation a global pandemic. The pandemic created significant market volatility, economic uncertainty, and disruption to normal business operations around the world, with slowdowns and shutdowns affecting entire industries. 
 The extent to which COVID-19 impacts our business will depend on future developments, which remain uncertain and cannot be predicted. We expect the significance of the COVID-19 pandemic, including the extent of its effect on our financial and operational results, to be dictated by, among other factors, its duration, the success of efforts to contain it, and the impact of actions taken in response. Uncertainty created by the COVID-19 pandemic is pervasive, and has impacted our financial results, operations, customers, vendors, and various areas of risk. Areas of risk may include, but are not limited to, cybersecurity, credit, interest rate, litigation, and risk related to vendor services. With the uncertainty created by COVID-19, it's challenging to determine the full impact on our ongoing financial and operational results. We continue to closely monitor external events and are in continual discussion with our customers to assess, prepare, and respond to conditions as they evolve. 
 Changes in credit quality and required allowance for loan and lease losses 
 To manage the credit risk arising from lending activities, our most significant source of credit risk, we maintain sound underwriting policies and procedures. We continuously monitor asset quality in order to determine the appropriateness of valuation allowances. These valuation allowances take into consideration various factors including, but not limited to, local, regional, and national economic conditions. 
 We maintain an ALLL to reserve for estimated incurred loan losses within our loan portfolio. The level of the ALLL reflects our evaluation of industry concentrations; specific credit risks; loan loss experience; loan portfolio quality; and economic, political and regulatory conditions. The determination of the appropriate level of the ALLL inherently involves a high degree of subjectivity and requires us to make significant estimates, all of which may undergo material changes. 
 Changes in economic conditions 
 An economic downturn within our local markets, as well as downturns in the state, national, or global markets, could negatively impact household and corporate incomes. This could lead to decreased demand for both loan and deposit products and lead to an increase of customers who fail to pay interest or principal on their loans. We continually monitor key economic indicators in an effort to anticipate the possible effects of downturns in the local, regional, and national economies. 
 Our success depends primarily on the general economic conditions of the State of Michigan and the specific local markets in which we operate. We provide banking and financial services to customers located primarily in the Clare, Gratiot, Isabella, Mecosta, Midland, Montcalm, and Saginaw counties in Michigan. The local economic conditions in these areas have a significant impact on the demand for our products and services, as well as the ability of our customers to repay loans, the value of the collateral securing loans, and the stability of our deposit funding sources. A significant decline in general economic conditions, caused by inflation, recession, acts of terrorism, international or domestic occurrences, a health crisis, 
 6 

Table of Contents 

 unemployment, changes in securities markets or other factors could impact these local economic conditions and, in turn, could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations. 
 Interest rate risk 
 IRR results from the timing differences in the maturity or repricing frequency of a financial institution s interest earning assets and its interest bearing liabilities. We monitor the potential effects of changes in interest rates through simulations and gap analyses. To help mitigate the effects of changes in interest rates, we make significant efforts to stagger projected cash flows and maturities of interest sensitive assets and liabilities. 
 Liquidity risk 
 Liquidity risk is the risk to earnings or capital arising from our inability to meet our obligations when they come due without incurring unacceptable and significant costs. Liquidity risk includes the inability to manage unplanned changes in funding sources, or failure to address changes in market conditions that affect the ability to liquidate assets quickly and with minimal loss in value. We have significant borrowing capacity through correspondent banks and the ability to sell certain investments to fund potential cash shortages, which we may use to help mitigate this risk. 
 The value of investment securities may be negatively impacted by fluctuations in the market 
 A volatile, illiquid market or decline in credit quality could require us to recognize an OTTI loss related to the investment securities held in our portfolio. We consider many factors in determining whether an OTTI exists including the length of time and extent to which fair value has been less than cost, the investment credit rating, and the probability that the issuer will be unable to pay the amount when due. The presence of these factors could lead to impairment charges. These risks are mitigated by the fact that we do not intend to sell the security in an unrealized loss position and it is more likely than not that we will not have to sell the security before recovery of its cost basis. 
 Operational risk 
 Operational risk is the risk of loss resulting from failed or inadequate internal processes, staffing, information technology systems, or external events. These factors may lead to reputation risk and transaction risk. Reputation risk is managed by developing and retaining marketplace confidence in handling customers financial transactions in an appropriate manner and protecting our safety and soundness. Transaction risk includes losses from fraud, error, the inability to deliver products or services, and loss or theft of information. Transaction risk also encompasses product development and delivery, transaction processing, information technology systems, and the internal control environment. 
 To minimize potential losses due to operational risks, we have established a robust system of internal controls that are regularly tested by our internal audit department in conjunction with the services of certified public accounting firms who assist in performing such internal audit work. The focus of these internal audit procedures is to verify the validity and appropriateness of various transactions, processes, and controls. The results of these procedures are reported to our Audit Committee. 
 The adoption of, violations of, or nonconformance with laws, rules, regulations, or prescribed practices 
 The financial services industry and public companies are extensively regulated and must meet regulatory standards set by the FDIC, DIFS, FRB, FASB, SEC, PCAOB, CFPB, and other regulatory bodies. Federal and state laws and regulations are designed primarily to protect deposit insurance funds and consumers, and not necessarily to benefit our shareholders. The nature, extent, and timing of the adoption of significant new laws, changes in existing laws, or repeal of existing laws may have a material impact on our business, results of operations, and financial condition, the effect of which is impossible to predict at this time. 
 Our compliance department annually assesses the adequacy and effectiveness of our processes for controlling and managing our principal compliance risks. 
 Changes to the financial services industry as a result of regulatory changes or actions, or significant litigation 
 The financial services industry is extensively regulated by state and federal regulation that governs almost all aspects of our operations. Laws and regulations may change from time to time and are primarily intended for the protection of consumers, depositors, and the deposit insurance fund. The impact of any changes to laws and regulations or other actions by regulatory agencies may negatively impact us or our ability to increase the value of our business. Regulatory authorities have extensive discretion in connection with their supervisory and enforcement activities, including the imposition of restrictions on the operation of an institution, the classification of assets by the institution, and the appropriateness of an institution s ALLL. Future regulatory changes or accounting pronouncements may increase our regulatory capital requirements or adversely affect 
 7 

Table of Contents 

 our regulatory capital levels. Additionally, actions by regulatory agencies or significant litigation against us could require the dedication of significant time and resources to respond to those actions and may lead to penalties. 
 We may not adjust to changes in the financial services industry 
 Our financial performance depends in part on our ability to maintain and grow our core deposit customer base and expand our financial services to our existing and new customers. The increasingly competitive environment is, in part, a result of changes in technology and product delivery systems and the accelerating pace of consolidation among financial service providers. New competitors may emerge to increase the degree of competition for our products and services. Financial services and products are also constantly changing. Our financial performance is dependent upon customer demand for our products and services, our ability to develop and offer competitive financial products and services, and our ability to adapt to enhancements in financial technology. 
 We may be required to recognize an impairment of goodwill 
 Goodwill represents the excess of the amounts paid to acquire subsidiaries over the fair value of their net assets at the date of acquisition. The majority of the recorded goodwill is related to acquisitions of other banks, which were subsequently merged into Isabella Bank. If it is determined that the goodwill is impaired, we must write-down the goodwill by the amount of the impairment. 
 We may face pressure from purchasers of our residential mortgage loans to repurchase loans sold or reimburse purchasers for losses related to such loans 
 We generally sell the fixed rate long-term residential mortgage loans we originate to the secondary market. The purchasers of residential mortgage loans, such as government sponsored entities, increased their efforts to require sellers of residential mortgage loans to either repurchase loans previously sold, or reimburse the purchasers for losses incurred on foreclosed loans due to actual or alleged failure to strictly conform to the terms of the contract. 
 Consumers may decide not to use banks to complete their financial transactions 
 Technology and other changes are allowing customers to complete financial transactions without the involvement of banks. For example, consumers can now pay bills and transfer funds directly without banks. The process of diminishing or removing banks as intermediaries in financial transactions could result in the loss of fee income, as well as the loss of customer deposits and income generated from those deposits. 
 Unauthorized disclosure of sensitive or confidential client or customer information, whether through cyber attacks, breach of computer systems or other means 
 Our products, services and systems are accessed through critical company or third-party operations. This involves the storage, processing and transmission of sensitive data, including proprietary or confidential data, regulated data, and personal information of employees and customers. Successful breaches, employee wrongdoing, or human or technological error could result in unauthorized access to, disclosure, modification, misuse, loss, or destruction of company, customer, or other third party data or systems. Examples include theft of sensitive, regulated, or confidential data, including personal information; loss of access to critical data or systems through ransomware, destructive attacks, or other means; and business delays, service or system disruptions, or denials of service. 
 Cybersecurity incidents have increased in number and severity and it is expected that these trends will continue. Should we, or third parties we do business with, fall victim to successful cyber attacks or experience other cybersecurity incidents, including the loss of personally identifiable customer or other sensitive data, the result could severely damage our reputation, expose us to the risks of litigation and liability, disrupt our operations, and increase cybersecurity or other insurance premiums. 
 We have cybersecurity insurance, in the event a cybersecurity attack were to occur, covering expenses related to notification, credit monitoring, investigation, crisis management, public relations, and legal advice. In addition, we maintain insurance to cover restoration of data, certain physical damage, or third-party injuries caused by potential cybersecurity incidents. However, damage and claims arising from such incidents may not be covered or may exceed the amount of any insurance available. Insurance policies are reviewed annually in detail. 
 A strong reputation is vital and requires utmost protection. An operating incident, significant cybersecurity disruption, or other adverse events may have a negative impact on our reputation which could make it more difficult for us to compete successfully for new opportunities, obtain necessary regulatory approvals, or severely reduce consumer demand for our products.

 Our estimates and assumptions may be incorrect 
 Our consolidated financial statements conform with GAAP, which require us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements. Estimates are based on information available to us at the time the estimates are made. Actual results could differ from estimates. For further discussion regarding significant accounting estimates, see Note 1 Nature of Operations and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data. 
 Disruption of infrastructure 
 Our operations depend upon our technological and physical infrastructure, including our equipment and facilities. Extended disruption of our vital infrastructure by fire, power loss, natural disaster, telecommunications failure, computer hacking and viruses, or other events outside of our control, could have a significant impact on our operations. We have developed and tested disaster recovery plans for all significant aspects of our operations. 
 Anti-takeover provisions 
 Our articles of incorporation include anti-takeover provisions that require a two-thirds majority vote of our shareholders to approve a sale of the Corporation. Additionally, changes to our articles of incorporation must be approved by a two-thirds majority vote of our shareholders. 
 
 Item 1B. Unresolved Staff Comments. 
 None. 
 
 Item 2. Properties. 
 Our executive offices are located at 401 North Main Street in Mount Pleasant, Michigan. In addition to this location, we own 28 branches, two operations centers, our previous main office building and vacant land.

 ISABELLA BANK CORPORATION FINANCIAL REVIEW 
 (Dollars in thousands except per share amounts) 
 The following is management s discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations. This discussion and analysis is intended to provide a better understanding of the consolidated financial statements and statistical data included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. 
 Executive Summary 
 We reported net income of 22,238 and earnings per common share of 2.95 for the year ended December 31, 2022. Net income and earnings per common share for the same period of 2021 were 19,499 and 2.48, respectively. Net interest income increased 7,780, or 14.76 , during 2022 compared to 2021. While PPP loan fees declined, rising interest rates and growth in core loans and AFS securities led to a 5,685 or 9.46 increase in gross interest income during 2022 compared to 2021. We continued to benefit from the significant reduction in higher-cost borrowings as interest expense on deposits and borrowings decreased 2,095, or 28.26 , for the year ended December 31, 2022 when compared to the same period in 2021. 
 The provision for loan losses during the year ended December 31, 2022 was 483, compared to a net provision reversal of 518 for the same period in 2021. During 2020, increased economic and environmental risk factors, predominantly driven by COVID-19, drove a significant increase in the ALLL and provision expense. Strong credit quality, coupled with improvement in economic factors, such as unemployment rates, resulted in a reduction in the ALLL and a provision reversal during the first quarter of 2021. Credit quality remained strong at December 31, 2022, as evidenced by total past due and nonaccrual loans which were 11,130, or 0.88 , of gross loans. Despite strong credit quality, the ALLL and provision for loan losses increased during 2022 as a result of core loan growth and economic related risk factors. 
 Noninterest income decreased 156 during 2022 compared to the same period in 2021. Gain on sale of mortgages decreased 1,063, as residential mortgage originations sold in the secondary market declined. Offsetting this was an increase in service charges and fees of 1,116, with 619 of the increase attributed to OMSR income. Noninterest expenses increased 3,126 in 2022 when compared to the same period in 2021 and was primarily a result of increased compensation, other losses, donations and community relations related expenses. 
 As of December 31, 2022, total assets and assets under management were 2,030,267 and 2,808,391, respectively. Assets under management include loans sold and serviced of 264,206 and investment and trust assets managed by Isabella Wealth of 513,918, in addition to assets on our consolidated balance sheet. Loans outstanding as of December 31, 2022 totaled 1,264,173. During 2022, gross loans declined 36,864 which was largely the result of a 72,001 reduction in advances to mortgage brokers, which is included within the commercial loan portfolio; however, is not considered a component of our core lending business. During 2022, core loan growth totaled 35,137 and was driven by growth in all loan categories. Total deposits were 1,744,275 as of December 31, 2022, which was an increase of 33,936 since December 31, 2021. A majority of this growth was in the form of demand deposits. All regulatory capital ratios for the Bank exceeded the minimum thresholds to be considered a "well capitalized" institution. 
 Our securities portfolio increased 89,880 since December 31, 2021, predominantly due to 210,869 in purchases, although offset by maturities and an increase in net unrealized losses. The unrealized loss on our AFS securities portfolio resulted from the recent increases in short-term and intermediate-term benchmark interest rates. As a result, this change in unrealized losses has reduced our balance of shareholders' equity and negatively impacted our tangible book value. Management does not anticipate the need to sell securities and incur a loss as a result of the sale. 
 Our net yield on interest earning assets (FTE) was 3.18 for 2022 which increased from 2.87 in 2021. The marked improvement is a result of strategies management began implementing in 2019 and 2020, focused on positioning the Bank to benefit in a rising interest rate environment, including a reduced reliance on higher-cost borrowed funds and brokered deposits.

 Recent Events and Legislation 
 Impact of COVID-19: Unexpected and unprecedented changes have occurred since early 2020 as the result of COVID-19. The full impact of the pandemic, including the uncertainties surrounding the pandemic, remain in 2022. However, significant progress has been made with vaccinations and medical treatments. Additionally, improved safety guidelines and the easing of restrictions have occurred since the onset of the pandemic. We expect the significance of the pandemic, including the extent of its effect on our financial and operational results, to be dictated by continued developments related to the COVID-19 pandemic. We continue to closely monitor external events and are in continual discussion with our customers to assess, prepare, and respond to conditions as they evolve. 
 Reclassifications 
 Certain amounts reported in management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations for 2021 and 2020 have been reclassified to conform with the 2022 presentation. 
 Subsequent Events 
 In June 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-13 and updated the measurement for credit losses for AFS debt securities and assets measured at amortized cost, which include loans and any other financial assets with the contractual right to receive cash. The new approach requires the use of an expected credit loss model. The new CECL guidance was effective January 1, 2023 and we have fully adopted the new guidance as of that date. 
 Based on portfolio characteristics and economic conditions and expectations as of January 1, 2023, we recorded a combined increase to the ACL and reserve for unfunded commitments on January 1, 2023 of approximately 3,000 upon the adoption of ASU 2016-13. 
 We evaluated subsequent events after December 31, 2022 through the date our condensed consolidated financial statements were issued for potential recognition and disclosure. Outside of the adoption of CECL, no other subsequent events require financial statement recognition or disclosure between December 31, 2022 and the date our condensed consolidated financial statements were issued. 
 Other 
 We have not received, nor are aware of, any notices of regulatory actions as of March 6, 2023.

 CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES 
 Our significant accounting policies are set forth in Note 1 Nature of Operations and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data. Of these significant accounting policies, we consider our policies regarding the ALLL, acquisition intangibles and goodwill, and the determination of the fair value and assessment of OTTI of investment securities to be our most critical accounting policies. 
 The ALLL requires our most subjective and complex judgment. Changes in economic conditions and other external factors can have a significant impact on the ALLL and, therefore, the provision for loan losses and results of operations. We have developed policies and procedures for assessing the appropriateness of the ALLL, recognizing that this process requires a number of assumptions and estimates with respect to our loan portfolio. Our assessments may be impacted in future periods by changes in economic conditions, and the discovery of information with respect to borrowers which is not known to us at the time of the issuance of the consolidated financial statements. For additional discussion concerning our ALLL and related matters, see Allowance for Loan and Lease Losses and Note 4 Loans and ALLL of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data. 
 U.S. generally accepted accounting principles require that we determine the fair value of the assets and liabilities of an acquired entity, and record the fair value on the date of acquisition. We employ a variety of measures in the determination of the fair value, including the use of discounted cash flow analysis, market appraisals, and projected future revenue streams. For certain items that we believe we have the appropriate expertise to determine the fair value, we may choose to use our own calculations of the value. In other cases, where the value is not easily determined, we consult with independent experts to determine the fair value of the identified asset or liability. Once valuations have been determined, the net difference between the price paid for the acquired entity and the net value of assets acquired on our balance sheet, including identifiable intangibles, is recorded as goodwill. Acquisition intangibles and goodwill are qualitatively evaluated to determine if it is more likely than not that the carrying balance is impaired on at least an annual basis. 
 AFS securities are carried at fair value with changes in the fair value included as a component of other comprehensive income. Declines in the fair value of AFS securities below their cost that are other-than-temporary are reflected as realized losses in the consolidated statements of income. We evaluate AFS securities for indications of losses that are considered other-than-temporary, if any, on a regular basis. The market values for most AFS investment securities are typically obtained from outside sources and applied to individual securities within the portfolio. Municipal securities for which no readily determinable market values are available are priced using fair value curves which most closely match the securities' characteristics.

 Average Balances, Interest Rates, and Net Interest Income 
 The following schedules present the daily average amount outstanding for each major category of interest earning assets, non-earning assets, interest bearing liabilities, and noninterest bearing liabilities for the last three years. These schedules also present an analysis of interest income and interest expense for the periods indicated. All interest income is reported on a FTE basis using a federal income tax rate of 21 . Loans in nonaccrual status, for the purpose of the following computations, are included in the average loan balances. FRB and FHLB restricted equity holdings are included in other interest earning assets.

 Net interest income is the amount by which interest income on earning assets exceeds the interest expense on interest bearing liabilities. Net interest income is influenced by changes in the balance and mix of assets and liabilities, as well as market interest rates. We exert some control over these factors; however, FRB monetary policy and competition have a significant impact. For analytical purposes, net interest income is adjusted to an FTE basis by including the income tax savings from interest on tax exempt loans and nontaxable investment securities, thus making year to year comparisons more meaningful. The FTE adjustment is based on a federal income tax rate of 21 . 
 
 Volume and Rate Variance Analysis 
 The following table sets forth the effect of volume and rate changes on interest income and expense for the periods indicated. For the purpose of this table, changes in interest due to volume and rate were determined as follows: 
 Volume change in volume multiplied by the previous period's FTE rate. 
 Rate change in the FTE rate multiplied by the previous period's volume. 
 All interest income presented in the table below is reported on a FTE basis using a federal income tax rate of 21 . The change in interest due to both volume and rate has been allocated to volume and rate changes in proportion to the relationship of the absolute dollar amounts of the change in each.

 The interest rate increases during 2022 alleviated much of the pressure placed on our net interest margin. Additionally, SBA PPP fee income has supported our yield on total earning assets over the past two years. The recent rate increases, and future rate increases expected during 2023, should lead to continued improvement in our net yield on interest earning assets.

 Allowance for Loan and Lease Losses 
 The viability of any financial institution is ultimately determined by its management of credit risk. Loans represent our single largest concentration of risk. The ALLL is our estimation of incurred losses within the existing loan portfolio. We allocate the ALLL throughout the loan portfolio based on our assessment of the underlying risks associated within each loan segment. Our assessments include allocations based on specific impairment valuation allowances, historical charge-offs, internally assigned credit risk ratings, and past due and nonaccrual balances. A portion of the ALLL is not allocated to any one loan segment, but is instead a representation of other qualitative risks that reflect the margin of imprecision inherent in the underlying assumptions used in the methodologies for estimating specific and general losses in the portfolio. 
 The following table summarizes our charge-offs, recoveries, provision for loan losses, and ALLL balances as of, and for the unaudited three month periods ended: December 31 2022 September 30 2022 June 30 2022 March 31 2022 December 31 2021 Total charge-offs 249 173 106 91 149 Total recoveries 479 132 117 155 78 Net loan charge-offs (recoveries) (230) 41 (11) (64) 71 Net loan charge-offs (recoveries) to average loans outstanding (0.02) 0.00 0.00 (0.01) 0.01 Provision for loan losses (57) 18 485 37 81 Provision for loan losses to average loans outstanding 0.00 0.00 0.04 0.00 0.01 ALLL 9,850 9,677 9,700 9,204 9,103 ALLL as a of loans at end of period 0.78 0.78 0.76 0.76 0.70

 During 2020, we increased the ALLL as a result of increased economic and environmental related risk factors, primarily driven by COVID-19. While these risk factors remain, improvement in credit quality indicators resulted in a reduction to the ALLL during 2021. Despite strong credit quality, the ALLL increased during 2022 as a result of core loan growth during the year and increased economic related risk factors. 
 The following table illustrates the two main components of the ALLL as of: December 31 2022 September 30 2022 June 30 2022 March 31 2022 December 31 2021 ALLL Individually evaluated for impairment 451 474 515 573 578 Collectively evaluated for impairment 9,399 9,203 9,185 8,631 8,525 Total 9,850 9,677 9,700 9,204 9,103 ALLL to gross loans Individually evaluated for impairment 0.04 0.04 0.04 0.05 0.04 Collectively evaluated for impairment 0.74 0.74 0.72 0.71 0.66 Total 0.78 0.78 0.76 0.76 0.70 
 The following table illustrates the amounts of the ALLL allocated to each loan segment and the percentage of these loan segments to gross loans as of December 31: 2022 2021 2020 2019 2018 ALLL Allocation of Gross Loans ALLL Allocation of Gross Loans ALLL Allocation of Gross Loans ALLL Allocation of Gross Loans ALLL Allocation of Gross Loans Commercial 1,321 58.61 1,740 62.07 2,162 61.10 1,914 59.08 2,563 58.43 Agricultural 577 8.25 289 7.22 311 8.11 634 9.85 775 11.27 Residential real estate 617 26.97 747 25.08 1,363 24.84 2,047 25.16 1,992 24.39 Consumer 961 6.17 908 5.63 798 5.95 922 5.91 857 5.91 Total Allocated 3,476 100.00 3,684 100.00 4,634 100.00 5,517 100.00 6,187 100.00 Unallocated 6,374 5,419 5,110 2,422 2,188 Total 9,850 100.00 9,103 100.00 9,744 100.00 7,939 100.00 8,375 100.00 
 While we utilize our best judgment and information available, the ultimate adequacy of the ALLL is dependent upon a variety of factors beyond our control, including the performance of our borrowers, the economy, and changes in interest rates. We closely monitor overall credit quality indicators and our policies and procedures related to the analysis of the ALLL to ensure that the ALLL remains at an appropriate level.

 Loans Past Due and Loans in Nonaccrual Status 
 Fluctuations in past due and nonaccrual status loans can have a significant impact on the ALLL. To determine the potential impact, and corresponding estimated losses, we analyze our historical loss trends on loans past due greater than 30 days and nonaccrual status loans for indications of additional deterioration. 
 Total Past Due and Nonaccrual Loans as of December 31 2022 2021 2020 2019 2018 Commercial 7,504 561 2,148 2,477 2,722 Agricultural 234 987 3,786 4,285 5,377 Residential real estate 3,333 2,287 3,580 4,572 3,208 Consumer 59 196 96 71 105 Total 11,130 4,031 9,610 11,405 11,412 Total past due and nonaccrual loans to gross loans 0.88 0.31 0.78 0.96 1.01 
 Past due and nonaccrual status loans, as a percentage of gross loans, has improved in recent years with the exception of 2022. During the fourth quarter, past due loans increased as a result of one commercial relationship. Therefore, we do not believe the recent increase is an indicator of credit deterioration. 
 A summary of loans past due and in nonaccrual status, including the composition of the ending balance of nonaccrual status loans by type, is included in Note 4 Loans and ALLL of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data. 
 
 Troubled Debt Restructurings 
 We have taken a proactive approach to modifying loans to assist borrowers who are willing to work with us, thus making them less likely to default, and to avoid foreclosure. This approach has permitted certain borrowers to develop a payment structure that will allow them to continue making payments in lieu of foreclosure. Modifications have been successful for us and our customers as very few of the modified loans have resulted in foreclosures. The majority of new modifications result in terms that satisfy our criteria for continued interest accrual. TDRs that have been placed in nonaccrual status may be placed back on accrual status after six months of continued performance and achievement of current payment status. 
 We restructure debt with borrowers who due to financial difficulties are unable to service their debt under the original terms. We may extend the amortization period, reduce interest rates, allow temporary interest-only payment structures, forgive principal, forgive interest, or grant a combination of these modifications. Typically, the modifications are for a period of three years or less. There were no TDRs that were government sponsored as of December 31, 2022 or December 31, 2021. 
 Losses associated with TDRs, if any, are included in the estimation of the ALLL during the quarter in which a loan is identified as a TDR, and we review the analysis of the ALLL estimation each reporting period thereafter to ensure its continued appropriateness.

 The accrual of interest on commercial and agricultural loans, as well as residential real estate loans, is discontinued at the time a loan is 90 days or more past due unless the credit is well-secured and in the process of short-term collection. Upon transferring a loan to nonaccrual status, we perform an evaluation to determine the net realizable value of the underlying collateral. This evaluation is used to help determine if a charge-off is necessary. Consumer loans are typically charged-off no later than 180 days past due. Loans may be placed back on accrual status after six months of continued performance and achievement of current payment status. The level of nonperforming loans continued to improve and remains low in comparison to peer banks.

 Service charges and fees on deposit accounts declined in 2020 as a result of waived fees. In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, which led to an increase in the need for electronic services and products, we elected to remove select deposit account related charges and fees and temporarily waived some charges and fees to ease the financial stress of our customers. Despite some fees being removed or waived, fee income increased during 2021, but did not reach pre-pandemic levels. During 2022, we experienced an increase in fees mainly due to an increase in the number of deposit accounts. Although we expect a continuation in deposit account growth in 2023, fee levels may not exceed 2022 due to continued regulatory discussions around the practice of service charges and fees. 
 OMSR income results are driven, in part, by changes in offering rates on residential mortgage loans, anticipated prepayments in the servicing-retained portfolio, and the volume of loans within the servicing-retained portfolio. During 2021, the volume of loans serviced decreased, while prepayment speeds continued to increase. Both of these factors contributed to the recognition of a loss during 2021. During 2022, prepayment speeds declined as a result of an increase in interest rates, resulting in income recognized during 2022. OMSR income during 2023 is not expected to exceed 2022 levels as a result of an anticipated decline in the volume of loans serviced. 
 In 2020 wealth management fees decreased mainly due to the decline in market values of assets under management. During 2021, we experienced an increase in wealth management fees driven by a combination of the growth in the stock market and increased new business activity. During 2022, there was strong growth in the portfolio, however the decline in the market offset the increase in fees related to growth. We expect wealth management fees to exceed 2022 levels in 2023, as a result of new business activity. 
 The amount of loans sold is driven by customer demand and balance sheet management strategies. We experienced a significant increase in loan demand in early 2021 which led to an increase in the number and dollar amount of loans sold; as such, net gain on sale of mortgage loans increased significantly. In mid-2021, we decided to retain more loan originations on the balance sheet, due to our liquidity position, thereby decreasing the number of mortgage loans sold, which had an impact on the net gain on loans sold. As a result of this change in strategy, coupled with a decline in loan demand, net gain on sale of mortgage loans declined in the second half of 2021 and during 2022. As demand is expected to remain at reduced levels in 2023, due to the rise in interest rates, net gain on sale of mortgage loans is not expected to exceed 2022 levels during 2023. 
 We recognized gains from the redemption of corporate owned life insurance policies in connection with the passing of retired bank employees.

 During the fourth quarter of 2020, we incurred expense of 7,643 as a result of the extinguishment of 100,000 of FHLB advances. 
 Donations and community relations increased during 2022 as a result of initiatives designed to deepen and strengthen our relationship with the communities in which we operate and serve, which includes an expanded footprint. While government restrictions and temporary business closures related to COVID-19 impacted our ability to maintain the level of support in early 2021, we have since increased the level of community support. We intend to increase our community support in 2023, as a result expenses in 2023 are expected to exceed 2022 levels. 
 FDIC insurance premiums decreased in 2022 as a result of increased earnings and improved credit quality metrics. While we anticipate these trends to continue, FDIC insurance premiums are expected to increase in 2023 as a result of the recently approved increase in the base deposit insurance rate. 
 The fluctuations in all other noninterest expenses are spread throughout various categories, none of which are individually significant.

 A discussion of changes in balance sheet amounts by major categories follows: 
 Cash and cash equivalents 
 Included in cash and cash equivalents are funds held with the FRB which fluctuate from period to period. Cash levels decreased significantly during 2022 as a result of the purchase of AFS securities. These purchases were funded through deposit growth and a decline in loans during 2022.

 AFS securities 
 The primary objective of our investing activities is to manage our overall exposure to changes in interest rates. Secondary considerations include ensuring ample access to liquidity, generating returns, and providing current income. Over the last two years, the flat yield curve encouraged the use of excess funds to reduce higher-cost borrowings as opposed to investing in AFS securities. However, based on balance sheet strategies, excess funds above what is required to retire future maturities of higher-cost funding sources was prudently deployed to purchase AFS securities in future periods. 
 The following is a schedule of the carrying value of AFS securities as of December 31: 2022 2021 2020 U.S. Treasury 208,701 209,703 States and political subdivisions 117,512 121,205 143,656 Auction rate money market preferred 2,342 3,242 3,237 Mortgage-backed securities 39,070 56,148 88,652 Collateralized mortgage obligations 205,728 92,301 101,983 Corporate 7,128 8,002 1,700 Total 580,481 490,601 339,228 
 Excluding those holdings in government sponsored enterprises and municipalities within the State of Michigan, there were no investments in securities of any one issuer that exceeded 10 of shareholders equity during 2022, 2021, and 2020. We have a policy prohibiting investments in securities that we deem unsuitable due to their inherent credit or market risks. Prohibited investments include stripped mortgage-backed securities, zero coupon bonds, nongovernment agency asset-backed securities, and structured notes. Our holdings in mortgage-backed securities and collateralized mortgage obligations include only government agencies and government sponsored agencies as we hold no investments in private label mortgage-backed securities or collateralized mortgage obligations. 
 The following is a schedule of maturities of AFS securities and their weighted average yields as of December 31, 2022. Weighted average yields have been computed on an FTE basis using a tax rate of 21 . Our auction rate money market preferred investments are long-term floating rate instruments. The issuers of auction rate securities generally have the right to redeem or refinance the debt. Because of their lack of contractual maturities, auction rate money market preferred stocks are not reported by a specific maturity group. Mortgage-backed securities and collateralized mortgage obligations are not reported by a specific maturity group due to their variable monthly payments. Expected maturities may differ from contractual maturities because issuers may have the right to call or prepay obligations.

 Loans 
 Loans are the largest component of earning assets. The proper management of credit and market risk inherent in the loan portfolio is critical to our financial stability. To control these risks, we have adopted strict underwriting standards, lending limits to a single borrower, loan to collateral value limits, and a defined market area. We also monitor and limit loan concentrations to specific industries. We have no foreign loans and there were no concentrations greater than 10 of total loans that are not disclosed as a separate category in the following table. 
 The following table presents the composition of the loan portfolio for the years ended December 31: 2022 2021 2020 2019 2018 Commercial 740,920 807,439 756,686 700,941 659,529 Agricultural 104,314 93,955 100,461 116,920 127,161 Residential real estate 340,885 326,361 307,543 298,569 275,343 Consumer 78,054 73,282 73,621 70,140 66,674 Total 1,264,173 1,301,037 1,238,311 1,186,570 1,128,707

 Advances to mortgage brokers, within the commercial loan portfolio, which is not considered a component of our core lending business, was the primary driver behind the fluctuations experienced since December 31, 2021, as participation in this mortgage purchase program paused during most of 2021 and again in 2022. We've recently experienced an increase in commercial loan demand, despite changes in advances to mortgage brokers and continued forgiveness of the remaining SBA PPP loans. As demand is expected to continue, we anticipate growth in the commercial loan portfolio in 2023. While Agricultural loans have increased in 2022 and are expected to continue in 2023, we do not anticipate the same level of growth experienced in 2022 as the result of the competitive lending environment. Residential mortgage lending activities have slowed during the year as a result of rising interest rates. As interest rates are expected to continue to increase in 2023, growth in residential and consumer loans is anticipated to continue but at a slower pace. 
 Accrued interest receivable and other assets 
 Other assets consist primarily of prepaid expenses, OMSR, and net deferred tax assets. The increase in accrued interest receivable and other assets during 2022 was due primarily to the change in the net deferred tax assets related to AFS securities. For more information related to estimates and deferred taxes, refer to Note 1 Nature of Operations and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies and Note 15 Federal Income Taxes of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.

 Deposits 
 Deposits are our primary source of funding. The following table presents the composition of the deposit portfolio as of December 31: 2022 2021 2020 Noninterest bearing demand deposits 494,346 448,352 375,395 Interest bearing demand deposits 372,155 364,563 302,444 Savings deposits 625,734 596,662 505,497 Certificates of deposit 251,541 297,696 358,165 Brokered certificates of deposit 14,029 Internet certificates of deposit 499 3,066 10,787 Total 1,744,275 1,710,339 1,566,317

 Total deposits have increased over the past 12 months with significant growth in non-contractual deposits, such as demand and savings deposits. While we experienced a decline in certificates of deposit over the past year, the decline has slowed as a result of the recent increase in the interest rate environment. We expect interest rates to continue to rise in 2023 and anticipate a shift of customers moving back to certificates of deposit products. Over the last few years, we used excess funds to reduce higher-cost deposits, such as brokered certificates of deposit. 
 The following table presents estimated balances of uninsured deposits as of December 31: 2022 2021 2020 2019 2018 Uninsured deposits 585,901 548,213 461,859 336,399 292,017

 Borrowed Funds 
 Borrowed funds include FHLB advances, securities sold under agreements to repurchase, subordinated debt, and federal funds purchased. The balance of borrowed funds fluctuates from period to period based on our funding needs that arise from changes in loans, investments, and deposits. To provide balance sheet growth, we may utilize borrowings and brokered deposits to fund earning assets. 
 The following table presents borrowed funds balances as of December 31: 2022 2021 2020 Securities sold under agreements to repurchase without stated maturity dates 57,771 50,162 68,747 FHLB advances 20,000 90,000 Subordinated debt, net of unamortized issuance costs 29,245 29,158 Total 87,016 99,320 158,747 
 Over the last few years, we used excess funds to reduce and payoff FHLB advances. On June 2, 2021, we completed a private placement of 30,000 in aggregate principal amount of 3.25 Fixed-to-Floating Rate Subordinated Notes due 2031 (the "Notes"). The Notes will initially bear a fixed interest rate of 3.25 until June 15, 2026, after which time until maturity on June 15, 2031, the interest rate will reset quarterly to an annual floating rate equal to the then-current 3-month SOFR plus 256 basis points. The Notes are redeemable by us at our option, in whole or in part, on or after June 15, 2026. The Notes are not subject to redemption at the option of the holders. For additional disclosure related to borrowed funds, see Note 8 Borrowed Funds of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data. 
 Accrued interest payable and other liabilities 
 Included in accrued interest payable and other liabilities are obligations related to our defined benefit pension plan and other employee benefits. For more information on the defined benefit pension plan and other employee benefits, see Note 12 Benefit Plans of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data. 
 
 Contractual Obligations and Loan Commitments 
 We have various financial obligations, including contractual obligations and commitments related to deposits and borrowings, which may require future cash payments. We also have loan related commitments that may impact liquidity. The commitments include unused lines of credit, commercial and standby letters of credit, and commitments to grant loans. These commitments to grant loans include residential mortgage loans with the majority committed to be sold to the secondary market. Many of these commitments historically have expired without being drawn upon and do not necessarily indicate our future cash requirements. 
 For additional disclosure related to Contractual Obligations and Loan Commitments, see Note 9 Off-Balance-Sheet Activities, Commitments and Other Matters of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.

 Capital 
 Capital consists solely of common stock, retained earnings, and accumulated other comprehensive income (loss). We are authorized to raise capital through dividend reinvestment, employee and director stock purchases, and shareholder stock purchases. Pursuant to these authorizations, we issued 74,445 shares or 1,762 of common stock during 2022, and 67,436 shares or 1,593 of common stock in 2021. We offer the Directors Plan in which participants purchase stock units through deferred fees, in lieu of cash payments. Pursuant to this plan, we increased shareholders equity by 463 and 433 during 2022 and 2021, respectively. We also grant restricted stock awards pursuant to the RSP, effective June 24, 2020. Pursuant to this plan, we increased shareholders equity by 147 and 86 during 2022 and 2021. 
 We have publicly announced a common stock repurchase plan. Pursuant to this plan, we repurchased 47,665 shares or 1,124 of common stock during 2022 and 135,465 shares or 3,050 during 2021. As of December 31, 2022, we were authorized to repurchase up to an additional 419,826 shares of common stock. 
 In the fourth quarter of 2021, we completed a modified Dutch Auction tender offer which resulted in the purchase of 396,576.78534 shares at a price of 27.00 per share for a total amount of approximately 10,708. 
 The FRB has established minimum risk-based capital guidelines. Pursuant to these guidelines, a framework has been established that assigns risk weights to each category of on and off-balance-sheet items to arrive at risk adjusted total assets. Regulatory capital is divided by the risk adjusted assets with the resulting ratio compared to the minimum standard to determine whether a corporation has adequate capital. 
 The common equity tier 1 capital ratio has a minimum requirement of 4.50 . The minimum standard for primary, or Tier 1 capital is 6.00 and the minimum standard for total capital is 8.00 . The minimum requirements presented below include the minimum required capital levels based on the Basel III Capital Rules. Capital requirements to be considered well capitalized are based upon prompt corrective action regulations, as amended to reflect the changes under the Basel III Capital Rules. The following table sets forth these requirements and our ratios as of December 31: 2022 2021 Actual Minimum Required - BASEL III Required to be Considered Well Capitalized Actual Minimum Required - BASEL III Required to be Considered Well Capitalized Common equity tier 1 capital 12.91 7.00 6.50 12.07 7.00 6.50 Tier 1 capital 12.91 8.50 8.00 12.07 8.50 8.00 Total capital 15.79 10.50 10.00 14.94 10.50 10.00 Tier 1 leverage 8.61 4.00 5.00 7.97 4.00 5.00 
 There are no significant regulatory constraints placed on our capital. At December 31, 2022, the Bank exceeded minimum capital requirements. For further information regarding the Bank s capital requirements, see Note 10 Minimum Regulatory Capital Requirements of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.

 Fair Value 
 We utilize fair value measurements to record fair value adjustments to certain assets and liabilities and to determine fair value disclosures. AFS securities, cash flow hedge derivative instruments and certain liabilities are recorded at fair value on a recurring basis. Additionally, from time to time, we may be required to record at fair value other assets on a nonrecurring basis, such as mortgage loans AFS, impaired loans, goodwill, foreclosed assets, OMSR, and certain other assets and liabilities. These nonrecurring fair value adjustments typically involve the application of lower of cost or market accounting or write downs of individual assets. 
 For further information regarding fair value measurements, see Note 1 Nature of Operations and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies and Note 17 Fair Value of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data. 
 
 Liquidity 
 Liquidity is monitored regularly by our ALCO, which consists of members of senior management. The committee reviews projected cash flows, key ratios, and liquidity available from both primary and secondary sources. 
 Our primary sources of liquidity are cash and cash equivalents and unencumbered AFS securities. These categories totaled 488,981 or 24.08 of assets as of December 31, 2022, compared to 495,259 or 24.37 as of December 31, 2021. The decline in the amount and percentage of primary liquidity is a result of investment purchases, with an offset in increased deposits. Liquidity is important for financial institutions because of their need to meet loan funding commitments, depositor withdrawal requests, and various other commitments including expansion of operations, investment opportunities, and payment of cash dividends. Based on these same factors, daily liquidity could vary significantly. 
 Deposit accounts are our primary source of funds. Our secondary sources include the ability to borrow from the FHLB, from the FRB, and through various correspondent banks in the form of federal funds purchased and a line of credit. These funding methods typically carry a higher interest rate than traditional market deposit accounts. In recent periods, we have elected to use excess funds to reduce borrowings and other higher-cost funding sources. Some borrowed funds, including FHLB advances, FRB Discount Window advances, and repurchase agreements, require us to pledge assets, typically in the form of AFS securities or loans, as collateral. As of December 31, 2022, we had available lines of credit of 344,393. 
 The frequency and complexity of our liquidity stress testing has increased since early 2020 and continues to evolve due to economic uncertainly as a result of COVID-19 and changes within the interest rate and economic environment. Our liquidity position remained strong at the end of 2022, which is illustrated in the following table: December 31 2022 Total cash and cash equivalents 38,924 Available lines of credit Fed funds lines with correspondent banks 93,000 FHLB borrowings 237,407 FRB Discount Window 8,986 Other lines of credit 5,000 Total available lines of credit 344,393 Unencumbered lendable value of FRB collateral, estimated 1

 Market Risk 
 Our primary market risks are interest rate risk and liquidity risk. IRR is the exposure of our net interest income to changes in interest rates. IRR results from the difference in the maturity or repricing frequency of a financial institution's interest earning assets and its interest bearing liabilities. Managing IRR is the fundamental method by which financial institutions earn income and create shareholder value. Excessive exposure to IRR could pose a significant risk to our earnings and capital. 
 The FRB has adopted a policy requiring banks to effectively manage the various risks that can have a material impact on safety and soundness. The risks include credit, interest rate, liquidity, operational, and reputational. We have policies, procedures, and internal controls for measuring and managing these risks. Specifically, our ALCO policy and procedures include defining acceptable types and terms of investments and funding sources, liquidity requirements, limits on investments in long-term assets, limiting the mismatch in repricing opportunities of assets and liabilities, and the frequency of measuring and reporting to our Board of Directors. 
 The primary technique to measure IRR is simulation analysis. Simulation analysis forecasts the effects on the balance sheet structure and net interest income under a variety of scenarios that incorporate changes in interest rates, the shape of yield curves, interest rate relationships, loan prepayments, and funding sources. These forecasts are compared against net interest income projected in a stable interest rate environment. While many assets and liabilities reprice either at maturity or in accordance with their contractual terms, several balance sheet components demonstrate characteristics that require an evaluation to more accurately reflect their repricing behavior. Key assumptions in the simulation analysis include prepayments on loans, probable calls of investment securities, changes in market conditions, loan volumes and loan pricing, deposit sensitivity, and customer preferences. These assumptions are inherently uncertain as they are subject to fluctuation and revision in a dynamic rate environment. As a result, the simulation analysis cannot precisely forecast the impact of rising and falling interest rates on net interest income. Actual results will differ from simulated results due to many other factors, including changes in balance sheet components, interest rate changes, changes in market conditions, and management strategies. We regularly monitor our projected net interest income sensitivity to ensure that it remains within established limits. 
 Gap analysis, the secondary method to measure IRR, measures the cash flows and/or the earliest repricing of our interest bearing assets and liabilities. This analysis is useful for measuring trends in the repricing characteristics of the balance sheet. Significant assumptions are required in this process because of the embedded repricing options contained in assets and liabilities. Residential real estate and consumer loans allow the borrower to repay the balance prior to maturity without penalty, while commercial and agricultural loans may have prepayment penalties. The amount of prepayments is dependent upon many factors, including the interest rate of a given loan in comparison to the current offering rates, the level of home sales, and the overall availability of credit in the market place. Generally, a decrease in interest rates will result in an increase in cash flows from these assets. A significant portion of our securities are callable or have prepayment options. The call and prepayment options are more likely to be exercised in a period of decreasing interest rates. Savings and demand accounts may generally be withdrawn on request without prior notice. The timing of cash flows from these deposits is estimated based on historical experience. Certificates of deposit have penalties that discourage early withdrawals. 
 We do not believe there has been a material change in the nature or categories of our primary market risk exposure, or the particular markets that present the primary risk of loss. We do not know of or expect there to be any material change in the general nature of our primary market risk exposure in the near term, and we do not expect to make material changes to our market risk methods in the near term. We may change those methods in the future to adapt to changes in circumstances or to implement new techniques. 
 Gap analysis is also utilized as a method to measure interest rate sensitivity. Interest rate sensitivity is determined by the amount of earning assets and interest bearing liabilities repricing within a specific time period, and their relative sensitivity to a change in interest rates. We strive to achieve reasonable stability in the net interest margin through periods of changing interest rates. One specific focus of interest rate sensitivity is the loan portfolio, primarily with commercial and agricultural loans.

 Our primary market risk exposures related to the COVID-19 pandemic remain uncertain. A review of our market risk methods are ongoing and modeling is incorporating additional assumptions to account for this uncertainty related to this crisis. Repricing, cash flows, and prepayment projections for loans and mortgage-backed securities are not expected to behave as they would be expected to in a more stable interest rate environment. Customer deposit levels may experience unusual fluctuations due to COVID-related government support programs ending, customer and business needs, and a potential decline in money supply as the Federal Reserve shrinks its balance sheet. We continue to closely monitor customer and economic indicators to develop more precise market risk assumptions as the economic impact of the crisis continues to reveal itself.

 We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Isabella Bank Corporation as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, and the related consolidated statements of changes in shareholders equity, income, comprehensive income, and cash flows for each of the years in the three-year period ended December 31, 2022, and the related notes (collectively referred to as the financial statements). We also have audited Isabella Bank Corporation s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2022, based on criteria established in the Internal Control-Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (2013 framework) (the COSO criteria). 
 In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the consolidated financial position of Isabella Bank Corporation as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, and the consolidated results of their operations and their cash flows for each of the years in the three-year period ended December 31, 2022, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. Also, in our opinion Isabella Bank Corporation maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2022, based on the COSO criteria. 
 Basis for Opinions 
 Isabella Bank Corporation s management is responsible for these consolidated financial statements, for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting, and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in the accompanying Management s Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express opinions on Isabella Bank Corporation s consolidated financial statements and on Isabella Bank Corporation s internal control over financial reporting based on our integrated audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to Isabella Bank Corporation in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. 
 We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audits to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud, and whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. 
 Our audits of the consolidated financial statements included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the consolidated financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the consolidated financial statements. Our audit of internal control over financial reporting included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material misstatement exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinions. 
 Definition and Limitations of Internal Control over Financial Reporting 
 A corporation s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of consolidated financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A corporation s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the corporation; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of consolidated financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the corporation are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the corporation; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the corporation s assets that could have a material effect on the consolidated financial statements.

 Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. 
 One Critical Audit Matter 
 The critical audit matter communicated below arising from the current period audit of the financial statements was communicated or is required to be communicated to the Corporation's audit committee and (1) relates to accounts or disclosures that are material to the financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective or complex judgments. The communication of the critical audit matter does not alter in any way our opinion on the consolidated financial statements, taken as a whole, nor our opinion on internal control over financial reporting, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matter below, providing a separate opinion on the critical audit matter or on the accounts or disclosures to which it relates. 
 Allowance for Loan Losses 
 Description of the Matter 
 The Corporation s loan portfolio totaled 1.264 billion as of December 31, 2022 and the associated allowance for loan and lease losses (ALLL) was 9.850 million. As described in Notes 1 and 4 to the consolidated financial statements, the ALLL is established to absorb inherent losses that have been incurred or are probable within the existing portfolio of loans. Management s estimate of inherent losses within the loan portfolio is established using quantitative, as well as qualitative, considerations. The Corporation s methodology to determine the ALLL considers quantitative calculations including: specific valuation allowances determined in accordance with ASC Topic 310 based on probable losses on specific loans, historical valuation allowances determined in accordance with ASC topic 450 based on historical loan loss experience for similar loans with similar characteristics and trends, supplemented, as necessary, by credit judgment to address observed changes in trends and conditions, and other relevant environmental and economic factors such as concentrations of credit risk, economic trends and conditions, changes in underwriting standards, experience and depth of lending staff, trends in delinquencies, and the level of net charge-offs (qualitative factor adjustments). 
 Auditing the Corporation s ALLL involved a high degree of subjectivity due to the judgement involved in management s determination of commercial and agricultural loan credit risk ratings and identification and measurement of qualitative factor adjustments included in the estimate of the ALLL. 
 How We Addressed the Matter in Our Audit 
 We obtained an understanding of the Corporation s process for establishing the ALLL and evaluated the design and tested the operating effectiveness of controls that address the risk of material misstatement related to the measurement of the ALLL. We tested controls over management s review of commercial and agricultural loan credit risk ratings, the data inputs utilized in the ALLL calculation, management s identification and review of the qualitative factor adjustments, and management s review and approval process over the final determination of the ALLL. 
 To test the commercial and agricultural loan credit risk ratings included in management s estimate of the ALLL, we evaluated the methodology used, including management s consideration of the individual commercial and agricultural loan portfolio segments, and tested the completeness and accuracy of data from underlying systems that was used in the determination of credit risk. We performed procedures on a sample of commercial and agricultural loans to test the Corporation s credit risk ratings by comparing key attributes used in the determination of the credit risk rating to supporting documentation such as borrowers financial statements, underlying collateral, financial health of the guarantor and loan payment history. 
 To test the measurement of qualitative factor adjustments included in management s estimate of the ALLL, we evaluated the methodology and metrics, including testing the completeness and accuracy of data from underlying systems and other information. We further evaluated management s assessment of the qualitative factor adjustments by obtaining an understanding of the basis for relevant changes in underlying qualitative factor adjustments and giving consideration to prior period qualitative factor adjustments and other information available within the Corporation and from external sources focusing on both corroborating and contrary evidence.

 days or more past due unless the credit is well secured and in the process of collection. Consumer loans are typically charged-off no later than days past due. Past due status is based on contractual terms of the loan. In all cases, loans are placed in nonaccrual or charged-off at an earlier date if collection of principal or interest is considered doubtful. For loans that are placed on nonaccrual status or charged-off, all interest accrued in the current calendar year, but not collected, is reversed against interest income while interest accrued in prior calendar years, but not collected is charged against the ALLL. Interest income on loans in nonaccrual status is not recognized until qualifying for return to accrual status. Loans are returned to accrual status when all principal and interest amounts contractually due are brought current and future payments are reasonably assured. For impaired loans not classified as nonaccrual, interest income continues to be accrued over the term of the loan based on the principal amount outstanding.

 The unrealized loss on our AFS securities portfolio resulted from the recent increases in short-term and intermediate-term interest rates. 
 Based on our analysis, which included the criteria outlined above and the fact that we have asserted that we do not have to sell any AFS securities in an unrealized loss position, we do not believe that the values of any AFS securities are other-than-temporarily impaired as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, with the exception of one municipal bond previously identified in 2016 which had no activity during the period.

 days or more past due unless the credit is well-secured and in the process of short-term collection. Upon transferring a loan to nonaccrual status, we perform an evaluation to determine the net realizable value of the underlying collateral. This evaluation is used to help determine if a charge-off is necessary. Consumer loans are typically charged-off no later than days past due. Past due status is based on the contractual term of the loan. In all cases, a loan is placed in nonaccrual status at an earlier date if collection of principal or interest is considered doubtful. 
 When a loan is placed in nonaccrual status, all interest accrued in the current calendar year, but not collected, is reversed against interest income while interest accrued in prior calendar years, but not collected, is charged against the ALLL. Loans may be returned to accrual status after of continuous performance and achievement of current payment status. 
 . Borrowers with direct credit needs of more than may be serviced through the use of loan participations with other commercial banks. Commercial and agricultural real estate loans commonly require loan-to-value limits of or less. Depending upon the type of loan, past credit history, and current operating results, we may require the borrower to pledge accounts receivable, inventory, property, or equipment. Government agency guarantee may be required. Personal guarantees and/or life insurance beneficiary assignments are generally required from the owners of closely held corporations, partnerships, and sole proprietorships. In addition, we may require annual financial statements, prepare cash flow analyses, and review credit reports.. 
 We entered into a mortgage purchase program in 2016 with a financial institution where we participate in advances to mortgage brokers. The mortgage brokers originate residential mortgage loans with the intent to sell them on the secondary market. We participate in the advance to the mortgage broker, which is secured by the underlying mortgage loan, until it is ultimately sold on the secondary market. As such, the average life of each participated advance is approximately 20-30 days. Funds from the sale of the loan are used to pay off our participation in the advance to the mortgage broker. We classify these advances as commercial loans and include the outstanding balance in commercial loans on our consolidated balance sheets. Under the participation agreement, we currently are not committed to participate. 
 We offer adjustable rate mortgages, construction loans, and fixed rate residential real estate loans which have amortization periods up to a maximum of years. We consider the anticipated direction of interest rates, balance sheet duration, the sensitivity of our balance sheet to changes in interest rates, our liquidity needs, and overall loan demand to determine whether or not to sell fixed rate loans to Freddie Mac. 
 Our lending policies generally limit the maximum loan-to-value ratio on residential real estate loans to of the lower of the appraised value of the property or the purchase price. Private mortgage insurance is typically required on loans with loan-to-value ratios in excess of unless the loan qualifies for government guarantees.

 Appraisals are performed by independent appraisers and are reviewed for appropriateness. Generally, mortgage loan requests are reviewed by our mortgage loan committee or through a secondary market underwriting system; loans in excess of require the approval of our Internal Loan Committee, the Executive Loan Committee, the Board of Directors Loan Committee, or the Board of Directors. 
 Consumer loans include secured and unsecured personal loans. Loans are amortized for a period of up to years based on the age and value of the underlying collateral. The underwriting emphasis is on a borrower s perceived intent and ability to pay rather than collateral value. No consumer loans are sold to the secondary market. 
 . With no historical losses on advances to mortgage brokers, there is no allocation related to this portfolio. The unallocated component of the allowance reflects the margin of imprecision inherent in the underlying assumptions used in the methodologies for estimating specific and general losses in the portfolio. 
 While we have experienced fluctuations in credit quality indicators in recent periods, credit quality remained strong at December 31, 2022. The COVID-19 pandemic led to the temporary and some permanent closures of businesses throughout the communities in which we serve, which also led to increased unemployment. We increased the ALLL during 2020 as a result of increased economic and environmental related risk factors, primarily driven by COVID-19. While these risk factors remain, improvement in credit quality indicators resulted in a reduction to the ALLL during 2021. There have been no material changes to the ALLL and credit quality remained strong throughout 2022.

The Notes will initially bear a fixed interest rate of 3.25 until June 15, 2026, after which time until maturity on June 15, 2031, the interest rate will reset quarterly to an annual floating rate equal to the then-current 3-month SOFR plus 256 basis points. The Notes are redeemable by us at our option, in whole or in part, on or after June 15, 2026. The Notes are not subject to redemption at the option of the holders.

 Commercial and standby letters of credit Commitments to grant loans Total 
 Unfunded commitments under lines of credit are commitments for possible future extensions of credit to existing customers. These commitments may expire without being drawn upon and do not necessarily represent future cash requirements. Advances to mortgage brokers are also included in unfunded commitments under lines of credit. The unfunded commitment amount is the difference between our outstanding balances and maximum outstanding aggregate amount. 
 Commitments to grant loans are agreements to lend to a customer as long as there is no violation of any condition established in the contract. Commitments generally have fixed expiration dates or other termination clauses and may require payment of a fee. The amount of collateral obtained, if it is deemed necessary, is based on management's credit evaluation of the customer. Commitments to grant loans include residential mortgage loans that may be committed to be sold to the secondary market. 
 Commercial and standby letters of credit are conditional commitments we issued to guarantee the performance of a customer to a third party. Those guarantees are primarily issued to support private borrowing arrangements, including commercial paper, bond financing, and similar transactions. These commitments to extend credit and letters of credit generally mature within . The credit risk involved in these transactions is essentially the same as that involved in extending loans to customers. We evaluate each customer s credit worthiness on a case-by-case basis. The amount of collateral obtained, if deemed necessary upon the extension of credit, is based on our credit evaluation of the borrower. While we consider standby letters of credit to be

 and at December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. 
 Forward Loan Sale Commitments 
 To protect against the price risk inherent in derivative loan commitments, we utilize both mandatory delivery and best efforts forward loan sale commitments to mitigate the risk of potential decreases in the values of loan that would result from the exercise of the derivative loan commitments. 
 With a mandatory delivery contract, we commit to deliver a certain principal amount of mortgage loans to an investor at a specified price on or before a specified date. If we fail to deliver the amount of mortgages necessary to fulfill the commitment by the specified date, we are obligated to pay a pair-off fee, based on then current market prices, to the investor to compensate the investor for the shortfall. 
 With a best efforts contract, we commit to deliver an individual mortgage loan of a specified principal amount and quality to an investor if the loan to the underlying borrower closes. Generally, the price the investor will pay the seller for an individual loan is specified prior to the loan being funded (e.g. on the same day the lender commits to lend funds to a potential borrower). 
 We expect that these forward loan sale commitments will experience changes in fair value opposite to the change in fair value of derivative loan commitments. The notional amount of undesignated forward loan sale commitments was and at December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. The fair value of these forward loan sale commitments was and at December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. 
 The fair values of the rate lock loan commitments related to the origination of mortgage loans that will be held for sale and the forward loan sale commitments are deemed insignificant by management and, accordingly, are not recorded in our consolidated financial statements. 
 Other Matters 
 Correspondent banks may require us to maintain minimum cash reserve balances. The reserve balances related to correspondent banks amounted to for the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021. 
 Banking regulations limit the transfer of assets in the form of dividends, loans, or advances from the Bank to the Corporation. At December 31, 2022, substantially all of the Bank s assets were restricted from transfer to the Corporation in the form of loans or advances. Bank dividends are the principal source of funds for the Corporation. Payment of dividends without regulatory approval is limited to the current year s retained net income plus retained net income for the preceding two years, less any required transfers to common stock. At January 1, 2023, the amount available to the Corporation for dividends from the Bank, without regulatory approval, was approximately .

 During 2022, 2021 and 2020, settlement losses of , and were recognized in connection with lump-sum benefit distributions, respectively. Many plan participants elect to receive their retirement benefit payments in the form of lump-sum settlements. Pro rata settlement losses, which can occasionally occur as a result of these lump-sum distributions, are recognized only in years when the total of such distributions exceed the sum of the service and interest expense components of net periodic benefit cost.

 As a result of the curtailment of the Plan, there is no rate of compensation increase considered in the above assumptions. 
 The expected long-term rate of return is an estimate of anticipated future long-term rates of return on plan assets as measured on a market value basis. Factors considered in arriving at this assumption include: 
 Historical long-term rates of return for broad asset classes. 
 Actual past rates of return achieved by the plan. 
 The general mix of assets held by the plan. 
 The stated investment policy for the plan. 
 The selected rate of return is net of anticipated investment related expenses. 
 Pension Plan Assets 
 Our overall investment strategy is to moderately grow the portfolio by investing of the portfolio in equity securities and in fixed income securities. This strategy is designed to generate a long-term rate of return of 6.00 . Equity securities primarily consist of the S P 500 Index with a smaller allocation to the Small Cap and International Index. Fixed income securities are invested in the Bond Market Index. The plan has appropriate assets invested in short-term investments to meet near term benefit payments. 
 The asset mix and the sector weighting of the investments are determined by our benefits committee, which is comprised of members of our management. To manage the plan, we retain a third party investment advisor to conduct consultations. We review the performance of the advisor at least annually.

 The following is a description of the valuation methodologies used for assets measured at fair value. There have been no changes in the methodologies used at December 31, 2022 and 2021: 
 Short-term investments: Shares of a money market portfolio valued at amortized cost, which approximates fair value. 
 Common collective trusts: These investments are public investment securities valued using the NAV provided by a third party investment advisor. The NAV is quoted on a private market that is not active; however, the unit price is based on underlying investments which are traded on an active market. 
 We anticipate contributions to the plan in 2023 to approximate net contribution costs. 
 2024 2025 2026 2027 2028 - 2032 
 Directors Plan 
 Pursuant to the terms of the Directors Plan, our directors are required to invest at least 25 of their board fees in our common stock. These stock investments can be made either through deferred fees or through the purchase of shares through the Dividend Reinvestment Plan. Deferred fees, under the Directors Plan, are converted on a quarterly basis into stock units of our common stock based on the fair value of a share of our common stock as of the relevant valuation date. Stock units credited to a participant s account are eligible for stock and cash dividends as declared. Dividend Reinvestment Plan shares are purchased pursuant to the Dividend Reinvestment Plan. 
 Distribution of deferred fees from the Directors Plan occurs when the participant retires from the Board of Directors or upon the occurrence of certain other events. The participant is eligible to receive a distribution in the form of shares of our common stock of all of the stock units that are then in his or her account, and any unconverted cash will be converted to and rounded up to whole shares of stock and distributed, as well. The Directors Plan does not allow for cash settlement, and therefore, such share-based payment awards qualify for classification as equity. We may use authorized but unissued shares or purchase shares of common stock on the open market to meet our obligations under the Directors Plan. 
 We maintain the Rabbi Trust to fund the Directors Plan. The Rabbi Trust is an irrevocable grantor trust to which we may contribute assets for the limited purpose of funding a nonqualified deferred compensation plan. Although we may not use the assets of the Rabbi Trust for any purpose other than meeting our obligations under the Directors Plan, the assets of the Rabbi Trust remain subject to the claims of our creditors and are included in the consolidated financial statements. We may contribute cash or common stock to the Rabbi Trust from time to time for the sole purpose of funding the Directors Plan. The Rabbi Trust will use any cash that we contribute to purchase shares of our common stock on the open market. Shares held in the Rabbi Trust are included in the calculation of earnings per share.

 Cash Incentive Plans 
 Executive Cash Incentive Plan 
 We provide an executive cash incentive plan, which provides separate potential payouts for Isabella Bank's CEO, President, and CFO based on achievement of personal and corporate goals. The potential payouts under the plan range from 20 to 30 of the employee's annual salary. Expenses related to this plan for 2022, 2021, and 2020 were , , and respectively. 
 Employee Cash Incentive Plan 
 We provide cash incentive plans to reward employees above and beyond their base salaries when our performance and operating profitability exceed established annual targets. Incentives are also awarded for achievement of personal performance goals. Expenses related to this plan for 2022, 2021 and 2020 were , , and , respectively. 
 Restricted Stock Plan 
 Under the RSP, an equity based bonus plan, we may award restricted stock bonuses to eligible employees on an annual basis that are not fully transferable or vested until certain conditions are met. Currently, the eligible employees are the Bank's CEO, President and CFO. The RSP authorizes the issuance of unvested restricted stock to an eligible employee with a maximum award ranging from to of the employee s annual salary, on a calendar year basis. The employee must also satisfy the annual performance targets and measures established by the Board of Directors. If these grant conditions are not satisfied, then the award of restricted shares will lapse or be adjusted appropriately, at the discretion of the Board of Directors. All Grant Agreements contain vesting conditions and clawback provisions.

 The losses recognized for December 31, 2021 and 2020 related to our joint venture investment in CSS, which was sold during the fourth quarter of 2020.

As such, we did not recognize a deferred tax asset as of December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020 related to our investment and capital loss in CSS.

 Note 17 
 Following is a description of the valuation methodologies, key inputs, and an indication of the level of the fair value hierarchy in which the assets or liabilities are classified. 
 AFS securities: AFS securities are recorded at fair value on a recurring basis. Level 1 fair value measurement is based upon quoted prices for identical instruments. Level 2 fair value measurement is based upon quoted prices for similar instruments. If quoted prices are not available, fair values are measured using independent pricing models or other model based valuation techniques such as the present value of future cash flows, adjusted for the security s credit rating, prepayment assumptions and other factors such as credit loss and liquidity assumptions. The values for Level 1 and Level 2 investment securities are generally obtained from an independent third party. On a quarterly basis, we compare the values provided to alternative pricing sources. 
 Loans: We do not record loans at fair value on a recurring basis. However, some loans are classified as impaired and a specific allowance for loan losses may be established. Loans for which it is probable that payment of interest and principal will be significantly different than the contractual terms of the original loan agreement are considered impaired. Once a loan is identified as impaired, we measure the estimated impairment. The fair value of impaired loans is estimated using one of several methods, including the present value of expected future cash flows discounted at the loan s effective interest rate, or the fair value of the collateral, less costs to sell, if the loan is collateral dependent. Those impaired loans not requiring an allowance represent loans for which the fair value of the expected repayments or collateral exceed the recorded investments in such loans. 
 We review the net realizable values of the underlying collateral for collateral dependent impaired loans on at least a quarterly basis for all loan types. To determine the collateral value, we utilize independent appraisals, broker price opinions, or internal evaluations. We review these valuations to determine whether an additional discount should be applied given the age of market information that may have been considered as well as other factors such as costs to sell an asset if it is determined that the collateral will be liquidated in connection with the ultimate settlement of the loan. We use these valuations to determine if any specific reserves or charge-offs are necessary. We may obtain new valuations in certain circumstances, including when there has been significant deterioration in the condition of the collateral, if the foreclosure process has begun, or if the existing valuation is deemed to be outdated.

 Discounted value Cash crop inventory Livestock Accounts receivable Liquor license 
 Collateral discount rates may have ranges to accommodate differences in the age of the independent appraisal, broker price opinion, or internal evaluation. 
 OMSR: OMSR (which are included in other assets) are subject to impairment testing. To test for impairment, we utilize a discounted cash flow analysis using interest rates and prepayment speed assumptions currently quoted for comparable instruments and discount rates. If the valuation model reflects a value less than the carrying value, OMSR are adjusted to fair value through a valuation allowance as determined by the model. As such, we classify OMSR subject to nonrecurring fair value adjustments as Level 2. 
 The preceding methods described may produce a fair value calculation that may not be indicative of net realizable value or reflective of future fair values. Although we believe our valuation methods are appropriate and consistent with other market participants, the use of different methodologies or assumptions to determine the fair value of certain financial instruments could result in a different fair value measurement. 
 Estimated Fair Values of Financial Instruments Not Recorded at Fair Value in their Entirety on a Recurring Basis 
 Disclosure of the estimated fair values of financial instruments, which differ from carrying values, often requires the use of estimates. In cases where quoted market values in an active market are not available, we use present value techniques and other valuation methods to estimate the fair values of our financial instruments. These valuation methods require considerable judgment and the resulting estimates of fair value can be significantly affected by the assumptions made and methods used.

 DISCLOSURE CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES 
 We carried out an evaluation, under the supervision and with the participation of the Principal Executive Officer and Principal Financial Officer, of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures (as such term is defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15(d)-15(e) under the Exchange Act) as of December 31, 2022, pursuant to Exchange Act Rule 13a-15. Based upon that evaluation, the Principal Executive Officer and Principal Financial Officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures as of December 31, 2022, were effective to ensure that information required to be disclosed in reports that we file or submit under the Exchange Act are recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in SEC rules and forms. 
 CHANGES IN INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING 
 We also conducted an evaluation of internal control over financial reporting to determine whether any changes occurred during the quarter ended December 31, 2022, that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting. Based on this evaluation, we have concluded that there have been no such changes during the quarter ended December 31, 2022. 
 Management s Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting 
 We are responsible for the preparation and integrity of our published consolidated financial statements. The consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America and, accordingly, include amounts based on judgments and estimates. We also prepared the other information included in the Annual Report on Form 10-K and are responsible for the accuracy and consistency with the consolidated financial statements. 
 We are responsible for establishing and maintaining a system of internal control over financial reporting, which is intended to provide reasonable assurance to our management and Board of Directors regarding the reliability of our consolidated financial statements. The system includes but is not limited to: 
 A documented organizational structure and division of responsibility; 
 Established policies and procedures, including a code of conduct to foster a strong ethical climate which is communicated throughout our Corporation; 
 Internal auditors that monitor the operation of the internal control system and report findings and recommendations to management and the Audit Committee; 
 Procedures for taking action in response to an internal audit finding or recommendation; 
 Regular reviews of our consolidated financial statements by qualified individuals; and 
 The careful selection, training and development of our people. 
 There are inherent limitations in the effectiveness of any system of internal control, including the possibility of human error and the circumvention or overriding of controls. Also, the effectiveness of an internal control system may change over time. We have implemented a system of internal control that was designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of consolidated financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. 
 We have assessed our internal control system in relation to criteria for effective internal control over financial reporting described in Internal Control-Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations (2013 framework) of the Treadway Commission. 
 Based upon these criteria, we believe that, as of December 31, 2022, our system of internal control over financial reporting was effective. 
 Our independent registered public accounting firm, Rehmann Robson LLC ("Rehmann"), has audited our 2022 consolidated financial statements and our internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2022. Rehmann was given unrestricted access to all financial records and related data, including minutes of all meetings of stockholders, the Board of Directors and committees of the Board of Directors.

These stock investments can be made either through deferred fees or through the purchase of shares through the Dividend Reinvestment Plan. Deferred fees, under the Directors Plan, are converted on a quarterly basis into stock units of our common stock based on the fair value of a share of our common stock as of the relevant valuation date. Stock units credited to a participant s account are eligible for stock and cash dividends as declared. Dividend Reinvestment Plan shares are purchased pursuant to the Dividend Reinvestment Plan. 
 Distribution of deferred fees from the Directors Plan occurs when the participant retires from the Board of Directors or upon the occurrence of certain other events. The participant is eligible to receive a distribution in the form of shares of our common stock of all of the stock units that are then in his or her account, and any unconverted cash will be converted to and rounded up to whole shares of stock and distributed, as well. The Directors Plan does not allow for cash settlement, and therefore, such share-based payment awards qualify for classification as equity. We may use authorized but unissued shares or purchase shares of common stock on the open market to meet our obligations under the Directors Plan. 
 (2) The RSP is an equity-based bonus plan. Under the plan, we may award restricted stock bonuses to eligible employees on an annual basis that are not fully transferable. Currently, the eligible employees are Isabella Bank's CEO, President, and CFO. The RSP authorizes the issuance of unvested restricted stock to an eligible employee with a maximum award ranging from 25

 to 40 of the employee s annual salary, on a calendar year basis. The employee must also satisfy the annual performance targets and measures established by the Board of Directors. If these grant conditions are not satisfied, then the award of restricted shares will lapse or be adjusted appropriately, at the discretion of the Board of Directors. Awards are converted to shares upon payment to the participant based on the market value of our common stock on the date of award. 
 (3) As of December 31, 2022, the Directors Plan had 207,840 shares eligible to be distributed under the Directors Plan. The Rabbi Trust holds 154,879 shares for the benefit of participants pursuant to the Directors Plan. Accordingly, such shares are not included in the number of securities issuable in column (A). 
 (4) This amount includes shares subject to outstanding stock awards at the maximum amount of shares issuable under such awards. However, payout of incentive awards is contingent on the individual and the Corporation reaching certain levels of performance. If the performance criteria for these awards are not fully satisfied, the award recipient will receive less than the maximum number of shares eligible under these grants and may receive nothing from these grants. Additionally, this amount assumes the closing price of our common stock as of the award grant dates for purposes of the conversion from awards to common stock. 
 (5) The Directors Plan and the RSP do not have an exercise price. 
 (6) There is no maximum number of shares available for issuance under the Directors Plan and the RSP has a maximum number of 100,000 shares.
