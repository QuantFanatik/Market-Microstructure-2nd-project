 The Fund s principal business is to invest as a limited partner in other limited partnerships (the Operating Partnerships each of which will own or lease and will operate an apartment complex exclusively or partially for low- and moderate-income tenants. Each Operating Partnership in which the Fund will invest will own apartment complexes which are completed, newly-constructed, under construction or rehabilitation, or to-be constructed or rehabilitated, and which are expected to receive government assistance. Each apartment complex is expected to qualify for the low-income housing tax credit under Section 42 of the Internal Revenue Code (the Federal Housing Tax Credit ), providing tax benefits over a period of ten to twelve years in the form of tax credits which investors may use to offset income, subject to strict limitations, from other sources. Some apartment complexes may also qualify for the historic rehabilitation tax credit under Section 47 of the Internal Revenue Code (the Rehabilitation Tax Credit ). Section 236 (f) (ii) of the National Housing Act, as amended, and of the Housing and Urban Development Act of 1965, as amended, each provide for the making by The Department of Housing and Urban Development HUD of rent supplement payments to low income tenants in properties which receive other forms of federal assistance such as tax credits. The payments for each tenant, which are made directly to the owner of their property, generally are in such amounts as to enable the tenant to pay rent equal to 30 of the adjusted family income. Some of the apartment complexes in which the Fund has invested are receiving such rent supplements from HUD. HUD has been in the process of converting rent supplement assistance to assistance paid not to the owner of the apartment complex, but directly to the individuals. At this time, the Fund is unable to predict whether Congress will continue rent supplement programs payable directly to owners of the apartment complex. As of December 31, 2022, the Fund has investments in 0 Operating Partnerships on behalf of Series 20, 0 Operating Partnerships on behalf of Series 21, 0 Operating Partnerships on behalf of Series 22, 0 Operating Partnerships on behalf of Series 23, 0 Operating Partnerships on behalf of Series 24, 0 Operating Partnerships on behalf of Series 25, 0 Operating Partnerships on behalf of Series 26, 0 Operating Partnerships on behalf of Series 27, 0 Operating Partnerships on behalf of Series 28, 1 Operating Partnership on behalf of Series 29, 0 Operating Partnerships on behalf of Series 30, 0 Operating Partnerships on behalf of Series 31, 0 Operating Partnerships on behalf of Series 32, 0 Operating Partnerships on behalf of Series 33, 1 Operating Partnership on behalf of Series 34, 0 Operating Partnerships on behalf of Series 35, 0 Operating Partnerships on behalf of Series 36, 0 Operating Partnerships on behalf of Series 37, 0 Operating Partnerships on behalf of Series 38, 0 Operating Partnerships on behalf of Series 39, 0 Operating Partnerships on behalf of Series 40, 0 Operating Partnerships on behalf of Series 41, 0 Operating Partnerships on behalf of Series 42, 0 Operating Partnerships on behalf of Series 43, 0 Operating Partnerships on behalf of Series 44, 0 Operating Partnerships on behalf of Series 45 and 3 Operating Partnerships on behalf of Series 46. The business objectives of the Fund are to: (1) provide current tax benefits to investors in the form of Federal Housing Tax Credits and, in limited instances, a small amount of Rehabilitation Tax Credits, which an investor may apply, subject to various strict limitations, against the investor s federal income tax liability from active, portfolio and passive income; (2) preserve and protect the Fund s capital and provide capital appreciation and cash distributions through increases in value of the Fund s investments and, to the extent applicable, equity buildup through periodic payments on the mortgage indebtedness with respect to the apartment complexes; (3) provide tax benefits in the form of passive losses which an investor may apply to offset his passive income (if any); and (4) provide cash distributions (except with respect to the Fund s investment in some non-profit Operating Partnerships) from capital transaction proceeds. The Operating Partnerships intend to hold the apartment complexes for appreciation in value. The Operating Partnerships may sell the apartment complexes after a period of time if financial conditions in the future make sales desirable and if sales are permitted by government restrictions.

(b) Management s Annual Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting 
 Management of the Assignor Limited Partner is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rule 13a-15(f) under the Exchange Act). The Assignor Limited Partner s internal control system over financial reporting is designed to provide reasonable assurance to the Assignor Limited Partner s management regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes of accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. Due to inherent limitations, an internal control system over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Therefore, even those systems determined to be effective can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving their control objectives. As required by Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, management conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of the Assignor Limited Partner s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2022. In making this assessment, management used the criteria set forth by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO) in Internal Control-Integrated Framework (2013).

 REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM To the President and Chief Financial Officer BCTC IV Assignor Corp. Opinion on the Financial Statements We have audited the accompanying balance sheets of BCTC IV Assignor Corp. (the Company as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, and the related notes (collectively referred to as the financial statements ). In our opinion, the financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of December 31, 2022 and 2021 in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. Basis for Opinion These financial statements are the responsibility of the Company s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company s financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal security laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. The Company is not required to have, nor were we engaged to perform, an audit of its internal control over financial reporting. As part of our audits we are required to obtain an understanding of internal control over financial reporting but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Company s internal control over financial reporting. Accordingly, we express no such opinion. Our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe that our audits of the balance sheets provide a reasonable basis for our opinion. Critical Audit Matters Critical audit matters are matters arising from the current period audit of the financial statements that were communicated or required to be communicated to those charged with governance and that: (1) relate to accounts or disclosures that are material to the financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. We determined that there are no critical audit matters. 

/s/ We have served as the Company s auditor since 2002. March 22, 2023
