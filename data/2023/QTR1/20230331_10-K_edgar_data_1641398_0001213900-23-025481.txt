PART I 

Item 1. Business 

Overview 

GD Culture Group Limited GDC 
or the Company , formerly known as JM Global Holding Company, TMSR Holding Company Limited and Code Chain New Continent
Limited) is a holding company with no material operations of its own. We currently conduct business through Shanghai Highlight Media Co.,
Ltd. Highlight Media ). Highlight WFOE is the primary beneficiary of Highlight Media for accounting purposes, because, pursuant
to certain VIE agreements between Highlight WFOE, Highlight Media and shareholders of Highlight Media, Highlight Media shall pay Highlight
WFOE service fees in the amount of 100 of Highlight Media s net income, while Highlight WFOE is obligated to absorb all of losses
of Highlight Media. As a result, we consolidate the financial results of Highlight Media in our consolidated financial statements under
U.S. GAAP. Such VIE structure involves unique risks to investors. The VIE agreements have not been tested in a court of law and the Chinese
regulatory authorities could disallow this VIE structure, which would likely result in a material change in our operations and the value
of our securities, including that it could cause the value of such securities to significantly decline or become worthless. For more details
on the VIE structure, please see Item 1. Business Corporate Structure - Contractual Arrangements between Highlight Media
and Highlight WFOE and Item 1A. Risk Factors Risks Related to Our Corporate Structure . 

Highlight Media, founded in
2016, is an integrated marketing service agency, focusing on serving businesses in China in connection with brand management, image building,
public relations, social media management and event planning. Highlight Media is committed to becoming a modern technology media organization
that provide clients with customized services. Its growth strategy is substantially dependent upon our ability to market our intended
products and services successfully to prospective clients in China. This requires that we heavily rely upon our sales and marketing team
and marketing partners. Failure to reach potential clients will significantly affect our results of operation and could have a material
adverse effect on our business, financial conditions and the results of our operations. 

Prior to September 28, 2022, we were also engaged in research, development
and application of Internet of Things (IoT) and electronic tokens Wuge digital door signs through Wuge Network Games Co., Ltd. Wuge ),
a then VIE of the Company. On September 28, 2022, the Company entered into a termination agreement with Wuge and the shareholders of Wuge,
i.e., Wei Xu, former Chief Executive Officer, President and Chairman of the Board of the Company, and Bibo Lin, former Vice President
and Director of the Company, and two entities controlled by Wei Xu, to terminate certain technical consultation and services agreement.,
equity pledge agreement, equity option agreement, voting rights proxy and financial support agreement, by and among Makesi WFOE, Wuge and the shareholders of Wuge. As a result, Wuge ceased to be a VIE of Makesi WFOE and operations of Wuge have been designated as discontinued
operations. In exchange for such termination, on March 9, 2023, the Company cancelled 133,333 shares of common stock, after giving effect
to the 1-to-30 reverse stock split which became effective on November 9, 2022 (see Corporate History and Structure 
Reverse Stock Split for more details) that were issued to the shareholders of Wuge in January 2020.

Agreements and the Assignment Agreements grant Highlight WFOE with the power, rights and obligations equivalent in all material respects
to those it would possess as the sole equity holder of Highlight Media, including absolute rights to control the management, operations,
assets, property and revenue of Highlight Media. The assignment does not have any impact on Company s consolidated financial statements. 

Impact of the COVID-19 Pandemic 

The COVID-19 pandemic did
not have a material impact on our business or results of operation during the fiscal years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021. However,
the extent to which the COVID-19 pandemic may negatively impact the general economy and our business is highly uncertain and cannot be
accurately predicted. These uncertainties may impede our ability to conduct our operations and could materially and adversely affect our
business, financial condition and results of operations, and as a result could adversely affect our stock price and create more volatility. 

Recent Regulatory Developments 

On January 4, 2022, the Cyberspace
Administration of China, or CAC, issued the revised Measures on Cyberspace Security Review (the Revised Measures ), which
came into effect on February 15, 2022. Under the Revised Measures, any network platform operator controlling personal information
of no less than one million users which seeks to list in a foreign stock exchange should also be subject to cyber security review. 

We believe neither Highlight
Media is not a network platform operator who control over one million personal information as mentioned above, given that:
(i) Highlight Media does not possess a large amount of personal information in our business operations and (ii) data processed in Highlight
Media s business does not have a bearing on national security and thus may not be classified as core or important data by the authorities.
As such, we believe Highlight Media is not currently subject to the cyber security review by the CAC. However, the definition of
 network platform operator is unclear and it is also unclear on how it will be interpreted and implemented by the relevant
PRC governmental authorities. See Risk factors Risk Factors Related to Doing Business in China Highlight
Media may become subject to a variety of laws and regulations in the PRC regarding privacy, data security, cybersecurity, and data protection.
Highlight Media may be required to suspend its business, be liable for improper use or appropriation of personal information provided
by our customers or face other penalties.

On July 6, 2021, the relevant
PRC governmental authorities made public the Opinions on Strictly Cracking Down Illegal Securities Activities in Accordance with the Law.
These opinions emphasized the need to strengthen the administration over illegal securities activities and the supervision on overseas
listings by China-based companies and proposed to take effective measures, such as promoting the construction of relevant regulatory systems
to deal with the risks and incidents faced by China-based overseas-listed companies. As these opinions are recently issued, official guidance
and related implementation rules have not been issued yet and the interpretation of these opinions remains unclear at this stage. As of
the date of this annual report, we have not received any inquiry, notice, warning, or sanctions regarding listing abroad or offshore offering
from the China Securities Regulatory Commission CSRC or any other PRC governmental authorities. See Risk Factors Risk
Factors Related to Doing Business in China The Chinese government exerts substantial influence over the manner in which
we must conduct our business activities. We are currently not required to obtain approval from Chinese authorities to list on U.S
exchanges, however, if Highlight Media or GDC were required to obtain approval in the future and were denied permission from Chinese authorities
to list on U.S. exchanges, we will not be able to continue listing on U.S. exchange and the value of our common stock may significantly
decline or become worthless, which would materially affect the interest of the investors. 

On December 24, 2021, CSRC
issued Provisions of the State Council on the Administration of Overseas Securities Offering and Listing by Domestic Companies (Draft
for Comments) (the Administration Provisions ), and the Administrative Measures for the Filing of Overseas Securities Offering
and Listing by Domestic Companies (the Measures ), which are open for public comments by January 23, 2022. The Administration
Provisions and Measures for overseas listings lay out specific requirements for filing documents and include unified regulation management,
strengthening regulatory coordination, and cross-border regulatory cooperation. Domestic companies seeking to list abroad must carry out
relevant security screening procedures if their businesses involve supervisions such as foreign investment security and cyber security
reviews. Companies endangering national security are among those off-limits for overseas listings. According to Relevant Officials of
the CSRC Answered Reporter Questions CSRC Answers ), after the Administration Provisions and Measures are implemented upon
completion of public consultation and due legislative procedures, the CSRC will formulate and issue guidance for filing procedures to
further specify the details of filing administration and ensure that market entities could refer to clear guidelines for filing, which
means it will still take time to put the Administration Provisions and Measures into effect. As the Administration Provisions and Measures
have not yet come into effect, we are currently unaffected by them. However, according to CSRC Answers, only new initial public offerings
and refinancing by existing overseas listed Chinese companies will be required to go through the filing process; other existing overseas
listed companies will be allowed a sufficient transition period to complete their filing procedure. However, it is uncertain when the
Administration Provision and the Measures will take effect or if they will take effect as currently drafted. 

On February 17, 2023, the CSRC released
the Trial Administrative Measures for Administration of Overseas Securities Offerings and Listings by Domestic Companies (the Trial
Measures and five supporting guidelines, which came into effect on March 31, 2023. Pursuant to the Trial Measures, domestic
companies that seek to offer or list securities overseas, both directly and indirectly, should fulfill the filing procedures and report
relevant information to the CSRC. If a domestic company fails to complete the filing procedures or conceals any material fact or
falsifies any major content in its filing documents, such domestic company may be subject to administrative penalties by the CSRC,
such as order to rectify, warnings, fines, and its controlling shareholders, actual controllers, the person directly in charge and other
directly liable persons may also be subject to administrative penalties, such as warnings and fines. As a listed company, we believe that
we, all of our PRC subsidiaries and the consolidated VIEs are not required to fulfill filing procedures with the CSRC to continue
to offer our securities, or continue listing on the Nasdaq Capital Market, or operate business of the consolidated VIEs as of the date
of this annual report. However, there are substantial uncertainties regarding the interpretation and application of the Regulation on
Mergers and Acquisitions of Domestic Companies by Foreign Investors M A Rules ), other PRC Laws and future PRC laws
and regulations, and there can be no assurance that any governmental agency will not take a view that is contrary to or otherwise different
from our belief stated herein. See Risk Factors - Risk Factors Relating to Doing Business in China - The CSRC has
released the Trial Measures for Administration of Overseas Securities Offerings and Listings by Domestic Companies (the Trial Measures ).
While such rules have not yet gone into effect, the Chinese government may exert more oversight and control over offerings that are conducted
overseas and foreign investment in China-based issuers, which could significantly limit or completely hinder our ability to continue to
offer our securities to investors and could cause the value of our securities to significantly decline or become worthless. 

We believe that we are currently
not required to obtain any permission or approval from the CSRC and the CAC in the PRC to issue securities to foreign investors. However,
there is no guarantee that this will continue to be the case in the future in relation to any future offerings of our company or the continued
listing of our company s securities on the Nasdaq Capital Market, or even in the event such permission or approval is required and
obtained, it will not be subsequently revoked or rescinded. If we do not receive or maintain the approvals, or we inadvertently conclude
that such approvals are not required, or applicable laws, regulations, or interpretations change such that we are required to obtain approval
in the future, we may be subject to an investigation by competent regulators, fines or penalties, or an order prohibiting us from conducting
an offering, and these risks could result in a material adverse change in our operations and the value of our securities, significantly
limit or completely hinder our ability to offer or continue to offer securities to investors, or cause such securities to significantly
decline in value or become worthless.

Implication of the Holding Foreign Company
Accountable Act 

The Holding Foreign Companies
Accountable Act, or the HFCAA, was enacted on December 18, 2020. The HFCAA states that if the SEC determines that an issuer s
audit reports issued by a registered public accounting firm have not been subject to inspection by the PCAOB for three consecutive years
beginning in 2021, the SEC shall prohibit such issuer s securities from being traded on a national securities exchange or in the
over-the-counter trading market in the United States. On March 24, 2021, the SEC adopted interim final rules relating to the implementation
of certain disclosure and documentation requirements of the HFCAA. We will be required to comply with these rules if the SEC identifies
us as having a non-inspection year under a process to be subsequently established by the SEC. If we fail to meet the new
rules before the deadline specified thereunder, we could face possible prohibition from trading on the OTCQB, deregistration from the
SEC and/or other risks, which may materially and adversely affect, or effectively terminate, our securities trading in the United States.
On December 2, 2021, the SEC issued amendments to finalize rules implementing the submission and disclosure requirements in the HFCAA.
The rules apply to registrants that the SEC identifies as having filed an annual report with an audit report issued by a registered public
accounting firm that is located in a foreign jurisdiction and that PCAOB is unable to inspect or investigate completely because of a position
taken by an authority in foreign jurisdictions. Furthermore, on June 22, 2021, the U.S. Senate passed the Accelerating Holding Foreign
Companies Accountable Act, and on December 29, 2022, legislation entitled Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2023 (the
 Consolidated Appropriations Act was signed into law by President Biden, which contained, among other things, an identical
provision to the Accelerating Holding Foreign Companies Accountable Act and amended the HFCAA by requiring the SEC to prohibit an issuer s
securities from trading on any U.S. stock exchanges if its auditor is not subject to PCAOB inspections for two consecutive years instead
of three, thus reducing the time period for triggering the prohibition on trading. On August 26, 2022, the CSRC, the Ministry of Finance
of the PRC (the MOF ), and the PCAOB signed a Statement of Protocol (the Protocol ), governing inspections and
investigations of audit firms based in mainland China and Hong Kong, taking the first step toward opening access for the PCAOB to inspect
and investigate registered public accounting firms headquartered in mainland China and Hong Kong. Pursuant to the fact sheet with respect
to the Protocol disclosed by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (the SEC ), the PCAOB shall have independent discretion
to select any issuer audits for inspection or investigation and has the unfettered ability to transfer information to the SEC. On December
15, 2022, the PCAOB Board determined that the PCAOB was able to secure complete access to inspect and investigate registered public accounting
firms headquartered in mainland China and Hong Kong and voted to vacate its previous determinations to the contrary. However, should PRC
authorities obstruct or otherwise fail to facilitate the PCAOB s access in the future, the PCAOB Board will consider the need to
issue a new determination. 

Our auditor prior to
October 2022, WWC, P.C. had been inspected by the PCAOB on a regular basis in the audit period. Our current auditor, Enrome LLP, has
been inspected by the PCAOB on a regular basis as well. If it is later determined that the PCAOB is unable to inspect or investigate
our auditor completely, investors may be deprived of the benefits of such inspection. Any audit reports not issued by auditors that
are completely inspected by the PCAOB, or a lack of PCAOB inspections of audit work undertaken in China that prevents the PCAOB from
regularly evaluating our auditors audits and their quality control procedures, could result in a lack of assurance that our
financial statements and disclosures are adequate and accurate. Moreover, if trading in our securities is prohibited under the HFCAA
in the future because the PCAOB determines that it cannot inspect or fully investigate our auditor at such future time, an exchange
may determine to delist our securities. See Risk Factors Risks Related to Doing Business in China The
recent joint statement by the SEC and PCAOB, proposed rule changes submitted by Nasdaq, and the Holding Foreign Companies
Accountable Act all call for additional and more stringent criteria to be applied to emerging market companies

Nasdaq Compliance 

On May 5, 2022, the Company
received a letter from the Listing Qualifications Department of the Nasdaq Stock Market regarding the Company s failure to comply
with Nasdaq Continued Listing Rule 5550(a)(2), which requires listed securities to maintain a minimum bid price of 1.00 per share. A
failure to comply with Rule 5550(a)(2) exists when listed securities fail to maintain a closing bid price of at least 1.00 per share
for 30 consecutive business days. Based on the closing bid price for the last 30 consecutive business days (including, in particular,
the period March 23, 2022 through May 4, 2022), the Company failed to meet the aforesaid requirement. 

On
November 2, 2022, the Company received a written notice from Nasdaq (stating that, although the Company had not regained compliance with
the minimum bid price requirement by November 1, 2022, in accordance with Nasdaq Listing Rule 5810(c)(3)(A), the Company is
eligible for an additional 180 calendar day period, or until May 1, 2023, to regain compliance with Nasdaq Listing Rule 5550(a)(2). To
regain compliance, the closing bid price of the Company s common stock must meet or exceed 1.00 per share for a minimum of ten
consecutive business days during this 180-day period. 

On
November 28, 2022, the Company received a letter from Nasdaq stating that because the Company s common stock had a closing bid price
at or above 1.00 per share for 10 consecutive business days, the Company had regained compliance with the minimum bid price
requirement of 1.00 per share for continued listing on the Nasdaq Capital Market, as set forth in Nasdaq Listing Rule 5550(a)(2), and
that the matter is now closed. 

Environmental Matters 

As of December 31, 2022, Highlight
Media was not subject to any fines or legal action involving non-compliance with any relevant environmental regulation, nor are we aware
of any threatened or pending action, including by any environmental regulatory authority. 

Governmental Regulations 

Business license 

Any company that conducts
business in the PRC must have a business license that covers a particular type of work. Highlight Media s business license covers
its present business of Book Publishing Planning, Financial Self-Media and Public Relations. Prior to expanding Highlight Media s
business beyond that of its business license, Highlight Media is required to apply and receive approval from the PRC government. 

Employment laws 

We and Highlight Media are
subject to laws and regulations governing our relationship with our employees, including: wage and hour requirements, working and safety
conditions, citizenship requirements, work permits and travel restrictions. These include local labor laws and regulations, which may
require substantial resources for compliance. China s National Labor Law, which became effective on January 1, 1995, and amended
on August 27, 2009, and China s National Labor Contract Law, which became effective on January 1, 2008, and amended on December
28, 2012, permit workers in both state and private enterprises in China to bargain collectively. The National Labor Law and the National
Labor Contract Law provide for collective contracts to be developed through collaboration between the labor union (or worker representatives
in the absence of a union) and management that specify such matters as working conditions, wage scales, and hours of work. The laws also
permit workers and employers in all types of enterprises to sign individual contracts, which are to be drawn up in accordance with the
collective contract.

Intellectual property protection in China 

Patent. The
PRC has domestic laws for the protection of copyrights, patents, trademarks and trade secrets. The PRC is also signatory to some of the
world s major intellectual property conventions, including: 

Convention establishing the World Intellectual Property Organization (WIPO Convention) (June 4, 1980); 

Paris Convention for the Protection of Industrial Property (March 19, 1985); 

Patent Cooperation Treaty (January 1, 1994); and 

The Agreement on Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights (TRIPs) (November 11, 2001). 

Patents in the PRC are governed
by the China Patent Law and its Implementing Regulations, each of which went into effect in 1985. Amended versions of the China Patent
Law and its Implementing Regulations came into effect in 1993, 2001 and 2009, respectively. 

The PRC is signatory to the
Paris Convention for the Protection of Industrial Property, in accordance with which any person who has duly filed an application for
a patent in one signatory country shall enjoy, for the purposes of filing in the other countries, a right of priority during the period
fixed in the convention (12 months for inventions and utility models, and 6 months for industrial designs). 

The Patent Law covers three
kinds of patents patents for inventions, utility models and designs. The Chinese patent system adopts the principle of first to
file, which means that a patent may be granted only to the person who first files an application. Consistent with international practice,
the PRC allows the patenting of inventions or utility models that possess the characteristics of novelty, inventiveness and practical
applicability only. For a design to be patentable it cannot be identical with, or similar to, any design which, before the date of filing,
has been publicly disclosed in publications in the country or abroad or has been publicly used in the country, and should not be in conflict
with any prior right of another. 

Copyright . Copyright
in the PRC, including copyrighted software, is principally protected under the Copyright Law of the PRC and related rules and regulations.
Under the Copyright Law, the term of protection for copyrighted software is 50 years. 

Trademark . Registered
trademarks are protected under the Trademark Law of the PRC and related rules and regulations. Trademarks are registered with the Trademark
Office of the SAIC. Where registration is sought for a trademark that is identical or similar to another trademark which has already been
registered or given preliminary examination and approval for use in the same or similar category of commodities or services, the application
for registration of such trademark may be rejected. Trademark registrations are effective for a renewable ten-year period, unless otherwise
revoked. The duration of a trademark is 10 years from the date of registration. 

Domain names . Domain
name registrations are handled through domain name service agencies established under the relevant regulations, and applicants become
domain name holders upon successful registration.

Regulations on Tax 

PRC Corporate Income Tax 

The PRC corporate income tax,
or CIT, is calculated based on the taxable income determined under the applicable CIT Law and its implementation rules, which became effective
on January 1, 2008 and amended on February 24, 2017. The CIT Law imposes a uniform corporate income tax rate of 25 on all resident enterprises
in China, including foreign-invested enterprises. 

Uncertainties exist with respect
to how the CIT Law applies to the tax residence status of The Company and our offshore subsidiaries. Under the CIT Law, an enterprise
established outside of China with a de facto management body within China is considered a resident enterprise, 
which means that it is treated in a manner similar to a Chinese enterprise for corporate income tax purposes. Although the implementation
rules of the CIT Law define de facto management body as a managing body that exercises substantive and overall management
and control over the production and business, personnel, accounting books and assets of an enterprise, the only official guidance for
this definition currently available is set forth in Circular 82 issued by the State Administration of Taxation, which provides guidance
on the determination of the tax residence status of a Chinese-controlled offshore incorporated enterprise, defined as an enterprise that
is incorporated under the laws of a foreign country or territory and that has a PRC enterprise or enterprise group as its primary controlling
shareholder. Although the Company does not have a PRC enterprise or enterprise group as our primary controlling shareholder and is therefore
not a Chinese-controlled offshore incorporated enterprise within the meaning of Circular 82, in the absence of guidance specifically applicable
to us, we have applied the guidance set forth in Circular 82 to evaluate the tax residence status of The Company and our subsidiaries
organized outside the PRC. 

According to Circular 82,
a Chinese-controlled offshore incorporated enterprise will be regarded as a PRC tax resident by virtue of having a de facto management
body in China and will be subject to PRC corporate income tax on its worldwide income only if all of the following criteria are
met: 

the primary location of the day-to-day operational management is in the PRC; 

decisions relating to the enterprise s financial and human resource matters are made or are subject to approval by organizations or personnel in the PRC; 

the enterprise s primary assets, accounting books and records, company seals, and board and shareholders meeting minutes are located or maintained in the PRC; and 

50 or more of voting board members or senior executives habitually reside in the PRC. 

We do not believe that we
meet any of the conditions outlined in the immediately preceding paragraph. 

We believe none of our entities
outside of China is a PRC resident enterprise for PRC tax purposes. However, the tax resident status of an enterprise is subject to determination
by the PRC tax authorities and uncertainties remain with respect to the interpretation of the term de facto management body. 
As all of our management members are based in China, it remains unclear how the tax residency rule will apply to our case. If the PRC
tax authorities determine that we or any of our subsidiaries outside of China is a PRC resident enterprise for PRC enterprise income tax
purposes, then we or such subsidiary could be subject to PRC tax at a rate of 25 on its world-wide income, which could materially reduce
our net income. In addition, we will also be subject to PRC enterprise income tax reporting obligations. Furthermore, if the PRC tax authorities
determine that we are a PRC resident enterprise for enterprise income tax purposes, gains realized on the sale or other disposition of
our common stock may be subject to PRC tax, at a rate of 10 in the case of non-PRC enterprises or 20 in the case of non-PRC individuals
(in each case, subject to the provisions of any applicable tax treaty), if such gains are deemed to be from PRC sources. It is unclear
whether non-PRC shareholders of our company would be able to claim the benefits of any tax treaties between their country of tax residence
and the PRC in the event that we are treated as a PRC resident enterprise. Any such tax may reduce the returns on your investment in our
common stock. 

Value-Added Tax and Business Tax 

In November 2011, the Ministry
of Finance and the State Administration of Taxation promulgated the Pilot Plan for Imposition of Value-Added Tax to Replace Business Tax.
In May and December 2013 and April 2014, the Ministry of Finance and the State Administration of Taxation promulgated Circular 37, Circular
106 and Circular 43 to further expand the scope of services which are to be subject to Value-Added Tax, or VAT, instead of business tax.
Pursuant to these tax rules, from August 1, 2013, VAT will be imposed to replace the business tax in certain service industries, including
technology services and advertising services, on a nationwide basis. The VAT rate shall be 17 for sale or importation of goods by a taxpayer.
But, unlike business tax, a taxpayer is allowed to offset the qualified input VAT paid on taxable purchases against the output VAT chargeable
on the revenue from services provided.

Regulations Relating to Foreign Exchange and
Dividend Distribution 

Foreign Exchange Regulation 

The principal regulations
governing foreign currency exchange in China are the Foreign Exchange Administration Regulations. Under the PRC foreign exchange regulations,
payments of current account items, such as profit distributions and trade and service-related foreign exchange transactions, may be made
in foreign currencies without prior approval from SAFE by complying with certain procedural requirements. By contrast, approval from or
registration with appropriate government authorities is required where RMB is to be converted into foreign currency and remitted out of
China to pay capital expenses such as the repayment of foreign currency-denominated loans or foreign currency is to be remitted into China
under the capital account, such as a capital increase or foreign currency loans to our PRC subsidiaries. 

In November 2012, SAFE promulgated
the Circular of Further Improving and Adjusting Foreign Exchange Administration Policies on Foreign Direct Investment. Pursuant to this
circular, the opening of various special purpose foreign exchange accounts, such as pre-establishment expenses accounts, foreign exchange
capital accounts and guarantee accounts, the reinvestment of RMB proceeds by foreign investors in the PRC, and remittance of foreign exchange
profits and dividends by a foreign-invested enterprise to its foreign shareholders no longer require the approval or verification of SAFE,
and multiple capital accounts for the same entity may be opened in different provinces, which was not possible previously. In addition,
SAFE promulgated the Circular on Printing and Distributing the Provisions on Foreign Exchange Administration over Domestic Direct Investment
by Foreign Investors and the Supporting Documents in May 2013, which specifies that the administration by SAFE or its local branches over
direct investment by foreign investors in the PRC shall be conducted by way of registration and banks shall process foreign exchange business
relating to the direct investment in the PRC based on the registration information provided by SAFE and its branches. 

We typically do not need to
use our offshore foreign currency to fund our PRC operations. In the event we need to do so, we will apply to obtain the relevant approvals
of SAFE and other PRC government authorities as necessary. 

SAFE Circular 37 

SAFE promulgated the Circular
on Relevant Issues Concerning Foreign Exchange Control on Domestic Residents Offshore Investment and Financing and Roundtrip Investment
through Special Purpose Vehicles, or SAFE Circular 37, on July 4, 2014, which replaced the former circular commonly known as SAFE
Circular 75 promulgated by SAFE on October 21, 2005. SAFE Circular 37 requires PRC residents to register with local branches of
SAFE in connection with their direct establishment or indirect control of an offshore entity, for the purpose of overseas investment and
financing, with such PRC residents legally owned assets or equity interests in domestic enterprises or offshore assets or interests,
referred to in SAFE Circular 37 as a special purpose vehicle. SAFE Circular 37 further requires amendment to the registration
in the event of any significant changes with respect to the special purpose vehicle, such as increase or decrease of capital contributed
by PRC individuals, share transfer or exchange, merger, division or other material event. In the event that a PRC shareholder holding
interests in a special purpose vehicle fails to fulfill the required SAFE registration, the PRC subsidiaries of that special purpose vehicle
may be prohibited from making profit distributions to the offshore parent and from carrying out subsequent cross-border foreign exchange
activities, and the special purpose vehicle may be restricted in its ability to contribute additional capital into its PRC subsidiary.
Furthermore, failure to comply with the various SAFE registration requirements described above could result in liability under PRC law
for evasion of foreign exchange controls. 

We have notified substantial
beneficial owners of common stock who we know are PRC residents of their filing obligation. However, we may not be aware of the identities
of all our beneficial owners who are PRC residents. In addition, we do not have control over our beneficial owners and cannot assure you
that all of our PRC resident beneficial owners will comply with SAFE Circular 37. The failure of our beneficial owners who are PRC residents
to register or amend their SAFE registrations in a timely manner pursuant to SAFE Circular 37 or the failure of future beneficial owners
of our company who are PRC residents to comply with the registration procedures set forth in SAFE Circular 37 may subject such beneficial
owners or our PRC subsidiaries to fines and legal sanctions. Failure to register or amend the registration may also limit our ability
to contribute additional capital to our PRC subsidiaries or receive dividends or other distributions from our PRC subsidiaries or other
proceeds from disposal of our PRC subsidiaries, or we may be penalized by SAFE. 

Share Option Rules 

Under the Administration Measures
on Individual Foreign Exchange Control issued by the PBOC on December 25, 2006, all foreign exchange matters involved in employee share
ownership plans and share option plans in which PRC citizens participate require approval from SAFE or its authorized branch. Pursuant
to SAFE Circular 37, PRC residents who participate in share incentive plans in overseas non-publicly-listed companies may submit applications
to SAFE or its local branches for the foreign exchange registration with respect to offshore special purpose companies. In addition, under
the Notices on Issues concerning the Foreign Exchange Administration for Domestic Individuals Participating in Share Incentive Plans of
Overseas Publicly-Listed Companies, or the Share Option Rules, issued by SAFE on February 15, 2012, PRC residents who are granted shares
or share options by companies listed on overseas stock exchanges under share incentive plans are required to (i) register with SAFE or
its local branches, (ii) retain a qualified PRC agent, which may be a PRC subsidiary of the overseas listed company or another qualified
institution selected by the PRC subsidiary, to conduct the SAFE registration and other procedures with respect to the share incentive
plans on behalf of the participants, and (iii) retain an overseas institution to handle matters in connection with their exercise of share
options, purchase and sale of shares or interests and funds transfers. 

Regulation of Dividend Distribution 

The principal laws, rules
and regulations governing dividend distribution by foreign-invested enterprises in the PRC are the Company Law of the PRC, as amended,
the Wholly Foreign-owned Enterprise Law and its implementation regulations and the Chinese-foreign Equity Joint Venture Law and its implementation
regulations. Under these laws, rules and regulations, foreign-invested enterprises may pay dividends only out of their accumulated profit,
if any, as determined in accordance with PRC accounting standards and regulations. Both PRC domestic companies and wholly-foreign owned
PRC enterprises are required to set aside as general reserves at least 10 of their after-tax profit, until the cumulative amount of
such reserves reaches 50 of their registered capital. A PRC company is not permitted to distribute any profits until any losses from
prior fiscal years have been offset. Profits retained from prior fiscal years may be distributed together with distributable profits
from the current fiscal year.

Regulations on Mergers Acquisitions and
Overseas Listings 

On August 8, 2006, six PRC
regulatory agencies, including the CSRC, MOFCOM, the State-owned Assets Supervision and Administration Commission, the SAT, the State
Administration of Industry and Commerce and SAFE, adopted the M A Rules, which became effective on September 8, 2006, and were amended
on June 22, 2009. Foreign investors shall comply with the M A Rules when they purchase equity interests of a domestic company or subscribe
the increased capital of a domestic company, and thus changing the nature of the domestic company into a foreign-invested enterprise,
when the foreign investors establish a foreign-invested enterprise in the PRC, purchase the assets of a domestic company and operate the
assets, or when the foreign investors purchase the assets of a domestic company, establish a foreign-invested enterprise by injecting
such assets, and operate the assets. As for merger and acquisition of a domestic company with a related party relationship by a domestic
company, enterprise or natural person in the name of an overseas company legitimately incorporated or controlled by the domestic company,
enterprise of natural person, such merger and acquisition shall be subject to examination and approval of MOFCOM. The parties involved
shall not use domestic investment by foreign investment enterprises or other methods to circumvent the requirement of examination and
approval. 

Pursuant to the Manual of Guidance
on Administration for Foreign Investment Access, which was issued and became effective on December 18, 2008 by MOFCOM, notwithstanding
the fact that (i) the domestic shareholder is connected with the foreign investor or not, or (ii) the foreign investor is the existing
shareholder or the new investor, the M A Rules shall not apply to the transfer of an equity interest in an incorporated foreign-invested
enterprise from the domestic shareholder to the foreign investor. 

On July 6, 2021, the General
Office of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China and the General Office of the State Council jointly issued the Opinions.
The Opinions emphasized the need to strengthen the administration over illegal securities activities and the supervision on overseas listings
by China-based companies. The Opinions proposed to take effective measures, such as promoting the construction of relevant regulatory
systems, to deal with the risks and incidents facing China-based overseas-listed companies and the demand for cybersecurity and data privacy
protection. 

On February 17, 2023, with
the approval of the State Council, the CSRC released the Trial Measures and five supporting guidelines, which came into effect
on March 31, 2023. According to the Trial Measures, (1) domestic companies that seek to offer or list securities overseas, both directly
and indirectly, should fulfill the filing procedures and report relevant information to the CSRC; if a domestic company fails to
complete the filing procedures or conceals any material fact or falsifies any major content in its filing documents, such domestic company
may be subject to administrative penalties by the CSRC, such as order to rectify, warnings, fines, and its controlling shareholders,
actual controllers, the person directly in charge and other directly liable persons may also be subject to administrative penalties, such
as warnings and fines; (2) if the issuer meets both of the following conditions, the overseas offerings and listings shall be determined
as an indirect overseas offerings and listings by a domestic company: (i) 50 or more of the issuer s operating revenue, total profit,
total assets or net assets as documented in its audited consolidated financial statements for the most recent accounting year is accounted
for by domestic enterprises; and; (ii) its major operational activities are carried out in China or its main places of business are located
in China, or the senior managers in charge of its business operation and management are mostly Chinese citizens or domiciled in China;
and (3) where a domestic company seeks to indirectly offer and list securities in an overseas market, the issuer shall designate a major
domestic operating entity responsible for all filing procedures with the CSRC, and where an issuer makes an application for initial
public offerings or listings in an overseas market, the issuer shall submit filings with the CSRC within three business days
after such application is submitted; if the issuer submits the application documents for offerings or listings in secret or non-public
ways overseas, it may submit an explanation at the time of filing, and the application shall be postponed until the application documents
are reported to the CSRC within three business days after the application documents are disclosed overseas. 

On February 24, 2023, the
CSRC, together with the MOF, National Administration of State Secrets Protection and National Archives Administration of China, revised
the Provisions issued by the CSRC and National Administration of State Secrets Protection and National Archives Administration of China
in 2009. The revised Provisions were issued under the title the Provisions on Strengthening Confidentiality and Archives Administration
of Overseas Securities Offering and Listing by Domestic Companies, and came into effect on March 31, 2023 together with the Trial
Measures. One of the major revisions to the revised Provisions is expanding their application to cover indirect overseas offering and
listing, as is consistent with the Trial Measures. The revised Provisions require that, among other things, (a) a domestic company that
plans to, either directly or indirectly through its overseas listed entity, publicly disclose or provide to relevant individuals or entities,
including securities companies, securities service providers, and overseas regulators, any documents and materials that contain state
secrets or working secrets of government agencies, shall first obtain approval from competent authorities according to law, and file with
the secrecy administrative department at the same level; and (b) a domestic company that plans to, either directly or indirectly through
its overseas listed entity, publicly disclose or provide to relevant individuals and entities, including securities companies, securities
service providers, and overseas regulators, any other documents and materials that, if leaked, will be detrimental to national security
or public interest, shall strictly fulfill relevant procedures stipulated by applicable national regulations. Any failure or perceived
failure by our Company, our subsidiaries, or the VIEs to comply with the above confidentiality and archives administration requirements
under the revised Provisions and other PRC laws and regulations may result in the relevant entities being held legally liable by competent
authorities, and referred to the judicial organ to be investigated for criminal liability if suspected of committing a crime. 

Legal Proceedings 

From time to time, we may
be involved in various claims and legal proceedings arising in the ordinary course of business. None of our Company, our subsidiaries
or variable interest entity is currently a party to any such claims or proceedings which, if decided adversely to the Company, would either,
individually or in the aggregate, have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations or cash flows. 

16 

Employees 

As of March 31, 2023, Highlight
Media had 20 full-time employees. 

Highlight Media have not experienced
any significant labor disputes and consider its relationship with the employees to be good. The employees are not covered by any collective
bargaining agreement. 

As Highlight Media continues
to expand our business, we believe it is critical to hire and retain top talent, especially in the areas of marketing and technology engineering.
We believe Highlight Media has the ability to attract and retain high quality engineering talent in China based on our competitive salaries,
annual performance-based bonus system, and equity incentive program for senior employees and executives. 

Item 1A. Risk Factors 

An investment in our shares
of common stock involves a high degree of risk. You should carefully consider the following risk factors, together with the other information
contained in this annual report, before you decide to buy any shares. Any of the following risks could cause our business, results of
operations and financial condition to suffer materially, causing the market price of our shares of common stock to decline, in which event
you may lose part or all of your investment in our shares of common stock. Additional risks and uncertainties not currently known to us
or that we currently do not deem material may also become important factors that may materially and adversely affect our business. 

Risks Related to Our Corporate Structure 

If the PRC government deems that the VIE
agreements in relation to Highlight Media, our consolidated variable interest entity or VIE, do not comply with PRC regulatory restrictions
on foreign investment in the relevant industries, or if these regulations or the interpretation of existing regulations change in the
future, we could be subject to severe penalties or be forced to relinquish our interests in those operations and our common stock may
decline in value dramatically or even become worthless. 

We are a holding company incorporated
in Nevada. As a holding company with no material operations of our own, we conduct substantially all of our operations through Highlight
Media, the consolidated variable interest entity (or VIE) established in PRC. Highlight WFOE is the primary beneficiary of Highlight Media
for accounting purposes, because, pursuant to the VIE agreements, Highlight Media shall pay Highlight WFOE service fees in the amount
of 100 of Highlight Media s net income, while Highlight WFOE is obligated to absorb all of losses of Highlight Media. As a
result, we consolidate the financial results of Highlight Media in our consolidated financial statements under U.S. GAAP. Such VIE structure
involves unique risks to investors. For more details on the VIE structure, please see Item 1. Business Corporate Structure
- Contractual Arrangements between Highlight Media And Highlight WFOE . 

We rely on and expect to continue
to rely on the VIE agreements to operate our business. These contractual arrangements are not as effective in providing us with control
over Highlight Media as ownership of controlling equity interests would be in enabling us to derive economic benefits from the operations
of Highlight Media. Under the current contractual arrangements, as a legal matter, if Highlight Media or any of its shareholders executing
the VIE agreements fails to perform its, his or her respective obligations under these contractual arrangements, we may have to incur
substantial costs and resources to enforce such arrangements, and rely on legal remedies available under PRC laws, including seeking specific
performance or injunctive relief, and claiming damages, which we cannot assure you will be effective. For example, if Highlight Media s
shareholders were to refuse to transfer their equity interests in such variable interest entity to us or our designated persons when we
exercise the purchase option pursuant to these contractual arrangements, we may have to take a legal action to compel them to fulfill
their contractual obligations. Highlight Media and its shareholders could breach their contractual arrangements with us by, among other
things, failing to conduct their operations in an acceptable manner or taking other actions that are detrimental to our interests. If
we had direct ownership of Highlight Media, we would be able to exercise our rights as a shareholder to effect changes in the board of
directors of Highlight Media, which in turn could implement changes, subject to any applicable fiduciary obligations, at the management
and operational level. However, under the current contractual arrangements, we rely on the performance by Highlight Media and its shareholders
of their obligations under the contracts. The shareholders of Highlight Media may not act in the best interests of our Company or may
not perform their obligations under these contracts. Such risks exist throughout the period in which we intend to operate the business
through the contractual arrangements with Highlight Media. 

All of these contractual arrangements
are governed by PRC law and provide for the resolution of disputes through arbitration in the PRC. The VIE agreements have not been tested
in a court of law. If (i) the applicable PRC authorities invalidate the VIE agreements for violation of PRC laws, rules and regulations,
(ii) Highlight Media or its shareholders terminate the contractual arrangements, (iii) Highlight Media or its shareholders fail to perform
its/his/her obligations under these contractual arrangements, or (iv) if these regulations change or are interpreted differently in the
future, we may have to modify such structure to comply with regulatory requirements. There can be no assurance that we can achieve this
without material disruption to our business. Furthermore, if Highlight WFOE is found to be in violation of any existing or future PRC
laws or regulations, or fail to obtain or maintain any of the required permits or approvals, the relevant PRC regulatory authorities would
have broad discretion to take action in dealing with such violations or failures, including, without limitation: 

revoking the business license and/or operating licenses of Highlight WFOE or Highlight Media; 

discontinuing or placing restrictions or onerous conditions on our operations through any transactions among Highlight WFOE and Highlight Media;

imposing fines, confiscating the income from Highlight WFOE or Highlight Media, or imposing other requirements with which Highlight WFOE or Highlight Media may not be able to comply; 

placing restrictions on our right to collect revenues; 

shutting down our servers or blocking our app/websites; 

requiring us to restructure our ownership structure or operations, including terminating the contractual arrangements with Highlight Media and deregistering the equity pledges of Highlight Media, which in turn would affect our ability to consolidate or derive economic interests from Highlight Media; or 

restricting or prohibiting our use of the proceeds of future financings to finance our business and operations in China. 

taking other regulatory or enforcement actions against us that could be harmful to our business. 

The imposition of any of these
penalties would result in a material and adverse effect on our ability to conduct our business, thus causing the value of our common stock
to significantly decline or be worthless, which would materially affect the interest of the investors. In addition, it is unclear what
impact the PRC government actions would have on us and on our ability to consolidate the financial results of Highlight Media in our consolidated
financial statements, if the PRC government authorities were to find our corporate structure and contractual arrangements to be in violation
of PRC laws and regulations. If the imposition of any of these government actions causes us to lose our right to direct the activities
of Highlight Media or our right to receive substantially all the economic benefits and residual returns from Highlight Media and we are
not able to restructure our ownership structure and operations in a satisfactory manner, we would no longer be able to consolidate the
financial results of Highlight Media in our consolidated financial statements. Either of these results, or any other significant penalties
that might be imposed on us in this event, would have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations. 

In addition, if Highlight
Media or all or part of its assets become subject to liens or rights of third-party creditors, we may be unable to continue some or all
of our business activities, which could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. If
Highlight Media undergoes a voluntary or involuntary liquidation proceeding, its shareholders or unrelated third-party creditors may claim
rights to some or all of these assets, thereby hindering our ability to operate our business, which could materially and adversely affect
our business and our ability to generate revenues. 

We are a holding company, and will rely
on dividends paid by our subsidiaries for our cash needs. Any limitation on the ability of Highlight WFOE to make dividend payments to
us, or any tax implications of making dividend payments to us, could limit our ability to pay our parent company expenses or pay dividends
to holders of our common stock. 

We are a holding company with
no material operation of our own. We may rely on dividends to be paid by our subsidiaries to fund our cash and financing requirements,
including the funds necessary to pay dividends and other cash distributions to our shareholders, to service any debt we may incur and
to pay our operating expenses. If any of our subsidiaries incurs debt on its own behalf in the future, the instruments governing the debt
may restrict its ability to pay dividends or make other distributions to us. 

Under PRC laws and regulations,
our PRC subsidiary, Highlight WFOE, which is a wholly foreign-owned enterprise in China, may pay dividends only out of its accumulated
profits as determined in accordance with PRC accounting standards and regulations. In addition, a wholly foreign-owned enterprise is required
to set aside at least 10 of its accumulated after-tax profits each year, if any, to fund a certain statutory reserve fund, until the
aggregate amount of such fund reaches 50 of its registered capital. 

Highlight Media, the VIE with
which Highlight WFOE has contractual arrangement with, generates primarily all of its revenue in Renminbi, which is not freely convertible
into other currencies. As a result, any restriction on currency exchange may limit the ability of our PRC subsidiary to use its Renminbi
revenues to pay dividends to us. The PRC government may continue to strengthen its capital controls, and more restrictions and substantial
vetting process may be put forward by State Administration of Foreign Exchange (the SAFE for cross-border transactions
falling under both the current account and the capital account. Any limitation on the ability of our PRC subsidiary to pay dividends or
make other kinds of payments to us could materially and adversely limit our ability to grow, make investments or acquisitions that could
be beneficial to our business, pay dividends, or otherwise fund and conduct our business. 

In addition, the Enterprise
Income Tax Law and its implementation rules provide that a withholding tax rate of up to 10 will be applicable to dividends payable by
Chinese companies to non-PRC-resident enterprises unless otherwise exempted or reduced according to treaties or arrangements between the
PRC central government and governments of other countries or regions where the non-PRC resident enterprises are incorporated. Any limitation
on the ability of our PRC subsidiary to pay dividends or make other distributions to us could materially and adversely limit our ability
to grow, make investments or acquisitions that could be beneficial to our business, pay dividends, or otherwise fund and conduct our business. 

18 

Shareholders of Highlight Media may have
potential conflicts of interest with us, which may materially and adversely affect our business and financial condition. 

The equity interests of Highlight
Media are held by a total of two shareholders, Hongxiang Yu, Chief Executive Officer, President and Chairman of the Board of GDC, Shuang
Zhang, Vice President and Director of GDC, Their interests may differ from the interests of our Company as a whole. They may breach, or
cause Highlight Media to breach, or refuse to renew the existing VIE agreements Highlight WFOE has with Highlight Media, which would have
a material adverse effect on our ability to receive economic benefits from them. For example, the shareholders may be able to cause our
agreements with Highlight Media to be performed in a manner adverse to us by, among other things, failing to remit payments due under
the contractual arrangements to us on a timely basis. We cannot assure you that when conflicts of interest arise, any or all of these
shareholders will act in the best interests of our Company or such conflicts will be resolved in our favor. 

Currently, we do not have
arrangements to address potential conflicts of interest the shareholders of Highlight Media may encounter, on one hand, and as a beneficial
owner of our Company, on the other hand. We, however, could, at all times, exercise our option under the Exclusive Option Agreement to
cause them to transfer all of their equity ownership in Highlight Media to a PRC entity or individual designated by us as permitted by
the then applicable PRC laws. In addition, if such conflicts of interest arise, we could also, in the capacity of attorney-in-fact of the
then existing shareholders of Highlight Media as provided under the power of attorney, directly appoint new directors of Highlight Media.
We rely on the shareholders of Highlight Media to comply with PRC laws and regulations, which protect contracts and provide that directors
and executive officers owe a duty of loyalty to our Company and require them to avoid conflicts of interest and not to take advantage
of their positions for personal gains, and the laws of Nevada, which provide that the directors have a duty of care and a duty of loyalty
to act honestly in good faith with a view to our best interests. However, the legal frameworks of China and Nevada do not provide guidance
on resolving conflicts in the event of a conflict with another corporate governance regime. If we cannot resolve any conflicts of interest
or disputes between us and the shareholders of Highlight Media, we would have to rely on legal proceedings, which could result in disruption
of our business and subject us to substantial uncertainty as to the outcome of any such legal proceedings. As a result, our common stock
may decline in value dramatically or even become worthless should we become unable to assert our contractual rights over the assets of
Highlight Media that conducts all or substantially our operations. 

Contractual arrangements in relation to
Highlight Media may be subject to scrutiny by the PRC tax authorities and they may determine that we or Highlight Media owe/owes additional
taxes, which could negatively affect our results of operations and the value of your investment. 

Under applicable PRC laws
and regulations, arrangements and transactions among related parties may be subject to audit or challenge by the PRC tax authorities within
ten years after the taxable year when the transactions are conducted. The PRC enterprise income tax law requires every enterprise in China
to submit its annual enterprise income tax return together with a report on transactions with its related parties to the relevant tax
authorities. The tax authorities may impose reasonable adjustments on taxation if they have identified any related party transactions
that are inconsistent with arm s length principles. We may face material and adverse tax consequences if the PRC tax authorities
determine that the contractual arrangements between our WFOE, our variable interest entity Highlight Media and the shareholders of Highlight
Media were not entered into on an arm s length basis in such a way as to result in an impermissible reduction in taxes under applicable
PRC laws, rules and regulations, and adjust Highlight Media s income in the form of a transfer pricing adjustment. A transfer pricing
adjustment could, among other things, result in a reduction of expense deductions recorded by Highlight Media for PRC tax purposes, which
could, in turn, increase their tax liabilities without reducing Highlight WFOE s tax expenses. In addition, if Highlight WFOE requests
the shareholders of Highlight Media to transfer their equity interests in Highlight Media at nominal or no value pursuant to these contractual
arrangements, such transfer could be viewed as a gift and subject Highlight WFOE to PRC income tax. Furthermore, the PRC tax authorities
may impose late payment fees and other penalties on Highlight Media for the adjusted but unpaid taxes according to the applicable regulations.
Our results of operations could be materially and adversely affected if Highlight Media s tax liabilities increase or if they are
required to pay late payment fees and other penalties. 

If we exercise the option to acquire equity
ownership of Highlight Media, the ownership transfer may subject us to certain limitation and substantial costs. 

Pursuant to the VIE agreements,
Highlight WFOE has the exclusive right to purchase all or any part of the equity interests in Highlight Media from the shareholders of
Highlight Media for a nominal price, unless the relevant government authorities or then applicable PRC laws request that a minimum
price amount be used as the purchase price, in such case the purchase price shall be the lowest amount under such request. The shareholders
of Highlight Media will be subject to PRC individual income tax on the difference between the equity transfer price and the then current
registered capital of Highlight Media. Additionally, if such a transfer takes place, the competent tax authority may require Highlight
WFOE to pay enterprise income tax for ownership transfer income with reference to the market value, in which case the amount of tax could
be substantial.

Risks Related to Doing Business in China 

PRC regulation of loans to, and direct investments
in, PRC entities by offshore holding companies may delay or prevent us from using proceeds from future financing activities to make loans
or additional capital contributions to our PRC operating subsidiaries. 

In July 2014, SAFE promulgated
the Circular on Relevant Issues Concerning Foreign Exchange Control on Domestic Residents Offshore Investment and Financing and
Roundtrip Investment through Special Purpose Vehicles, or SAFE Circular 37, which replaces the previous SAFE Circular 75. SAFE Circular
37 requires PRC residents, including PRC individuals and PRC corporate entities, to register with SAFE or its local branches in connection
with their direct or indirect offshore investment activities. SAFE Circular 37 is applicable to our shareholders who are PRC residents
and may be applicable to any offshore acquisitions that we may make in the future. 

Under SAFE Circular 37, PRC
residents who make, or have prior to the implementation of SAFE Circular 37 made, direct or indirect investments in offshore special purpose
vehicles, or SPVs, are required to register such investments with SAFE or its local branches. In addition, any PRC resident who is a direct
or indirect shareholder of an SPV, is required to update its registration with the local branch of SAFE with respect to that SPV, to reflect
any material change. Moreover, any subsidiary of such SPV in China is required to urge the PRC resident shareholders to update their registration
with the local branch of SAFE to reflect any material change. If any PRC resident shareholder of such SPV fails to make the required registration
or to update the registration, the subsidiary of such SPV in China may be prohibited from distributing its profits or the proceeds from
any capital reduction, share transfer or liquidation to the SPV, and the SPV may also be prohibited from making additional capital contributions
into its subsidiaries in China. In February, 2015, SAFE promulgated a Notice on Further Simplifying and Improving Foreign Exchange Administration
Policy on Direct Investment, or SAFE Notice 13. Under SAFE Notice 13, applications for foreign exchange registration of inbound foreign
direct investments and outbound direct investments, including those required under SAFE Circular 37, must be filed with qualified banks
instead of SAFE. Qualified banks should examine the applications and accept registrations under the supervision of SAFE. We have used
our best efforts to notify PRC residents or entities who directly or indirectly hold shares in our holding company and who are known to
us as being PRC residents to complete the foreign exchange registrations. However, we may not be informed of the identities of all the
PRC residents or entities holding direct or indirect interest in our company, nor can we compel our beneficial owners to comply with SAFE
registration requirements. We cannot assure you that all other shareholders or beneficial owners of ours who are PRC residents or entities
have complied with, and will in the future make, obtain or update any applicable registrations or approvals required by, SAFE regulations.
Failure by such shareholders or beneficial owners to comply with SAFE regulations, or failure by us to amend the foreign exchange registrations
of our PRC subsidiaries, could subject us to fines or legal sanctions, restrict our overseas or cross-border investment activities, and
limit our PRC subsidiaries ability to make distributions or pay dividends to us or affect our ownership structure, which could
adversely affect our business and prospects. 

Furthermore, as these foreign
exchange and outbound investment related regulations are relatively new and their interpretation and implementation has been constantly
evolving, it is unclear how these regulations, and any future regulation concerning offshore or cross-border investments and transactions,
will be interpreted, amended and implemented by the relevant government authorities. For example, we may be subject to a more stringent
review and approval process with respect to our foreign exchange activities, such as remittance of dividends and foreign-currency-denominated
borrowings, which may adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations. We cannot assure you that we have complied or
will be able to comply with all applicable foreign exchange and outbound investment related regulations. In addition, if we decide to
acquire a PRC domestic company, we cannot assure you that we or the owners of such company, as the case may be, will be able to obtain
the necessary approvals or complete the necessary filings and registrations required by the foreign exchange regulations. This may restrict
our ability to implement our acquisition strategy and could adversely affect our business and prospects. 

As an offshore holding company
with PRC subsidiaries, we may finance our subsidiaries by means of loans or capital contributions and finance Highlight Media by means
of loans. Any capital contributions or loans that we, as an offshore entity, make to our Company s PRC subsidiary and Highlight
Media are subject to the above PRC regulations. We may not be able to obtain necessary government registrations or approvals on a timely
basis, if at all. If we fail to obtain such approvals or make such registration, our ability to make equity contributions or provide loans
to our Company s PRC subsidiary and Highlight Media or to fund their operations may be negatively affected, which may adversely
affect their liquidity and ability to fund their working capital and expansion projects and meet their obligations and commitments. As
a result, our liquidity and our ability to fund and expand our business may be negatively affected. 

20 

Changes in China s economic, political
or social conditions or government policies could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations. 

All of Highlight Media s
operations and assets are located in China. Accordingly, Highlight Media s business, prospects, financial condition and results
of operations may be influenced to a significant degree by political, economic and social conditions in China generally and by continued
economic growth in China as a whole. 

The Chinese economy differs
from the economies of most developed countries in many respects, including the amount of government involvement, level of development,
growth rate, control of foreign exchange and allocation of resources. Although the Chinese government has implemented measures emphasizing
the utilization of market forces for economic reform, the reduction of state ownership of productive assets and the establishment of improved
corporate governance in business enterprises, a substantial portion of productive assets in China is still owned by the government. In
addition, the Chinese government continues to play a significant role in regulating industry development by imposing industrial policies.
The Chinese government also exercises significant control over China s economic growth through allocating resources, controlling
payment of foreign currency-denominated obligations, setting monetary policy, and providing preferential treatment to particular industries
or companies 

While the Chinese economy
has experienced significant growth over the past decades, growth has been uneven, both geographically and among various sectors of the
economy. The Chinese government has implemented various measures to encourage economic growth and guide the allocation of resources. Some
of these measures may benefit the overall Chinese economy, but may have a negative effect on us. For example, our financial condition
and results of operations may be adversely affected by government control over capital investments or changes in tax regulations. In addition,
in the past the Chinese government has implemented certain measures, including interest rate increases, to control the pace of economic
growth. These measures may cause decreased economic activity in China, and since 2012, China s economic growth has slowed down.
Any prolonged slowdown in the Chinese economy may reduce the demand for our products and services and materially and adversely affect
our business and results of operations. 

Under the Enterprise Income Tax Law, we
may be classified as a Resident Enterprise of China. Such classification will likely result in unfavorable tax consequences
to us and our non-PRC stockholders. 

China passed the Enterprise
Income Tax Law, or the EIT Law, and its implementing rules, both of which became effective on January 1, 2008. Under the EIT Law, an enterprise
established outside of China with de facto management bodies within China is considered a resident enterprise, 
meaning that it can be treated in a manner similar to a Chinese enterprise for enterprise income tax purposes. The implementing rules
of the EIT Law define de facto management as substantial and overall management and control over the production and operations,
personnel, accounting, and properties of the enterprise. 

On April 22, 2009, the State
Administration of Taxation of China issued the Notice Concerning Relevant Issues Regarding Cognizance of Chinese Investment Controlled
Enterprises Incorporated Offshore as Resident Enterprises pursuant to Criteria of de facto Management Bodies, or the Notice, further interpreting
the application of the EIT Law and its implementation to offshore entities controlled by a Chinese enterprise or group. Pursuant to the
Notice, an enterprise incorporated in an offshore jurisdiction and controlled by a Chinese enterprise or group will be classified as a
 non-domestically incorporated resident enterprise if (i) its senior management in charge of daily operations reside or perform
their duties mainly in China; (ii) its financial or personnel decisions are made or approved by bodies or persons in China; (iii) its
substantial assets and properties, accounting books, corporate stamps, board and stockholder minutes are kept in China; and (iv) all of
its directors with voting rights or senior management reside in China. A resident enterprise would be subject to an enterprise income
tax rate of 25 on its worldwide income and must pay a withholding tax at a rate of 10 when paying dividends to its non-PRC stockholders.
Because substantially all of our operations and senior management are located within the PRC and are expected to remain so for the foreseeable
future, we may be considered a PRC resident enterprise for enterprise income tax purposes and therefore subject to the PRC enterprise
income tax at the rate of 25 on its worldwide income. However, it remains unclear as to whether the Notice is applicable to an offshore
enterprise controlled by a Chinese natural person. Therefore, it is unclear how tax authorities will determine tax residency based on
the facts of each case. 

21 

If the PRC tax authorities
determine that we are a resident enterprise for PRC enterprise income tax purposes, a number of unfavorable PRC tax consequences
could follow. First, we may be subject to the enterprise income tax at a rate of 25 on our worldwide taxable income as well as PRC enterprise
income tax reporting obligations. In our case, this would mean that income such as non-China source income would be subject to PRC enterprise
income tax at a rate of 25 . Currently, we do not have any non-China source income, as we conduct our sales in China. However, under the
EIT Law and its implementing rules, dividends paid to us from our PRC subsidiaries would be deemed as qualified investment income
between resident enterprises and therefore qualify as tax-exempt income pursuant to clause 26 of the EIT Law. Second,
it is possible that future guidance issued with respect to the new resident enterprise classification could result in a
situation in which the dividends we pay with respect to our common stock, or the gain our non-PRC shareholders may realize from the transfer
of our common stock, may be treated as PRC-sourced income and may therefore be subject to a 10 PRC withholding tax. The EIT Law and its
implementing regulations are, however, relatively new and ambiguities exist with respect to the interpretation and identification of PRC-sourced
income, and the application and assessment of withholding taxes. If we are required under the EIT Law and its implementing regulations
to withhold PRC income tax on dividends payable to our non-PRC shareholders, or if non-PRC stockholders are required to pay PRC income
tax on gains on the transfer of their common stock, our business could be negatively impacted and the value of your investment may be
materially reduced. Further, if we were treated as a resident enterprise by PRC tax authorities, we would be subject to
taxation in both China and such countries in which we have taxable income, and our PRC tax may not be creditable against such other taxes. 

We must comply with the Foreign Corrupt
Practices Act and Chinese anti-corruption laws . 

We are required to comply
with the United States Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, or FCPA, which prohibits US companies from engaging in bribery or other prohibited
payments to foreign officials for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business. Foreign companies, including some of our competitors,
are not subject to these prohibitions. The PRC also strictly prohibits bribery of government officials. Certain of our suppliers are owned
by the PRC government and our dealings with them are likely to be considered to be with government officials for these purposes. Corruption,
extortion, bribery, pay-offs, theft and other fraudulent practices occur from time-to-time in China. It is our policy to prohibit our
employees, and to discourage our agents, representatives and consultants, from engaging in such practices. If our competitors engage in
these practices, they may receive preferential treatment from personnel of some companies, giving our competitors an advantage in securing
business or from government officials who might give them priority in obtaining new licenses, which would put us at a disadvantage. Our
employees, agents, representatives and consultants may not always be subject to our control. If any of them violates FCPA or other anti-corruption
law, we might be held responsible. We could suffer severe penalties in that event. In addition, the US government may seek to hold us
liable for successor liability FCPA violations committed by companies in which we invest or which we acquire. 

Uncertainties in the interpretation and
enforcement of PRC laws and regulations and changes in policies, rules, and regulations in China, which may be quick with little advance
notice, could limit the legal protection available to you and us. 

The PRC legal system is based
on written statutes. Unlike common law systems, it is a system in which legal cases have limited value as precedents. In the late 1970s,
the PRC government began to promulgate a comprehensive system of laws and regulations governing economic matters in general. The legislation
over the past three decades has significantly increased the protection afforded to various forms of foreign or private-sector investment
in China. Highlight Media is subject to various PRC laws and regulations generally applicable to companies in China. Since these laws
and regulations are relatively new and the PRC legal system continues to rapidly evolve, however, the interpretations of many laws, regulations,
and rules are not always uniform and enforcement of these laws, regulations, and rules involve uncertainties. 

From time to time, we may
have to resort to administrative and court proceedings to enforce our legal rights. Since PRC administrative and court authorities have
significant discretion in interpreting and implementing statutory and contractual terms, however, it may be more difficult to evaluate
the outcome of administrative and court proceedings and the level of legal protection we enjoy in the PRC legal system than in more developed
legal systems. Furthermore, the PRC legal system is based in part on government policies, internal rules, and regulations that may have
retroactive effect and may change quickly with little advance notice. As a result, Highlight Media may not be aware of its violation of
these policies and rules until sometime after the violation. Such uncertainties, including uncertainties over the scope and effect of
the contractual, property (including intellectual property), and procedural rights, and any failure to respond to changes in the regulatory
environment in China could materially and adversely affect Highlight Media s business and impede Highlight Media s ability
to continue its operations. 

Our business may be materially and adversely
affected if Highlight Media declares bankruptcy or become subject to a dissolution or liquidation proceeding. 

The Enterprise Bankruptcy
Law of the PRC, or the Bankruptcy Law, came into effect on June 1, 2007. The Bankruptcy Law provides that an enterprise will be liquidated
if the enterprise fails to settle its debts as and when they fall due and if the enterprise s assets are, or are demonstrably, insufficient
to clear such debts. 

22 

Highlight Media holds certain
assets that are important to our business operations. If Highlight Media undergoes a voluntary or involuntary liquidation proceeding,
unrelated third-party creditors may claim rights to some or all of these assets, thereby hindering our ability to operate our business,
which could materially and adversely affect Highlight Media s business, financial condition and results of operations. 

According to SAFE s
Notice of the State Administration of Foreign Exchange on Further Improving and Adjusting Foreign Exchange Administration Policies for
Direct Investment, effective on 17 December 2012, and the Provisions for Administration of Foreign Exchange Relating to Inbound Direct
Investment by Foreign Investors, effective May 13, 2013, if any of our PRC subsidiaries undergoes a voluntary or involuntary liquidation
proceeding, prior approval from SAFE for remittance of foreign exchange to our shareholders abroad is no longer required, but we still
need to conduct a registration process with the SAFE local branch. It is not clear whether registration is a mere formality
or involves the kind of substantive review process undertaken by SAFE and its relevant branches in the past. 

Substantial uncertainties exist with respect
to the interpretation of the PRC Foreign Investment Law and how it may impact the viability of our current corporate structure, corporate
governance and business operations. 

The Ministry of Commerce published
a discussion draft of the proposed Foreign Investment Law in January 2015, or the 2015 FIL Draft, which expands the definition of foreign
investment and introduces the principle of actual control in determining whether a company is considered a foreign-invested
enterprise, or an FIE. Under the 2015 FIL Draft, VIEs that are controlled via contractual arrangement would also be deemed as foreign
invested enterprises, if they are ultimately controlled by foreign investors. 

On March 15, 2019, the National
People s Congress approved the Foreign Investment Law of the PRC, or the FIL, which will come into effect on January 1, 2020, repealing
simultaneously the Law of the PRC on Sino-foreign Equity Joint Ventures, the Law of the PRC on Wholly Foreign-owned Enterprises and the
Law of the PRC on Sino-foreign Cooperative Joint Ventures, together with their implementation rules and ancillary regulations. Pursuant
to the FIL, foreign investment refers to any investment activity directly or indirectly carried out by foreign natural persons, enterprises,
or other organizations, including investment in new construction project, establishment of foreign funded enterprise or increase of investment,
merger and acquisition, and investment in any other way stipulated under laws, administrative regulations, or provisions of the State
Council. Although the FIL has deleted the particular reference to the concept of actual control and contractual arrangements
compared to the 2015 FIL Draft, there is still uncertainty regarding whether Highlight Media would be identified as a FIE in the future. 

Even if Highlight Media were
to be identified as a FIE in the future, we believe that our current business would not be adversely affected. However, if we were to
engage in any business conduct involving third parties identified as prohibited or restricted on the Negative List, Highlight Media as
well as its subsidiary may be subject to laws and regulations on foreign investment. In addition, our shareholders would also be prohibited
or restricted to invest in certain sectors on the Negative List. However, even if Highlight Media were to be identified as a FIE, the
validity of our contractual arrangements with Highlight Media and its shareholders as well as our corporate structure would not be adversely
affected. We would still be able to receive benefits from Highlight Media in accordance with the contractual agreements. In addition,
as the Chinese government has been updating the Negative List in recent years and reducing the sectors prohibited or restricted for foreign
investment, it is probable in the future that, even if Highlight Media is identified as a FIE, it is still allowed to acquire or hold
equity of enterprises in sectors currently prohibited or restricted for foreign investment. 

Furthermore, the PRC Foreign
Investment Law provides that foreign invested enterprises established according to the existing laws regulating foreign investment may
maintain their structure and corporate governance within five years after the implementing of the PRC Foreign Investment Law. 

In addition, the PRC Foreign
Investment Law also provides several protective rules and principles for foreign investors and their investments in the PRC, including,
among others, that a foreign investor may freely transfer into or out of China, in Renminbi or a foreign currency, its contributions,
profits, capital gains, income from disposition of assets, royalties of intellectual property rights, indemnity or compensation lawfully
acquired, and income from liquidation, among others, within China; local governments shall abide by their commitments to the foreign investors;
governments at all levels and their departments shall enact local normative documents concerning foreign investment in compliance with
laws and regulations and shall not impair legitimate rights and interests, impose additional obligations onto FIEs, set market access
restrictions and exit conditions, or intervene with the normal production and operation activities of FIEs; except for special circumstances,
in which case statutory procedures shall be followed and fair and reasonable compensation shall be made in a timely manner, expropriation
or requisition of the investment of foreign investors is prohibited; and mandatory technology transfer is prohibited. 

23 

Notwithstanding the above,
the PRC Foreign Investment Law stipulates that foreign investment includes foreign investors invest through any other methods under
laws, administrative regulations or provisions prescribed by the State Council . Therefore, there are possibilities that future
laws, administrative regulations or provisions prescribed by the State Council may regard contractual arrangements as a form of foreign
investment, and then whether our contractual arrangement will be recognized as foreign investment, whether our contractual arrangement
will be deemed to be in violation of the foreign investment access requirements and how the above-mentioned contractual arrangement will
be handled are uncertain. 

Given the Chinese government s significant
oversight and discretion over the conduct of the business of Highlight Media, the Chinese government may intervene or influence its operations
at any time, which could result in a material change in the operations of Highlight Media and/or the value of our common stock. 

The Chinese government has
significant oversight and discretion over the conduct of Highlight Media and may intervene or influence their operations at any time as
the government deems appropriate to further regulatory, political, and societal goals, which could result in a material change in the
operations of Highlight Media and/or the value of our common stock. 

The Chinese government has
recently published new policies that significantly affected certain industries such as the education and Internet industries, and we cannot
rule out the possibility that it will in the future release regulations or policies regarding our industry that could adversely affect
the business, financial condition, and results of operations of Highlight Media. Furthermore, if China adopts more stringent standards
with respect to certain areas such as environmental protection or corporate social responsibilities, Highlight Media may incur increased
compliance costs or become subject to additional restrictions in their operations. Certain areas of the law in China, including intellectual
property rights and confidentiality protections, may also not be as effective as in the United States or other countries. In addition,
we cannot predict the effects of future developments in the PRC legal system on the business operations of Highlight Media, including
the promulgation of new laws, or changes to existing laws or the interpretation or enforcement thereof. These uncertainties could limit
the legal protections available to us and our investors, including you. 

The Chinese government exerts substantial
influence over the manner in which we must conduct our business activities . We are currently not required to obtain approval
from Chinese authorities to list on U.S exchanges, however, if Highlight Media or the holding company were required to obtain approval
in the future and were denied permission from Chinese authorities to list on U.S. exchanges, we will not be able to continue listing on
U.S. exchange and the value of our common stock may significantly decline or become worthless, which would materially affect the interest
of the investors. 

The Chinese government has
exercised and continues to exercise substantial control over virtually every sector of the Chinese economy through regulation and state
ownership. Under the current government leadership, the government of the PRC has been pursuing reform policies which have adversely affected
China-based operating companies whose securities are listed in the United States, with significant policies changes being made from
time to time without notice. There are substantial uncertainties regarding the interpretation and application of PRC laws and regulations,
including, but not limited to, the laws and regulations governing our business, or the enforcement and performance of our contractual
arrangements with borrowers in the event of the imposition of statutory liens, bankruptcy or criminal proceedings. Our ability to operate
in China may be harmed by changes in its laws and regulations, including those relating to taxation, environmental regulations, land use
rights, property and other matters. The central or local governments of these jurisdictions may impose new, stricter regulations or interpretations
of existing regulations that would require additional expenditures and efforts on our part to ensure our compliance with such regulations
or interpretations. Accordingly, government actions in the future, including any decision not to continue to support recent economic reforms
and to return to a more centrally planned economy or regional or local variations in the implementation of economic policies, could have
a significant effect on economic conditions in China or particular regions thereof, and could require us to divest ourselves of any interest
we then hold in Chinese properties. 

Given recent statements by
the Chinese government indicating an intent to exert more oversight and control over offerings that are conducted overseas and/or foreign
investment in China-based issuers, any such action could significantly limit or completely hinder our ability to offer or continue to
offer securities to investors and cause the value of such securities to significantly decline or become worthless. 

Recently, the General Office
of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China and the General Office of the State Council jointly issued the Opinions on Severely
Cracking Down on Illegal Securities Activities According to Law, or the Opinions, which was made available to the public on July 6,
2021. The Opinions emphasized the need to strengthen the administration over illegal securities activities, and the need to strengthen
the supervision over overseas listings by Chinese companies. Effective measures, such as promoting the construction of relevant regulatory
systems, will be taken to deal with the risks and incidents of China-concept overseas listed companies. As of the date of this annual
report, we have not received any inquiry, notice, warning, or sanctions from PRC government authorities in connection with the Opinions. 

On June 10, 2021, the
Standing Committee of the National People s Congress of China, or the SCNPC, promulgated the PRC Data Security Law, which took effect
in September 2021. The PRC Data Security Law imposes data security and privacy obligations on entities and individuals carrying out
data activities, and introduces a data classification and hierarchical protection system based on the importance of data in economic and
social development, and the degree of harm it will cause to national security, public interests, or legitimate rights and interests of
individuals or organizations when such data is tampered with, destroyed, leaked, illegally acquired or used. The PRC Data Security Law
also provides for a national security review procedure for data activities that may affect national security and imposes export restrictions
on certain data an information. 

24 

On August 17, 2021, the
State Council promulgated the Regulations on the Protection of the Security of Critical Information Infrastructure, or the Regulations,
which took effect on September 1, 2021. The Regulations supplement and specify the provisions on the security of critical information
infrastructure as stated in the Cybersecurity Review Measures. The Regulations provide, among others, that protection department of certain
industry or sector shall notify the operator of the critical information infrastructure in time after the identification of certain critical
information infrastructure. 

On August 20, 2021, the
SCNPC promulgated the Personal Information Protection Law of the PRC, or the Personal Information Protection Law, which took effect on
November 1, 2021. As the first systematic and comprehensive law specifically for the protection of personal information in the PRC,
the Personal Information Protection Law provides, among others, that (i) an individual s consent shall be obtained to use sensitive
personal information, such as biometric characteristics and individual location tracking, (ii) personal information operators using
sensitive personal information shall notify individuals of the necessity of such use and impact on the individual s rights, and
(iii) where personal information operators reject an individual s request to exercise his or her rights, the individual may
file a lawsuit with a People s Court. 

On December 24, 2021,
the CSRC, together with other relevant government authorities in China issued the Provisions of the State Council on the Administration
of Overseas Securities Offering and Listing by Domestic Companies (Draft for Comments), and the Measures for the Filing of Overseas Securities
Offering and Listing by Domestic Companies (Draft for Comments) Draft Overseas Listing Regulations ). The Draft Overseas
Listing Regulations requires that a PRC domestic enterprise seeking to issue and list its shares overseas Overseas Issuance and
Listing shall complete the filing procedures of and submit the relevant information to CSRC. The Overseas Issuance and Listing
includes direct and indirect issuance and listing. Where an enterprise whose principal business activities are conducted in PRC seeks
to issue and list its shares in the name of an overseas enterprise Overseas Issuer on the basis of the equity, assets,
income or other similar rights and interests of the relevant PRC domestic enterprise, such activities shall be deemed an indirect overseas
issuance and listing Indirect Overseas Issuance and Listing under the Draft Overseas Listing Regulations. Therefore, the
proposed offering would be deemed an Indirect Overseas Issuance and Listing under the Draft Overseas Listing Regulations. As such, the
Company would be required to complete the filing procedures of and submit the relevant information to CSRC after the Draft Overseas Listing
Regulations become effective. 

As such, the Company s
businesses may be subject to various government and regulatory interference in the provinces in which they operate. The Company could
be subject to regulation by various political and regulatory entities, including various local and municipal agencies and government sub-divisions.
The Company may incur increased costs necessary to comply with existing and newly adopted laws and regulations or penalties for any failure
to comply. The Chinese government may intervene or influence our operations at any time with little advance notice, which could result
in a material change in our operations and in the value of our common stock. Any actions by the Chinese government to exert more oversight
and control over offerings that are conducted overseas and/or foreign investment in China-based issuers could significantly limit or completely
hinder our ability to offer or continue to offer securities to investors and cause the value of such securities to significantly decline
or become worthless. 

Furthermore, it is uncertain
when and whether the Company will be required to obtain permission from the PRC government to list on U.S. exchanges in the future,
and even when such permission is obtained, whether it will be denied or rescinded. Although the Company is currently not required to obtain
permission from any of the PRC federal or local government to obtain such permission and has not received any denial to list on the U.S. exchange,
our operations could be adversely affected, directly or indirectly, by existing or future laws and regulations relating to its business
or industry. As a result, our common stock may decline in value dramatically or even become worthless should we become subject to new
requirement to obtain permission from the PRC government to list on U.S. exchange in the future. 

Fluctuations in exchange rates could adversely
affect our business and the value of our securities. 

Changes in the value of the
RMB against the U.S. dollar are affected by, among other things, changes in China s political and economic conditions. Any significant
revaluation of the RMB may have a material adverse effect on our revenues and financial condition, and the value of, and any dividends
payable on our shares in U.S. dollar terms. For example, to the extent that we need to convert U.S. dollars we receive from our public
offering into RMB for our operations, appreciation of the RMB against the U.S. dollar would have an adverse effect on RMB amount we would
receive from the conversion. Conversely, if we decide to convert our RMB into U.S. dollars for the purpose of paying dividends on our
common stock or for other business purposes, appreciation of the U.S. dollar against the RMB would have a negative effect on the U.S.
dollar amount available to us. In addition, fluctuations of the RMB against other currencies may increase or decrease the cost of imports
and exports, and thus affect the price-competitiveness of our products against products of foreign manufacturers or products relying on
foreign inputs. 

25 

Since July 2005, the RMB is
no longer pegged to the U.S. dollar. Although the People s Bank of China regularly intervenes in the foreign exchange market to
prevent significant short-term fluctuations in the exchange rate, the RMB may appreciate or depreciate significantly in value against
the U.S. dollar in the medium to long term. Moreover, it is possible that in the future PRC authorities may lift restrictions on fluctuations
in the RMB exchange rate and lessen intervention in the foreign exchange market. 

Increases in labor costs in the PRC may
adversely affect our business and results of operations. 

The currently effective PRC
Labor Contract Law , or the Labor Contract Law was first adopted on June 29, 2007 and later amended on December 28, 2012. The PRC Labor
Contract Law has reinforced the protection of employees who, under the Labor Contract Law, have the right, among others, to have written
employment contracts, to enter into employment contracts with no fixed term under certain circumstances, to receive overtime wages and
to terminate or alter terms in labor contracts. Furthermore, the Labor Contract Law sets forth additional restrictions and increases the
costs involved with dismissing employees. To the extent that we need to significantly reduce our workforce, the Labor Contract Law could
adversely affect our ability to do so in a timely and cost-effective manner, and our results of operations could be adversely affected.
In addition, for employees whose employment contracts include noncompetition terms, the Labor Contract Law requires us to pay monthly
compensation after such employment is terminated, which will increase our operating expenses. 

We expect that our labor costs,
including wages and employee benefits, will continue to increase. Unless we are able to pass on these increased labor costs to our vehicle
buyers by increasing the prices of our products and services, our financial condition and results of operations would be materially and
adversely affected. 

PRC regulations relating to offshore investment
activities by PRC residents may limit our PRC subsidiary s ability to increase its registered capital or distribute profits to us
or otherwise expose us or our PRC resident beneficial owners to liability and penalties under PRC law. 

In July 2014, the State Administration
of Foreign Exchange promulgated the Circular on Issues Concerning Foreign Exchange Administration over the Overseas Investment and Financing
and Roundtrip Investment by Domestic Residents via Special Purpose Vehicles, or Circular 37 . According to Circular 37, prior
registration with the local SAFE branch is required for Chinese residents to contribute domestic assets or interests to offshore companies,
known as Special Purpose Vehicles SPVs ). Circular 37 further requires amendment to a PRC resident s registration
in the event of any significant changes with respect to the SPV, such as an increase or decrease in the capital contributed by PRC individuals,
share transfer or exchange, merger, division, or other material event. Further, foreign investment enterprises established by way
of round-tripping shall complete the relevant foreign exchange registration formalities pursuant to the prevailing foreign exchange control
provisions for direct investments by foreign investors, and disclose the relevant information such as actual controlling party of the
shareholders truthfully. 

We may not be informed of
the identities of all the PRC residents or entities holding direct or indirect interest in our company, nor can we compel our beneficial
owners to comply with SAFE registration requirements. As a result, we cannot assure you that all of our shareholders or beneficial owners
who are PRC residents or entities have complied with, and will in the future make or obtain any applicable registrations or approvals
required by, SAFE regulations. Failure by such shareholders or beneficial owners to comply with SAFE regulations, or failure by us to
amend the foreign exchange registrations of our PRC subsidiaries, could subject us to fines or legal sanctions, restrict our overseas
or cross-border investment activities, limit Highlight WFOE s ability to make distributions or pay dividends to us or affect our
ownership structure, which could adversely affect our business and prospects. 

Highlight Media
may become subject to a variety of laws and regulations in the PRC regarding privacy, data security, cybersecurity, and data protection.
Highlight Media may be required to suspend its business, be liable for improper use or appropriation of personal information provided
by our customers and face other penalties. 

Highlight
Media may become subject to a variety of laws and regulations in the PRC regarding privacy, data security, cybersecurity, and data protection.
These laws and regulations are continuously evolving and developing. The scope and interpretation of the laws that are or may be applicable
to us are often uncertain and may be conflicting, particularly with respect to foreign laws. In particular, there are numerous laws and
regulations regarding privacy and the collection, sharing, use, processing, disclosure, and protection of personal information and other
user data. Such laws and regulations often vary in scope, may be subject to differing interpretations, and may be inconsistent among different
jurisdictions. 

26 

We
expect to obtain information about various aspects of our operations as well as regarding our employees and third parties. We also maintain
information about various aspects of our operations as well as regarding our employees. The integrity and protection of our customer,
employee and company data is critical to our business. Our customers and employees expect that we will adequately protect their personal
information. We are required by applicable laws to keep strictly confidential the personal information that we collect, and to take adequate
security measures to safeguard such information. 

The
PRC Criminal Law, as amended by its Amendment 7 (effective on February 28, 2009) and Amendment 9 (effective on November 1, 2015), prohibits
institutions, companies and their employees from selling or otherwise illegally disclosing a citizen s personal information obtained
during the course of performing duties or providing services or obtaining such information through theft or other illegal ways. On November
7, 2016, the Standing Committee of the PRC National People s Congress issued the Cyber Security Law of the PRC, or Cyber Security
Law, which became effective on June 1, 2017. 

Pursuant
to the Cyber Security Law, network operators must not, without users consent, collect their personal information, and may only
collect users personal information necessary to provide their services. Providers are also obliged to provide security maintenance
for their products and services and shall comply with provisions regarding the protection of personal information as stipulated under
the relevant laws and regulations. 

The
Civil Code of the PRC (issued by the PRC National People s Congress on May 28, 2020 and effective from January 1, 2021) provides
main legal basis for privacy and personal information infringement claims under the Chinese civil laws. PRC regulators, including the
Cyberspace Administration of China, MIIT, and the Ministry of Public Security have been increasingly focused on regulation in the areas
of data security and data protection. 

The
PRC regulatory requirements regarding cybersecurity are constantly evolving. For instance, various regulatory bodies in China, including
the Cyberspace Administration of China, the Ministry of Public Security and the SAMR, have enforced data privacy and protection laws and
regulations with varying and evolving standards and interpretations. In April 2020, the Chinese government promulgated Cybersecurity Review
Measures, which came into effect on June 1, 2020. According to the Cybersecurity Review Measures, operators of critical information infrastructure
must pass a cybersecurity review when purchasing network products and services which do or may affect national security. 

In
November 2016, the Standing Committee of China s National People s Congress passed China s first Cybersecurity Law CSL ),
which became effective in June 2017. The CSL is the first PRC law that systematically lays out the regulatory requirements on cybersecurity
and data protection, subjecting many previously under-regulated or unregulated activities in cyberspace to government scrutiny. The legal
consequences of violation of the CSL include penalties of warning, confiscation of illegal income, suspension of related business, winding
up for rectification, shutting down the websites, and revocation of business license or relevant permits. In April 2020, the Cyberspace
Administration of China and certain other PRC regulatory authorities promulgated the Cybersecurity Review Measures, which became effective
in June 2020. Pursuant to the Cybersecurity Review Measures, operators of critical information infrastructure must pass a cybersecurity
review when purchasing network products and services which do or may affect national security. On July 10, 2021, the Cyberspace Administration
of China issued a revised draft of the Measures for Cybersecurity Review for public comments Draft Measures ), which required
that, in addition to operator of critical information infrastructure, any data processor carrying out data
processing activities that affect or may affect national security should also be subject to cybersecurity review, and further elaborated
the factors to be considered when assessing the national security risks of the relevant activities, including, among others, (i) the risk
of core data, important data or a large amount of personal information being stolen, leaked, destroyed, and illegally used or exited
the country; and (ii) the risk of critical information infrastructure, core data, important data or a large amount of personal information
being affected, controlled, or maliciously used by foreign governments after listing abroad. The Cyberspace Administration of China has
said that under the proposed rules companies holding data on more than 1,000,000 users must now apply for cybersecurity approval when
seeking listings in other nations because of the risk that such data and personal information could be affected, controlled, and
maliciously exploited by foreign governments, The cybersecurity review will also investigate the potential national security risks
from overseas IPOs. We do not know what regulations will be adopted or how such regulations will affect us and our listing on Nasdaq.
In the event that the Cyberspace Administration of China determines that we are subject to these regulations, we may be required to delist
from Nasdaq and we may be subject to fines and penalties. On June 10, 2021, the Standing Committee of the NPC promulgated the PRC Data
Security Law, which took effect on September 1, 2021. The Data Security Law also sets forth the data security protection obligations for
entities and individuals handling personal data, including that no entity or individual may acquire such data by stealing or other illegal
means, and the collection and use of such data should not exceed the necessary limits The costs of compliance with, and other burdens
imposed by, CSL and any other cybersecurity and related laws may limit the use and adoption of our products and services and could have
an adverse impact on our business. On January 4, 2022, thirteen PRC regulatory agencies, namely, the CAC, the NDRC, the Ministry
of Industry and Information Technology, the Ministry of Public Security, the Ministry of State Security, the Ministry of Finance, MOFCOM,
SAMR, CSRC, the People s Bank of China, the National Radio and Television Administration, National Administration of State Secrets
Protection and the National Cryptography Administration, jointly adopted and published the Measures for Cybersecurity Review (2021), which
became effective on February 15, 2022. The Measures for Cybersecurity Review (2021) required that, among others, in addition to operator
of critical information infrastructure any operator of network platform holding personal information of more than
one million users which seeks to list in a foreign stock exchange should also be subject to cybersecurity review. 

27 

On
July 10, 2021, the Cyberspace Administration of China issued a revised draft of the Measures for Cybersecurity Review for public
comments (the Review Measures ), and on December 28, 2021, the Cyberspace Administration of China jointly with the relevant
authorities published Measures for Cybersecurity Review (2021) which took effect on February 15, 2022 and replace the Review
Measures, which required that, operators of critical information infrastructure purchasing network products and services, and data processors
(together with the operators of critical information infrastructure, the Operators carrying out data processing activities
that affect or may affect national security, shall conduct a cybersecurity review, any operator who controls more than one million users 
personal information must go through a cybersecurity review by the cybersecurity review office if it seeks to be listed in a foreign country. 

Under
the Data Security Law enacted on September 1, 2021 and the Measures for Cybersecurity Review (2021) implemented on February 15,
2022, given that (i) Highlight Media is not an Operator, (Ii) Highlight Media does not possess more than one million users personal
information, and (iIi) data processed in Highlight Media s business does not have a bearing on national security and thus may not
be classified as core or important data by the authorities. However, if the CSRC, CAC or other regulatory agencies later promulgate new
rules or explanations requiring that we obtain their approvals for this offering and any follow-on offering, we may be unable to obtain
such approvals and we may face sanctions by the CSRC, CAC or other PRC regulatory agencies for failure to seek their approval which could
significantly limit or completely hinder our ability to offer or continue to offer securities to our investors and the securities currently
being offered may substantially decline in value and be worthless. 

We
cannot assure you that PRC regulatory agencies, including the CAC, would take the same view as we do, and there is no assurance that we
can fully or timely comply with such laws. In the event that we are subject to any mandatory cybersecurity review and other specific actions
required by the CAC, we face uncertainty as to whether any clearance or other required actions can be timely completed, or at all. Given
such uncertainty, we may be further required to suspend our relevant business, shut down our website, or face other penalties, which could
materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations. 

The CSRC has released the Trial
Measures for Administration of Overseas Securities Offerings and Listings by Domestic Companies (the Trial Measures ). While
such rules have not yet gone into effect, the Chinese government may exert more oversight and control over offerings that are conducted
overseas and foreign investment in China-based issuers, which could significantly limit or completely hinder our ability to continue to
offer our securities to investors and could cause the value of our securities to significantly decline or become worthless. 

On February 17, 2023, with
the approval of the State Council, the CSRC released the Trial Measures and five supporting guidelines, which came into effect
on March 31, 2023. According to the Trial Measures, (1) domestic companies that seek to offer or list securities overseas, both directly
and indirectly, should fulfill the filing procedures and report relevant information to the CSRC; if a domestic company fails to
complete the filing procedures or conceals any material fact or falsifies any major content in its filing documents, such domestic company
may be subject to administrative penalties by the CSRC, such as order to rectify, warnings, fines, and its controlling shareholders,
actual controllers, the person directly in charge and other directly liable persons may also be subject to administrative penalties, such
as warnings and fines; (2) if the issuer meets both of the following conditions, the overseas offerings and listings shall be determined
as an indirect overseas offerings and listings by a domestic company: (i) 50 or more of the issuer s operating revenue, total profit,
total assets or net assets as documented in its audited consolidated financial statements for the most recent accounting year is accounted
for by domestic enterprises; and; (ii) its major operational activities are carried out in China or its main places of business are located
in China, or the senior managers in charge of its business operation and management are mostly Chinese citizens or domiciled in China;
and (3) where a domestic company seeks to indirectly offer and list securities in an overseas market, the issuer shall designate a major
domestic operating entity responsible for all filing procedures with the CSRC, and where an issuer makes an application for initial
public offerings or listings in an overseas market, the issuer shall submit filings with the CSRC within three business days
after such application is submitted; if the issuer submits the application documents for offerings or listings in secret or non-public
ways overseas, it may submit an explanation at the time of filing, and the application shall be postponed until the application documents
are reported to the CSRC within three business days after the application documents are disclosed overseas. 

The Trial Measures, may subject
us to additional compliance requirements in the future, and we cannot assure you that we will be able to get the clearance of filing procedures
under the Trial Measures on a timely basis, or at all. Any failure of us to fully comply with new regulatory requirements may significantly
limit or completely hinder our ability to continue to offer our securities, cause significant disruption to our business operations, and
severely damage our reputation, which would materially and adversely affect our consolidated financial condition and results of operations
and cause our securities to significantly decline in value or become worthless. We believe that we, our PRC subsidiaries and the consolidated
VIEs are not required to fulfill filing procedures with the CSRC to continue to offer our securities, or continue listing on
the Nasdaq Capital Market, or operate the business of the consolidated VIEs. In addition, to date, none of us, our PRC subsidiaries or
the consolidated VIEs have received any filing or compliance requirements from CSRC for the listing of the Company at Nasdaq
Capital Market and all of its overseas offerings. However, there are substantial uncertainties regarding the interpretation and application
of the M A Rules, other PRC Laws and future PRC laws and regulations, and there can be no assurance that any PRC governmental agency
will not take a view that is contrary to or otherwise different from our belief stated herein 

28 

If we become directly subject to the recent
scrutiny, criticism and negative publicity involving U.S.-listed Chinese companies, we may have to expend significant resources to investigate
and resolve the matter which could harm our business operations, this offering and our reputation and could result in a loss of your investment
in our common stock, especially if such matter cannot be addressed and resolved favorably. 

Recently, U.S. public companies
that have substantially all of their operations in China, have been the subject of intense scrutiny, criticism and negative publicity
by investors, financial commentators and regulatory agencies, such as the SEC. Much of the scrutiny, criticism and negative publicity
has centered around financial and accounting irregularities, a lack of effective internal controls over financial accounting, inadequate
corporate governance policies or a lack of adherence thereto and, in many cases, allegations of fraud. As a result of the scrutiny, criticism
and negative publicity, the publicly traded stock of many U.S. listed Chinese companies has sharply decreased in value and, in some cases,
has become virtually worthless. Many of these companies are now subject to shareholder lawsuits and SEC enforcement actions and are conducting
internal and external investigations into the allegations. It is not clear what effect this sector-wide scrutiny, criticism and negative
publicity will have on our Company, our business and this offering. If we become the subject of any unfavorable allegations, whether such
allegations are proven to be true or untrue, we will have to expend significant resources to investigate such allegations and/or defend
the Company. This situation may be a major distraction to our management. If such allegations are not proven to be groundless, our Company
and business operations will be severely hampered and your investment in our common stock could be rendered worthless. 

You may face difficulties in protecting
your interests and exercising your rights as a stockholder since we conduct substantially all of our operations in China, and almost all
of our officers and directors reside outside the U.S. 

Although we are incorporated
in Nevada, we conduct substantially all of our operations in China. All of our current officers and almost all of our directors reside
outside the U.S. and substantially all of the assets of those persons are located outside of the U.S. It may be difficult for you to conduct
due diligence on the Company or such directors in your election of the directors and attend shareholders meeting if the meeting is held
in China. We plan to have one shareholder meeting each year at a location to be determined, potentially in China. As a result of all of
the above, our public shareholders may have more difficulty in protecting their interests through actions against our management, directors
or major shareholders than would shareholders of a corporation doing business entirely or predominantly within the U.S. 

The recent joint statement by the SEC and
PCAOB, proposed rule changes submitted by Nasdaq, and the Holding Foreign Companies Accountable Act all call for additional and more stringent
criteria to be applied to emerging market companies upon assessing the qualification of their auditors, especially the non-U.S. auditors
who are not inspected by the PCAOB. Although the audit report included in annual report was issued by U.S. auditors who are currently
inspected by the PCAOB, if it is later determined that the PCAOB is unable to inspect or investigate our auditor completely, investors
would be deprived of the benefits of such inspection and our common stock may be delisted or prohibited from trading. 

On April 21, 2020, SEC Chairman
Jay Clayton and PCAOB Chairman William D. Duhnke III, along with other senior SEC staff, released a joint statement highlighting the risks
associated with investing in companies based in or have substantial operations in emerging markets including China. The joint statement
emphasized the risks associated with lack of access for the PCAOB to inspect auditors and audit work papers in China and higher risks
of fraud in emerging markets. 

29 

On May 18, 2020, Nasdaq filed
three proposals with the SEC to (i) apply minimum offering size requirement for companies primarily operating in Restrictive Market ,
(ii) adopt a new requirement relating to the qualification of management or board of director for Restrictive Market companies, and (iii)
apply additional and more stringent criteria to an applicant or listed company based on the qualifications of the company s auditors. 

On May 20, 2020, the U.S.
Senate passed the Holding Foreign Companies Accountable Act requiring a foreign company to certify it is not owned or controlled by a foreign
government if the PCAOB is unable to audit specified reports because the company uses a foreign auditor not subject to PCAOB inspection.
If the PCAOB is unable to inspect the company s auditors for three consecutive years, the issuer s securities are prohibited
to trade on a national securities exchange or in the over the counter trading market in the U.S. On December 2, 2020, the U.S. House of
Representatives approved the Holding Foreign Companies Accountable Act. On December 18, 2020, the Holding Foreign Companies Accountable
Act was signed into law. 

On March 24, 2021, the SEC
announced that it had adopted interim final amendments to implement congressionally mandated submission and disclosure requirements of
the Act. The interim final amendments will apply to registrants that the SEC identifies as having filed an annual report on Forms
10-K, 20-F, 40-F or N-CSR with an audit report issued by a registered public accounting firm that is located in a foreign jurisdiction
and that the PCAOB has determined it is unable to inspect or investigate completely because of a position taken by an authority in that
jurisdiction. The SEC will implement a process for identifying such a registrant and any such identified registrant will be required to
submit documentation to the SEC establishing that it is not owned or controlled by a governmental entity in that foreign jurisdiction,
and will also require disclosure in the registrant s annual report regarding the audit arrangements of, and governmental influence
on, such a registrant. 

On June 22, 2021, the U.S.
Senate passed the Accelerating Holding Foreign Companies Accountable Act, and on December 29, 2022, legislation entitled Consolidated
Appropriations Act, 2023 (the Consolidated Appropriations Act was signed into law by President Biden, which contained,
among other things, an identical provision to the Accelerating Holding Foreign Companies Accountable Act and amended the HFCA Act by requiring
the SEC to prohibit an issuer s securities from trading on any U.S. stock exchanges if its auditor is not subject to PCAOB inspections
for two consecutive years instead of three, thus reducing the time period for triggering the prohibition on trading. 

On December 2, 2021, the SEC
issued amendments to finalize rules implementing the submission and disclosure requirements in the Holding Foreign Companies Accountable
Act. The rules apply to registrants that the SEC identifies as having filed an annual report with an audit report issued by a registered
public accounting firm that is located in a foreign jurisdiction and that PCAOB is unable to inspect or investigate completely because
of a position taken by an authority in foreign jurisdictions. 

On December 16, 2021, PCAOB
announced the PCAOB Holding Foreign Companies Accountable Act determinations (the PCAOB determinations relating to the
PCAOB s inability to inspect or investigate completely registered public accounting firms headquartered in mainland China of the
PRC or Hong Kong, a Special Administrative Region and dependency of the PRC, because of a position taken by one or more authorities in
the PRC or Hong Kong. 

On August 26, 2022, the CSRC,
the Ministry of Finance of the PRC (the MOF ), and the PCAOB signed a Statement of Protocol (the Protocol ),
governing inspections and investigations of audit firms based in mainland China and Hong Kong, taking the first step toward opening access
for the PCAOB to inspect and investigate registered public accounting firms headquartered in mainland China and Hong Kong. Pursuant to
the fact sheet with respect to the Protocol disclosed by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (the SEC ), the PCAOB
shall have independent discretion to select any issuer audits for inspection or investigation and has the unfettered ability to transfer
information to the SEC. 

On December 15, 2022, the PCAOB Board determined that the PCAOB was
able to secure complete access to inspect and investigate registered public accounting firms headquartered in mainland China and Hong
Kong and voted to vacate its previous determinations to the contrary. However, should PRC authorities obstruct or otherwise fail to facilitate
the PCAOB s access in the future, the PCAOB Board will consider the need to issue a new determination. Our auditor prior to
October 2022, WWC, P.C. had been inspected by the PCAOB on a regular basis in the audit period. Our current auditor, Enrome LLP, has been
inspected by the PCAOB on a regular basis as well. If it is later determined that the PCAOB is unable to inspect or investigate our auditor
completely, investors may be deprived of the benefits of such inspection. Any audit reports not issued by auditors that are completely
inspected by the PCAOB, or a lack of PCAOB inspections of audit work undertaken in China that prevents the PCAOB from regularly evaluating
our auditors audits and their quality control procedures, could result in a lack of assurance that our financial statements and
disclosures are adequate and accurate. Moreover, if trading in our securities is prohibited under the HFCAA in the future because the
PCAOB determines that it cannot inspect or fully investigate our auditor at such future time, an exchange may determine to delist our
securities 

30 

However, these recent developments
would add uncertainties to our offering, and we cannot assure you whether Nasdaq or regulatory authorities would apply additional and
more stringent criteria to us after considering the effectiveness of our auditor s audit procedures and quality control procedures,
adequacy of personnel and training, or sufficiency of resources, geographic reach or experience as it relates to the audit of our financial
statements. In the event it is later determined that the PCAOB is unable to inspect or investigate completely the Company s auditor
because of a position taken by an authority in a foreign jurisdiction, then such lack of inspection could cause trading in the Company s
securities to be prohibited under the Holding Foreign Companies Accountable Act, and ultimately result in a determination by a securities
exchange to delist the Company s securities. 

The M A Rules and certain other PRC
regulations establish complex procedures for some acquisitions of Chinese companies by foreign investors, which could make it more difficult
for us to pursue growth through acquisitions in China. 

The Regulations on Mergers
and Acquisitions of Domestic Companies by Foreign Investors, or the M A Rules, adopted by six PRC regulatory agencies in August 2006
and amended in 2009, and some other regulations and rules concerning mergers and acquisitions established additional procedures and requirements
that could make merger and acquisition activities by foreign investors more time consuming and complex, including requirements in some
instances that the MOC be notified in advance of any change-of-control transaction in which a foreign investor takes control of a PRC
domestic enterprise. For example, the M A Rules require that MOFCOM be notified in advance of any change-of-control transaction in
which a foreign investor takes control of a PRC domestic enterprise, if (i) any important industry is concerned, (ii) such transaction
involves factors that impact or may impact national economic security, or (iii) such transaction will lead to a change in control of a
domestic enterprise which holds a famous trademark or PRC time-honored brand. Moreover, the Anti-Monopoly Law promulgated by the SCNPC
effective in 2008 requires that transactions which are deemed concentrations and involve parties with specified turnover thresholds (i.e.,
during the previous fiscal year, (i) the total global turnover of all operators participating in the transaction exceeds RMB10 billion
and at least two of these operators each had a turnover of more than RMB400 million within China, or (ii) the total turnover within China
of all the operators participating in the concentration exceeded RMB 2 billion, and at least two of these operators each had a turnover
of more than RMB 400 million within China) must be cleared by MOFCOM before they can be completed. 

Moreover, the Anti-Monopoly
Law requires that the MOC shall be notified in advance of any concentration of undertaking if certain thresholds are triggered. In addition,
the security review rules issued by the MOC that became effective in September 2011 specify that mergers and acquisitions by foreign investors
that raise national defense and security concerns and mergers and acquisitions through which foreign investors may acquire
de facto control over domestic enterprises that raise national security concerns are subject to strict review by the MOC,
and the rules prohibit any activities attempting to bypass a security review, including by structuring the transaction through a proxy
or contractual control arrangement. In the future, we may grow our business by acquiring complementary businesses. Complying with the
requirements of the above-mentioned regulations and other relevant rules to complete such transactions could be time consuming, and any
required approval processes, including obtaining approval from the MOC or its local counterparts may delay or inhibit our ability to complete
such transactions, which could affect our ability to expand our business or maintain our market share. 

If Highlight Media fails to maintain the
requisite licenses and approvals required under PRC law, our business, financial condition and results of operations may be materially
and adversely affected. 

Foreign investment is highly
regulated by the PRC government and local authorities. Highlight Media is required to obtain and maintain certain licenses or approvals
from different regulatory authorities in order to operate their respective current businesses. These licenses and approvals are essential
to the operation of their businesses, for example, the value-added telecommunication business carried out by Highlight Media. If Highlight
Media fails to obtain or maintain any of the required licenses or approvals for its business, we may be subject to various penalties,
such as fines and the discontinuation or restriction of its operations. Any such disruption in the business operations of Highlight Media
could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. 

31 

You may experience difficulties in effecting
service of legal process, enforcing foreign judgments or bringing original actions against us or our management, in China, based upon
United States laws, including the U.S. federal securities laws, or other foreign laws. 

We are a company incorporated
in Nevada. Substantially all of our operations are conducted in China, and substantially all of our assets are located in China. All of
our current directors and officers reside in China, and substantially all of the assets of those persons are located outside of the United
States. As a result, it may be difficult for a shareholder to effect service of process within the United States upon these persons, or
to enforce judgments against us which are obtained in United States courts, including judgments predicated upon the civil liability provisions
of the securities laws of the United States or any state in the United States. 

The recognition and enforcement
of foreign judgments are provided for under the PRC Civil Procedures Law. PRC courts may recognize and enforce foreign judgments in accordance
with the requirements of the PRC Civil Procedures Law based either on treaties between China and the country where the judgment is made
or on principles of reciprocity between jurisdictions. China does not have any treaties or other form of reciprocity with the United States
providing for the reciprocal recognition and enforcement of foreign judgments. In addition, according to the PRC Civil Procedures Law,
courts in the PRC will not enforce a foreign judgment against us or our directors or officers if they decide that the judgment violates
the basic principles of PRC laws, national sovereignty, security or public interest. As a result, it is uncertain whether and on what
basis a PRC court would enforce a judgment rendered by a court in the United States. 

In the event shareholders
originate an action against a company without domicile in China for disputes related to contracts or other property interests, the PRC
courts may accept a cause of action if (a) the disputed contract is concluded or performed in the PRC or the disputed subject matter
is located in the PRC, (b) the company (as defendant) has properties that can be seized within the PRC, (c) the company has a representative
organization within the PRC, or (d) the parties chose to submit to the jurisdiction of the PRC courts in the contract on the condition
that such submission does not violate the requirements of jurisdiction under the PRC Civil Procedures Law. The action may be initiated
by the shareholder by filing a complaint with the PRC courts. The PRC courts would determine whether to accept the complaint in accordance
with the PRC Civil Procedures Law. The shareholder may participate in the action by itself or entrust any other person or PRC legal counsel
to participate on behalf of such shareholder. Foreign citizens and companies will have the same rights as PRC citizens and companies
in such an action unless such foreign country restricts the rights of PRC citizens and companies.

Risks Related to Our Business and Operations 

Failure to manage Highlight Media effectively
since its acquisition could materially impact our business. 

The recent acquisition of
Highlight Media have placed, and future growth will place, a significant strain on the Company s management, administrative, operational
and financial infrastructure. The Company s success will depend in part on its ability to manage Highlight Media effectively. To
manage the recent and expected growth of its operations and personnel, the Company will need to continue to improve its operational, financial
and management controls and its reporting systems and procedures. Failure to effectively manage Highlight Media could result in difficulty
or delays in deploying the Company s services to customers, declines in quality or customer satisfaction, increases in costs, difficulties
in introducing new features or other operational difficulties. Any of these difficulties could adversely impact the Company s business
performance and results of operations. 

The limited operating history and evolving
business model of Highlight Media make it difficult to evaluate its business and future prospects and the risks and challenges it may
encounter. 

Highlight Media commenced
operations in 2016. The evaluations of the business and prediction about future performance may not be as accurate as they would be if
Highlight Media had a longer operating history. In the event that actual results differ from the expectation, the investors perceptions
of Highlight Media's business and future prospects could change materially, which may adversely affect the price of our common stock. 

If Highlight Media s fails to maintain
strong relationships with the clients, authors and other creative talent, as well as to develop relationships with new creative talent,
its business could be adversely affected. 

Highlight Media s business
is highly dependent on maintaining strong relationships with the clients, authors and other creative talent who produce the products and
services that are sold to its customers. Any overall weakening of these relationships, or the failure to develop successful new relationships,
could have an adverse impact on Highlight Media s business and financial performance. 

Increases in certain operating costs and
expenses, which are beyond our control and can significantly affect our profitability, could adversely affect our operating performance. 

Highlight Media s major
expense categories include employee compensation. Compensation costs are influenced by general economic factors, including those affecting
costs of health insurance, postretirement benefits and any trends specific to the employee skill sets that Highlight Media requires. 

Highlight Media maintains an experienced
and dedicated employee base that executes its strategies. Failure to attract, retain and develop this employee base could result in difficulty
with executing our strategy. 

Highlight Media s employees,
notably its senior executives and editorial staff members, have substantial experience in the publishing and education markets. In addition,
Highlight Media continues in the process of implementing a strategic information technology transformation process, requiring diverse
levels of relevant expertise and experience. If Highlight Media were unable to continue to adequately maintain and develop a workforce
of this nature meeting the foregoing needs, including the development of new skills in the context of a rapidly changing business environment
created by technology, involving new business processes and increased access to data and data analytics, it could negatively impact Highlight
Media s operations and growth prospects. 

33 

Highlight Media may face disruption to third-party
technology systems and resulting interruptions in the availability of its services. 

The satisfactory performance,
reliability and availability of our services are critical to our success. We rely on third-party technology infrastructure, websites and
social media platforms. However, the technology systems or infrastructure may not function properly at all times. Such third-party technology
infrastructure may experience telecommunications failures, computer viruses, failures during the process of upgrading or replacing software,
databases or components, power outages, hardware failures, user errors, or other attempts to harm Highlight Media s ability to provide
services. Further, hackers, acting individually or in coordinated groups, may also launch distributed denial of service attacks or other
coordinated attacks that may cause service outages or other interruptions in Highlight Media s business. 

Highlight Media may be subject to intellectual
property infringement claims. 

We cannot be certain that
Highlight Media's operations or any aspects of its business do not or will not infringe upon or otherwise violate trademarks, patents,
copyrights, know-how or other intellectual property rights held by third parties. Highlight Media may be from time to time in the
future subject to legal proceedings and claims relating to the intellectual property rights of others. In addition, there may be third-party trademarks,
patents, copyrights, know-how or other intellectual property rights that are infringed by Highlight Media's services or other aspects
of its business without its awareness. If any third-party infringement claims are brought against Highlight Media, it may be forced
to divert management s time and other resources from its business and operations to defend against these claims, regardless of their
merits. 

Highlight Media may fail to make necessary
or desirable strategic alliance, acquisition or investment, and we may not be able to achieve the benefits we expect from the alliances,
acquisition or investments we make. 

Highlight Media may pursue
selected strategic alliances and potential strategic acquisitions that are supplemental to our business and operations, including opportunities
that can help us further expand our product and service offerings and improve our technology system. However, strategic alliances with
third parties could subject Highlight Media to a number of risks, including risks associated with sharing proprietary information, non-performance or
default by counterparties, and increased expenses in establishing these new alliances, any of which may materially and adversely affect
our business. In addition, Highlight Media may have limited ability to control or monitor the actions of its strategic partners. To the
extent a strategic partner suffers any negative publicity as a result of its business operations, Highlight Media's reputation may be
negatively affected by virtue of its association with such party. 

The costs of identifying and
consummating strategic acquisitions may be significant and subsequent integrations of newly acquired companies, businesses, assets and
technologies would require significant managerial and financial resources and could result in a diversion of resources from our existing
business, which in turn could have an adverse effect on our growth and business operations. In addition, investments and acquisitions
could result in the use of substantial amounts of cash, potentially dilutive issuances of equity securities and exposure to potential
unknown liabilities of the acquired business. The acquired businesses or assets may not generate the financial results Highlight Media
expects and may incur losses. The cost and duration of integrating newly acquired businesses could also materially exceed our expectations.
If Highlight Media's portfolio do not perform as we expect, its results of operation and profitability may be adversely affected. 

34 

Our financial results
would suffer if Highlight Media fails to successfully differentiate its offerings and meet market needs. 

Highlight Media is subject
to the risks that it will not successfully develop and execute promotional strategies in response to future customer trends or technological
changes or that it will not otherwise meet market needs in these businesses in a timely or cost-effective fashion. If the Company cannot
attract new customers and meet the changing preferences and demands of these customers, its revenues and cash flows could be negatively
impacted. 

Cyber risk and
the failure to maintain the integrity of Highlight Media's operational or security systems or infrastructure, or those of third parties
with which Highlight Media does business, could have a material adverse effect on Highlight Media's business, consolidated financial condition,
and results of operations. 

The cybersecurity risks Highlight
Media faces range from cyberattacks common to most industries, such as the development and deployment of malicious software to gain access
to its networks and attempt to steal confidential information, launch distributed denial of service attacks, or attempt other coordinated
disruptions, to more advanced threats that target Highlight Media. 

Like many multinational corporations,
Highlight Media, and some third parties upon which Highlight Media relies, has experienced cyberattacks on its computer systems and networks
in the past and may experience them in the future, likely with more frequency and sophistication and involving a broader range of devices
and modes of attack, all of which will increase the difficulty of detecting and successfully defending against them. To date, none have
resulted in any material adverse impact to its business, operations, products, services, or customers. Highlight Media has invested in
Cybersecurity tools and resources to keep its systems safe. However, the security measures implemented by Highlight Media or by its outside
service providers may not be effective, and our systems (and those of the outside service providers) may be vulnerable to theft, loss,
damage and interruption from a number of potential sources and events, including unauthorized access or security breaches, cyber-attacks,
computer viruses, power loss, or other disruptive events. 

Changes in global economic conditions could
impact our ability to borrow funds and meet our future financing needs. 

Changes in global financial
markets have not had, nor do we anticipate they will have, a significant impact on our liquidity. Due to our significant operating cash
flow, financial assets, access to capital markets, and available lines of credit and revolving credit agreements, we continue to believe
that we have the ability to meet our financing needs for the foreseeable future. As market conditions change, we will continue to monitor
our liquidity position. However, there can be no assurance that our liquidity or our consolidated financial position and results of operations
will not be adversely affected by possible future changes in global financial markets and global economic conditions. Unprecedented market
conditions including illiquid credit markets, volatile equity markets, dramatic fluctuations in foreign currency rates, and economic recession,
could affect future results. 

35 

Risks Related to Our Securities 

The price of our common stock could be
subject to rapid and substantial volatility. Such volatility, including any stock run-ups, may be unrelated to our actual or
expected operating performance and financial condition or prospects, making it difficult for prospective investors to assess the
rapidly changing value of our common stock. Volatility in our common stock price may subject us to securities
litigation. 

The market for our
common stock may have, when compared to seasoned issuers, significant price volatility and we expect that the price of our shares of
common stock may continue to be more volatile than that of a seasoned issuer for the indefinite future. As a relatively
small-capitalization company with a relatively small public float, we may experience greater share price volatility, extreme price
run-ups, lower trading volume, and less liquidity than large-capitalization companies. In particular, our common stock may be
subject to rapid and substantial price volatility, low volumes of trades, and large spreads in bid and ask prices. Such volatility,
including any stock run-ups, may be unrelated to our actual or expected operating performance and financial condition or prospects,
making it difficult for prospective investors to assess the rapidly changing value of our common stock. 

In addition, if the trading
volumes of our common stock are low, persons buying or selling in relatively small quantities may easily influence the price of our common
stock. This low volume of trades could also cause the price of our common stock to fluctuate greatly, with large percentage changes in
price occurring in any trading day session. Holders of our common stock may also not be able to readily liquidate their investment or
may be forced to sell at depressed prices due to low volume trading. Broad market fluctuations and general economic and political conditions
may also adversely affect the market price of our common stock. As a result of this volatility, investors may experience losses on their
investment in our common stock. A decline in the market price of our common stock also could adversely affect our ability to issue additional
common stock or other securities and our ability to obtain additional financing in the future. No assurance can be given that an active
market in our common stock will develop or be sustained. If an active market does not develop, holders of our common stock may be unable
to readily sell the shares they hold or may not be able to sell their shares at all. 

In a addition, in the past, plaintiffs have often initiated securities
class action litigation against a company following periods of volatility in the market price of its securities. We may, in the future,
be the target of similar litigation. Securities litigation could result in substantial costs and liabilities to the Company and could
divert our management s attention and resources. 

We will need additional capital in the future.
If additional capital is not available, we may not be able to continue to operate our business pursuant to our business plan or we may
have to discontinue our operations entirely. 

Regardless of the success
of this offering, we will require additional capital in the future. We have incurred losses in each year since our inception. If we continue
to use cash at our historical rates of use we will need significant additional financing, which we may seek through a combination of private
and public equity offerings, debt financings and collaborations and strategic and licensing arrangements. To the extent that we raise
additional capital through the sale of equity or convertible debt securities, the ownership interest will be diluted, and the terms of
any such offerings may include liquidation or other preferences that may adversely affect the then existing shareholders rights. Debt
financing, if available, would result in increased fixed payment obligations and may involve agreements that include covenants limiting
or restricting our ability to take specific actions such as incurring debt or making capital expenditures. If we raise additional funds
through collaboration, strategic alliance or licensing arrangements with third parties, we may have to relinquish valuable rights to our
technologies, future revenue streams or product candidates, or grant licenses on terms that are not favorable to us. 

Raising additional capital by issuing shares
may cause dilution to existing shareholders. 

We are currently authorized
to issue 200,000,000 shares of common stock. As of March 31, 2023, we had 1,711,544 shares of common stock issued and outstanding. 

36 

We may seek additional capital
through a combination of private and public equity offerings, debt financings and collaborations and strategic and licensing arrangements.
To the extent that we raise additional capital through the sale of equity or convertible debt securities, the ownership interest will
be diluted, and the terms of any such offerings may include liquidation or other preferences that may adversely affect the then existing
shareholders rights. Debt financing, if available, would result in increased fixed payment obligations and may involve agreements that
include covenants limiting or restricting our ability to take specific actions such as incurring debt or making capital expenditures.
If we raise additional funds through collaboration, strategic alliance or licensing arrangements with third parties, we may have to relinquish
valuable rights to our technologies, future revenue streams or product candidates, or grant licenses on terms that are not favorable to
us. 

Future sales of our common stock could reduce the market price
of the common stock. 

Substantial sales of our common
stock may cause the market price of our common stock to decline. Sales by us or our security holders of substantial amounts of our common
stock, or the perception that these sales may occur in the future, could cause a reduction in the market price of our common stock. 

The issuance of any additional
shares of our common stock or any securities that are exercisable for or convertible into our common stock, may have an adverse effect
on the market price of the common stock and will have a dilutive effect on our existing shareholders and holders of common stock. 

We do not know whether a market for the common stock will be sustained or what the trading price of the common stock will be and as a
result it may be difficult for you to sell your shares. 

Although our common stock
trade on Nasdaq, an active trading market for the common stock may not be sustained. It may be difficult for you to sell your shares without
depressing the market price for the common stock. As a result of these and other factors, you may not be able to sell your shares. Further,
an inactive market may also impair our ability to raise capital by selling common stock, or may impair our ability to enter into strategic
partnerships or acquire companies or products by using our shares as consideration. 

We have no plans to pay dividends on our
shares, and you may not receive funds without selling the shares. 

We have not declared or paid
any cash dividends on our common stock, nor do we expect to pay any cash dividends on our common stock for the foreseeable future. We
currently intend to retain any additional future earnings to finance our operations and growth and, therefore, we have no plans to pay
cash dividends on our common stock at this time. Any future determination to pay cash dividends on our common stock will be at the discretion
of our board of directors and will be dependent on our earnings, financial condition, operating results, capital requirements, any contractual
restrictions, and other factors that our board of directors deems relevant. Accordingly, you may have to sell some or all of the shares
in order to generate cash from your investment. You may not receive a gain on your investment when you sell the shares and may lose the
entire amount of your investment. 

A possible short squeeze due
to a sudden increase in demand of our common stock that largely exceeds supply may lead to additional price volatility. 

Historically there has not
been a large short position in our common stock. However, in the future investors may purchase shares of our common stock to hedge
existing exposure or to speculate on the price of our common stock. Speculation on the price of our common stock may involve long and
short exposures. To the extent an aggregate short exposure in our common stock becomes significant, investors with short exposure may
have to pay a premium to purchase shares for delivery to share lenders at times if and when the price of our common stock increases significantly,
particularly over a short period of time. Those purchases may in turn, dramatically increase the price of our common stock. This is often
referred to as a short squeeze. A short squeeze could lead to volatile price movements in our common stock that
are not directly correlated to our business prospects, financial performance or other traditional measures of value for the Company or
its common stock. 

We have granted participation rights which
could affect our ability to raise funds. 

Pursuant to the securities
purchase agreement with the investors from the February 2021 Offering, we granted such investors participation rights with respect to
issuance of common stock or common stock equivalents within 12 months after the date of the securities purchase agreement. This participation
right could delay, limit or hinder our ability to enter into equity financings and to raise funds from third parties. 

37 

As a smaller reporting company 
under applicable law, we will be subject to lessened disclosure requirements. Such reduced disclosure may make our common stock less attractive
to investors. 

For as long as we remain an
 smaller reporting company as defined in Rule 405 of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the Securities Act and Item 10 of the Regulation S-K, we will elect to take advantage of certain exemptions from various reporting requirements that are
applicable to other public companies that are not smaller reporting companies , including, but not limited to, not being
required to comply with the auditor attestation requirements of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, reduced disclosure obligations
regarding executive compensation in our periodic reports and proxy statements, and the ability to include only two years of audited
financial statements and only two years of related management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results
of operations disclosure. Because of these lessened regulatory requirements, our stockholders would be left without information or rights
available to stockholders of more mature companies. If some investors find our common stock less attractive as a result, there may be
a less active trading market for our common stock and our stock price may be more volatile.

(a) Market Information 

Our common stock is traded
on the Nasdaq Capital Market and OTC Market under the symbols GDC . 

(b) Holders 

On March 31, 2023, there are approximately 325 holders of record of
our common stock. 

(c) Dividends

(d) Securities Authorized for Issuance Under Equity Compensation
Plans. 

We established our 2019 Equity
Incentive Plan (the Plan ). The Plan was approved by our board of directors on December 12, 2019 and was approved by our
stockholders at our annual meeting in 2019. The purpose of the Plan is to grant stock and options to purchase our common stock to our
employees, directors and key consultants. The maximum number of shares of common stock that may be issued pursuant to awards granted under
the Plan, is 3,000,000 shares. 

The following summary briefly describes the principal
features of the Plan and is qualified in its entirety by reference to the full text of the Plan. 

Administration. Our
Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors will administer the Plan. The Committee will have the authority to determine the terms
and conditions of any agreements evidencing any Awards granted under the Plan and to adopt, alter and repeal rules, guidelines and practices
relating to the Plan. Our Compensation Committee will have full discretion to administer and interpret the Plan and to adopt such rules,
regulations and procedures as it deems necessary or advisable. 

Eligibility. Current
or prospective employees, directors, officers, advisors or consultants of the Company or its affiliates are eligible to participate in
the Plan. Our Compensation Committee has the sole and complete authority to determine who will be granted an award under the Plan, however,
it may delegate such authority to one or more officers of the Company under the circumstances set forth in the Plan. 

39 

Number of Shares Authorized. The
Plan provides for an aggregate of Three Million (3,000,000) common stock to be available for awards. If an award is forfeited or
if any option terminates, expires or lapses without being exercised, the common stock subject to such award will again be made available
for future grant. Shares of common stock that are used to pay the exercise price of an option or that are withheld to satisfy the Participant s
tax withholding obligation will not be available for re-grant under the Plan. 

Each common share subject
to an option or a stock appreciation right will reduce the number of common stock available for issuance by one share, and each common
share underlying an award of restricted stock, restricted stock units, stock bonus awards and performance compensation awards will reduce
the number of common stock available for issuance by one share. 

If there is any change in
our corporate capitalization, the Compensation Committee in its sole discretion may make substitutions or adjustments to the number of
shares reserved for issuance under our Plan, the number of shares covered by awards then outstanding under our Plan, the limitations on
awards under our Plan, the exercise price of outstanding options and such other equitable substitution or adjustments as it may determine
appropriate. 

The Plan has a term of ten
years and no further awards may be granted under the Plan after that date. 

Awards Available for Grant. Our
Compensation Committee may grant awards of con-qualified stock options, incentive (qualified) stock options, stock appreciation rights,
restricted stock, restricted stock units, stock bonus awards, performance compensation awards (including cash bonus awards) or any combination
of the foregoing. 

Options. Our Compensation
Committee will be authorized to grant options to purchase common stock that are either qualified, meaning they are intended
to satisfy the requirements of Internal Revenue Code of 1986 (the Code Section 422 for incentive stock options, or non-qualified, 
meaning they are not intended to satisfy the requirements of Section 422 of the Code. Options granted under the Plan will be subject to
the terms and conditions established by our Compensation Committee. Under the terms of the Plan, the exercise price of the options will
be set forth in the applicable Award agreement. Options granted under the Plan will be subject to such terms, including the exercise price
and the conditions and timing of exercise, as may be determined by our Compensation Committee and specified in the applicable award agreement.
The maximum term of an option granted under the Plan will be ten years from the date of grant (or five years in the case of a qualified
option granted to a 10 stockholder). 

Stock Appreciation Rights. Our
Compensation Committee will be authorized to award stock appreciation rights (or SARs) under the Plan. SARs will be subject to the terms
and conditions established by our Compensation Committee. An SAR is a contractual right that allows a participant to receive, either in
the form of cash, shares or any combination of cash and shares, the appreciation, if any, in the value of a share over a certain period
of time. An Option granted under the Plan may include SARs and SARs may also be awarded to a participant independent of the grant of an
option. SARs granted in connection with an option shall be subject to terms similar to the option corresponding to such SARs. SARs shall
be subject to terms established by our Compensation Committee and reflected in the award agreement. 

Restricted Stock. Our
Compensation Committee will be authorized to award restricted stock under the Plan. Our Compensation Committee will determine the terms
of such restricted stock awards. Restricted stock is common stock that generally is non-transferable and subject to other restrictions
determined by our Compensation Committee for a specified period. Unless our Compensation Committee determines otherwise or specifies otherwise
in an award agreement, if the participant terminates employment or services during the restricted period, then any unvested restricted
stock is forfeited. 

Restricted Stock Unit Awards. Our
Compensation Committee will be authorized to award restricted stock unit awards. Our Compensation Committee will determine the terms of
such restricted stock units. Unless our Compensation Committee determines otherwise or specifies otherwise in an award agreement, if the
participant terminates employment or services during the period of time over which all or a portion of the units are to be earned, then
any unvested units will be forfeited. 

40

of Financial Condition and Results of Operations 

The following discussion
and analysis of the results of our operations and financial condition should be read in conjunction with our financial statements, and
the notes to those financial statements that are included elsewhere in this Report. All monetary figures are presented in U.S. dollars,
unless otherwise indicated. 

Our Management s
Discussion and Analysis contains not only statements that are historical facts, but also statements that are forward-looking. Forward-looking
statements are, by their very nature, uncertain and risky. These risks and uncertainties include international, national, and local general
economic and market conditions; our ability to sustain, manage, or forecast growth; our ability to successfully make and integrate acquisitions;
new product development and introduction; existing government regulations and changes in, or the failure to comply with, government regulations;
adverse publicity; competition; the loss of significant customers or suppliers; fluctuations and difficulty in forecasting operating results;
change in business strategy or development plans; business disruptions; the ability to attract and retain qualified personnel; the ability
to protect technology; the risk of foreign currency exchange rate; and other risks that might be detailed from time to time in our filings
with the Securities and Exchange Commission. 

Although the forward-looking
statements in this Report reflect the good faith judgment of our management, such statements can only be based on facts and factors currently
known by them. Consequently, and because forward-looking statements are inherently subject to risks and uncertainties, the actual results
and outcomes may differ materially from the results and outcomes discussed in the forward-looking statements. You are urged to carefully
review and consider the various disclosures made by us in this report as we attempt to advise interested parties of the risks and factors
that may affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations and prospects.

Overview 

GD Culture Group Limited GDC ,
formerly known as JM Global Holding Company, TMSR Holding Company Limited and Code Chain New Continent Limited) is a holding company incorporated
in the State of Nevada with no material operations of its own. We currently conduct business through Shanghai Highlight Media Co., Ltd. Highlight Media ). Highlight WFOE is the primary beneficiary of Highlight Media for accounting purposes, because, pursuant
to the VIE agreements, Highlight Media shall pay Highlight WFOE service fees in the amount of 100 of Highlight Media s net income,
while Highlight WFOE is obligated to absorb all of losses of Highlight Media. As a result, we consolidate the financial results of
Highlight Media in our consolidated financial statements under U.S. GAAP. Such VIE structure involves unique risks to investors. The VIE
agreements have not been tested in a court of law and the Chinese regulatory authorities could disallow this VIE structure, which would
likely result in a material change in our operations and the value of our securities, including that it could cause the value of such
securities to significantly decline or become worthless. For more details on the VIE structure, please see Item 1. Business 
Corporate Structure - Contractual Arrangements between Highlight Media And Highlight WFOE and Item 1A. Risk Factors 
Risks Related to Our Corporate Structure . 

Prior to September 28, 2022,
we were also engaged in research, development and application of Internet of Things (IoT) and electronic tokens Wuge digital door signs
through Wuge Network Games Co., Ltd. Wuge ), a then VIE of the Company. On September 28, 2022, the Company entered into
a share purchase agreement with a buyer unaffiliated with the Company (the Buyer ), and Wei Xu, former Chief Executive Officer,
President and Chairman of the Board of the Company (the Payee ). Pursuant to the agreement, the Company agreed to sell and
the Buyer agreed to purchase all the issued and outstanding ordinary shares of Wuge, a PRC company and an indirect subsidiary of the Company.
The Payee agreed to be responsible for the payment of the purchase price on behalf of the Buyer. On September 30, 2022, the Company closed
the sale of the Wuge and caused the GDC Shares to be cancelled. As a result, as of September 30, 2022, operations of Wuge have been designated
as discontinued operations. 

Key Factors that Affect Operating Results 

Highlight Media, founded in
2016, is an integrated marketing service agency, focusing on enterprise brand management, crisis public relations, intelligent public
opinion monitoring, media PR, financial and economic we-media operation, digital face application, large-scale exhibition services and
other businesses. It is committed to becoming a modern science and technology media organization that fully empowers the development of
customer enterprises in the era of artificial intelligence and big data. Its growth strategy is substantially dependent upon our ability
to market our intended products and services successfully to prospective clients in China. This requires that we heavily rely upon our
sales and marketing team and marketing partners. Failure to reach potential clients will significantly affect our results of operation
and could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial conditions and the results of our operations. 

The threats to network and
data security are increasingly diverse and sophisticated. Despite the efforts and processes to prevent breaches, the social media platforms,
systems and services of third parties that Highlight Media uses in its operations are vulnerable to cyber security risks, including cyber-attacks
such as viruses and worms, phishing attacks, denial-of-service attacks, physical or electronic break-ins, employee theft or misuse, and
similar disruptions from unauthorized tampering with the servers and computer systems or those of third parties that Highlight Media use
in its operations, which could lead to interruptions, delays, loss of critical data, and loss of consumer confidence. 

In addition, Highlight Media
may be the target of email scams that attempt to acquire sensitive information or company assets. Despite the efforts to create security
barriers to such threats, Highlight Media may not be able to entirely mitigate these risks. Any cyber-attack that attempts to obtain our
data and assets, disrupt Highlight Media s service, or otherwise access the social media platforms, systems and services of third
parties that Highlight Media uses, if successful, could adversely affect the business, operating results, and financial condition, be
expensive to remedy, and damage the reputation of Highlight Media. 

The media industries involving
IoT devices, software and services are characterized by the existence of a large number of patents, copyrights, trademarks and trade secrets
and by frequent litigation based on allegations of infringement or other violations of intellectual property rights. Much of this litigation
involves patent holding companies or other adverse patent owners who have no relevant product revenues of their own, and against whom
our own patent portfolio may provide little or no deterrence. 

43 

The nature of Highlight Media s
business and its publications involves copy rights. We cannot assure you that we, our subsidiaries or the variable interest entities will
prevail in any future copyright infringement litigations. Defending such claims, regardless of their merit, could be time-consuming and
distracting to management, result in costly litigation or settlement, cause delays, or require us, our subsidiaries or the variable interest
to enter into royalty or licensing agreements. In addition, we, our subsidiaries or the variable interest entities could be obligated
to indemnify our customers against third parties claims of intellectual property infringement based on publications. If our products
or solutions violate any third-party intellectual property rights, we could be required to withdraw them from the market, re-edit and
re-publish them or seek to obtain licenses from third parties, which might not be available on reasonable terms or at all. Any efforts
re-edit and re-publish our publications, obtain licenses from third parties on favorable terms might not be successful and, in any case,
might substantially increase our costs and harm our business, financial condition and operating results. Withdrawal of any of our publications
from the market could harm our business, financial condition and operating results. 

Impact of the COVID-19 Pandemic 

The COVID-19 pandemic did
not have a material impact on our business or results of operation during the fiscal years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021. However,
the extent to which the COVID-19 pandemic may negatively impact the general economy and our business is highly uncertain and cannot be
accurately predicted. These uncertainties may impede our ability to conduct our operations and could materially and adversely affect our
business, financial condition and results of operations, and as a result could adversely affect our stock price and create more volatility.

of Wuge. 

Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates 

The preparation of financial
statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States requires our management to make assumptions,
estimates and judgments that affect the amounts reported, including the notes thereto, and related disclosures of commitments and contingencies,
if any. We have identified certain accounting policies that are significant to the preparation of our consolidated financial statements.
These accounting policies are important for an understanding of our financial condition and results of operation. Critical accounting
policies are those that are most important to the portrayal of our financial conditions and results of operations and require management s
difficult, subjective, or complex judgment, often as a result of the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently
uncertain and may change in subsequent periods. Certain accounting estimates are particularly sensitive because of their significance
to financial statements and because of the possibility that future events affecting the estimate may differ significantly from management s
current judgments. We believe the following critical accounting policies involve the most significant estimates and judgments used in
the preparation of our consolidated financial statements. 

45 

Cash and cash equivalents 

The Company considers certain
short-term, highly liquid investments with an original maturity of three months or less, when purchased, to be cash equivalents. Cash
and cash equivalents primarily represent bank deposits and fixed deposits with maturities of less than three months. 

Investments 

The Company purchases certain
liquid short term investments such as money market funds and or other short term debt securities marketed by large financial institutions.
These investments are not insured against loss of principal. These investments are accounted for as financial instruments that are marked
to fair market value at the end of each reporting period. As result of their short maturities, and limited risk profile, at times, their
amortized carrying cost may be the best approximation their fair value. 

Accounts receivable, net 

Accounts receivable include
trade accounts due from customers. An allowance for doubtful accounts may be established and recorded based on management s assessment
of potential losses based on the credit history and relationships with the customers. Management reviews its receivables on a regular
basis to determine if the bad debt allowance is adequate, and adjusts the allowance when necessary. Delinquent account balances are written-off
against allowance for doubtful accounts after management has determined that the likelihood of collection is not probable. 

Inventories 

Inventories are comprised
of raw materials, work in progress and finished goods and are stated at the lower of cost or net realizable value using the weighted average
method in Rong Hai. Management reviews inventories for obsolescence and cost in excess of net realizable value at least annually and records
a reserve against the inventory when the carrying value exceeds net realizable value. 

Prepayments 

Prepayments are funds deposited
or advanced to outside vendors for future inventory purchases. As a standard practice in China, many of the Company s vendors require
a certain amount to be deposited with them as a guarantee that the Company will complete its purchases on a timely basis. This amount
is refundable and bears no interest. The Company has legally binding contracts with its vendors, which require any outstanding prepayments
to be returned to the Company when the contract ends. 

Fair value measurement 

The accounting standard regarding
fair value of financial instruments and related fair value measurements defines financial instruments and requires disclosure of the fair
value of financial instruments held by us. The Company considers the carrying amount of cash, notes receivable, accounts receivable, other
receivables, prepayments, accounts payable, other payables and accrued liabilities, customer deposits, short term loans and taxes payable
to approximate their fair values because of their short term nature. 

46 

The accounting standards define
fair value, establish a three-level valuation hierarchy for disclosures of fair value measurement and enhance disclosure requirements
for fair value measures. The three levels are defined as follow: 

Level 1 inputs to the valuation methodology are quoted prices (unadjusted) for identical assets or liabilities in active markets. 

Level 2 inputs to the valuation methodology include quoted prices for similar assets and liabilities in active markets, and inputs that are observable for the assets or liability, either directly or indirectly, for substantially the full term of the financial instruments. 

Level 3 inputs to the valuation methodology are unobservable and significant to the fair value. 

Financial instruments included
in current assets and current liabilities are reported in the consolidated balance sheets at face value or cost, which approximate fair
value because of the short period of time between the origination of such instruments and their expected realization and their current
market rates of interest. 

Revenue recognition 

On January 1, 2018, the Company
adopted Accounting Standards Update ASU 2014-09 Revenue from Contracts with Customers (ASC 606) using the modified retrospective
method for contracts that were not completed as of January 1, 2018. This did not result in an adjustment to retained earnings upon
adoption of this new guidance as the Company s revenue, other than warranty revenues, was recognized based on the amount of consideration
we expect to receive in exchange for satisfying the performance obligations. However, the impact of the Company s warranty revenue
was not material as of the date of adoption, and as a result, did not result in an adjustment. 

The core principle underlying
the revenue recognition ASU is that the Company will recognize revenue to represent the transfer of goods and services to customers in
an amount that reflects the consideration to which the Company expects to be entitled in such exchange. This will require the Company
to identify contractual performance obligations and determine whether revenue should be recognized at a point in time or over time, based
on when control of goods and services transfers to a customer. The Company s revenue streams are primarily recognized at a
point in time except for the warranty revenues where the warranty periods are recognized over the warranty period, usually is a period
of twelve months. 

The ASU requires the use of
a new five-step model to recognize revenue from customer contracts. The five-step model requires that the Company (i) identify the contract
with the customer, (ii) identify the performance obligations in the contract, (iii) determine the transaction price, including variable
consideration to the extent that it is probable that a significant future reversal will not occur, (iv) allocate the transaction price
to the respective performance obligations in the contract, and (v) recognize revenue when (or as) the Company satisfies the performance
obligation. The application of the five-step model to the revenue streams compared to the prior guidance did not result in significant
changes in the way the Company records its revenue. Upon adoption, the Company evaluated its revenue recognition policy for all revenue
streams within the scope of the ASU under previous standards and using the five-step model under the new guidance and confirmed that there
were no differences in the pattern of revenue recognition except its warranty revenues. 

An entity will also be required
to determine if it controls the goods or services prior to the transfer to the customer in order to determine if it should account for
the arrangement as a principal or agent. Principal arrangements, where the entity controls the goods or services provided, will result
in the recognition of the gross amount of consideration expected in the exchange. Agent arrangements, where the entity simply arranges
but does not control the goods or services being transferred to the customer, will result in the recognition of the net amount the entity
is entitled to retain in the exchange. 

47 

Revenues from digital
doors signs are recognized at a point in time when legal title and control over the sign is transferred to the customer. Management
has determined that for the sales of digital door signs there is a single performance obligation that is met when the aforementioned
control is transferred. Typically, customers make payment for the product in advance; the Company will record the payment as
contract liabilities under the liability account customer deposits until the Company delivers the product by transferring control.
Such revenues are recognized at a point in time after all Payments received prior to the relevant criteria for revenue recognition
are met, are recorded as customer deposits. 

Gross versus Net Revenue Reporting 

Starting from July 2016, in
the normal course of the Company s trading of industrial waste materials business, the Company directly purchases the processed
industrial waste materials from the Company s suppliers under the Company s specifications and drop ships the materials directly
to the Company s customers. The Company would inspect the materials at its customers site, during which inspection it temporarily
assumes legal title to the materials, and after which inspection legal title is transferred to its customers. In these situations, the
Company generally collects the sales proceed directly from the Company s customers and pay for the inventory purchases to the Company s
suppliers separately. The determination of whether revenues should be reported on a gross or net basis is based on the Company s
assessment of whether it is the principal or an agent in the transaction. In determining whether the Company is the principal or an agent,
the Company follows the new accounting guidance for principal-agent considerations. Since the Company is the primary obligor and is responsible
for (i) fulfilling the processed industrial waste materials delivery, (ii) controlling the inventory by temporarily assume legal title
to the materials after inspecting the products from our vendors before passing the materials to our customers, and (iii) bearing the back-end
risk of inventory loss with respect to any product return from the Company s customers, the Company has concluded that it is the
principal in these arrangements, and therefore report revenues and cost of revenues on a gross basis. 

Recently Issue Accounting Pronouncements 

In February 2018, the FASB
issued ASU 2018-02, Income Statement - Reporting Comprehensive Income (Topic 220): Reclassification of Certain Tax Effects from Accumulated
Other Comprehensive Income. The amendments in this Update affect any entity that is required to apply the provisions of Topic 220, Income
Statement Reporting Comprehensive Income, and has items of other comprehensive income for which the related tax effects are presented
in other comprehensive income as required by GAAP. The amendments in this Update are effective for all entities for fiscal years beginning
after December 15, 2018, and interim periods within those fiscal years. Early adoption of the amendments in this Update is permitted,
including adoption in any interim period, (1) for public business entities for reporting periods for which financial statements have not
yet been issued and (2) for all other entities for reporting periods for which financial statements have not yet been made available for
issuance. The amendments in this Update should be applied either in the period of adoption or retrospectively to each period (or periods)
in which the effect of the change in the U.S. federal corporate income tax rate in the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act is recognized. We do not
believe the adoption of this ASU would have a material effect on our consolidated financial statements. 

We do not believe other recently
issued but not yet effective accounting standards, if currently adopted, would have a material effect on our consolidated balance sheets,
statements of income and comprehensive income and statements of cash flows. 

Liquidity and Capital Resources 

The Company has funded working
capital and other capital requirements primarily by equity contributions, loans from shareholders, cash flow from operations, short term
bank loans, loans from third parties. Cash is required to repay debts and pay salaries, office expenses, income taxes and other operating
expenses. As of December 31, 2022, our net working capital was approximately 1.3 million, over 59 of the Company s current liabilities
was from other payables related parties due to major shareholders. Removing these liabilities, the Company had net working capital
of minus 3.8 million and is expected to continue to generate cash flow by operations from the acquisitions of new companies and loans
from related-parties in the twelve months period. 

48 

We believe that current levels
of cash and cash flows from operations will be sufficient to meet its anticipated cash needs for at least the next twelve months from
the date the consolidated financial statements to be issued. However, it may need additional cash resources in the future if it experiences
changed business conditions or other developments, and may also need additional cash resources in the future if it wishes to pursue opportunities
for investment, acquisition, strategic cooperation or other similar actions. If it is determined that the cash requirements exceed the
Company s amounts of cash and cash equivalents on hand, the Company may seek to issue debt or equity securities or obtain additional
credit facility 

The following summarizes the
key components of the Company s cash flows for the year ended December 31, 2022 and 2021.

most significant risks for the Company s business. 

Financial instruments that
potentially subject the Company to significant concentrations of credit risk consist primarily of cash and accounts receivable. Cash held
at major financial institutions located in the PRC are not insured by the government. While we believe that these financial institutions
are of high credit quality, it also continually monitors their credit worthiness. 

Accounts receivable are typically
unsecured and derived from revenue earned from customers, thereby exposed to credit risk. Credit risk is controlled by the application
of credit approvals, limits and monitoring procedures. The Company manages credit risk through in-house research and analysis of the Chinese
economy and the underlying obligors and transaction structures. To minimize credit risk, the Company normally require prepayment from
the customers prior to begin production or delivery products. The Company identifies credit risk collectively based on industry, geography
and customer type. This information is monitored regularly by management. 

In measuring the credit risk
of our sales to our customers, the Company mainly reflects the probability of default by the customer on its contractual
obligations and considers the current financial position of the customer and the exposures to the customer and its likely future development. 

Liquidity Risk 

The Company is also exposed
to liquidity risk which is risk that it is unable to provide sufficient capital resources and liquidity to meet its commitments and business
needs. Liquidity risk is controlled by the application of financial position analysis and monitoring procedures. When necessary, the Company
will turn to other financial institutions and the owners to obtain short-term funding to meet the liquidity shortage. 

Inflation Risk 

The Company is also exposed
to inflation risk Inflationary factors, such as increases in raw material and overhead costs, could impair our operating results. Although
we do not believe that inflation has had a material impact on our financial position or results of operations to date, a high rate of
inflation in the future may have an adverse effect on our ability to maintain current levels of gross margin and operating expenses as
a percentage of sales revenue if the selling prices of our products do not increase with such increased costs. 

Foreign Currency Risk 

A majority of the Company s
operating activities and a significant portion of the Company s assets and liabilities are denominated in RMB, which is not freely
convertible into foreign currencies. All foreign exchange transactions take place either through the Peoples Bank of China PBOC or other authorized financial institutions at exchange rates quoted by PBOC. Approval of foreign currency payments by the PBOC or other
regulatory institutions requires submitting a payment application form together with suppliers invoices and signed contracts. The
value of RMB is subject to changes in central government policies and to international economic and political developments affecting supply
and demand in the China Foreign Exchange Trading System market.

Item 9. Changes in and Disagreements with Accountants on Accounting
and Financial Disclosure. 

On
October 11, 2022, the Company notified its independent registered public accounting firm, WWC, P.C. its decision to dismiss WWC,
P.C. as the Company s auditor. The reports of WWC, P.C. on the financial statements
of the Company for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2021 and the related statements of operations and comprehensive income (loss), changes
in stockholders equity (deficit), and cash flows for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2021 did not contain an adverse opinion
or disclaimer of opinion and were not qualified or modified as to uncertainty, audit scope or accounting principles. The decision to change
the independent registered public accounting firm was recommended and approved by the Audit Committee and the Board of Directors of the
Company. During the Company s most recent fiscal year ended December 31, 2021 and through October 11, 2022, the date of dismissal,
(a) there were no disagreements with WWC, P.C. on any matter of accounting principles or practices, financial statement disclosure, or
auditing scope or procedure, which disagreements, if not resolved to the satisfaction of WWC, P.C., would have caused it to make reference
thereto in its reports on the financial statements for such years and (b) there were no reportable events as described in
Item 304(a)(1)(v) of Regulation S-K. 

On
October 11, 2022, the Audit Committee and the Board of Directors of the Company appointed Enrome LLP as its new independent registered
public accounting firm to audit the Company s financial statements. During the two most recent fiscal years ended December 31, 2021
and 2020 and any subsequent interim periods through the date hereof prior to the engagement of Enrome LLP, neither the Company, nor someone
on its behalf, has consulted Enrome LLP regarding: 

(i) 
 either: the application of accounting principles to a specified transaction, either completed or proposed; or the type of audit opinion that might be rendered on the Company s consolidated financial statements, and either a written report was provided to the Company or oral advice was provided that the new independent registered public accounting firm concluded was an important factor considered by the Company in reaching a decision as to the accounting, auditing or financial reporting issue; or 

(ii) 
 any matter that was either the subject of a disagreement as defined in paragraph 304(a)(1)(iv) of Regulation S-K or a reportable event as described in paragraph 304(a)(1)(v) of Regulation S-K. 

Item 9A. Controls and Procedures. 

Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures 

Under the supervision and
with the participation of our management, including our Chief Executive Officers, President and Chief Financial Officer (the Certifying
Officers ), we carried out an evaluation of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures
as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act. Based on the foregoing, our Certifying Officers concluded that our
disclosure controls and procedures were not effective as of the end of the period covered by this Report. 

Disclosure controls and procedures
are controls and other procedures designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in our reports filed or submitted under
the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC s rules and forms.
Disclosure controls and procedures include, without limitation, controls and procedures designed to ensure that information required to
be disclosed in our reports filed or submitted under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to management, including our Certifying
Officers, or persons performing similar functions, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. 

Management s Report on Internal Controls Over Financial Reporting 

As required by the SEC rules
and regulations for the implementation of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining
adequate internal control over financial reporting. Our internal control over financial reporting is designed to provide reasonable assurance
regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of our consolidated financial statements for external reporting purposes
in accordance with GAAP. Our internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that: 

(1) 
 pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of our company, 

(2) 
 provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of consolidated financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America, and that our receipts and expenditures are being made only in accordance with authorizations of our management and directors, and 

(3) 
 provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of our assets that could have a material effect on the consolidated financial statements. 

51 

A material weakness is defined under
the SEC rules as a deficiency, or a combination of deficiencies, in internal control over financial reporting such that there is a reasonable
possibility that a material misstatement of a company s annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected
on a timely basis by our internal controls. As a result of its review, management concluded that we had material weaknesses in our internal
control over financial reporting process consisting of the following: 

Inadequate U.S. GAAP expertise. The current accounting staff is inexperienced in applying U.S. GAAP standard as they are primarily engaged in ensuring compliance with PRC accounting and reporting requirement for our consolidated operating entities, and thus require substantial training. The current staff s accounting skills and understanding as to how to fulfill the requirements of U.S. GAAP-based reporting, including subsidiary financial statements consolidation, are inadequate. 

No formal plan to provide applicable training for our financial and accounting staff to enhance our understanding of U.S. GAAP and internal control over financial reporting. 

Because of its inherent limitations,
internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect errors or misstatements in our consolidated financial statements.
Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because
of changes in conditions, or that the degree or compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. Management assessed the effectiveness
of our internal control over financial reporting at December 31, 2022. In making these assessments, management used the criteria set forth
by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO) in Internal Control Integrated Framework (2013).
Based on our assessments and those criteria, management determined that our internal control over financial reporting was not effective
at December 31, 2022 due to the material weaknesses identified by our management as described above. 

Management Plan to Remediate Material Weaknesses 

We plan to engage outside consultant to supplement efforts to improve our internal control over financial reporting; 

We plan to acquire applicable training for our financial and accounting staff to enhance our understanding of U.S. GAAP and internal control over financial reporting 

Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting 

There were no changes in our
internal control over financial reporting (as such term is defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) of the Exchange Act) during the most
recent fiscal quarter that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial
reporting.

No Classification of Directors 

In accordance with our existing
charter, our board of directors is divided into two classes with only one class of directors being elected in each year and each class
(except for those directors appointed prior to our first annual meeting of stockholders) serving a two-year term. 

As discussed above, in connection
with the Business Combination, our board of directors has been reconstituted and comprised of six members. Our board of directors believes
it is in the best interests of the Company for the board of directors to have no separate classification, such that each director serves
a one-year term until the next annual meeting of stockholders or until such director s successor is elected or qualified. If Proposal
4 is approved at the special meeting, all six directors that our board of directors has nominated to serve on the board will serve until
the first annual meeting of stockholders following the Business Combination. 

Director Independence 

Nasdaq listing standards require
that a majority of our board of directors be independent as long as we are not a controlled company. We anticipate that a majority of
our board of directors will be independent as of the closing of the Business Combination. An independent director is defined
under the Nasdaq rules generally as a person other than an officer or employee of the company or its subsidiaries or any other individual
having a relationship which in the opinion of the company s board of directors, would interfere with the director s exercise
of independent judgment in carrying out the responsibilities of a director. We anticipate that our board of directors will determine that
Mr. Mingyue Cai, Mr. Shuaiheng Zhang and Mr. Yi Zhong are independent directors as defined in the Nasdaq listing standards
and applicable SEC rules. Our independent directors will have regularly scheduled meetings at which only independent directors are present. 

Leadership Structure and Risk Oversight 

The board of directors does
not have a lead independent director. Currently Mr. Hongxiang Yu serves as our Chief Executive Officer, President and Chairman of the Board. 

Committees of the Board of Directors 

The standing committees of
our board of directors currently consists of an Audit Committee and a Compensation Committee, and after the Business Combination will
also consist of a Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee. Each of the committees will report to the board of directors as they
deem appropriate and as the board may request. 

55 

Audit Committee 

Our Audit Committee currently
consists of Mr. Shuaiheng Zhang, Mr. Yi Zhong and Mr. Mingyue Cai, with Mr. Shuaiheng Zhang serving as the chairman of the Audit Committee.
We believe that each of these individuals qualify as independent directors according to the rules and regulations of the SEC with respect
to audit committee membership. We also believe that Mr. Shuaiheng Zhang qualifies as our audit committee financial expert, 
as such term is defined in Item 401(h) of Regulation S-K. Our board of directors has adopted a written charter for the Audit Committee,
which is attached as an exhibit to this Report. 

The audit committee s
duties, which are specified in our Audit Committee Charter, include, but are not limited to:

determining the compensation and oversight of the work of the independent auditor (including resolution of disagreements between management and the independent auditor regarding financial reporting) for the purpose of preparing or issuing an audit report or related work; 

establishing procedures for the receipt, retention and treatment of complaints received by us regarding accounting, internal accounting controls or reports which raise material issues regarding our financial statements or accounting policies; and 

56 

Compensation Committee 

Our Compensation Committee
currently consists of Mr. Mingyue Cai, Mr. Shuaiheng Zhang, and Mr. Yi Zhong, with Mr. Mingyue Cai serving as the chairman of the Compensation
Committee. We anticipate that each of the members of our Compensation Committee will be independent under the applicable Nasdaq listing
standards. Our board of directors has adopted a written charter for the Compensation Committee, which is attached as an exhibit to this
Report. 

The compensation committee s
duties, which are specified in our Compensation Committee Charter, include, but not limited to: 

reviewing and approving on an annual basis the corporate goals and objectives relevant to our Chief Executive Officer s compensation, evaluating our Chief Executive Officer s performance in light of such goals and objectives and determining and approving the remuneration (if any) of our Chief Executive Officer s based on such evaluation; 

reviewing and approving the compensation of all of our other executive officers;

Nominating Committee will be responsible for, among other matters: (1) identifying individuals qualified to become members of our board
of directors, consistent with criteria approved by our board of directors; (2) overseeing the organization of our board of directors to
discharge the board s duties and responsibilities properly and efficiently; (3) identifying best practices and recommending corporate
governance principles; and (4) developing and recommending to our board of directors a set of corporate governance guidelines and principles
applicable to us. 

Our Corporate Governance and
Nominating Committee currently consists of Mr. Shuaiheng Zhang, Mr. Yi Zhong and Mr. Mingyue Cai, with Mr. Yi Zhong serving as the chairman
of the Corporate Governance and Nominating Committee. We anticipate that each of the members of our Corporate Governance and Nominating
Committee will be independent under the applicable Nasdaq listing standards. Our board of directors has adopted a written charter for
the Corporate Governance and Nominating Committee, which is available on our corporate website at www.ccnctech.com. 

Compensation Committee Interlocks and Insider Participation 

None of our executive officers
currently serves, and in the past year has not served, as a member of the board of directors or compensation committee of any entity that
has one or more executive officers serving on our board of directors. 

Delinquent Section 16(a) Reports 

Section 16(a) of the Securities
Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, requires our officers, directors and persons who beneficially own more than ten percent of our common
stock to file reports of ownership and changes in ownership with the SEC. These reporting persons are also required to furnish us with
copies of all Section 16(a) forms they file. Based solely upon a review of such Forms, during the year ended December 31, 2022, Mr. Hongxiang
Yu and Mr. Shuang Zhang did not file the required Section 16 reports on time. In particular, Mr. Hongxiang Yu failed to timely file a
Form 3 in connection with his acquisition of 210,000 shares of common stock of the Company on September 29, 2022. Mr. Shuang Zhang failed
to timely file a Form 3 in connection with his acquisition of 90,000 shares of common stock of the Company on September 29, 2022 

Code of Ethics 

We have adopted a Code of
Ethics that applies to all of our employees, including our chief executive officer, chief financial officer and principal accounting officer.

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING
FIRM 

To: 
 The Board of Directors and Stockholders of 
GD Culture Group Limited 

Opinion on the Consolidated Financial Statements 

We have audited the accompanying
consolidated balance sheets of GD Culture Group Limited and its subsidiaries (the Company as of December 31, 2022,
and the related consolidated statements of loss and comprehensive loss, changes in shareholders equity, and cash flows for
the year ended December 31, 2022, and the related notes (collectively referred to as the consolidated financial statements). In our
opinion, the consolidated financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of
December 31, 2022, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for the year ended December 31, 2022, in conformity with
accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America U.S. GAAP ). 

Basis for Opinion 

These consolidated financial statements are the responsibility of the
Company s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company s consolidated financial statements based
on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB) and
are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules
and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. 

We conducted our audits in accordance with the
standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial
statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. The Company is not required to have, nor were we engaged
to perform, an audit of its internal control over financial reporting. As part of our audits, we are required to obtain an understanding
of internal control over financial reporting, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Company s
internal control over financial reporting. Accordingly, we express no such opinion. 

Our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material
misstatement of the consolidated financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those
risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the consolidated financial
statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as
evaluating the overall presentation of the consolidated financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for
our opinion. 

Critical Audit Matters 

The critical audit matters communicated below
are matters arising from the current period audit of the consolidated financial statements that were communicated or required to be communicated
to the audit committee and that: (1) related to accounts or disclosures that were material to the consolidated financial statements and
(2) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of the critical audit matter does not alter
in any way our opinion on the consolidated financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit
matter below, providing a separate opinion on the critical audit matter or on the accounts or disclosures to which they relate.

Goodwill-Shanghai Hightlight Media Co., Ltd. Hightlight Media 

As described in Note 3 and Note 10 to the consolidated
financial statements, the Company acquired Hightlight Media. The goodwill arising on this acquisition amounted to 2.12 million as of
December 31,2022. 

Management assessed goodwill for potential impairment
as of December 31 2022 by comparing the carrying amount of the cash-generating unit to which goodwill has been allocated with the recoverable
amount determined by assessing the value-in-use VIU by preparing a discounted cash flow forecast. Preparing a discounted
cash flow forecast involves the exercise of significant management judgement, in particular in forecasting revenue growth and operating
profit and in determining an appropriate discount rate 

Goodwill is tested for impairment on an annual
basis, or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that it might be impaired. The Company has elected to perform
quantitative assessment. In the quantitative assessment, the Company s evaluation of goodwill for impairment involves the comparison
of the fair value of Hightlight Media to the carrying value. The Company used the discounted cash flow model to estimate fair value, which
requires management to make significant estimates and assumptions related to discount rates and forecasts of future revenues and operating
margins. Changes in these assumptions could have a significant impact on either the fair value, the amount of any goodwill impairment
charge. Based on the quantitative assessment performed, if it is more likely than not that the fair value is less than its carrying amount.
During the year ended December 31, 2022, no impairment charge on goodwill arising on this acquisition of Hightlight Media was recognized
based on the quantitative assessment performed. 

We identified goodwill impairment for the Hightlight
Media as a critical audit matter because it is the material to the consolidated financial statements of the Company and certain significant
judgments in respect of the assumption made which are inherently uncertain and could be subject to management bias made by management
to estimate the fair value of the Hightlight Media and the difference between its fair value and carrying value. This required a high degree
of auditor judgment and an increased extent of effort, including the need to involve our fair value specialists, when performing audit
procedures to evaluate the reasonableness of management s estimates and assumptions related to selection of the discount rate and
forecasts of future revenue and operating margin. 

Our audit procedures relating to the discount
rate and forecasts of future revenue and operating margin used by management to estimate the fair value of the Hightlight Media included
the following, among others: 

We evaluated management s ability to accurately forecast future revenues and operating margins by comparing actual results to management s forecasts. 

We evaluated the reasonableness of the (1) valuation methodology and (2) discount rate by: 

a. 
 
 Testing the source information underlying
the determination of the discount rate and the mathematical accuracy of the calculation; 

b. 
 
 Developing a range of independent estimates
and comparing those to the discount rate selected by management.

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING
FIRM 

To: 
 The Board of Directors and Stockholders of 
Code Chain New Continent Limited 

Opinion on the Financial Statements 

We have audited the accompanying consolidated
balance sheets of Code Chain New Continent Limited and its subsidiaries (the Company as of December 31, 2021 and 2020,
and the related consolidated statements of income (loss) and comprehensive loss, changes in shareholders equity, and cash flows
for the two-year period ended December 31, 2021, and the related notes (collectively referred to as the financial statements). In our
opinion, the financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of December 31, 2021
and 2020, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for the two-year period ended December 31, 2021, in conformity with accounting
principles generally accepted in the United States of America. 

Basis for Opinion 

These financial statements are the responsibility
of the Company s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company s financial statements based on our
audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB) and are
required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and

the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion. 

Critical Audit Matters 

The critical audit matters communicated below
are matters arising from the current period audit of the financial statements that were communicated or required to be communicated to
the audit committee and that: (1) relate to accounts or disclosures that are material to the financial statements and (2) involved our
especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion
on the financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matters below, providing separate opinions
on the critical audit matters or on the accounts or disclosures to which they relate. 

Critical Audit Matter Description 

The Company s evaluation of goodwill and
related impairment, if any, involves the comparison of the fair value of each reporting unit to its carrying value. The Company uses the
discounted cash flow model to estimate fair value, which requires management to make significant estimates and assumptions related to
forecasts of future revenues and operating margins. Changes in these assumptions which may include but are not limited to macroeconomic
factors, political risks, product adoption or obsoletion rates, and effectiveness of sales channels may have a significant impact on the
fair value, and related potential impairment, if any. The Company s reporting unit, Sichuan Wuge Network Games Co., Ltd. Wuge generated a substantial proportion of the Company s consolidated revenues and gross margins via the sales of digital door signs.
The value of goodwill related to Wuge is derived from the sales generated by this unit. As a result of the significant judgments made
by management to estimate the fair value of Wuge for which there is limited historical data and the judgments involved in selecting significant
business assumptions to forecast future revenue and operating margin for Wuge, performing audit procedures to evaluate the reasonableness
of management s estimates and assumptions required a high degree of auditor judgment and an increased effort. 

How the Critical Audit Matter Was Addressed
in the Audit 

Our audit procedures related to the determination
of forecasts of future revenue and operating margin used by management to estimate the fair value contributed by Wuge included the following,
among others: 

We evaluated management s ability to accurately
forecast future revenue and operating margin by comparing actual results to management s historical forecasts for the sales of Wuge s
products. We also developed our own independent analysis and estimate of revenues and profits and applied them and a discounted cash flow
model to evaluate the fair value of goodwill. To support our independent model we enquired of management regarding their assumptions,
searched for market data, used historical data, and performed sensitivity and scenario analysis to test different outcomes from the model.

to the VIE Agreements, once signed, Highlight Media shall pay service fees to WFOE in the amount of of Highlight Media s after-tax
net income, while WFOE shall be obligated to absorb all of losses of Highlight Media. Accordingly, under U.S. GAAP, WFOE will treat Highlight

DESCRIPTION OF SECURITIES 

Description of Capital Stock 

General 

The following description of our capital stock
does not purport to be complete and is subject to and qualified in its entirety by our certificate of incorporation, our bylaws and by
the applicable provisions of Nevada law. 

Our authorized capital stock consists of 220,000,000
shares, par value 0.0001 per share, consisting of 200,000,000 shares of common stock and 20,000,000 shares of preferred stock. 

On November 4, 2022, the Company filed a Certificate of Amendment to
the Articles of Incorporation (the Certificate of Amendment with the Nevada Secretary of State to effect a reverse stock
split of the outstanding shares of common stock, par value 0.0001 per shares, of the Company at a ratio of one-for-thirty (30), which
became effective at 12:01 a.m. on November 9, 2022. Upon effectiveness of the reverse stock split, every thirty (30) outstanding shares
of common stock were combined into and automatically become one share of common stock. 

Unless otherwise indicated, all references to
common stock, warrants to purchase common stock, share data, per share data, and related information have been retroactively adjusted,
where applicable, herein to reflect the reverse stock split of our common stock as if they had occurred at the beginning of the earlier
period presented. 

Common Stock 

As of the date of this annual report, there were
1,711,544 shares of our common stock issued and outstanding, held by approximately 325 stockholders of record. The outstanding shares
of common stock are fully paid and non-assessable. The holders of common stock are entitled to one vote for each share held of record
on all matters submitted to a vote of the stockholders. 

We have one class of common stock. Holders of
our common stock are entitled to one vote per share on all matters to be voted upon by stockholders and do not have cumulative voting
rights in the election of directors. Holders of shares of common stock are entitled to receive on a pro rata basis such dividends, if
any, as may be declared from time to time by our board of directors in its discretion from funds legally available for that use, subject
to any preferential dividend rights of outstanding preferred stock. They are also entitled to share on a pro rata basis in any distribution
to our common stockholders upon our liquidation, dissolution or winding up, subject to the prior rights of any outstanding preferred stock.
Common stockholders do not have preemptive rights to subscribe to any additional stock issuances by us, and they do not have the right
to require the redemption of their shares or the conversion of their shares into any other class of our stock. The rights, preferences
and privileges of holders of common stock are subject to, and may be adversely affected by, the rights of the holders of outstanding preferred
stock and any series of preferred stock that we may designate and issue in the future. 

Anti-Takeover Effects of Our Articles of Incorporation
and Bylaw 

The following provisions of our articles of incorporation
and bylaws could have the effect of delaying or discouraging another party from acquiring control of us and could encourage persons seeking
to acquire control of us to first negotiate with our board of directors: 

no cumulative voting in the election of directors, which limits the ability of minority stockholders to elect director candidates; 

the exclusive right of our board of directors to elect a director to fill a vacancy created by the expansion of the board of directors or the resignation, death or removal of a director, which prevents stockholders from being able to fill vacancies on our board of directors; 

the ability of our board of directors to authorize the issuance of shares of preferred stock and to determine the terms of those shares, including preferences and voting rights, without stockholder approval, which could adversely affect the rights of our common stockholders or be used to deter a possible acquisition of our company; 

the ability of our board of directors to alter our bylaws without obtaining stockholder approval; 

the required approval of the holders of at least two-thirds of the shares entitled to vote at an election of directors to adopt, amend or repeal our bylaws or repeal the provisions of our articles of incorporation and bylaws regarding the election and removal of directors; 

the requirement that a special meeting of stockholders may be called only by the chairman of the board of directors, the chief executive officer, the president or the board of directors, which may delay the ability of our stockholders to force consideration of a proposal or to take action, including the removal of directors; and 

advance notice procedures that stockholders must comply with in order to nominate candidates to our board of directors or to propose matters to be acted upon at a stockholders meeting, which may discourage or deter a potential acquirer from conducting a solicitation of proxies to elect the acquirer s own slate of directors or otherwise attempting to obtain control of us. 

Transfer Agent and Registrar 

The transfer agent of our common stock is Continental
Stock Transfer Trust Company. The address of our transfer agent is 1 State Street, 30th Floor, New York, NY 10004.

Upon issuance, the shares of preferred stock will
be fully paid and nonassessable, which means that its holders will have paid their purchase price in full and we may not require them
to pay additional funds.

The rights of holders of our common stock will be subject to, and may be adversely affected by, the rights of the holders of any preferred
stock that may be issued by us in the future. The issuance of preferred stock could also have the effect of delaying or preventing a change
in control of our company or make removal of management more difficult.
