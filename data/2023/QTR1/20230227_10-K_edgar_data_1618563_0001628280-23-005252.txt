 PART I 
 
 Item 1. Business 
 General 
 National Storage Affiliates Trust is a fully integrated, self-administered and self-managed real estate investment trust organized in the state of Maryland on May 16, 2013. We have elected and we believe that we have qualified to be taxed as a REIT for U.S. federal income tax purposes commencing with our taxable year ended December 31, 2015. We serve as the sole general partner of our operating partnership subsidiary, NSA OP, LP (our "operating partnership"), a Delaware limited partnership formed on February 13, 2013 to conduct our business, which is focused on the ownership, operation, and acquisition of self storage properties predominantly located within the top 100 metropolitan statistical areas ("MSAs") throughout the United States. As of December 31, 2022, we held ownership interests in and operated a geographically diversified portfolio of 1,101 self storage properties, located in 42 states and Puerto Rico, comprising approximately 71.8 million rentable square feet, configured in approximately 564,000 storage units. We completed our initial public offering in 2015 and our common shares of beneficial interest, 0.01 par value per share ("common shares"), are listed on the New York Stock Exchange under the symbol "NSA."

 Our executive chairman of the board of trustees and former chief executive officer, Arlen D. Nordhagen, co-founded SecurCare Self Storage, Inc. ("SecurCare"), in 1988 to invest in and manage self storage properties. While growing SecurCare to over 150 self storage properties, Mr. Nordhagen recognized a market opportunity for a differentiated public self storage REIT that would leverage the benefits of national scale by integrating multiple experienced regional self storage operators with local operational focus and expertise. We believe that his vision, which is the foundation of the Company, aligns the interests of our participating regional operators ("PROs"), with those of our public shareholders by allowing our PROs to participate alongside our shareholders in our financial performance and the performance of our PROs' "managed portfolios", which means, with respect to each PRO, the portfolio of properties that such PRO manages on our behalf. A key component of this strategy is to capitalize on the local market expertise and knowledge of regional self storage operators by maintaining the continuity of their roles as property managers. 
 As of December 31, 2022, our PROs managed 385 of our properties. We believe that our structure creates the right financial incentives to align the interest of our PROs with those of our public shareholders. We require our PROs to exchange the self storage properties they contribute to the Company for a combination of OP units and subordinated performance units in our operating partnership or subsidiaries of our operating partnership that issue units intended to be economically equivalent to the OP units and subordinated performance units issued by our operating partnership ("DownREIT partnerships"). OP units, which are economically equivalent to our common shares, create alignment with the performance of the Company as a whole. Subordinated performance units, which are linked to the performance of specific managed portfolios, incentivize our PROs to drive operating performance and support the sustainability of the operating cash flow generated by the self storage properties that they manage on our behalf. Because subordinated performance unit holders receive distributions only after portfolio-specific minimum performance thresholds are satisfied, subordinated performance units play a key role in aligning the interests of our PROs with us and our shareholders. Our structure thus offers PROs a unique opportunity to serve as regional property managers for their managed portfolios and directly participate in the potential upside of those properties while simultaneously diversifying their investment to include a broader portfolio of self storage properties. We believe our structure provides us with a competitive growth advantage over self storage companies that do not offer property owners the ability to participate in the performance and potential future growth of their managed portfolios. 
 We believe that our national platform, which includes our PRO structure and property management platform, has significant potential for continued external and internal growth. We seek to further expand our national platform by continuing to recruit additional established self storage operators to act as future PROs, pursuing strategic off-market acquisitions, as well as opportunistically partnering with institutional funds and other institutional investors in strategic joint venture arrangements while integrating our operations through the implementation of centralized initiatives, including management information systems, revenue enhancement, and cost optimization programs. We are currently engaged in preliminary discussions with additional self storage operators and believe that we could add one to three more PROs in addition to the PROs we have currently, which will enhance our existing geographic footprint and allow us to enter regional markets in which we currently have limited or no market share. 
 
 At the time of our formation, we contemplated that PROs would seek to retire over time, allowing us to internalize the management of such PROs' managed portfolios into our full service internally staffed property management platform, which was initially developed to manage the properties owned by our unconsolidated real estate ventures. Internalization allows us to grow this platform by hiring former PRO employees to continue managing the same portfolios under the same local brands. With each retirement event, we acquire the PRO brand name and related intellectual property and discontinue paying the PRO supervisory and administrative fees and reimbursements. As of January 1, 2023, we have completed three retirement events: SecurCare effective March 31, 2020, Kevin Howard Real Estate, Inc., d/b/a Northwest Self Storage and its controlled affiliates ("Northwest") effective January 1, 2022 and Move It Self Storage and its controlled affiliates ("Move It") effective January 1, 2023.

 As a result of Move It's retirement, effective January 1, 2023, management of our 72 properties in the Move It managed portfolio was transferred to us and the Move It brand name and related intellectual property was internalized by us. In addition, we will no longer pay supervisory and administrative fees and reimbursements to Move It and on January 1, 2023, we issued a notice of non-voluntary conversion to cause all subordinated performance units related to Move It's managed portfolio to convert into OP units. As part of the internalization, a majority of Move It's employees were offered and provided employment by us to continue managing Move It's portfolio of properties as members of our existing property management platform. 
 As a result of Northwest's retirement, effective January 1, 2022, management of our properties in the Northwest managed portfolio was transferred to us and the related Northwest brand name and intellectual property was internalized by us, and we discontinued payment of any supervisory and administrative fees and reimbursements to Northwest. Most of Northwest's employees were hired by us as members of our existing property management platform. 
 Our Property Management Platform 
 Through our property management platform, we direct, manage and control the day-to-day operations and affairs of certain consolidated properties and our unconsolidated real estate ventures under our iStorage, SecurCare and Northwest brands and, commencing on January 1, 2023, our Move It brand. As of December 31, 2022, our property management platform managed and controlled 531 of our consolidated properties and 185 of our unconsolidated real estate venture properties. 
 We earn certain customary fees for managing and operating the properties in the unconsolidated real estate ventures and we facilitate tenant insurance and/or tenant warranty protection programs for tenants at these properties in exchange for half of all proceeds from such programs. 
 Our PROs 
 The Company had nine PROs as of December 31, 2022: Optivest Properties LLC and its controlled affiliates ("Optivest"), Move It Self Storage and its controlled affiliates ("Move It"), Guardian Storage Centers LLC and its controlled affiliates ("Guardian"), Southern Storage Management Systems, Inc. d/b/a Southern Self Storage ("Southern"), Blue Sky Self Storage LLC, a strategic partnership between Argus Professional Storage Management and Uplift Development Group (formerly known as GYS Development LLC) ("Blue Sky"), affiliates of Investment Real Estate Management, LLC d/b/a Moove In Self Storage ("Moove In"), Hide-Away Storage Services, Inc. and its controlled affiliates ("Hide-Away"), Arizona Mini Storage Management Company d/b/a Storage Solutions and its controlled affiliates ("Storage Solutions"), and an affiliate of Shader Brothers Corporation d/b/a Personal Mini Storage ("Personal Mini"). 
 To capitalize on their recognized and established local brands, our PROs continue to function as property managers for their managed portfolios under their existing brands (which include various brands in addition to those discussed below). Over the long-run, we may seek to continue internalizing our PROs and may brand or co-brand each location as part of NSA. 
 Optivest, which is based in Dana Point, California, is one of our PROs responsible for covering portions of the northeast and southwest regions. Optivest managed 84 of our properties located in Arizona, California, Massachusetts, Nevada, New Hampshire, New Mexico, Texas and Utah as of December 31, 2022. Optivest is run by its co-founder, Warren Allan, who has more than 25 years of financial and operational management experience in the self storage industry and is recognized as a self storage acquisition and development specialist. 
 Move It, which was based in Dallas, Texas, was one of our PROs responsible for covering portions of the Texas and southeast markets. Move It managed 72 of our properties located in Alabama, Florida, Louisiana, Mississippi, Tennessee and Texas as of December 31, 2022. Effective January 1, 2023, upon the retirement of Move It as a PRO, the Company acquired the Move It brand and internalized the management of the properties formerly managed by Move It. 
 Guardian, which is based in Irvine, California, is one of our PROs responsible for covering portions of the southern California and southwest regions. Guardian managed 56 of our properties located in Arizona, California and Nevada as of December 31, 2022. Guardian is led by John Minar, who has nearly 40 years of self storage acquisition, rehabilitation, ownership, operations and development experience.

 Southern, which is based in Palm Beach Gardens, Florida, is one of our PROs responsible for covering portions of Arizona, New Mexico and the southeast region, including New Orleans, the Florida Panhandle, southern Georgia and Puerto Rico. Southern managed 48 of our properties in Arizona, Louisiana, the Florida Panhandle, New Mexico, southern Georgia, and Puerto Rico as of December 31, 2022. Southern is led by Bob McIntosh and Peter Cowie, who are active real estate operators with more than 30 years of self storage experience. 
 Blue Sky, which is a strategic partnership between Argus Professional Storage Management and Uplift Development Group (formerly known as GYS Development LLC) and is based in the mountain west, is our PRO responsible for covering portions of the southeast, midwest, and southwest regions, including portions of Kansas, Georgia and Texas. Blue Sky managed 41 of our properties in Alabama, Arkansas, Colorado, Florida, Georgia, Indiana, Kansas, Kentucky, Minnesota, Montana, North Carolina, Texas, Wisconsin and Wyoming as of December 31, 2022. Blue Sky is led by Lee Fredrick, Ben Vestal and Michael Perry, who have extensive experience in acquisition, development and management of self storage properties. 
 Moove In, which is based in York, Pennsylvania, is our PRO responsible for covering portions of the mid-atlantic and midwest regions. Moove In managed 38 of our properties in Connecticut, Iowa, Maryland, Massachusetts, New Jersey, New York and Pennsylvania as of December 31, 2022. Moove In is led by John Gilliland, who currently serves on the board of directors for the Large Owners Council of the Self Storage Association, and a past Chairman of the Self Storage Association. 
 Hide-Away, which is based in Sarasota, Florida, is our PRO responsible for covering the western Florida market. Hide-Away managed 25 of our properties in western Florida as of December 31, 2022. Hide-Away is led by its founder, Steve Wilson, one of the early developers of the self storage business, who served for more than 35 years as the President of Hide-Away and its related entities, and is a past Chairman of the Self Storage Association. 
 Storage Solutions, which is based in Chandler, Arizona, is our PRO responsible for covering portions of the Arizona and Nevada markets. Storage Solutions managed 11 of our properties in Arizona and Nevada as of December 31, 2022. Storage Solutions is led by its founder, Bill Bohannan, who is one of the largest operators in Phoenix and has more than 35 years of self storage acquisition, development and management experience. Mr. Bohannan is recognized in the industry as a self storage acquisition, development and management specialist. 
 Personal Mini, which is based in Orlando, Florida, is our PRO responsible for covering portions of the central Florida market. Personal Mini managed 10 of our properties in central Florida as of December 31, 2022. Personal Mini is led by Marc Smith, a self storage investor who has been involved in all facets of the self storage business. Mr. Smith is a past Chairman of the Self Storage Association, and also previously served as president of the Southeast Region of the Self Storage Association. 
 We benefit from the local market knowledge and active presence of our PROs, allowing us to build and foster important customer and industry relationships. These local relationships provide attractive off-market acquisition opportunities that we believe will continue to fuel additional external growth. 
 We believe our structure allows our PROs to optimize their established property management platforms while addressing financial and operational hurdles. Before joining us, our PROs faced challenges in securing low cost capital and had to manage multiple investors and lending relationships, making it difficult to compete with larger competitors, including public REITs, for acquisition and investment opportunities. Our PROs were also limited in their ability to raise growth capital through the sale of assets, a portfolio refinancing, or capital contributions from new equity partners. Serving as our on-the-ground acquisition teams, our PROs now have access to our broader financing sources and lower cost of capital, while our national platform allows them to benefit from economies of scale to drive operating efficiencies in a rapidly evolving, technology-driven industry.

 Our Consolidated Properties 
 We seek to own properties that are well located in high quality sub-markets with highly accessible street access and attractive supply and demand characteristics, providing our properties with strong and stable cash flows that are less sensitive to the fluctuations of the general economy. Many of these markets have multiple barriers to entry against increased supply, including zoning restrictions against new construction and new construction costs that we believe are higher than our properties' fair market value. As of December 31, 2022, we owned a geographically diversified portfolio of 916 self storage properties, located in 39 states and Puerto Rico, comprising approximately 58.3 million rentable square feet, configured in approximately 453,000 storage units. Of these properties, 301 were acquired by us from our PROs, 614 were acquired by us from third-party sellers and one was acquired by us from the 2016 Joint Venture (as defined in Note 5 to the consolidated financial statements in Item 8). A complete listing of, and additional information about, our self storage properties is included in Item 2 of this report. 
 During the year ended December 31, 2022, we acquired 45 consolidated self storage properties, of which five were acquired by us from our PROs and 40 were acquired by us from third-party sellers. The following is a summary of our 2022 consolidated acquisition activity (dollars in thousands):

 Our Unconsolidated Real Estate Ventures 
 We seek to opportunistically partner with institutional funds and other institutional investors to acquire attractive portfolios utilizing a promoted return structure. We believe there is significant opportunity for continued external growth by partnering with institutional investors seeking to deploy capital in the self storage industry. 
 2018 Joint Venture 
 As of December 31, 2022, our 2018 Joint Venture (as defined in Note 5 to the consolidated financial statements in Item 8), in which we have a 25 ownership interest, owned and operated 104 self storage properties containing approximately 7.8 million rentable square feet, configured in over 64,000 storage units and located across 17 states. 
 2016 Joint Venture 
 As of December 31, 2022, our 2016 Joint Venture (as defined in Note 5 to the consolidated financial statements in Item 8), in which we have a 25 ownership interest, owned and operated a portfolio of 81 properties containing approximately 5.6 million rentable square feet, configured in approximately 47,000 storage units and located across 13 states.

 Our Competitive Strengths 
 We believe our property management platform combined with our unique PRO structure allows us to differentiate ourselves from other self storage operators, and the following competitive strengths enable us to effectively compete against our industry peers: 
 High Quality Properties in Key Growth Markets. We held ownership interests in and operated a geographically diversified portfolio of 1,101 self storage properties, located in 42 states and Puerto Rico, comprising approximately 71.8 million rentable square feet, configured in approximately 564,000 storage units as of December 31, 2022. Over 70 of our consolidated portfolio is located in the top 100 MSAs, based on our 2022 net operating income ("NOI"). We believe that these properties are primarily located in high quality growth markets that have attractive supply and demand characteristics and are less sensitive to the fluctuations of the general economy. Many of these markets have multiple barriers to entry against increased supply, including zoning restrictions against new construction and new construction costs that we believe are higher than our properties' fair market value. Furthermore, we believe that our significant size and the overall geographic diversification of our portfolio reduces risks associated with specific local or regional economic downturns or natural disasters. 
 Integrated Platform Utilizing Advanced Technology for Enhanced Operational Performance and Best Practices. Our national platform allows us to capture cost savings through integration and centralization, thereby eliminating redundancies and utilizing economies of scale across the property management platforms of us and our PROs. As compared to a stand-alone operator, our national platform has greater access to lower-cost capital, reduced Internet marketing costs per customer lead, discounted property insurance expense, and reduced overhead costs. In addition, the Company has sufficient scale for various centralized functions, including financial reporting, the operation of call centers, expanding cell tower leasing, a national credit card processing program, marketing, information technology, legal support, and capital market functions, to achieve substantial cost savings over smaller, individual operators. 
 Our national platform utilizes advanced technology for our data warehouse program, Internet marketing, our centralized call centers, financial and property analytic dashboards, revenue optimization analytics and expense management tools to enhance operational performance. These centralized programs, which are run through our Technology and Best Practices Group, are positively impacting our business performance, and we believe that they will continue to be a driver of organic growth going forward. We will continue to utilize our Technology and Best Practices Group to help us benefit from the collective sharing of key operating strategies among our PROs in areas like human resource management, local marketing and operating procedures and building tenant insurance-related arrangements. 
 Differentiated, Growth-Oriented Strategy Focused on Established Operators. We are a self storage REIT with a unique structure that supports our differentiated external growth strategy. Our PRO structure appeals to operators who are looking for access to growth capital while maintaining an economic stake in the self storage properties that each manages on our behalf. These attributes entice operators to join the Company rather than sell their properties for cash consideration. Through our PRO structure, we seek to attract operators who are confident in the future performance of their properties and desire to participate in the growth of the Company. We have successfully recruited established operators across the United States with a history of efficient property management and a track record of successful acquisitions. Our structure and differentiated strategy have enabled us to build a substantial captive pipeline (our "captive pipeline") from existing operators as well as potentially create external growth from the recruitment of additional PROs. 
 Aligned Incentive Structure with Shareholder Downside Protection. Our structure promotes operator accountability as subordinated performance units issued to our PROs in exchange for the contribution of their properties are entitled to distributions only after those properties satisfy minimum performance thresholds. In the event of a material reduction in operating cash flow, distributions on our subordinated performance units will be reduced before or disproportionately to distributions on our common shares held by our common shareholders. In addition, we expect our PROs will generally co-invest subordinated equity in the form of subordinated performance units in each acquisition that they source from a third-party seller, and the value of these subordinated performance units will fluctuate with the performance of their managed portfolios. Therefore, our PROs are incentivized to select acquisitions that are expected to exceed minimum performance thresholds, thereby increasing the value of their subordinated equity stake. We expect that our shareholders will benefit from the higher levels of property performance that our PROs are incentivized to deliver.

 Our Business and Growth Strategies 
 By capitalizing on our competitive strengths, we seek to increase scale, achieve optimal revenue-producing occupancy and rent levels, and increase long-term shareholder value by achieving sustainable long-term growth. Our business and growth strategies to achieve these objectives are as follows: 
 Maximize Property Level Cash Flow. We strive to maximize the cash flows at our properties by leveraging the economies of scale provided by our national platform, including through the implementation of new ideas derived from our Technology and Best Practices Group. We believe that our efficient national platform, centralized infrastructure and unique PRO structure, will enable us to achieve optimal market rents and occupancy, reduce operating expenses and increase the sale by us and our PROs of ancillary products and services, including tenant insurance, of which we receive a portion of the proceeds, truck rentals and packing supplies. 
 Acquire Built-in Captive Pipeline of Target Properties from Existing PROs. We have an attractive, high quality potential acquisition pipeline of over 110 self storage properties valued at approximately 1.5 billion that will continue to drive our future growth. We consider a property to be in our captive pipeline if it (i) is under a management service agreement with one of our PROs, (ii) meets our property quality criteria, and (iii) is either required to be offered to us under the applicable facilities portfolio management agreement or a PRO has a reasonable basis to believe that the controlling owner of the property intends to sell the property in the next seven years. 
 Our PROs have management service agreements with all of the properties in our captive pipeline and hold controlling and non-controlling ownership interests in some of these properties. With respect to each property in our captive pipeline in which a PRO holds a controlling ownership interest, such PRO has agreed that it will not transfer (or permit the transfer of, to the extent possible) any interest in such self storage property without first offering or causing to be offered (if permissible) such interest to us. In addition, upon maturity of the outstanding mortgage indebtedness encumbering such property, so long as occupancy is consistent with or exceeds average local market levels, which we determine in our sole discretion, such PRO has agreed to offer or cause to be offered (if permissible) such interest to us. With respect to captive pipeline properties in which our PROs have a non-controlling ownership interest or no ownership interest, each PRO has agreed to use commercially reasonable good faith efforts to facilitate our purchase of such property. We preserve the discretion to accept or reject any of the properties that our PROs are required to, or elect to, offer (or cause to be offered) to us. 
 Access Additional Off-Market Acquisition Opportunities. Our PROs have established an extensive network of industry relationships and contacts in their respective markets. Through these local connections, our PROs are able to access acquisition opportunities that are not publicly marketed or sold through auctions. Our structure incentivizes our PROs to source acquisitions in their markets from third-party sellers and consolidate these properties into the Company. We believe our PROs' networks, their industry expertise and close familiarity with the other operators in their markets provide us with a clear competitive advantage in identifying and selecting attractive acquisition opportunities, in many cases, before they are publicly marketed. Additionally, we have established a corporate acquisitions team that, through relationships with our PROs and other market participants, sources acquisition opportunities whereby the properties will be managed by our corporate property management team. We believe our reputation as a reliable, well-capitalized buyer, along with our use of OP units as transactional currency which offers a tax-deferred transaction to self storage owners seeking to sell their properties, gives us a competitive advantage over self storage companies that do not have the same transactional history or currency as us. 
 Recruit Additional New PROs in Target Markets. We intend to continue to execute on our external growth strategy through additional acquisitions and contributions from future PROs in key markets. We believe there is significant opportunity for growth through consolidation of the highly fragmented composition of the market. We believe that future operators will be attracted to our unique structure, providing them with lower cost of capital, better economies of scale, and greater operational and overhead efficiencies while preserving their existing property management platforms. We intend to add one to three additional PROs to complement our existing geographic footprint and to achieve our goal of creating a highly diversified nationwide portfolio of properties focused in the top 100 MSAs. When considering a PRO candidate, we consider various factors, including the size of the potential PRO's portfolio, the quality and location of its properties, its market exposure, its operating expertise, its ability to grow its business, and its reputation with industry participants.

 Strategic Joint Venture Arrangements. We intend to continue to opportunistically partner with institutional funds and other institutional investors to acquire attractive portfolios utilizing a promoted return structure. We believe there is significant opportunity for continued external growth by partnering with institutional investors seeking to deploy capital in the self storage industry. We intend to leverage our property management platform to provide property and asset management services for future strategic joint ventures, generating additional operating profits and third party fee income. In addition, we consider the 75 third-party interest in our unconsolidated real estate ventures, which currently own 185 properties, to present a potential acquisition opportunity. This 75 third-party share of gross real estate assets is approximately 1.6 billion based on the historical book value of the joint ventures. Were we to pursue an acquisition of these interests, it could potentially drive our future growth. 
 Our Financing Strategy 
 We expect to maintain a flexible approach in financing new property acquisitions. In general, we expect to fund our property acquisitions through a combination of borrowings under bank credit facilities (including term loans and revolving facilities), property-level debt, issuances of OP equity and public and private equity and debt issuances. 
 As of December 31, 2022, our unsecured credit facility provided for total borrowings of 1.550 billion (the "credit facility"). The credit facility consists of the following components: (i) a revolving line of credit (the "Revolver") which provided for a total borrowing commitment up to 650.0 million, under which we could borrow, repay and re-borrow amounts, (ii) a 125.0 million tranche A term loan facility (the "Term Loan A"), (iii) a 250.0 million tranche B term loan facility (the "Term Loan B"), (iv) a 225.0 million tranche C term loan facility (the "Term Loan C"), (v) a 175.0 million tranche D term loan facility (the "Term Loan D") and (vi) a 125.0 million tranche E term loan facility (the "Term Loan E"). As of December 31, 2022, we had the entire amounts drawn on Term Loan A, Term Loan B, Term Loan C, Term Loan D and Term Loan E and we had 496.0 million of outstanding borrowings under the Revolver, and the capacity to borrow an additional 147.8 million under the Revolver while remaining in compliance with the credit facility's financial covenants. As of December 31, 2022, we had an expansion option under the credit facility, which, if exercised in full, would have provided for a total credit facility of 1.750 billion. 
 On January 3, 2023, we entered into a third amended and restated credit agreement which expands the total borrowing capacity of our credit facility by 405.0 million to 1.955 billion with an expansion option to expand the total borrowing capacity to 2.5 billion. The maturity date of the revolving line of credit is now January 2027, while the total revolving borrowing capacity was increased to 950 million from 650 million. In connection with the credit facility amendments the 125 million Term Loan A due January 2023 was retired, Term Loan B increased from 250 million to 275 million, Term Loan C increased from 225 million to 325 million, Term Loan D increased from 175 million to 275 million, and Term Loan E increased from 125 million to 130 million. 
 As of December 31, 2022, we had a credit agreement with a syndicated group of lenders for a term loan facility that was set to mature in June 2023 (the "2023 Term Loan Facility") and was separate from the credit facility in an aggregate amount of 175.0 million. As of December 31, 2022 the entire amount was outstanding under the 2023 Term Loan Facility with an effective interest rate of 2.83 . We had an expansion option under the 2023 Term Loan Facility, which, if exercised in full, would have provided for total borrowings in an aggregate amount of 400.0 million. In connection with the amendments to recast our credit facility on January 3, 2023, we repaid the 2023 Term Loan Facility in full. 
 We have a credit agreement with a lender for a term loan facility that matures in December 2028 (the "2028 Term Loan Facility") and is separate from the credit facility and 2023 Term Loan Facility in an aggregate amount of 75.0 million. As of December 31, 2022 the entire amount was outstanding under the 2028 Term Loan Facility with an effective interest rate of 4.62 . We have an expansion option under the 2028 Term Loan Facility, which, if exercised in full, would provide for total borrowings in an aggregate amount up to 125.0 million. 
 We have a credit agreement with a lender for a term loan facility that matures in April 2029 (the "April 2029 Term Loan Facility") and is separate from the credit facility, 2023 Term Loan Facility and 2028 Term Loan Facility in an aggregate amount of 100.0 million. As of December 31, 2022 the entire amount was outstanding under the April 2029 Term Loan Facility with an effective interest rate of 4.27 .

 We have a June 2029 Term Loan Facility that matures in June 2029 (the "June 2029 Term Loan Facility") and is separate from the credit facility, 2023 Term Loan Facility, 2028 Term Loan Facility, and April 2029 Term Loan Facility in an aggregate amount of 285.0 million. As of December 31, 2022, the June 2029 Term Loan Facility had a variable effective interest rate of 5.37 . We have an expansion option under the June 2029 Term Loan Facility, which, if exercised in full, would provide for total borrowings in an aggregate amount up to 300.0 million. 
 The credit facility, 2023 Term Loan Facility, 2028 Term Loan Facility, April 2029 Term Loan Facility and the June 2029 Term Loan Facility each contain the same financial covenants and customary affirmative and negative covenants that, among other things, could limit the Company's ability to make distributions or certain investments, incur debt, incur liens and enter into certain transactions. 
 On August 30, 2019, our operating partnership issued 100.0 million of 3.98 senior unsecured notes due August 30, 2029 (the "2029 Notes") and 50.0 million of 4.08 senior unsecured notes due August 30, 2031 (the "August 2031 Notes") in a private placement to certain institutional investors. 
 On October 22, 2020, our operating partnership issued 150.0 million of 2.99 senior unsecured notes due August 5, 2030 (the "August 2030 Notes") and 100.0 million of 3.09 senior unsecured notes due August 5, 2032 (the "August 2032 Notes"). 
 On May 26, 2021, our operating partnership issued 55.0 million of 3.10 senior unsecured notes due May 4, 2033 (the "May 2033 Notes"). 
 On July 26, 2021, our operating partnership issued 35.0 million of 2.16 senior unsecured notes due May 4, 2026 (the "2026 Notes") and 90.0 million of 3.00 senior unsecured notes due May 4, 2031 (the "May 2031 Notes"). 
 On December 14, 2021, our operating partnership issued 75.0 million of 2.72 senior unsecured notes due November 30, 2030 (the "November 2030 Notes"), 175.0 million of 2.81 senior unsecured notes due November 30, 2031 (the "November 2031 Notes") and 75.0 million of 3.06 senior unsecured notes due November 30, 2036 (the "2036 Notes"). 
 On January 28, 2022, our operating partnership issued 125.0 million of 2.96 senior unsecured notes due November 30, 2033 (the "November 2033 Notes"). 
 On September 28, 2022, our operating partnership issued 200.0 million of 5.06 senior unsecured notes due November 16, 2032 (the "November 2032 Notes" and together with the 2026 Notes, 2029 Notes, August 2030 Notes, November 2030 Notes, May 2031 Notes, August 2031 Notes, November 2031 Notes, August 2032 Notes, May 2033 Notes, November 2033 Notes and 2036 Notes, the "Senior Unsecured Notes") in a private placement to certain institutional investors. 
 The Senior Unsecured Notes are subject to customary affirmative and negative covenants that, among other things, limit the Company's ability to make distributions or certain investments, incur debt, incur liens and enter into certain transactions. 
 We expect to employ leverage in our capital structure in amounts determined from time to time by our board of trustees. Although our board of trustees has not adopted a policy which limits the total amount of indebtedness that we may incur, it will consider a number of factors in evaluating our level of indebtedness from time to time, as well as the amount of such indebtedness that will be either fixed and variable-rate, and in making financial decisions, including, among others, the following: 
 the interest rate of the proposed financing; 
 the extent to which the financing impacts our flexibility in managing our properties; 
 prepayment penalties and restrictions on refinancing; 
 the purchase price of properties we acquire with debt financing; 
 our long-term objectives with respect to the financing; 
 our target investment returns; 
 the ability of particular properties, and the Company as a whole, to generate cash flow sufficient to cover expected debt service payments;

 overall level of consolidated indebtedness; 
 timing of debt maturities; 
 provisions that require recourse and cross-collateralization; 
 corporate credit ratios including debt service coverage, debt to total market capitalization and debt to undepreciated assets; and 
 the overall ratio of fixed- and variable-rate debt. 
 Our indebtedness may be recourse, non-recourse or cross-collateralized. If the indebtedness is non-recourse, the collateral will be limited to the particular properties to which the indebtedness relates. In addition, we may invest in properties subject to existing loans secured by mortgages or similar liens on our properties, or may refinance properties acquired on a leveraged basis. We may use the proceeds from any borrowings to refinance existing indebtedness, to refinance investments, including the redevelopment of existing properties, for general working capital or for other purposes when we believe it is advisable. 
 Dividend Reinvestment Plan 
 In the future, we may adopt a dividend reinvestment plan that will permit shareholders who elect to participate in the plan to have their cash dividends reinvested in additional common shares. 
 Regulation 
 General 
 Generally, self storage properties are subject to various laws, ordinances and regulations, including those relating to lien sale rights and procedures, public accommodations, insurance, and the environment. Changes in any of these laws, ordinances or regulations could increase the potential liability existing or created by tenants or others on our properties. Laws, ordinances, or regulations affecting development, construction, operation, upkeep, safety and taxation requirements may result in significant unanticipated expenditures, loss of self storage sites or other impairments to operations, which would adversely affect our cash flows from operating activities. 
 Under the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990 (the "ADA"), all places of public accommodation are required to meet certain federal requirements related to access and use by disabled persons. A number of additional U.S. federal, state and local laws may also require modifications to our properties, or restrict certain further renovations of the properties, with respect to access thereto by disabled persons. The ADA or these other laws may also apply to our website. For additional information on the ADA, see "Item 1A. Risk Factors Risks Related to Our Business Costs associated with complying with the ADA may result in unanticipated expenses." 
 Insurance activities are subject to state insurance laws and regulations as determined by the particular insurance commissioner for each state in accordance with the McCarran-Ferguson Act, as well as subject to the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act and the privacy regulations promulgated by the Federal Trade Commission pursuant thereto.

 Under various U.S. federal, state and local laws, ordinances and regulations, owners and operators of real estate may be liable for the costs of investigating and remediating certain hazardous substances or other regulated materials on or in such property. The Comprehensive Environmental Response Compensation and Liability Act of 1980, as amended ("CERCLA") and comparable state laws typically impose strict joint and several liabilities without regard to whether the owner or operator knew of, or was responsible for, the presence of such substances or materials. The presence of such substances or materials, or the failure to properly remediate such substances, may adversely affect the owner's or operator's ability to lease, sell or rent such property or to borrow using such property as collateral. Persons who arrange for the disposal or treatment of hazardous substances or other regulated materials may be liable for the costs of removal or remediation of such substances at a disposal or treatment facility, whether or not such facility is owned or operated by such person. Certain environmental laws impose liability for release of asbestos-containing materials into the air and third-parties may seek recovery from owners or operators of real properties for personal injury associated with asbestos-containing materials. Certain environmental laws also impose liability, without regard to knowledge or fault, for removal or remediation of hazardous substances or other regulated materials upon owners and operators of contaminated property. Moreover, the past or present owner or operator of a property from which a release emanates could be liable for any personal injuries or property damages that may result from such releases, as well as any damages to natural resources that may arise from such releases. Certain environmental laws impose compliance obligations on owners and operators of real property with respect to the management of hazardous materials and other regulated substances. For example, environmental laws govern the management of asbestos-containing materials and lead-based paint. Failure to comply with these laws can result in penalties or other sanctions. In connection with the ownership, operation and management of our current or past properties and any properties that we may acquire and/or manage in the future, we could be legally responsible for environmental liabilities or costs relating to a release of hazardous substances or other regulated materials at or emanating from such property. In order to assess the potential for such liability, we conduct an environmental assessment of each property prior to acquisition and manage our properties in accordance with environmental laws while we own or operate them. We have engaged qualified, reputable and adequately insured environmental consulting firms to perform environmental site assessments of all of our properties prior to acquisition and are not aware of any environmental issues that are expected to materially impact the operations of any property. For additional information on environmental matters and regulation, see "Item 1A. Risk Factors Risks Related to Our Business Environmental compliance costs and liabilities associated with operating our properties may affect our results of operations." 
 Property management activities are often subject to state real estate brokerage laws and regulations as determined by the particular real estate commission for each state. We may be required to comply with various state privacy statutes in connection with the operation of our business. 
 REIT Qualification 
 We have elected and we believe that we have qualified to be taxed as a REIT under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, (the "Code"), commencing with our taxable year ended on December 31, 2015. We generally will not be subject to U.S. federal income tax on our net taxable income to the extent that we distribute annually all of our net taxable income to our shareholders and maintain our qualification as a REIT. We believe that we have been organized and have operated in conformity with the requirements for qualification and taxation as a REIT under the Code, and we expect that our intended manner of operation will enable us to continue to meet the requirements for qualification and taxation as a REIT. To qualify, and maintain our qualification, as a REIT, we must meet on a continuing basis, through our organization and actual investment and operating results, various requirements under the Code relating to, among other things, the sources of our gross income, the composition and values of our assets, our distribution levels and the diversity of ownership of our shares. If we fail to qualify as a REIT in any taxable year and do not qualify for certain statutory relief provisions, we will be subject to U.S. federal income tax at regular corporate rates and may be precluded from qualifying as a REIT for the subsequent four taxable years following the year during which we failed to qualify as a REIT. Even if we qualify for taxation as a REIT, we still may be subject to some U.S. federal, state and local taxes on our income or assets. In addition, subject to maintaining our qualification as a REIT, a portion of our business is conducted through, and a portion of our income is earned by, one or more taxable REIT subsidiaries ("TRSs"), which are subject to U.S. federal corporate income tax at regular rates. Distributions paid by us generally will not be eligible for taxation at the preferential U.S. federal income tax rates that currently apply to certain distributions received by individuals from taxable corporations, unless such distributions are attributable to dividends received by us from a TRS.

 Competition 
 We compete with many other entities engaged in real estate investment activities for customers and acquisitions of self storage properties and other assets, including national, regional, and local owners, operators, and developers of self storage properties. We compete based on a number of factors including location, rental rates, security, suitability of the property's design to prospective tenants' needs, and the manner in which the property is operated and marketed. We believe that the primary competition for potential customers comes from other self storage properties within a three to five mile radius. We have positioned our properties within their respective markets as high-quality operations that emphasize tenant convenience, security, and professionalism. 
 We also may compete with numerous other potential buyers when pursuing a possible property for acquisition, which can increase the potential cost of a project. These competing bidders also may possess greater resources, or have a lower cost of capital, than us and therefore be in a better position to acquire a property. However, our use of OP units and subordinated performance units as transactional currency allows us to structure our acquisitions in tax-deferred transactions. As a result, potential targets who are tax-sensitive might favor us as a suitor. 
 Our primary national competitors in many of our markets for both tenants and acquisition opportunities include local and regional operators, institutional investors, private equity funds, as well as the other public self storage REITs, including Public Storage, CubeSmart, Extra Space Storage Inc. and Life Storage, Inc. These entities also seek financing through similar channels to the Company. Therefore, we will continue to compete for institutional investors in a market where funds for real estate investment may decrease. 
 Human Capital 
 We seek to foster a diverse and inclusive work environment that values each individual team member s talents and contributions, while channeling those efforts toward our common core values of integrity, accountability, humility and compassion. Our success relies on the general professionalism of our employees and our PRO's site managers and staff which are contributing factors to a site's ability to successfully secure rentals, retain tenants and maintain clean and secure self storage properties. We seek to increase employee retention and well-being and our team members enjoy a robust benefit package that includes medical, dental, vision, life insurance, 401K with matching employer contribution and a performance-based bonus incentive plan. We also seek to promote diversity among our employees and management team. As of December 31, 2022, approximately 62 of our employees were women and 42 of our senior management team (Director level and above) were women, including Tamara Fischer, our Chief Executive Officer and member of our Board of Trustees. 
 As of December 31, 2022, we had 1,155 employees, which includes employees of our property management platform but does not include persons employed by our PROs. As of December 31, 2022, our PROs, collectively, had approximately 700 full-time and part-time employees involved in management, operations, and reporting with respect to our self storage property portfolio.

 Adverse economic or other conditions in the markets in which we do business and more broadly associated with the real estate industry could negatively affect our occupancy levels and rental rates and therefore our operating results and the value of our self storage properties. 
 Our operating results are dependent upon our ability to achieve optimal occupancy levels and rental rates at our self storage properties. Adverse economic or other conditions in the markets in which we do business, particularly in our markets in Texas, California, Florida, Oregon, and Georgia, which accounted for approximately 19 , 14 , 9 , 8 , and 6 , respectively, of our total rental and other property-related revenues for the year ended December 31, 2022, may lower our occupancy levels and limit our ability to maintain or increase rents or require us to offer rental discounts. No single customer represented a significant concentration of our 2022 revenues. However, our property portfolio consists solely of self storage properties and is therefore subject to risks inherent in investments in a single industry. The following adverse developments, among others, in the markets in which we do business may adversely affect the operating performance of our properties: 
 business layoffs or downsizing, industry slowdowns, relocation of businesses and changing demographics; 
 periods of economic slowdown, recession, or inflationary environments, declining demand for self storage generally or in a particular area or the public perception that any of these events may occur; 
 local or regional real estate market conditions, such as competing properties or products, the oversupply of self storage, or vacancies or changes in self storage space market rents; 
 perceptions by prospective tenants of the safety, convenience and attractiveness of our properties and the neighborhoods in which they are located; and 
 other events affecting or shifting consumer discretionary spending. 
 Any of the above events may reduce our rental revenues, impair our operating results, and reduce our ability to satisfy our debt service obligations and make cash distributions to our shareholders, and the effect of the foregoing may be greater than it would be were our investments not limited to a single industry. 
 We may not be successful in identifying and consummating suitable acquisitions, adding additional suitable new PROs, or integrating and operating such acquisitions, including integrating them into our financial and operational reporting infrastructure and internal control framework in a timely manner, which may impede our growth. 
 Our ability to expand through acquisitions is integral to our business strategy and requires us to identify suitable acquisition candidates or investment opportunities that meet our criteria and are compatible with our growth strategy. We may not be successful in identifying suitable properties or other assets that meet our acquisition criteria or in consummating acquisitions on satisfactory terms or at all. Failure to identify or consummate acquisitions will slow our growth, which could in turn adversely affect our share price. 
 For the potential acquisitions in our captive pipeline, we have not entered into negotiations with the respective owners of these properties and there can be no assurance as to whether we will acquire any of these properties or the actual timing of any such acquisitions. Each captive pipeline property is subject to additional due diligence and the determination by us to pursue the acquisition of the property. In addition, with respect to the captive pipeline properties in which our PROs have a non-controlling ownership interest or no ownership interest, the current owner of each property is not required to offer such property to us and there can be no assurance that we will acquire these properties. 
 Our ability to acquire properties on favorable terms and successfully integrate and operate them, including integrating them into our financial and operational reporting infrastructure in a timely manner, may be constrained by the following significant risks: 
 
 17 

Table of Contents 

 we face competition from national, regional and local owners, operators and developers of self storage properties, which may result in higher property acquisition prices and reduced yields; 
 we may not be able to achieve satisfactory completion of due diligence investigations and other customary closing conditions; 
 we may fail to finance an acquisition on favorable terms or at all; 
 we may spend more time and incur more costs than budgeted to make necessary improvements or renovations to, and to integrate and operate, acquired properties; and 
 we may acquire properties subject to liabilities without any recourse, or with only limited recourse, with respect to unknown liabilities such as liabilities for clean-up of undisclosed environmental contamination, tax liabilities, claims by persons dealing with the former owners of the properties and claims for indemnification by general partners, trustees, officers and others indemnified by the former owners of the properties. 
 The contributors of properties may make limited representations and warranties to us about the properties and may agree to indemnify us up to a specified amount for a certain period of time following the closing for breaches of those representations and warranties. However, any resulting liabilities identified may not fall within the scope or time frame covered by the indemnification, and we may be required to bear those liabilities, which may materially and adversely affect our operating results, financial condition and business. 
 We face competition for tenants. 
 We compete with many other entities engaged in real estate investment activities for tenants, including national, regional and local owners, operators and developers of self storage properties. Actions by our competitors may decrease or prevent increases in the occupancy and rental rates, while increasing the operating expenses of our properties. 
 Increases in taxes and regulatory compliance costs, including as a result of changes in law or property reassessments, may reduce our income and adversely impact our cash flows. 
 Increases in income or other taxes generally are not passed through to tenants under leases and may reduce or negatively impact our net income, funds from operations ("FFO"), cash flows, financial condition, ability to pay or refinance our debt obligations, ability to make cash distributions to shareholders, and the trading price of our securities. 
 In addition, the value of our properties may be reassessed for property tax purposes by taxing authorities including as a result of our acquisition activities. For example, our property taxes could increase due to changes in tax rates or removal of limitations on the amount by which our property taxes or property reassessments may increase. For example, in November 2020, there was an initiative in California, which did not pass, to remove certain limits on annual real estate tax increases of assessed value of real property. To the extent a similar future initiative is successful, it would increase the assessed value and/or tax rates applicable to self storage properties in California. We currently have 86 consolidated properties and 12 unconsolidated properties in California. Accordingly, the amount of property taxes we pay in the future may increase substantially from what we have paid in the past or from what we expected in connection with our underwriting activities, which could adversely impact our operating results, cash flow, and our ability to pay any expected dividends to our shareholders. 
 Similarly, in response to facing severe budgetary problems, many states and jurisdictions are considering or implementing changes in laws such as increasing sales taxes, increasing the potential liability for environmental conditions existing on properties, increasing the restrictions on discharges or other conditions, or mandating paid family leave for employees, which may result in significant unanticipated expenditures, which could result in similar adverse effects.

 Our storage leases are relatively short-term in nature, which exposes us to the risk that we may have to re-lease our units and we may be unable to do so on attractive terms, on a timely basis or at all. 
 Our storage leases are relatively short-term in nature, typically month-to-month, which exposes us to the risk that we may have to re-lease our units frequently and we may be unable to do so on attractive terms, on a timely basis or at all. Because these leases generally permit the tenant to leave at the end of the month without penalty, our revenues and operating results may be impacted by declines in market rental rates more quickly than if our leases were for longer terms. In addition, any delay in re-leasing units as vacancies arise would reduce our revenues and harm our operating results. 
 Security breaches through cyber-attacks, cyber-intrusions, or other methods could disrupt our information technology networks and related systems. 
 We and our PROs are increasingly dependent upon automated information technology processes and Internet commerce, and many of our and their tenants come from the telephone or over the Internet. Moreover, the nature of our and our PROs' business involves the receipt and retention of certain personal information about such tenants. In many cases, we and our PROs also rely significantly on third-party vendors to retain data, process transactions and provide other systems services. Our networks and operations could be disrupted, and sensitive data could be compromised, by physical or electronic security breaches, targeted against us, our PROs, our vendors or other organizations, including financial markets or institutions, including by way of or through cyber-attacks or cyber-intrusions over the Internet, malware, computer viruses, attachments to e-mails, phishing, employee theft or misuse, or inadequate security controls. Although we make efforts to protect the security and integrity of our networks and systems, there can be no assurance that these efforts and measures will be effective or that attempted security breaches or disruptions would not be successful, as such attacks and breaches may be difficult to detect (or not detected at all) and are becoming more sophisticated. In such event, we may experience business interruptions; data loss, ransom, misappropriation, or corruption; theft or misuse of confidential or proprietary information; or litigation and investigation by tenants, governmental or regulatory agencies, or other third parties, which could result in the payment of fines, penalties and other damages. Such events could also have other adverse impacts on us, including breaches of debt covenants, other contractual or REIT compliance obligations, or late or misstated financial reports, and significant diversion of management attention and resources. As a result, such events could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows and harm our business reputation or have such effects on our PROs. 
 Costs associated with complying with the ADA may result in unanticipated expenses. 
 Under the ADA and other federal, state and local laws, we are required to meet certain requirements related to access and use by disabled persons. Noncompliance with the ADA could result in the imposition of fines or an award of damages to private litigants and also could result in an order to correct any non-complying feature, which could result in substantial capital expenditures. If one or more of our properties or websites is not in compliance with the ADA or similar laws, then we would be required to incur additional costs to bring the property or websites into compliance. If we incur such costs and they are substantial, our financial condition, results of operations, cash flow, per share trading price of our common shares and our ability to satisfy our debt service obligations and to make cash distributions to our shareholders could be adversely affected. 
 Environmental compliance costs and liabilities associated with operating our properties may affect our results of operations. 
 Under various U.S. federal, state and local environmental laws, ordinances and regulations, owners and operators of real estate may be liable for the costs of investigating and remediating certain hazardous substances or other regulated materials on or in such property. No assurances can be given that existing environmental studies with respect to any of our properties reveal all environmental liabilities, that any prior owner or operator of our properties did not create any material environmental condition not known to us, or that a material environmental condition does not otherwise exist as to any one or more of our properties. There also exists the risk that material environmental conditions, liabilities or compliance concerns may have arisen after the review was completed or may arise in the future. Finally, future laws, ordinances or regulations and future interpretations of existing laws, ordinances or regulations may impose additional material environmental liability.

 We and certain of our PROs have tenant insurance- and/or tenant protection plan-related arrangements that are in some cases subject to state-specific governmental regulation, which may adversely affect our results. 
 We and certain of our PROs have tenant insurance- and/or tenant protection plan-related arrangements with regulated insurance companies and our tenants. Some of our PROs earn access fees in connection with these arrangements. We receive a portion of the fees from these PROs. The tenant insurance and tenant protection plan businesses, including the payments associated with these arrangements, are in some cases subject to state-specific governmental regulation. State regulatory authorities generally have broad discretion to grant, renew and revoke licenses and approvals, to promulgate, interpret and implement regulations, and to evaluate compliance with regulations through periodic examinations, audits and investigations of the affairs of insurance industry participants. Although these arrangements are managed by our property management platform and/or certain of our PROs who have developed marketing programs and management procedures to navigate the regulatory environment, as a result of regulatory or private action in any jurisdiction in which we operate, we may be temporarily or permanently suspended from continuing some or all of our tenant insurance- and/or tenant protection plan-related activities, or otherwise fined or penalized or suffer an adverse judgment, which could adversely affect our business and results of operations. 
 Privacy concerns could result in regulatory changes that may harm our business. 
 Personal privacy has become a significant issue in the jurisdictions in which we operate. Many jurisdictions in which we operate have imposed or in the future may impose restrictions and requirements on the use of personal information by those collecting such information. For example, the California Consumer Privacy Act of 2018, which became effective as of January 1, 2020, together with the California Privacy Rights Act, provides consumers with expansive rights and control over personal information obtained by or shared with certain covered businesses. Changes to law or regulations or the passage of new laws affecting privacy, if applicable to our business, could impose additional costs and liability on us and could limit our use and disclosure of such information. 
 We face possible risks and costs associated with the effects of climate change and severe weather. 
 We cannot predict the rate at which climate change will progress. However, the physical effects of climate change could have a material adverse effect on our properties, operations, and business. To the extent that climate change impacts changes in weather patterns, our markets could experience severe weather, including hurricanes, tornados, earthquakes, severe winter storms, wildfires and coastal flooding due to increases in storm intensity and rising sea levels. Over time, these conditions could result in declining demand for storage at our properties or in our inability to operate them at all. Climate change and severe weather may also have indirect effects on our business by increasing the cost of, or decreasing the availability of, property insurance on terms we find acceptable, by increasing the costs of energy, maintenance, repair of fire, water and/or wind damage, and snow removal at our properties. 
 Changes in federal, state, and local legislation and regulation as well as international pacts or treaties based on concerns about climate change could result in increased capital expenditures on our existing properties (for example, to improve their energy efficiency and/or resistance to severe weather) without a corresponding increase in revenue, which may result in adverse impacts to our net income. In recent years, there have been a number of new legal efforts to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and to take other similar actions to combat the effects of climate change, including at the international level and at the U.S. federal, state and local levels. We rely on a limited number of vendors to provide key services, such as the provision of utilities, at certain of our properties. Our business and property operations may be adversely affected if these vendors fail to adequately provide key services at our properties as a result of unanticipated events, including those resulting from climate change. If a vendor fails to adequately provide utilities or other important services, we may experience significant interruptions in service and disruptions to business operations at our properties, incur remediation costs, and become subject to claims and damage to our reputation. There can be no assurance that climate change and severe weather, or the potential impacts of these events on our vendors, will not have a material adverse effect on our properties, operations, or business.

 Uninsured losses or losses in excess of our insurance coverage could adversely affect our financial condition, operating results and cash flow. 
 We maintain comprehensive liability, fire, flood, earthquake, wind (as deemed necessary or as required by our lenders), extended coverage and rental loss insurance with respect to our properties. Certain types of losses, however, may be either uninsurable or not economically insurable either in total or in part (due to location or otherwise), such as losses due to earthquakes, hurricanes, tornadoes, floods, riots, acts of war or terrorism. Should an uninsured loss occur, we could lose both our investment in and anticipated profits and cash flow from a property or otherwise be subject to significant liabilities. In addition, if any such loss is insured, we may be required to pay significant amounts on any claim for recovery of such a loss prior to our insurer being obligated to reimburse us for the loss, or the amount of the loss may exceed our coverage for the loss. We currently self-insure a portion of our commercial insurance deductible risk through our captive insurance company. To the extent that our captive insurance company is unable to bear that risk, we may be required to fund additional capital to our captive insurance company or we may be required to bear that loss. As a result, our operating results may be adversely affected. 
 Illiquidity of real estate investments could significantly impede our ability to respond to adverse changes in the performance of our properties. 
 Because real estate investments are relatively illiquid and we have agreed and may in the future agree to certain transfer restrictions with respect to our properties, our ability to promptly sell one or more properties in our portfolio in response to changing economic, financial and investment conditions is limited. The real estate market is affected by many factors, such as general economic conditions, availability of financing, interest rates and other factors, including supply and demand, that are beyond our control. We cannot predict whether we will be able to sell any property for the price or on the terms set by us or whether any price or other terms offered by a prospective purchaser would be acceptable to us. We also cannot predict the length of time needed to find a willing purchaser and to close the sale of a property. In addition, we may be required to expend funds to correct defects or to make improvements before a property can be sold. We cannot assure you that we will have funds available to correct those defects or to make those improvements. 
 Our business could be harmed if key personnel terminate their employment with us. 
 Our success depends, to a significant extent, on the continued services of Arlen D. Nordhagen, Tamara D. Fischer, David G. Cramer and Brandon S. Togashi and the other members of our senior management team. We have entered into employment agreements with Mr. Nordhagen, Ms. Fischer, Mr. Cramer and Mr. Togashi and these employment agreements provide for an initial term of employment and automatic one-year extensions thereafter unless either party provides at least 90 days' notice of non-renewal. Notwithstanding these agreements, there can be no assurance that any of them will remain employed by us. The loss of services of one or more members of our senior management team could harm our business and our prospects. This risk may be heightened during periods of tight labor market conditions. 
 We invest in strategic joint ventures that subject us to additional risks. 
 Some of our investments are, and in the future may be, structured as strategic joint ventures. Part of our strategy is to opportunistically partner with institutional funds and other institutional investors to acquire attractive portfolios through a promoted return structure. These arrangements are driven by the magnitude of capital required to complete the acquisitions and maintain the acquired portfolios. Such arrangements involve risks not present where a third party is not involved, including the possibility that partners or co-venturers might become bankrupt or otherwise fail to fund their share of required capital contributions. Additionally, partners or co-venturers might at any time have economic or other business interests or goals different from us and or in competition with us.

Table of Contents 

 Joint ventures generally provide for a reduced level of control over an acquired project because governance rights are shared with others. Accordingly, certain major decisions relating to joint ventures, including decisions relating to, among other things, the approval of annual budgets, sales and acquisitions of properties, financings, and certain actions relating to bankruptcy, are often made by a majority vote of the investors or by separate agreements that are reached with respect to individual decisions. In addition, such decisions may be subject to the risk that the partners or co-venturers may make business, financial or management decisions with which we do not agree or take risks or otherwise act in a manner that does not serve our best interests. Because we may not have the ability to exercise control over such operations, we may not be able to realize some or all of the benefits that we believe will be created from our involvement. At times, we and our partners or co-venturers may also each have the right to trigger a buy-sell arrangement, which could cause us to sell our interest, or acquire our partners' or co-venturers' interest, at a time when we otherwise would not have initiated such a transaction. If any of the foregoing were to occur, our business, financial condition and results of operations could suffer as a result. 
 The on-going COVID-19 pandemic or the future outbreak of any other highly infectious or contagious diseases, could adversely impact or cause significant disruption to our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. 
 We face various risks related to pandemics, epidemics and other outbreaks of highly infectious or contagious diseases, including the on-going COVID-19 pandemic. New COVID-19 variants continue to emerge and have spread locally, regionally, nationally, and globally. The severity of new variants remains uncertain and there is no guarantee that governments and businesses in the future will not reinstate many of the more restrictive safety protocols that were implemented at various times over the last three years. There is no assurance that current or future variants will be contained or that the recommended safety protocols, including the use of vaccines, will continue to be effective or available in the long term. Impact of the COVID-19, future variants thereof or other highly infectious or contagious diseases and the response of governments to combat the spread of these disease, could, among other things, affect our tenants ability to meet their obligations to us, impact consumer discretionary spending, reduce new move-ins, compel complete or partial closures and operational changes at our properties, reduce demand for growth opportunities, such as acquiring new properties or adding new PROs, and interrupt the availability of our and our PROs' personnel. As a result, the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic and any future outbreak of another highly infectious or contagious disease, could adversely impact our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. 
 Risks Related to Our Structure and Our Relationships with Our PROs 
 Some of our PROs have limited experience operating under our capital structure, and we may not be able to achieve the desired outcomes that the structure is intended to produce. 
 Some of our PROs have limited experience operating under our capital structure. As a means of incentivizing our PROs to drive operating performance and support the sustainability of the operating cash flow from the properties they manage on our behalf, we issued each PRO subordinated performance units aimed at aligning the interests of our PROs with our interests and those of our shareholders. The subordinated performance units are entitled to distributions exclusively tied to the performance of each PRO's managed portfolios but only after minimum performance thresholds are satisfied. Our issuance of such units, however, may have been and could be based on inaccurate valuations and thus misallocated, which would limit or eliminate the effectiveness of our intended incentive-based program. 
 We are restricted in making certain property sales on account of agreements with our PROs that may require us to keep certain properties that we would otherwise sell. 
 The partnership unit designations related to our subordinated performance units provide that, until March 31, 2023, our operating partnership may not sell, dispose or otherwise transfer any property that is a part of the applicable self storage property portfolio relating to a series of subordinated performance units without the consent of the partners (including us) holding at least 50 of the then outstanding OP units and the consent of partners holding at least 50 of the then outstanding series of subordinated performance units that relate to the applicable property, except for sales, dispositions or other transfers of a property to wholly owned subsidiaries of our operating partnership. This restriction may require us to keep certain properties that we would otherwise sell, which could have an adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition, cash flow and ability to execute our business plan. In addition, we may enter into agreements with future PROs that contain the same or similar restrictions or that impose such restrictions for different periods.

 Our ability to terminate our facilities portfolio management agreements ("FPMAs") and asset management agreements ("AMAs") with a PRO is limited, which may adversely affect our ability to execute our business plan. 
 We may elect to terminate our FPMAs and AMAs with a PRO and transfer property management responsibilities over the properties managed by such PRO to us (or our designee), (i) upon certain defaults by a PRO as set forth in these agreements, or (ii) if the PRO's properties, on a portfolio basis, fail to meet certain predetermined performance thresholds for more than two consecutive calendar years or if the operating cash flow generated by the properties of the PRO for any calendar year falls below a level that will enable us to fund minimum levels of distributions, debt service payments attributable to the properties, and fund the properties' allocable operating expenses. Consequently, to the extent a PRO complies with these covenants, standards, and minimum requirements, we may not be able to terminate the applicable FPMAs and AMAs and transfer property management responsibilities over such properties to us (or our designee) even if our board believes that such PRO is not properly executing our business plan and/or is failing to operate its properties to their full potential. Moreover, transferring the management responsibilities over the properties managed by a PRO may be costly or difficult to implement or may be delayed, even if we are able to and believe that such a change in portfolio and property management would be beneficial to us and our shareholders. 
 We may less vigorously pursue enforcement of terms of agreements entered into with our PROs because of conflicts of interest with our PROs. 
 Our PROs are entities that have contributed self storage properties to us in exchange for ownership interests in us. As part of each transaction, our PROs make limited representations to us regarding the entities, properties and other assets to be acquired by us in the contribution and generally agree to indemnify us for 12 months after the closing of the contribution for breaches of such representations. Such indemnification is limited, however, and we are not entitled to any other indemnification in connection with the contributions. In addition, following each contribution from a PRO, the day-to-day operations of each of the managed properties will be managed by the PRO who was the principal of the applicable property portfolios prior to the contribution. In addition, certain key persons of our PROs are members of our board or our PRO advisory committee. Consequently, we may choose not to enforce, or to enforce less vigorously, our rights under these agreements and any other agreements with our PROs due to our desire to maintain our ongoing relationship with our PROs, which could adversely affect our operating results and business. 
 We own self storage properties in some of the same geographic regions as our PROs and may compete for tenants with other properties managed by our PROs. 
 Pursuant to our FPMAs, each PRO has agreed that, without our consent, the PRO will not, and it will cause its affiliates (other than Blue Sky's sub-manager) not to, enter into any new arrangements for the management of additional self storage properties within any PRO's assigned territory. However, we have not and will not acquire all of the self storage properties of our PROs. We will therefore own self storage properties in some of the same geographic regions as our PROs, and, as a result, we and our PROs may compete for tenants. This competition may affect our ability to attract and retain tenants and may reduce the rental rates we are able to charge, which could adversely affect our operating results and business. 
 Our PROs may engage in other activities, diverting their attention from the management of our properties, which could adversely affect the execution of our business plan and our operating results. 
 Our PROs and their employees and personnel are in the business of managing self storage properties. We have agreed that our PROs may continue to manage properties not included in our portfolio, and our PROs are not obligated to dedicate any specific employees or personnel exclusively to the management of our properties. As a result, their time and efforts may be diverted from the management of our properties, which could adversely affect the execution of our business plan and our operating results.

 When a PRO elects or is required to "retire" we may become exposed to new and additional costs and risks. 
 Under our FPMAs, after a two-year period following the initial contribution of their properties to us, a PRO may elect, or be required, to "retire" from the self storage business. Upon a retirement event, management of the properties will be transferred to us (or our designee) in exchange for OP units with a value equal to four times the average of the normalized annual EBITDA from the management contracts related to such PRO's managed portfolio over the immediately preceding 24-month period. As a result of this transfer, we may become exposed to new and additional costs and risks. Accordingly, the retirement of a PRO may adversely affect our financial condition and operating results. For example, in connection with our internalization of a retiring PRO, there can be no assurance that we will be able to retain such retiring PRO's employees, successfully hire new employees, or effectively integrate such employees and the retiring PRO's property management platform into our or another PRO's property management platform. 
 Our contribution transactions were generally not negotiated on an arm's-length basis and may not be as favorable to us as if they had been negotiated with unaffiliated third parties. 
 We did not conduct arm's-length negotiations with certain of the parties involved regarding the terms of our contribution transactions, including the contribution agreements, FPMAs, sales commission agreements, AMAs and registration rights agreements. In the course of structuring such transactions, certain members of our senior management team and other contributors had the ability to influence the type and level of benefits that they received from us. Accordingly, the terms of such transactions may not solely reflect the best interests of us or our shareholders and may be overly favorable to the other party to such transactions and agreements. 
 Conflicts of interest could arise with respect to certain transactions between the holders of OP units and subordinated performance units, which include our PROs, on the one hand, and us and our shareholders, on the other. 
 Conflicts of interest could arise with respect to the interests of holders of OP units and subordinated performance units, on the one hand, which include members of our senior management team, PROs, and trustees and us and our shareholders, on the other. Certain business combinations, the sale, disposition or transfer of certain of our assets or the repayment of certain indebtedness that may be desirable to us and our shareholders could have adverse tax consequences to such unit holders. In addition, under Maryland law, our trustees and officers have duties to the Company in connection with their management of the Company, however, under Delaware law, as a general partner, we have fiduciary duties to our operating partnership and to the limited partners in connection with the management of our operating partnership. Our duties as a general partner may come into conflict with the duties of our trustees and officers to the Company and our shareholders and we are not required to resolve such conflicts in favor of either the Company or the limited partners in our operating partnership. Further, there can be no assurance that any procedural protections we implement to address these or other conflicts of interest will result in optimal outcomes for us and our shareholders.

 The partnership agreement of our operating partnership contains provisions that may delay, defer or prevent a change in control. 
 The partnership agreement of our operating partnership provides that subordinated performance unit holders holding more than 50 of the voting power of the subordinated performance units must approve certain change of control transactions involving us unless, as a result of such transactions, the holders of subordinated performance units are offered a choice (1) to allow their subordinated performance units to remain outstanding without the terms thereof being materially and adversely changed or the subordinated performance units are converted into or exchanged for equity securities of the surviving entity having terms and conditions that are substantially similar to those of the subordinated performance units (it being understood that we may not be the surviving entity and that the parent of the surviving entity or the surviving entity may not be publicly traded) or (2) to receive for each subordinated performance unit an amount of cash, securities or other property payable to a holder of OP units had such holder exercised its right to exchange its subordinated performance units for OP units without taking into consideration a specified conversion penalty associated with such an exchange. In addition, in the case of any such change of control transactions in which we have not received the consent of OP unit holders holding more than 50 of the OP units (other than those held by us or our subsidiaries) and of subordinated performance unit holders holding more than 50 of the voting power of the subordinated performance units (other than those held by us or our subsidiaries), such transaction is required to be approved by a company-wide vote of limited partners holding more than 50 of our outstanding OP units in which OP units (including for this purpose OP units held by us and our subsidiaries) are voted and subordinated performance units (not held by us and our subsidiaries) are voted on an applicable as converted basis and in which we will be deemed to vote the OP units held by us and our subsidiaries in proportion to the manner in which all of our outstanding common shares were voted at a shareholders meeting relating to such transaction. These approval rights could delay, deter, or prevent a transaction or a change in control that might involve a premium price for our common shares or otherwise be in the best interests of our shareholders. 
 Certain provisions of the Maryland General Corporation Law (the "MGCL") and of our bylaws and our declaration of trust could inhibit a change in our control and have an adverse impact on the price of our shares. 
 The MGCL, our bylaws and our declaration of trust contain provisions that may discourage, delay or make more difficult a change in our control. We are subject to the Maryland Business Combination Act. Our board has adopted a resolution exempting from the Maryland Business Combination Act any business combinations between us and (1) any other person, provided that the business combination is first approved by our board (including a majority of disinterested trustees), (2) Arlen D. Nordhagen and any of his affiliates and associates and (3) any person acting in concert with the foregoing. As a result, such persons may be able to enter into business combinations with us that may not be in the best interests of our shareholders without compliance by us with the moratorium supermajority vote requirements and other provisions of the statute. If this resolution is repealed or our board does not approve a business combination, the Maryland Business Combination Act may discourage third parties from trying to acquire control of us and increase the difficulty of consummating such an offer. 
 The Maryland Control Share Acquisition Act provides that holders of "control shares" of a Maryland real estate investment trust acquired in a "control share acquisition" have no voting rights with respect to such shares except to the extent approved by our shareholders by the affirmative vote of at least two-thirds of all the votes entitled to be cast on the matter, excluding votes entitled to be cast by the acquirer of control shares, our officers and our trustees who are also our employees. Our bylaws exempt from the Maryland Control Share Acquisition Act acquisitions of our shares by any person. If we amend our bylaws to repeal the exemption from the Maryland Control Share Acquisition Act, the Maryland Control Share Acquisition Act also may make it more difficult for a third party to obtain control of us and increase the difficulty of consummating such an offer. 
 We have also adopted other measures that may make it difficult for a third party to obtain control of us, including provisions of our declaration of trust and bylaws limiting the liability of our present and former trustees and officers to us and our shareholders for money damages to the maximum extent permitted under Maryland law, requiring us to indemnify our present and former trustees and officers for actions taken in their official capacities, permitting (subject to the rights of holders of any class or series of preferred shares) removal of a trustee, with or without cause, only by the affirmative vote of at least two-thirds of the votes entitled to be cast generally in the election of trustees, and authorizing our board (without shareholder approval) to classify or reclassify our shares in one or more classes or series, to cause the issuance of additional shares and to amend our declaration of trust to increase or decrease the number of shares that we have authority to issue. These provisions, as well as other

 provisions of our declaration of trust and bylaws, may delay, defer or prevent a transaction or a change in control that might otherwise be in the best interests of our shareholders. 
 Restrictions on ownership and transfer of our shares may restrict change of control or business combination opportunities in which our shareholders might receive a premium for their shares. 
 In order for us to qualify as a REIT for each taxable year, no more than 50 in value of our outstanding shares may be owned, directly or constructively, by five or fewer individuals during the last half of any calendar year, and at least 100 persons must beneficially own our shares during at least 335 days of a taxable year of 12 months, or during a proportionate portion of a shorter taxable year. "Individuals" for this purpose include natural persons, private foundations, some employee benefit plans and trusts, and some charitable trusts. To assist us in preserving our REIT qualification, among other purposes, our declaration of trust generally prohibits, among other limitations, any person from beneficially or constructively owning more than 9.8 in value or in number of shares, whichever is more restrictive, of our aggregate outstanding shares of all classes and series, the outstanding shares of any class or series of our preferred shares or our outstanding common shares. These ownership limits and the other restrictions on ownership and transfer of our shares contained in our declaration of trust could have the effect of discouraging a takeover or other transaction in which holders of our common shares might receive a premium for their shares over the then prevailing market price or which holders might believe to be otherwise in their best interests. Our board of trustees has established exemptions from these ownership limits which permits certain of our institutional investors to hold up to 20 of our common shares and up to 25 of our preferred shares. 
 Risks Related to Our Debt Financings 
 There are risks associated with our indebtedness. 
 Our level of debt and the limitations imposed on us by our debt agreements could have significant adverse consequences, including the following: 
 our cash flow may be insufficient to meet our required principal and interest payments; 
 to satisfy our debt obligations, we may be forced to dispose of one or more of our properties, possibly on disadvantageous terms; 
 our debt level could place us at a competitive disadvantage compared to our competitors with less debt; and 
 we may violate our restrictive covenants or otherwise default on our obligations, which may entitle our creditors to accelerate our debt obligations, foreclose on our properties securing our debt, enforce our guarantees and/or trigger default on our other indebtedness. 
 Disruptions in the financial markets could affect our ability to obtain debt financing on reasonable terms or at all and have other adverse effects on us. 
 Uncertainty in the credit markets may negatively impact our ability to access additional debt financing or to refinance existing debt maturities on favorable terms (or at all), which may negatively affect our ability to make acquisitions or make distributions required to maintain our qualification as a REIT. A downturn in the credit markets may cause us to seek alternative sources of potentially less attractive financing, and may require us to adjust our business plans accordingly. In addition, these factors may make it more difficult for us to sell properties or may adversely affect the price we receive for properties that we do sell, as prospective buyers may experience increased costs of debt financing or difficulties in obtaining debt financing. 
 We depend on external sources of capital that are outside of our control, which could adversely affect our ability to acquire or develop properties, satisfy our debt obligations and/or make distributions to shareholders. 
 We depend on external sources of capital to acquire properties, to satisfy our debt obligations and to make distributions to our shareholders required to maintain our qualification as a REIT, and these sources of capital may not be available on favorable terms, or at all. Our access to external sources of capital depends on a number of factors, including the market's perception of our growth potential and our current and potential future earnings and our ability to continue to qualify as a REIT for U.S. federal income tax purposes. If we are unable to obtain external sources of capital, we may not be able to acquire properties when strategic opportunities exist, satisfy our debt obligations or make cash distributions to our shareholders that would permit us to qualify as a REIT or avoid paying tax on all of our net taxable income.

 Increases in interest rates may increase our interest expense and adversely affect our cash flow and our ability to service our indebtedness, make cash distributions to our shareholders, and acquire or sell properties and our decision to hedge against interest rate risk might not be effective. 
 As of December 31, 2022, we had approximately 3.6 billion of debt outstanding, of which approximately 621.0 million, or 17.5 , is subject to variable interest rates (excluding variable-rate debt subject to interest rate swaps). During 2022, the U.S. Federal Reserve Board (the "Federal Reserve Board) has raised interest rates from historically low levels and has signaled an intention to continue to do so until current inflation levels re-align with the Federal Reserve Board's long-term inflation target. To the extent the Federal Reserve Board continues to raise interest rates, there is a risk that rates across the financial system may rise. As interest rates increase, our debt service obligations on variable-rate debt increase even though the amount borrowed remains the same, while our net income, cash flows, and our ability to pay cash distributions to our shareholders correspondingly decrease. In addition, increased interest rates make the financing of any acquisition and investment activity more costly and could decrease the amount third parties are willing to pay for any properties that we wish to sell. 
 Although we have historically sought, and may in the future seek, to manage our exposure to interest rate volatility by using interest rate hedging arrangements, these arrangements may not be effective. Developing an effective interest rate risk strategy is complex and no strategy can completely insulate us from risks associated with interest rate fluctuations. Failure to hedge effectively against interest rate changes may adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations and ability to make cash distributions to our shareholders. 
 The terms and covenants relating to our indebtedness could adversely impact our economic performance. 
 Our credit facility, term loan facilities and senior unsecured notes contain (and any new or amended facility we may enter into from time to time will likely contain) customary affirmative and negative covenants, including financial covenants that, among other things, cap our total leverage and our unsecured debt. In the event that we fail to satisfy our covenants, we would be in default under our debt agreements and may be required to repay such debt with capital from other sources. Under such circumstances, other sources of debt or equity capital may not be available to us, or may be available only on unattractive terms. Moreover, the presence of such covenants could cause us to operate our business with a view toward compliance with such covenants, which might not produce optimal returns for shareholders. 
 The discontinuation of the London interbank offered rate ("LIBOR") and transition to alternative reference rates may adversely impact our borrowings and interest rate hedging. 
 As of December 31, 2022, certain of our debt agreements and our interest rate swap agreements are linked to U.S. dollar LIBOR, including certain of our term loan facilities. As announced on March 5, 2021 by the ICE Benchmark Administration Limited ("IBA"), the IBA will cease the publication of LIBOR for the most commonly used U.S. dollar LIBOR tenors after June 30, 2023. The Alternative Reference Rates Committee ("AARC"), a steering committee comprised of large U.S. financial institutions convened by the U.S. Federal Reserve Board and the New York Federal Reserve, has recommended the Secured Overnight Financing Rate ("SOFR") as a more robust reference rate alternative to U.S. dollar LIBOR. The ARRC has also recommended the use of the CME Group s computation of forward-looking SOFR term rates ("Term SOFR"), subject to certain recommended limitations on the scope of its use. In March 2022, the Adjustable Interest Rate (LIBOR) Act was enacted at the federal level in the United States, pursuant to which the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System has designated benchmark replacement rates based on SOFR for U.S. law governed legacy contracts that have no or insufficient fallback provisions. Market practices related to calculation conventions for replacement benchmark rates continue to develop and may vary, and inconsistent calculation conventions may develop among financial products. It is not possible to predict all consequences of the IBA's plans to cease publishing U.S. dollar LIBOR, any related regulatory actions and the expected discontinuance of the use of U.S. dollar LIBOR as a reference rate for financial contracts.

 In advance of the transition date described above, we have begun amending our debt agreements and interest rate swap agreements that utilize U.S. dollar LIBOR as a factor in determining the interest rate to transition to SOFR and Term SOFR, including the recent amendment of our credit facility. However, these efforts may not be successful in mitigating the legal, tax and financial risk from changing the reference rate in our legacy agreements. Furthermore, the transition away from U.S. dollar LIBOR may adversely impact our ability to manage and hedge exposures to fluctuations in interest rates using derivative instruments. There is no guarantee that a transition from U.S. dollar LIBOR to an alternative will not result in financial market disruptions, significant increases in benchmark rates, or borrowing costs to borrowers, any of which could have an adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition, and the market price of our common shares. 
 Risks Related to Our Qualification as a REIT 
 Our failure to remain qualified as a REIT would subject us to U.S. federal income tax and applicable state and local taxes, which would reduce the amount of operating cash flow to our shareholders. 
 We have elected and we believe that we have qualified to be taxed as a REIT commencing with our taxable year ended December 31, 2015. We have not requested, and do not intend to request a ruling from the Internal Revenue Service ("IRS"), that we qualify as a REIT. Qualification as a REIT involves the application of highly technical and complex Code provisions and Treasury Regulations promulgated thereunder for which there are limited judicial and administrative interpretations. To qualify as a REIT, we must meet, on an ongoing basis through actual operating results, various tests regarding the nature and diversification of our assets and our income, the ownership of our outstanding shares and the amount of our distributions. Our ability to satisfy these asset tests depends upon our analysis of the characterization and fair market values of our assets, some of which are not susceptible to a precise determination, and for which we will not obtain independent appraisals. Moreover, new legislation, court decisions or administrative guidance may, in each case possibly with retroactive effect, make it more difficult or impossible for us to qualify as a REIT. Thus, while we believe that we have been organized and operated and we intend to operate so that we will continue to qualify as a REIT, given the highly complex nature of the rules governing REITs, the ongoing importance of factual determinations and the possibility of future changes in our circumstances, no assurance can be given that we have qualified or will so qualify for any particular year. These considerations also might restrict the types of assets that we can acquire or services that we can provide in the future. 
 We own and may in the future acquire direct or indirect interests in entities that have elected or will elect to be treated as REITs under the Code (each a "Subsidiary REIT"). If a Subsidiary REIT were to fail to qualify as a REIT, then (i) that Subsidiary REIT would become subject to U.S. federal income tax, (ii) shares in such Subsidiary REIT would cease to be qualifying assets for purposes of the asset tests applicable to REITs, and (iii) it is possible that we would fail certain of the tests applicable to REITs, in which event we would fail to qualify as a REIT unless we qualify for certain statutory relief provisions. 
 In addition, in order to qualify as a REIT, prior to the end of the taxable year, we must also distribute any earnings and profits of any property we acquire in certain tax-deferred transactions to the extent such earnings accrued at a time when such corporation did not qualify as a REIT. We have entered into certain transactions involving the tax-deferred acquisition of target corporations. We believe that we have distributed any earnings and profits of such target corporations attributable to any period that such corporations did not qualify as a REIT. However, no assurances can be provided in this regard, and if there is a determination that we have inherited and retained any such earnings and profits, our qualification as a REIT could be adversely impacted. 
 If we fail to qualify as a REIT in any taxable year, and we do not qualify for certain statutory relief provisions, we would be required to pay U.S. federal income tax on our taxable income at regular corporate rates, and distributions to our shareholders would not be deductible by us in determining our taxable income. In such a case, we might need to borrow money, sell assets, or reduce or even cease making distributions in order to pay our taxes. Our payment of income tax would reduce significantly the amount of operating cash flow to our shareholders. Furthermore, if we fail to maintain our qualification as a REIT, we no longer would be required to make distributions to our shareholders. In addition, unless we were eligible for certain statutory relief provisions, we could not re-elect to be taxed as a REIT until the fifth calendar year following the year in which we failed to qualify.

 Even if we qualify as a REIT, we may face other tax liabilities that reduce our cash flow. 
 Even if we qualify for taxation as a REIT, we may be subject to certain U.S. federal, state and local taxes on our income and assets, including taxes on any undistributed income, state or local income and property and transfer taxes, including real property transfer taxes. In addition, we could, in certain circumstances, be required to pay an excise or penalty tax (which could be significant in amount) in order to utilize one or more relief provisions under the Code to maintain our qualification as a REIT. Any of these taxes would decrease operating cash flow to our shareholders. 
 In order to qualify as a REIT, we must distribute to our shareholders each calendar year at least 90 of our net taxable income (excluding net capital gain). To the extent that we satisfy the 90 distribution requirement, but distribute less than 100 of our net taxable income (including net capital gain), we would be subject to U.S. federal corporate income tax on our undistributed net taxable income. In addition, we will incur a 4 non-deductible excise tax on the amount, if any, by which our distributions in any calendar year are less than a minimum amount specified under U.S. federal income tax laws. Although we intend to distribute our net taxable income to our shareholders in a manner that would avoid this 4 tax, there can be no assurance that we will be able to do so, due to timing differences between our actual receipt of cash and the inclusion of items in our income for U.S. federal income tax purposes, the effect of non-deductible capital expenditures, or the creation of reserves or required debt or amortization payments. 
 In addition, we will be subject to a 100 tax on any income from sales or other dispositions of property (other than property treated as foreclosure property under the Code) that is held as inventory or primarily for sale to customers in the ordinary course of a trade or business by a REIT, either directly or indirectly through certain pass-through subsidiaries (a "prohibited transaction"). In order to meet the REIT qualification requirements, or to avoid the imposition of the penalty tax on prohibited transactions, we may hold some of our assets or provide certain services to our tenants through one or more TRSs, which generally will be subject to U.S. federal, state and local corporate taxes. In addition, if a REIT lends money to a TRS, the TRS may be unable to deduct all or a portion of the interest paid to the REIT, which could increase the tax liability of the TRS. In addition, the Code imposes a 100 tax on certain transactions between a TRS and its parent REIT that are not conducted on an arm's length basis. We intend to structure transactions with any TRS on terms that we believe are arm's length to avoid incurring the 100 excise tax described above. There can be no assurances, however, that we will be able to avoid application of the 100 tax. Furthermore, if we acquire appreciated assets from a corporation that is or has been a subchapter C corporation in a transaction in which the adjusted tax basis of such assets in our hands is less than the fair market value of the assets, determined at the time we acquired such assets, and if we subsequently dispose of any such assets during the 5-year period following the acquisition of the assets from the C corporation, we will be subject to tax at the highest corporate tax rates on any gain from the disposition of such assets to the extent of the excess of the fair market value of the assets on the date that we acquired such assets over the basis of such assets on such date, which we refer to as built-in gains. In addition, we have entered into certain transactions in which we acquired target entities in tax-deferred transactions. To the extent such entities had outstanding U.S. federal income tax or other tax liabilities, we would succeed to such liabilities. Payment of these taxes generally could materially and adversely affect our income, cash flow, results of operations, financial condition, liquidity and prospects, and could adversely affect the value of our common shares and our ability to make distributions to our shareholders.

 Complying with the REIT requirements may cause us to forgo and/or liquidate otherwise attractive investments, and in some situations, to maintain our REIT qualification, we may be forced to borrow funds during unfavorable market conditions. 
 To qualify as a REIT, we must ensure that at least 75 of our gross income for each taxable year, excluding certain amounts, is derived from certain real property-related sources, and at least 95 of our gross income for each taxable year, excluding certain amounts, is derived from certain real property-related sources and passive income such as dividends and interest. In addition, we must ensure that, at the end of each calendar quarter, at least 75 of the value of our total assets consists of cash, cash items, U.S. government securities and qualified real estate assets. The remainder of our investment in securities generally cannot include more than 10 of the outstanding voting securities of any one issuer (other than U.S. government securities, securities of corporations that are treated as TRSs and qualified real estate assets) or more than 10 of the total value of the outstanding securities of any one issuer (other than government securities, securities of corporations that are treated as TRSs and qualified real estate assets). In addition, in general, no more than 5 of the value of our assets can consist of the securities of any one issuer (other than U.S. government securities, securities of corporations that are treated as TRSs and qualified real estate assets), no more than 20 of the value of our total assets can be represented by securities of one or more TRSs and no more than 25 of the value of our assets can consist of debt instruments issued by publicly offered REITs that are not otherwise secured by real property. If we fail to comply with these asset requirements at the end of any calendar quarter, we must correct the failure within 30 days after the end of the calendar quarter or qualify for certain statutory relief provisions to avoid losing our REIT qualification and suffering adverse tax consequences. 
 To meet these tests, we may be required to take or forgo taking actions that we would otherwise consider advantageous. For instance, in order to satisfy the gross income or asset tests applicable to REITs under the Code, we may be required to forgo investments that we otherwise would make, and we may be required to liquidate from our portfolio otherwise attractive investments. In addition, we may be required to make distributions to shareholders at disadvantageous times or when we do not have funds readily available for distribution. As a result, we may need to borrow funds to meet the REIT distribution requirements even if the then prevailing market conditions are not favorable for these borrowings. Our access to third-party sources of capital depends on a number of factors, including the market's perception of our growth potential, our current debt levels, the per share trading price of our common shares, and our current and potential future earnings. We cannot assure you that we will have access to such capital on favorable terms at the desired times, or at all, which may cause us to curtail our investment activities and/or to dispose of assets at inopportune times. These actions could reduce our income and amounts available for distribution to our shareholders. Thus, compliance with the REIT requirements may hinder our investment performance. 
 If our operating partnership is treated as a corporation for U.S. federal income tax purposes, we will cease to qualify as a REIT. 
 We believe our operating partnership qualifies as a partnership for U.S. federal income tax purposes, and accordingly generally will not be subject to U.S. federal income tax on its income. Instead, each of its partners, including us, will be required to pay tax on its allocable share of our operating partnership's income. No assurance can be provided, however, that the IRS will not challenge our operating partnership's status as a partnership for U.S. federal income tax purposes, or that a court would not sustain such a challenge. If the IRS were successful in treating our operating partnership as a corporation for U.S. federal income tax purposes, we would fail to meet the gross income tests and certain of the asset tests applicable to REITs, we would cease to qualify as a REIT, and both we and our operating partnership would become subject to U.S. federal, state and local income tax. The payment by our operating partnership of income tax would reduce significantly the amount of cash available to our operating partnership to satisfy obligations to make principal and interest payments on its debt and to make distribution to its partners, including us.

 Complying with REIT requirements may limit our ability to hedge effectively and may cause us to incur tax liabilities. 
 The REIT provisions of the Code may limit our ability to hedge our assets and operations. Under these provisions, any income that we generate from transactions intended to hedge our interest rate risk will be excluded from gross income for purposes of the REIT 75 and 95 gross income tests if (i) the instrument (a) hedges interest rate risk on liabilities used to carry or acquire real estate assets or (b) hedges an instrument described in clause (a) for a period following the extinguishment of the liability or the disposition of the asset that was previously hedged by the hedged instrument, and (ii) the relevant instrument is properly identified under applicable Treasury regulations. Income from hedging transactions that does not meet these requirements will generally constitute non-qualifying income for purposes of both the REIT 75 and 95 gross income tests. As a result of these rules, we may have to limit our use of hedging techniques that might otherwise be advantageous or implement those hedges through a TRS. This could increase the cost of our hedging activities because our TRS would be subject to tax on gains or expose us to greater risks associated with changes in interest rates than we would otherwise want to bear, and we generally would not benefit from losses in our TRS, although, subject to limitation, such losses may be carried forward to offset future taxable income of the TRS. 
 The ability of our board of trustees to revoke our REIT election without shareholder approval may cause adverse consequences to our shareholders. 
 Our declaration of trust provides that the board of trustees may revoke or otherwise terminate our REIT election, without the approval of our shareholders, if the board determines that it is no longer in our best interest to attempt to, or continue to, qualify as a REIT. If we cease to qualify as a REIT, we would become subject to U.S. federal income tax on our net taxable income and we generally would no longer be required to distribute any of our net taxable income to our shareholders, which may have adverse consequences on our total return to our shareholders. 
 Legislative or regulatory tax changes related to REITs could materially and adversely affect our business. 
 At any time, the U.S. federal income tax laws or regulations governing REITs or the administrative interpretations of those laws or regulations may be changed, possibly with retroactive effect. We cannot predict if or when any new U.S. federal income tax law, regulation or administrative interpretation, or any amendment to any existing U.S. federal income tax law, regulation or administrative interpretation, will be adopted, promulgated or become effective or whether any such law, regulation or interpretation may take effect retroactively. We and our shareholders could be adversely affected by any such change in, or any new, U.S. federal income tax law, regulation or administrative interpretation. Stockholders are urged to consult with their tax advisors regarding the effects of the other legislative, regulatory or administrative developments on an investment in the Company's common stock. 
 Risks Related to Our Common Shares and Preferred Shares 
 Common shares and preferred shares eligible for future sale may have adverse effects on our share price. 
 Subject to applicable law and the rules of any stock exchange on which our shares may be listed or traded, our board, without common shareholder approval, may authorize us to issue additional authorized and unissued common shares and preferred shares on the terms and for the consideration it deems appropriate and may amend our declaration of trust to increase the total number of shares, or the number of shares of any class or series, that we are authorized to issue. In addition, our operating partnership may issue OP units, which are redeemable for cash or, at our option exchangeable on a one-for-one basis into common shares after an agreed period of time and certain other conditions, preferred units of limited partnership interest, which are redeemable for cash or, at our option exchangeable on a one-for-one basis into our 6.000 Series A cumulative redeemable preferred shares of beneficial interest ("Series A Preferred Shares") and subordinated performance units, which are only convertible into OP units beginning two years following the initial issuance of the applicable series and then (i) at the holder's election only upon the achievement of certain performance thresholds relating to the properties to which such subordinated performance units relate or (ii) at our election upon a retirement event of a PRO that holds such subordinated performance units or upon certain qualifying terminations.

 Notwithstanding the two-year lock out period on conversions of subordinated performance units into OP units, if such subordinated performance units were convertible into OP units as of December 31, 2022, each subordinated performance unit would on average hypothetically convert into 1.72 OP units, or into an aggregate of approximately 21.5 million OP units. These amounts are based on historical financial information for the trailing twelve months ended December 31, 2022. The hypothetical conversion is calculated by dividing the average cash available for distribution, or CAD, per subordinated performance unit by 110 of the CAD per OP unit over the same period. We anticipate that as our CAD grows over time, the conversion ratio will also grow, including to levels that may exceed this amount. The actual number of OP units into which such subordinated performance units will become convertible may vary significantly and will depend upon the applicable conversion penalty and the actual CAD to the OP units and the actual CAD to the converted subordinated performance units in the one-year period ending prior to conversion. We have also granted registration rights to those persons who will be eligible to receive common shares issuable upon exchange of OP units and preferred shares issuable upon exchange of preferred units issued in our contribution transactions. 
 We cannot predict the effect, if any, of future sales of our common or preferred shares or the availability of shares for future sales, on the market price of our common or preferred shares. The market price of our common shares may decline significantly when the restrictions on resale by certain of our shareholders lapse. Sales of substantial amounts of common or preferred shares or the perception that such sales could occur may adversely affect the prevailing market price for our common shares. 
 We cannot assure our ability to pay dividends in the future. 
 Historically, we have paid quarterly common share dividends to our shareholders and quarterly distributions to our operating partnership unitholders, and we intend to continue to pay such dividends and distributions in amounts such that all or substantially all of our net taxable income in each year is distributed, which, along with other factors, should enable us to continue to qualify for the tax benefits accorded to a REIT under the Code. We have not established a minimum dividends payment level, and all future distributions will be made at the discretion of our board. Our ability to pay dividends will depend upon, among other factors: 
 the operational and financial performance of our properties; 
 capital expenditures with respect to existing and newly acquired properties; 
 general and administrative expenses associated with our operation as a publicly-held REIT; 
 maintenance of our REIT qualification; 
 the amount of, and the interest rates on, our debt and the ability to refinance our debt; 
 the absence of significant expenditures relating to environmental and other regulatory matters; and 
 other risk factors described in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. 
 Certain of these matters are beyond our control and any significant difference between our expectations and actual results could have a material adverse effect on our cash flow and our ability to make distributions to shareholders. 
 Future offerings of debt or equity securities, which may rank senior to our common shares, may adversely affect the market price of our common shares. 
 If we decide to issue debt securities in the future, which would rank senior to our common shares, it is likely that they will be governed by an indenture or other instrument containing covenants restricting our operating flexibility. Additionally, any equity securities or convertible or exchangeable securities that we issue in the future may have rights, preferences and privileges more favorable than those of our common shares and may result in dilution to owners of such shares. We and, indirectly, our shareholders will bear the cost of issuing and servicing such securities. Because our decision to issue debt or equity securities in any future offering will depend on market conditions and other factors beyond our control, we cannot predict or estimate the amount, timing or nature of our future offerings. Thus, holders of our common shares will bear the risk of our future offerings reducing the market price of our shares and diluting the value of their common share holdings in us.

 Our portfolio consists of self storage properties that are designed to offer customers convenient, affordable, and secure storage units. Generally, our properties are in highly visible locations clustered in states or markets with strong population and job growth and are specifically designed to accommodate residential and commercial tenants with features such as security systems, electronic gate entry, easy access, climate control, and pest control. Our units typically range from 25 square feet to 300 square feet, and some of our properties also offer outside storage for vehicles, boats, and equipment. We provide 24-hour access to many storage units through computer controlled access systems, as well as alarm and sprinkler systems on many of our individual storage units. Almost all of the storage units in our portfolio are leased on a month-to-month basis providing us the flexibility to increase rental rates over time as market conditions permit. Additional information on our consolidated self storage properties is contained in "Schedule III - Real Estate and Accumulated Depreciation" in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.

 Item 5. Market for the Registrant's Common Equity, Related Stockholder Matters and Issuer Purchases of Equity Securities 
 Market Information 
 Our common shares have been listed and traded on the NYSE under the symbol "NSA" since April 22, 2015. Prior to that time there was no public market for our common shares. 
 Holders 
 As of February 24, 2023, the Company had 82 record holders of its common shares. The 82 holders of record do not include the beneficial owners of common shares whose shares are held by a broker or bank. Such information was obtained from our transfer agent and registrar. 
 Dividends 
 Since our initial quarter as a publicly-traded REIT, we have made regular quarterly distributions to our shareholders. Holders of common shares are entitled to receive distributions when declared by our board of trustees out of any assets legally available for that purpose. In order to maintain our status as a REIT for U.S. federal income tax purposes, we are required to distribute at least 90 of our "REIT taxable income," which is generally equivalent to our net taxable ordinary income, determined without regard to the deduction for dividends paid and excluding net capital gains to our shareholders annually. 
 Common share dividends are characterized for U.S. federal income tax purposes as ordinary income, capital gains, return of capital or a combination thereof. Each year we communicate to shareholders the tax characterization of the common share dividends paid during the preceding year. Our tax return for the year ended December 31, 2022 has not yet been filed and consequently, the taxability information presented for our dividends paid in 2022 is based upon management's estimate. The following table summarizes the taxability of our dividends per common share for the year ended December 31, 2022: 
 Year Ended December 31, 2022 Ordinary Income 1.767988 82.2 Return of Capital 0.382012 17.8 Total 2.150000 100.0 
 Equity Compensation Plan Information 
 Information about our equity compensation plans is incorporated by reference to Item 12 of Part III of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.

Of these, (i) Mr. Nordhagen, our executive chairman, received 448,047 OP units upon conversion of 163,128 Series MI subordinated performance units and (ii) Mr. Cramer, our president and chief operating officer, received 204,943 OP units upon the conversion of 74,617 Series MI subordinated performance units. Also, effective as of January 1, 2023, a company owned and controlled by Mark Van Mourick, one of our trustees, received 95,036 OP units upon a voluntary conversion of 32,796 Series OV subordinated performance units. 
 Following a specified lock up period after the date of issuance set forth above, the OP units issued by the operating partnership may be redeemed from time to time by holders for a cash amount per OP unit equal to the market value of an equivalent number of common shares. The Company has the right, but not the obligation, to assume and satisfy the redemption obligation of the operating partnership described above by issuing one common share in exchange for each OP unit tendered for redemption. 
 The Company has elected to report early the private placement of its common shares that may occur if the Company elects to assume the redemption obligation of the operating partnership as described above in the event that OP units are in the future tendered for redemption. 
 Following a two-year lock-up period, holders of subordinated performance units may elect, only upon the achievement of certain performance thresholds relating to the properties to which such subordinated performance units relate, to convert all or a portion of such subordinated performance units into OP units one time each year by submitting a completed conversion notice prior to December 1 of such year. All duly submitted conversion notices will become effective on the immediately following January 1. For additional information about the conversion or exchange of subordinated performance units into OP units, see Note 9 in Item 8 of this report. 
 As of February 24, 2023, other than those OP units held by the Company, 41,482,271 OP units were outstanding (including 665,056 outstanding Long-Term Incentive Plan Units ("LTIP units") and 2,120,491 outstanding OP units in certain consolidated subsidiaries of the operating partnership ("DownREIT OP units"), which are convertible into, or exchangeable for, OP units on a one-for-one basis, subject to certain conditions).

 Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations 
 You should read the following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations in conjunction with the financial statements and notes thereto included in Item 8. "Financial Statements and Supplementary Data" as well as Item 1. "Business," Item 1A. "Risk Factors," and Item 2. "Properties," respectively, in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. 
 
 Overview 
 National Storage Affiliates Trust is a fully integrated, self-administered and self-managed real estate investment trust organized in the state of Maryland on May 16, 2013. We have elected and we believe that we have qualified to be taxed as a REIT commencing with our taxable year ended December 31, 2015. We serve as the sole general partner of our operating partnership, a Delaware limited partnership formed on February 13, 2013 to conduct our business, which is focused on the ownership, operation, and acquisition of self storage properties located predominantly within the top 100 MSAs throughout the United States. 
 Our executive chairman of the board of trustees and former chief executive officer, Arlen D. Nordhagen, co-founded SecurCare Self Storage, Inc. in 1988 to invest in and manage self storage properties. While growing SecurCare to over 150 self storage properties, Mr. Nordhagen recognized a market opportunity for a differentiated public self storage REIT that would leverage the benefits of national scale by integrating multiple experienced regional self storage operators with local operational focus and expertise. We believe that his vision, which is the foundation of the Company, aligns the interests of our PROs, with those of our public shareholders by allowing our PROs to participate alongside our shareholders in our financial performance and the performance of our PROs' managed portfolios. This structure offers our PROs a unique opportunity to serve as regional property managers for their managed portfolios and directly participate in the potential upside of those properties while simultaneously diversifying their investment to include a broader portfolio of self storage properties. Over time, largely through our unconsolidated real estate ventures and internalization of three of our largest PROs, SecurCare, Northwest and, following January 1, 2023, Move It, we have developed a full service internally-staffed property management platform to complement our PRO structure. 
 Our Structure 
 Through our property management platform, we direct, manage and control the day-to-day operations and affairs of certain consolidated properties and our unconsolidated real estate ventures under our iStorage, Northwest, SecurCare and, following January 1, 2023, Move It brands. As of December 31, 2022, our property management platform managed and controlled 531 of our consolidated properties and 185 of our unconsolidated real estate venture properties. As of December 31, 2022, our PROs managed the day-to-day operations of 385 of our consolidated properties. 
 We earn certain customary fees for managing and operating the properties in the unconsolidated real estate ventures and we facilitate tenant insurance and/or tenant warranty protection programs for tenants at these properties in exchange for half of all proceeds from such programs. 
 For properties managed by our PROs, our structure promotes operator accountability as subordinated performance units issued to our PROs in exchange for the contribution of their properties are entitled to distributions only after those properties satisfy minimum performance thresholds. In the event of a material reduction in operating cash flow, distributions on our subordinated performance units will be reduced before or disproportionately to distributions on our common shares held by our common shareholders. In addition, we expect our PROs will generally co-invest subordinated equity in the form of subordinated performance units in each acquisition that they source, and the value of these subordinated performance units will fluctuate with the performance of their managed portfolios. Therefore, our PROs are incentivized to select acquisitions that are expected to exceed minimum performance thresholds, thereby increasing the value of their subordinated equity stake. We expect that our shareholders will benefit from the higher levels of property performance that our PROs are incentivized to deliver.

 Our PROs 
 We had nine PROs as of December 31, 2022: Optivest, Move It, Guardian, Southern, Blue Sky, Moove In, Hide Away, Storage Solutions and Personal Mini. We seek to further expand our platform by continuing to recruit additional established self storage operators, while integrating our operations through the implementation of centralized initiatives, including management information systems, revenue enhancement, and cost optimization programs. Our national platform allows us to capture cost savings by eliminating redundancies and utilizing economies of scale across the property management platforms of our PROs while also providing greater access to lower-cost capital. 
 Effective January 1, 2022, Northwest elected to retire as one of our PROs. As a result of the retirement, on January 1, 2022, management of our properties in the Northwest managed portfolio was transferred to us and the Northwest brand name and related intellectual property was internalized by us, and we discontinued payment of any supervisory and administrative fees or reimbursements to Northwest. 
 During the year ended December 31, 2022, one of our PROs, Move It Self Storage and its controlled affiliates, notified us of Move It's election to retire as a PRO effective January 1, 2023. As a result of the retirement, on January 1, 2023, management of our properties in the Move It managed portfolio was transferred to us and the Move It brand name and related intellectual property was internalized by us, and we discontinued payment of any supervisory and administrative fees or reimbursements to Move It. In addition, on January 1, 2023, we issued a notice of non-voluntary conversion to convert all of the subordinated performance units related to Move It's managed portfolio into OP units. As part of the internalization, a majority of Move It's employees were offered and provided employment by us and continue to manage Move It's portfolio of properties as members of NSA's existing property management platform. 
 Our Consolidated Properties 
 We seek to own properties that are well located in high quality sub-markets with highly accessible street access and attractive supply and demand characteristics, providing our properties with strong and stable cash flows that are less sensitive to the fluctuations of the general economy. Many of these markets have multiple barriers to entry against increased supply, including zoning restrictions against new construction and new construction costs that we believe are higher than our properties' fair market value. We maintain an active acquisition pipeline that we expect will continue to drive our future growth. 
 As of December 31, 2022, we owned a geographically diversified portfolio of 916 self storage properties, located in 39 states and Puerto Rico, comprising approximately 58.3 million rentable square feet, configured in approximately 453,000 storage units. Of these properties, 301 were acquired by us from our PROs, 614 were acquired by us from third-party sellers and one was acquired by us from the 2016 Joint Venture. 
 Our Unconsolidated Real Estate Ventures 
 We seek to opportunistically partner with institutional funds and other institutional investors to acquire attractive portfolios utilizing a promoted return structure. We believe there is significant opportunity for continued external growth by partnering with institutional investors seeking to deploy capital in the self storage industry. 
 2018 Joint Venture 
 As of December 31, 2022, our 2018 Joint Venture, in which we have a 25 interest, owned and operated a portfolio of 104 properties containing approximately 7.8 million rentable square feet, configured in approximately 64,000 storage units and located across 17 states. 
 2016 Joint Venture 
 As of December 31, 2022, our 2016 Joint Venture, in which we have a 25 ownership interest, owned and operated a portfolio of 81 properties containing approximately 5.6 million rentable square feet, configured in approximately 47,000 storage units and located across 13 states.

 Results of Operations 
 When reviewing our results of operations it is important to consider the timing of acquisition activity. We acquired 45 self storage properties during the year ended December 31, 2022 and 229 self storage properties during the year ended December 31, 2021. As a result of these and other factors, we do not believe that our historical results of operations discussed and analyzed below are comparable or necessarily indicative of our future results of operations or cash flows. 
 During the year ended December 31, 2022, we incurred outsized casualty-related expenses and losses due to certain events including floods, fires, and hurricanes Fiona and Ian, which we do not consider indicative of our core operating performance. These elevated amounts of casualty costs from these events totaled 6.4 million which is included in other operating expenses. The Company maintains property and casualty insurance on its wholly-owned and joint venture properties, which covers both damages and business interruption expenses subject to varying deductibles depending on the cause and extent of the claim. 
 The following discussion and analysis of the results of our operations and financial condition for the year ended December 31, 2022 compared to the year ended December 31, 2021 should be read in conjunction with the accompanying consolidated financial statements included in Item 8. The discussion and analysis of the results of our operations and financial condition for the year ended December 31, 2021 compared to the year ended December 31, 2020, can be found in Part II, "Item 7. Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations" of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2021, which was filed with the SEC on February 25, 2022. 
 Certain figures, such as interest rates and other percentages, included in this section have been rounded for ease of presentation. Percentage figures included in this section have not in all cases been calculated on the basis of such rounded figures but on the basis of such amounts prior to rounding. For this reason, percentage amounts in this section may vary slightly from those obtained by performing the same calculations using the figures in our consolidated financial statements or in the associated text. Certain other amounts that appear in this section may similarly not sum due to rounding.

 Total Revenue 
 Our total revenue, including management fees and other revenue, increased by 215.9 million, or 36.9 , for the year ended December 31, 2022, as compared to the year ended December 31, 2021. This increase was primarily attributable to incremental revenue from 45 self storage properties acquired during the year ended December 31, 2022 and from 229 self storage properties acquired during 2021 (partially offset by the disposition of two self storage properties), increases in management fees and other revenue from our unconsolidated real estate ventures. Total revenue increased despite a decrease in total portfolio average occupancy from 94.2 for the year ended December 31, 2021 to 91.9 for the year ended December 31, 2022 due to an increase in rental rates. Average occupancy is calculated based on the average of the month-end occupancy immediately preceding the period presented and the month-end occupancies included in the respective period presented. 
 Rental Revenue 
 Rental revenue increased by 207.3 million, or 38.3 , for the year ended December 31, 2022, as compared to the year ended December 31, 2021. The increase in rental revenue was primarily attributable to incremental rental revenue of 17.7 million from 45 self storage properties acquired during 2022, and 127.6 million from 229 self storage properties acquired during 2021. Annualized total portfolio rental revenues (including fees and net of any discounts and uncollectible customer amounts) divided by average occupied square feet ("average annualized rental revenue per occupied square foot") increased from 13.01, for the year ended December 31, 2021 to 14.83, or 14.0 , for the year ended December 31, 2022, driven primarily by increased contractual lease rates for in-place tenants. 
 Other Property-Related Revenue 
 Other property-related revenue represents ancillary income from our self storage properties, such as tenant insurance-related access fees and sales of storage supplies. Other property-related revenue increased by 5.4 million, or 27.2 , for the year ended December 31, 2022, as compared to the year ended December 31, 2021. This increase primarily resulted from incremental other property-related revenue of 0.4 million from 45 self storage properties acquired during 2022, and 5.2 million from 229 self storage properties acquired during 2021. 
 Management Fees and Other Revenue 
 Management fees and other revenue, which are primarily related to managing and operating the unconsolidated real estate ventures, were 27.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2022, compared to 24.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2021, an increase of 3.2 million or 13.3 . This increase was primarily attributable to increased property management fees due to growth in unconsolidated real estate venture revenue. 
 Property Operating Expenses 
 Property operating expenses were 211.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2022 compared to 155.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2021, an increase of 55.8 million, or 35.9 . The increase in property operating expenses was primarily attributable to incremental property operating expenses of 5.0 million from 45 self storage properties acquired during 2022, and 43.9 million from 229 self storage properties acquired during 2021.

This increase was attributable to increases in supervisory and administrative fees charged by our PROs of 2.2 million, due to increases in property revenue and acquisitions of additional properties managed by our PROs, as well as increases in personnel costs and equity based compensation expense. 
 Depreciation and Amortization 
 Depreciation and amortization increased 74.8 million, or 47.3 , for the year ended December 31, 2022, compared to the year ended December 31, 2021. This increase was primarily attributable to incremental depreciation expense related to the 45 self storage properties acquired during 2022 and 229 self storage properties acquired during 2021. The increase in depreciation and amortization includes an increase in amortization of customer in-place leases from 20.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2021 to 34.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2022. 
 Other 
 Other expenses increased 5.7 million, or 199.2 , for the year ended December 31, 2022, compared to the year ended December 31, 2021. This increase was primarily attributable to increases in casualty-related expenses and losses. 
 Interest Expense 
 Interest expense increased 38.5 million, or 53.5 , for the year ended December 31, 2022, compared to the year ended December 31, 2021. The increase in interest expense was attributable to rising interest rates on our variable-rate debt and higher outstanding borrowings including (i) the May 2021 issuance of 55.0 million of 3.10 senior unsecured notes due May 4, 2033, (ii) the July 2021 issuance of 35.0 million of 2.16 senior unsecured notes due May 4, 2026 and 90.0 million of 3.00 senior unsecured notes due May 4, 2031, (iii) the September 2021 issuance of 125.0 million of term loan debt under our credit facility with an effective interest rate of 2.96 as of December 31, 2022, (iv) the December 14, 2021 issuance of 75.0 million of 2.72 senior unsecured notes due November 30, 2030, 175.0 million of 2.81 senior unsecured notes due November 30, 2031 and 75.0 million of 3.06 senior unsecured notes due November 30, 2036, (v) the January 2022 issuance of 125.0 million of 2.96 senior unsecured notes due November 30, 2033, (vi) the June 2022 issuance of 285.0 million of term loan debt due June 2029 with an effective interest rate of 5.37 as of December 31, 2022, (vii) the September 2022 issuance of 200.0 million of 5.06 senior unsecured notes due November 2032, and (viii) an increase in borrowings under our revolving line of credit with an effective interest rate of 5.69 as of December 31, 2022. 
 Equity In Earnings Of Unconsolidated Real Estate Ventures 
 Equity in earnings of unconsolidated real estate ventures represents our share of earnings and losses incurred through our 25 ownership interests in the 2018 Joint Venture and the 2016 Joint Venture. During the year ended December 31, 2022, we recorded 7.7 million of equity in earnings from our unconsolidated real estate ventures compared to 5.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2021. 
 Net Income Attributable to Noncontrolling Interests 
 As discussed in Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements in Item 8, we allocate U.S. generally accepted accounting principles ("GAAP") income (loss) utilizing the HLBV method, in which we allocate income or loss based on the change in each unitholders' claim on the net assets of our operating partnership at period end after adjusting for any distributions or contributions made during such period. 
 Due to the stated liquidation priorities and because the HLBV method incorporates non-cash items such as depreciation expense, in any given period, income or loss may be allocated disproportionately to noncontrolling interests. Net income attributable to noncontrolling interests was 80.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2022, compared to 41.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2021.

 Critical Accounting Policies and Use of Estimates 
 Our financial statements have been prepared on the accrual basis of accounting in accordance with GAAP. The preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. On an ongoing basis, we evaluate our estimates and assumptions, including those that impact our most critical accounting policies. We base our estimates and assumptions on historical experience and on various other factors that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances. Our critical accounting estimates are defined as accounting estimates or assumptions made in accordance with GAAP, which involve a significant level of estimation, uncertainty or subjectivity and have had or are reasonably likely to have a material impact on our financial condition or results of operations. Actual results may differ from these estimates. We believe the following are our most critical accounting policies. 
 Principles of Consolidation and Presentation of Noncontrolling Interests 
 Our consolidated financial statements include the accounts of our operating partnership and its controlled subsidiaries. All significant intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated in the consolidation of entities. 
 The limited partner ownership interests in our operating partnership that are held by owners other than us are referred to as noncontrolling interests. Noncontrolling interests also include ownership interests in DownREIT partnerships held by entities other than our operating partnership. Noncontrolling interests in a subsidiary are generally reported as a separate component of equity in our consolidated balance sheets. In our consolidated statements of operations, the revenues, expenses and net income or loss related to noncontrolling interests in our operating partnership are included in the consolidated amounts, with net income or loss attributable to the noncontrolling interests deducted separately to arrive at the net income or loss solely attributable to us. 
 When we obtain an economic interest in an entity, we evaluate the entity to determine if the entity is deemed a variable interest entity ("VIE"), and if we are deemed to be the primary beneficiary, in accordance with authoritative guidance issued on the consolidation of VIEs. When an entity is not deemed to be a VIE, we consider the provisions of additional guidance to determine whether the general partner controls a limited partnership or similar entity when the limited partners have certain rights. We consolidate all entities that are VIEs and of which the Company is deemed to be the primary beneficiary. 
 Self Storage Properties and Customer In-Place Leases 
 Self storage properties are carried at historical cost less accumulated depreciation and any impairment losses. When self storage properties are acquired, the purchase price is allocated to the tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on estimated fair values. The purchase price is allocated to the individual properties based on the fair value determined using an income approach or a cash flow analysis using appropriate risk adjusted capitalization rates, which take into account the relative size, age, and location of the individual properties along with current and projected occupancy and relative rental rates or appraised values, if available. Tangible assets are allocated to land, buildings and related improvements, and furniture and equipment. 
 In allocating the purchase price for a self storage property acquisition, we determine whether the acquisition includes intangible assets. We allocate a portion of the purchase price to an intangible asset attributed to the value of customer in-place leases. Because the majority of tenant leases are on a month-to-month basis, this intangible asset represents the estimated value of the leases in effect on the acquisition date. This intangible asset is amortized to expense using the straight-line method over 12 months, the estimated average remaining rental period for the leases.

 Non-GAAP Financial Measures 
 FFO and Core FFO 
 Funds from operations, or FFO, is a widely used performance measure for real estate companies and is provided here as a supplemental measure of our operating performance. The December 2018 Nareit Funds From Operations White Paper - 2018 Restatement, which we refer to as the White Paper, defines FFO as net income (as determined under GAAP), excluding: real estate depreciation and amortization, gains and losses from the sale of certain real estate assets, gains and losses from change in control, mark-to-market changes in value recognized on equity securities, impairment write-downs of certain real estate assets and impairment of investments in entities when it is directly attributable to decreases in the value of depreciable real estate held by the entity and after items to record unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures on the same basis. Distributions declared on subordinated performance units and DownREIT subordinated performance units represent our allocation of FFO to noncontrolling interests held by subordinated performance unitholders and DownREIT subordinated performance unitholders. For purposes of calculating FFO attributable to common shareholders, OP unitholders, and LTIP unitholders, we exclude distributions declared on subordinated performance units, DownREIT subordinated performance units, preferred shares and preferred units. We define Core FFO as FFO, as further adjusted to eliminate the impact of certain items that we do not consider indicative of our core operating performance. These further adjustments consist of acquisition costs, gains on debt forgiveness, gains (losses) on early extinguishment of debt, casualty-related expenses or losses and adjustments for unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures. 
 Management uses FFO and Core FFO as key performance indicators in evaluating the operations of our properties. Given the nature of our business as a real estate owner and operator, we consider FFO and Core FFO as key supplemental measures of our operating performance that are not specifically defined by GAAP. We believe that FFO and Core FFO are useful to management and investors as a starting point in measuring our operational performance because FFO and Core FFO exclude various items included in net income (loss) that do not relate to or are not indicative of our operating performance such as gains (or losses) from sales of self storage properties and depreciation, which can make periodic and peer analyses of operating performance more difficult. Our computation of FFO and Core FFO may not be comparable to FFO reported by other REITs or real estate companies. 
 FFO and Core FFO should be considered in addition to, but not as a substitute for, other measures of financial performance reported in accordance with GAAP, such as total revenues, operating income and net income (loss). FFO and Core FFO do not represent cash generated from operating activities determined in accordance with GAAP and are not a measure of liquidity or an indicator of our ability to make cash distributions. We believe that to further understand our performance, FFO and Core FFO should be compared with our reported net income (loss) and considered in addition to cash flows computed in accordance with GAAP, as presented in our consolidated financial statements.

 (2) These casualty-related expenses are recorded in the line item "Other" included in operating expense in the accompanying consolidated statement of operations. 
 (3) NSA combines OP units and DownREIT OP units with common shares because, after the applicable lock-out periods, OP units in the Company's operating partnership are redeemable for cash or, at NSA's option, exchangeable for common shares on a one-for-one basis and DownREIT OP units are also redeemable for cash or, at NSA's option, exchangeable for OP units in our operating partnership on a one-for-one basis, subject to certain adjustments in each case. Subordinated performance units, DownREIT subordinated performance units, and LTIP units may also, under certain circumstances, be convertible into or exchangeable for common shares (or other units that are convertible into or exchangeable for common shares). See footnote (1) to the following table for additional discussion of subordinated performance units, DownREIT subordinated performance units, and LTIP units in the calculation of FFO and Core FFO per share and unit.

 2.81 2.26 1.71 (1) Adjustment accounts for the difference between the weighted average number of shares used to calculate diluted earnings per share and the weighted average number of shares used to calculate FFO and Core FFO per share and unit. Diluted earnings per share is calculated using the two-class method for the company's restricted common shares, the treasury stock method for certain unvested LTIP units, and includes the assumption of a hypothetical conversion of subordinated performance units and DownREIT subordinated performance units into OP units, even though such units may only be convertible into OP units (i) after a lock-out period and (ii) upon certain events or conditions. For additional information about the conversion of subordinated performance units, DownREIT subordinated performance units and LTIP units into OP units, see Note 10 to the consolidated financial statements in Item 8. The computation of weighted average shares and units for FFO and Core FFO per share and unit includes all restricted common shares and LTIP units that participate in distributions and excludes all subordinated performance units and DownREIT subordinated performance units because their effect has been accounted for through the allocation of FFO to the related unitholders based on distributions declared. 
 (2) Represents the effect of adjusting the numerator to consolidated net income (loss) prior to GAAP allocations for noncontrolling interests, after deducting preferred share and unit distributions, and before the application of the two-class method and treasury stock method, as described in footnote (1) . 
 
 Net Operating Income 
 Net operating income, or NOI, represents rental revenue plus other property-related revenue less property operating expenses. NOI is not a measure of performance calculated in accordance with GAAP. 
 We believe NOI is useful to investors in evaluating our operating performance because: 
 NOI is one of the primary measures used by our management and our PROs to evaluate the economic productivity of our properties, including our ability to lease our properties, increase pricing and occupancy and control our property operating expenses; 
 NOI is widely used in the real estate industry and the self storage industry to measure the performance and value of real estate assets without regard to various items included in net income that do not relate to or are not indicative of operating performance, such as depreciation and amortization, which can vary depending upon accounting methods, the book value of assets, and the impact of our capital structure; and 
 We believe NOI helps our investors to meaningfully compare the results of our operating performance from period to period by removing the impact of our capital structure (primarily interest expense on our outstanding indebtedness) and depreciation of the cost basis of our assets from our operating results. 
 
 47 

Table of Contents 

 There are material limitations to using a non-GAAP measure such as NOI, including the difficulty associated with comparing results among more than one company and the inability to analyze certain significant items, including depreciation and interest expense, that directly affect our net income (loss). We compensate for these limitations by considering the economic effect of the excluded expense items independently as well as in connection with our analysis of net income (loss). NOI should be considered in addition to, but not as a substitute for, other measures of financial performance reported in accordance with GAAP, such as total revenues and net income (loss). 
 As of December 31, 2022, our same store portfolio consisted of 628 self storage properties. Our same store portfolio is defined as those properties owned and operated since the first day of the earliest year presented, excluding any properties sold, expected to be sold or subject to significant changes such as expansions or casualty events which cause the portfolio's year-over-year operating results to no longer be comparable. The following table illustrates the changes in rental revenue, other property-related revenue, and property operating expenses, for the year ended December 31, 2022 compared to the year ended December 31, 2021 (dollars in thousands):

 Rental Revenue 
 Same store portfolio rental revenues increased 59.7 million, or 12.6 , due to a 13.4 increase, from 13.05 to 14.80, in annualized same store rental revenue (including fees and net of any discounts and uncollectible customer amounts) divided by average occupied square feet for the year ended December 31, 2022, driven primarily by increased contractual lease rates for in-place tenants offset by a decrease in average occupancy from 94.7 for the year ended December 31, 2021 to 93.8 for the year ended December 31, 2022. 
 Other Property-Related Revenue 
 Same store other property-related revenue remained consistent decreasing by 0.3 million, or 1.5 , for the year ended December 31, 2022, as compared to the year ended December 31, 2021. 
 Property Operating Expenses 
 Same store property operating expenses were 140.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2022 compared to 134.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2021, an increase of 6.4 million, or 4.8 . The increase in same store property operating expenses was a result of increases in property tax, utilities and marketing costs during the year ended December 31, 2022.

 Our consolidated NOI shown in the table above does not include our proportionate share of NOI for our unconsolidated real estate ventures. For additional information about our 2018 Joint Venture and 2016 Joint Venture see Note 5 to the consolidated financial statements in Item 8. 
 EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA 
 We define EBITDA as net income (loss), as determined under GAAP, plus interest expense, loss on early extinguishment of debt, income taxes, depreciation and amortization expense and the Company's share of unconsolidated real estate venture depreciation and amortization. We define Adjusted EBITDA as EBITDA plus acquisition costs, equity-based compensation expense, losses on sale of properties, impairment of long-lived assets and casualty-related expense, minus gains on sale of properties and debt forgiveness, and after adjustments for unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures. These further adjustments eliminate the impact of items that we do not consider indicative of our core operating performance. In evaluating EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA, you should be aware that in the future we may incur expenses that are the same as or similar to some of the adjustments in this presentation. Our presentation of EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA should not be construed as an inference that our future results will be unaffected by unusual or non-recurring items. 
 We present EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA because we believe they assist investors and analysts in comparing our performance across reporting periods on a consistent basis by excluding items that we do not believe are indicative of our core operating performance. EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA have limitations as an analytical tool. Some of these limitations are: 
 EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA do not reflect our cash expenditures, or future requirements, for capital expenditures, contractual commitments or working capital needs; 
 EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA do not reflect the significant interest expense, or the cash requirements necessary to service interest or principal payments, on our debts; 
 although depreciation and amortization are non-cash charges, the assets being depreciated and amortized will often have to be replaced in the future, and EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA do not reflect any cash requirements for such replacements; 
 Adjusted EBITDA excludes equity-based compensation expense, which is and will remain a key element of our overall long-term incentive compensation package, although we exclude it as an expense when evaluating our ongoing operating performance for a particular period; 
 EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA do not reflect the impact of certain cash charges resulting from matters we consider not to be indicative of our ongoing operations; and 
 
 49 

Table of Contents 

 other companies in our industry may calculate EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA differently than we do, limiting their usefulness as comparative measures. 
 We compensate for these limitations by considering the economic effect of the excluded expense items independently as well as in connection with our analysis of net income (loss). EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA should be considered in addition to, but not as a substitute for, other measures of financial performance reported in accordance with GAAP, such as total revenues and net income (loss).

 Liquidity and Capital Resources 
 Liquidity Overview 
 Liquidity is the ability to meet present and future financial obligations. Our primary source of liquidity is cash flow from our operations. Additional sources are proceeds from equity and debt offerings, debt financings including additional borrowing capacity under the credit facility, and expansion options available under the 2028 Term Loan Facility, the June 2029 Term Loan Facility, and our credit facility. 
 Our short-term liquidity requirements consist primarily of property operating expenses, property acquisitions, capital expenditures, general and administrative expenses and principal and interest on our outstanding indebtedness. A further short-term liquidity requirement relates to distributions to our common and preferred shareholders and holders of preferred units, OP units, subordinated performance units, LTIP units, DownREIT OP units and DownREIT subordinated performance units. We expect to fund short-term liquidity requirements from our operating cash flow, cash on hand and borrowings under our credit facility. 
 Our long-term liquidity needs consist primarily of the repayment of debt, property acquisitions, and capital expenditures. We acquire properties through the use of cash, preferred units, OP units and subordinated performance units in our operating partnership or DownREIT partnerships. We expect to meet our long-term liquidity requirements with operating cash flow, cash on hand, secured and unsecured indebtedness, and the issuance of equity and debt securities.

Table of Contents 

 The availability of credit and its related effect on the overall economy may affect our liquidity and future financing activities, both through changes in interest rates and access to financing. During 2022, the Federal Reserve Board has raised interest rates from historically low levels and has signaled an intention to continue to do so until current inflation levels re-align with the Federal Reserve Board's long-term inflation target. Our ability to access capital on favorable terms as well as to use cash from operations to continue to meet our liquidity needs, all of which are highly uncertain and cannot be predicted, could be affected by various risks and uncertainties. We believe that, as a publicly-traded REIT, we will have access to multiple sources of capital to fund our long-term liquidity requirements, including the incurrence of additional debt and the issuance of debt and additional equity securities. However, we cannot assure you that this will be the case. 
 Cash Flows 
 At December 31, 2022, we had 35.3 million in cash and cash equivalents and 6.9 million of restricted cash, an increase in cash and cash equivalents of 10.3 million and an increase in restricted cash of 4.0 million from December 31, 2021. Restricted cash primarily consists of escrowed funds deposited with financial institutions resulting from property sales for which we elected to purchase replacement property in accordance with Section 1031 of the Code, and for real estate taxes, insurance, and other reserves for capital improvements in accordance with our loan agreements. The following discussion relates to changes in cash due to operating, investing, and financing activities, which are presented in our consolidated statements of cash flows included in Item 8 of this report. 
 Operating Activities 
 Cash provided by our operating activities was 443.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2022 compared to 331.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2021, an increase of 112.5 million. Our operating cash flow increased primarily due to operating cash flows from 229 self storage properties acquired during the year ended December 31, 2021 that generated cash flow for the entire year ended December 31, 2022 and 45 self storage properties that were acquired during the year ended December 31, 2022. These increases were partially offset by higher cash payments for interest expense. 
 Investing Activities 
 Cash used in investing activities was 584.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2022 compared to 2.0 billion for the year ended December 31, 2021. The primary uses of cash for the year ended December 31, 2022 were for our acquisition of 45 self storage properties for cash consideration of 496.4 million, capital expenditures of 42.8 million and capital contributions of 55.0 million to fund the self storage property acquisitions of our 2016 Joint Venture and 2018 Joint Venture. Cash used in investing activities was 2.0 billion for the year ended December 31, 2021 compared to 509.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2020. The primary uses of cash for the year ended December 31, 2021 were for our acquisition of 229 self storage properties for cash consideration of 2.0 billion, capital expenditures of 27.6 million and the acquisition of the interest in a reinsurance company and related cash flows of 2.9 million. 
 Capital expenditures totaled 42.8 million, 27.6 million and 16.4 million during the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020 respectively. We generally fund post-acquisition capital additions from cash provided by operating activities. 
 We categorize our capital expenditures broadly into three primary categories: 
 recurring capital expenditures, which represent the portion of capital expenditures that are deemed to replace the consumed portion of acquired capital assets and extend their useful life; 
 value enhancing capital expenditures, which represent the portion of capital expenditures that are made to enhance the revenue and value of an asset from its original purchase condition; and 
 acquisitions capital expenditures, which represent the portion of capital expenditures capitalized during the current period that were identified and underwritten prior to a property's acquisition.

 Credit Facility and Term Loan Facilities 
 As of December 31, 2022, our credit facility provided for total borrowings of 1.550 billion, consisting of six components: (i) a Revolver which provides for a total borrowing commitment up to 650.0 million, whereby we may borrow, repay and re-borrow amounts under the Revolver, (ii) a 125.0 million Term Loan A, (iii) a 250.0 million Term Loan B, (iv) a 225.0 million Term Loan C, (v) a 175.0 million Term Loan D and (vi) a 125.0 million Term Loan E. The Revolver was set to mature in January 2024; provided that we had the ability to extend to July 2024 by paying an extension fee of 0.075 of the total borrowing commitment thereunder at the time of extension and meeting other customary conditions with respect to compliance. The Term Loan A was set to mature in January 2023, the Term Loan B matures in July 2024, the Term Loan C matures in January 2025, the Term Loan D matures in July 2026 and the Term Loan E matures in March 2027. The Revolver, Term Loan A, Term Loan B, Term Loan C, Term Loan D and Term Loan E were not subject to any scheduled reduction or amortization payments prior to maturity. As of December 31, 2022, we had an expansion option under the credit facility, which, if exercised in full, would provide for a total credit facility of 1.750 billion. 
 As of December 31, 2022, 125.0 million was outstanding under the Term Loan A with an effective interest rate of 3.74 , 250.0 million was outstanding under the Term Loan B with an effective interest rate of 2.94 , 225.0 million was outstanding under the Term Loan C with an effective interest rate of 2.91 , 175.0 million was outstanding under the Term Loan D with an effective interest rate of 3.12 and 125.0 million was outstanding under the Term Loan E with an effective interest rate of 5.59 . As of December 31, 2022, we would have had the capacity to borrow remaining Revolver commitments of 147.8 million while remaining in compliance with the credit facility's financial covenants.

 (2) Under the amended credit facility effective January 3, 2023, the Company has an expansion option which if exercised in full, would provide an additional 545.0 million of borrowing capacity. 
 (3) In connection with the January 3, 2023 amendments to our credit facility, we repaid in full both the 125.0 million of Term Loan A and the 175.0 million June 2023 Term Loan, both of which were to mature in 2023. 
 We anticipate our current cash balances, cash flows from operations and available sources of liquidity will be sufficient to fund operations and meet our short-term and long-term cash requirements, including our scheduled debt repayments, payments for contractual obligations, acquisitions, capital expenditures, working capital needs, dividends, and other prudent uses of our capital, as needed. However, we will continue to assess our liquidity needs. In the event of certain market conditions, we may require additional liquidity, which would require us to evaluate available alternatives and take appropriate actions.

 Equity Transactions 
 Issuance and Repurchase of Common Shares 
 On July 11, 2022, we approved a share repurchase program authorizing, but not obligating, the repurchase of up to 400.0 million of the Company's common shares from time to time. During the year ended December 31, 2022, we repurchased 1,986,175 common shares for approximately 90.1 million. 
 During the year ended December 31, 2022, after receiving notices of redemption from certain OP unitholders, we elected to issue 627,896 common shares to such holders in exchange for 627,896 OP units in satisfaction of the operating partnership's redemption obligations. 
 Issuance of OP Equity 
 In connection with the 45 properties acquired during the year ended December 31, 2022, we issued 68.9 million of OP equity (consisting of 353,030 series A-1 perpetual preferred units, 887,291 OP units and 167,396 subordinated performance units). We also issued 3.2 million of OP equity (consisting of 46,540 OP units) as consideration for Northwest's rights to property management contracts, brand, intellectual property, and certain intangible assets in connection with the PRO retirement. 
 As discussed in Note 3 to the consolidated financial statements in Item 8, during the year ended December 31, 2022, the Company also issued (i) 3,911,260 OP units upon the non-voluntary conversion of 2,078,357 subordinated performance units in connection with Northwest's retirement, (ii) 235,241 OP units upon the voluntary conversion of 82,611 subordinated performance units and (iii) 192,296 OP units upon the conversion of an equivalent number of LTIP units.

On February 22, 2023, our board of trustees also declared cash distributions of 0.375 per Series A Preferred Share and Series A-1 preferred unit to shareholders and unitholders of record as of March 15, 2023. In addition, we expect to declare a cash distribution in the first quarter of 2023 to our subordinated performance unitholders of record as of March 15, 2023. Such dividends and distributions are expected to be paid on March 30, 2023. 
 Cash Distributions from our Operating Partnership 
 Under the LP Agreement of our operating partnership, to the extent that we, as the general partner of our operating partnership, determine to make distributions to the partners of our operating partnership out of the operating cash flow or capital transaction proceeds generated by a real property portfolio managed by one of our PROs, the holders of the series of subordinated performance units that relate to such portfolio are entitled to share in such distributions. Under the LP Agreement of our operating partnership, operating cash flow with respect to a portfolio of properties managed by one of our PROs is generally an amount determined by us, as general partner of our operating partnership, equal to the excess of property revenues over property related expenses from that portfolio. In general, property revenue from the portfolio includes: 
 (i) all receipts, including rents and other operating revenues; 
 (ii) any incentive, financing, break-up and other fees paid to us by third parties; 
 (iii) amounts released from previously set aside reserves; and 
 (iv) any other amounts received by us, which we allocate to the particular portfolio of properties. 
 In general, property-related expenses include all direct expenses related to the operation of the properties in that portfolio, including real property taxes, insurance, property-level general and administrative expenses, employee costs, utilities, property marketing expense, property maintenance and property reserves and other expenses incurred at the property level. In addition, other expenses incurred by our operating partnership will also be allocated by us, as general partner, to the property portfolio and will be included in the property-related expenses of that portfolio. Examples of such other expenses include: 
 
 55 

Table of Contents 

 (i) corporate-level general and administrative expenses; 
 (ii) out-of-pocket costs, expenses and fees of our operating partnership, whether or not capitalized; 
 (iii) the costs and expenses of organizing and operating our operating partnership; 
 (iv) amounts paid or due in respect of any loan or other indebtedness of our operating partnership during such period; 
 (v) extraordinary expenses of our operating partnership not previously or otherwise deducted under item (ii) above; 
 (vi) any third-party costs and expenses associated with identifying, analyzing, and presenting a proposed property to us and/or our operating partnership; and 
 (vii) reserves to meet anticipated operating expenditures, debt service or other liabilities, as determined by us. 
 To the extent that we, as the general partner of our operating partnership, determine to make distributions to the partners of our operating partnership out of the operating cash flow of a real property portfolio managed by one of our PROs, operating cash flow from a property portfolio is required to be allocated to OP unitholders and to the holders of series of subordinated performance units that relate to such property portfolio as follows: 
 First, an amount is allocated to OP unitholders in order to provide OP unitholders (together with any prior allocations of capital transaction proceeds) with a cumulative preferred allocation on the unreturned capital contributions attributed to the OP units in respect of such property portfolio. The preferred allocation for all of our existing portfolios is 6 . As of December 31, 2022, our operating partnership had an aggregate of 2,915.8 million of unreturned capital contributions with respect to common shareholders and OP unitholders, with respect to the various property portfolios. 
 Second, an amount is allocated to the holders of the series of subordinated performance units relating to such property portfolio in order to provide such holders with an allocation (together with prior distributions of capital transaction proceeds) on their unreturned capital contributions. Although the subordinated allocation for the subordinated performance units is non-cumulative from period to period, if the operating cash flow from a property portfolio related to a series of subordinated performance units is sufficient, in the judgment of the general partner (with the approval of a majority of our independent trustees), to fund distributions to the holders of such series of subordinated performance units, but we, as the general partner of our operating partnership, decline to make distributions to such holders, the amount available but not paid as distributions will be added to the subordinated allocation corresponding to such series of subordinated performance units. The subordinated allocation for the outstanding subordinated performance units is 6 . As of December 31, 2022, an aggregate of 244.3 million of unreturned capital contributions has been allocated to the various series of subordinated performance units. 
 Thereafter, any additional operating cash flow is allocated to OP unitholders and the applicable series of subordinated performance units equally. 
 Following the allocation described above, we as the general partner of our operating partnership, will generally cause our operating partnership to distribute the amounts allocated to the relevant series of subordinated performance units to the holders of such series of subordinated performance units. We, as the general partner, may cause our operating partnership to distribute the amounts allocated to OP unitholders or may cause our operating partnership to retain such amounts to be used by our operating partnership for any purpose. Any operating cash flow that is attributable to amounts retained by our operating partnership pursuant to the preceding sentence will generally be available to be allocated as an additional capital contribution to the various property portfolios. 
 The foregoing description of the allocation of operating cash flow between the OP unitholders and subordinated performance unitholders is used for purposes of determining distributions to holders of subordinated performance units but does not necessarily represent the operating cash flow that will be distributed to OP unitholders (or paid as dividends to holders of our common shares). Any distribution of operating cash flow allocated to the OP unitholders will be made at our discretion (and paid as dividends to holders of our common shares at the discretion of our board of trustees).

Table of Contents 

 Under the LP Agreement of our operating partnership, capital transactions are transactions that are outside the ordinary course of our operating partnership's business, involve the sale, exchange, other disposition, or refinancing of any property, and are designated as capital transactions by us, as the general partner. To the extent the general partner determines to distribute capital transaction proceeds, the proceeds from capital transactions involving a particular property portfolio are required to be allocated to OP unitholders and to the series of subordinated performance units that relate to such property portfolio as follows: 
 First, an amount determined by us, as the general partner, of such capital transaction proceeds is allocated to OP unitholders in order to provide OP unitholders (together with any prior allocations of operating cash flow) with a cumulative preferred allocation on the unreturned capital contributions attributed to the OP unitholders in respect of such property portfolio that relate to such capital transaction plus an additional amount equal to such unreturned capital contributions. 
 Second, an amount determined by us, as the general partner, is allocated to the holders of the series of subordinated performance units relating to such property portfolio in order to provide such holders with a non-cumulative subordinated allocation on the unreturned capital contributions made by such holders in respect of such property portfolio that relate to such capital transaction plus an additional amount equal to such unreturned capital contributions. 
 The preferred allocation and subordinated allocation with respect to capital transaction proceeds for each portfolio is equal to the preferred allocation and subordinated allocation for distributions of operating cash flow with respect to that portfolio. 
 Thereafter, any additional capital transaction proceeds are allocated to OP unitholders and the applicable series of subordinated performance units equally. 
 Following the allocation described above, we, as the general partner of our operating partnership, will generally cause our operating partnership to distribute the amounts allocated to the relevant series of subordinated performance units to the holders of such series of subordinated performance units. We, as general partner of our operating partnership, may cause our operating partnership to distribute the amounts allocated to the OP unitholders or may cause our operating partnership to retain such amounts to be used by our operating partnership for any purpose. Any capital transaction proceeds that are attributable to amounts retained by our operating partnership pursuant to the preceding sentence will generally be available to be allocated as an additional capital contribution to the various property portfolios. 
 The foregoing allocation of capital transaction proceeds between the OP unitholders and subordinated performance unitholders is used for purposes of determining distributions to holders of subordinated performance units but does not necessarily represent the capital transaction proceeds that will be distributed to OP unitholders (or paid as dividends to holders of our common shares). Any distribution of capital transaction proceeds allocated to the OP unitholders will be made at our discretion (and paid as dividends to holders of our common shares at the discretion of our board of trustees). 
 Our OP units are redeemable for cash or, at our option exchangeable on a one-for-one basis into common shares after an agreed period of time and certain other conditions. Our subordinated performance units are only convertible into OP units following a two year lock-out period and then (i) at the holder's election only upon the achievement of certain performance thresholds relating to the properties to which such subordinated performance units relate or (ii) at our election upon a retirement event of a PRO that holds such subordinated performance units or upon certain qualifying terminations.

Table of Contents 

 Notwithstanding the two-year lock out period on conversions of subordinated performance units into OP units, if such subordinated performance units were convertible into OP units as of December 31, 2022, each subordinated performance unit would on average hypothetically convert into 1.72 OP units, or into an aggregate of approximately 21.5 million OP units. These amounts are based on historical financial information for the trailing twelve months ended December 31, 2022. The hypothetical conversion is calculated by dividing the average cash available for distribution, or CAD, per subordinated performance unit by 110 of the CAD per OP unit over the same period. We anticipate that as our CAD grows over time, the conversion ratio will also grow, including to levels that may exceed this amount. The actual number of OP units into which such subordinated performance units will become convertible may vary significantly and will depend upon the applicable conversion penalty and the actual CAD to the OP units and the actual CAD to the converted subordinated performance units in the one-year period ending prior to conversion. We have also granted registration rights to those persons who will be eligible to receive common shares issuable upon exchange of OP units issued in our formation transactions and certain contribution transactions. 
 Allocation of Capital Contributions 
 We, as the general partner of our operating partnership, in our discretion, have the right to increase or decrease, as appropriate, the amount of capital contributions allocated to our operating partnership in general and to each series of subordinated performance units to reflect capital expenditures made by our operating partnership in respect of each portfolio, the sale or refinancing of all or a portion of the properties comprising the portfolio, the distribution of capital transaction proceeds by our operating partnership, the retention by our operating partnership of cash for working capital purposes and other events impacting the amount of capital contributions allocated to the holders. In addition, to avoid conflicts of interests, any decision by us to increase or decrease allocations of capital contributions must also be approved by a majority of our independent trustees. 
 Segment 
 We manage our business as one reportable segment consisting of investments in self storage properties located in the United States. Although we operate in several markets, these operations have been aggregated into one reportable segment based on the similar economic characteristics among all markets. 
 Seasonality 
 The self storage business is subject to minor seasonal fluctuations. A greater portion of revenues and profits are realized from May through September. Historically, our highest level of occupancy has typically been in July, while our lowest level of occupancy has typically been in February. Results for any quarter may not be indicative of the results that may be achieved for the full fiscal year. 

ITEM 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk 
 Market risk refers to the risk of loss from adverse changes in market prices and interest rates. Our future income, cash flows, and fair values of financial instruments are dependent upon prevailing market interest rates. The primary market risk to which we believe we are exposed is interest rate risk. Interest rate risk is highly sensitive to many factors, including governmental monetary and tax policies, domestic and international economic and political considerations, and other factors beyond our control. We use interest rate swaps to moderate our exposure to interest rate risk by effectively converting the interest on variable rate debt to a fixed rate. We make limited use of other derivative financial instruments and we do not use them for trading or other speculative purposes. 
 As of December 31, 2022, we had 621.0 million of debt subject to variable interest rates (excluding variable-rate debt subject to interest rate swaps). If our reference rates (currently one-month LIBOR and SOFR) were to increase or decrease by 100 basis points, the increase or decrease in interest expense on the variable-rate debt (excluding variable-rate debt subject to interest rate swaps) would decrease or increase future earnings and cash flows by approximately 6.2 million annually. 
 Interest rate risk amounts were determined by considering the impact of hypothetical interest rates on our financial instruments. These analyses do not consider the effect of any change in overall economic activity that could occur. Further, in the event of a change of that magnitude, we may take actions to further mitigate our exposure to the change. However, due to the uncertainty of the specific actions that would be taken and their possible effects, these analyses assume no changes in our financial structure.

 Item 9A. Controls and Procedures 
 Disclosure Controls and Procedures 
 A review and evaluation was performed by our management, including our Chief Executive Officer (the "CEO") and Chief Financial Officer (the "CFO"), of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures (as such term is defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act), as of the end of the period covered by this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Based on that review and evaluation, the CEO and CFO have concluded that our current disclosure controls and procedures, as designed and implemented, were effective. 
 Notwithstanding the foregoing, a control system, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that it will detect or uncover failures within the Company to disclose material information otherwise required to be set forth in our periodic reports. 
 Management's Annual Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting 
 Our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting. Internal control over financial reporting is defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) promulgated under the Exchange Act as a process designed by, or under the supervision of, our principal executive and principal financial officers and effected by our board of trustees, audit committee, management and other personnel to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with U.S. GAAP and includes those policies and procedures that: 
 pertain to the maintenance of records that in reasonable detail accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the Company; 
 provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with U.S. GAAP, and that our receipts and expenditures are being made only in accordance with authorizations of our management and trustees; and 
 provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of our assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements. 
 Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risks that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. 
 Our management assessed the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2022. In making this assessment, our management used criteria set forth by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission in Internal Control-Integrated Framework (2013 Framework). 
 Based on this assessment, our management believes that, as of December 31, 2022, our internal control over financial reporting was effective based on those criteria. 
 The Company s independent registered public accounting firm has issued an attestation report on the Company s internal control over financial reporting. 
 Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting 
 There have been no changes in our internal control over financial reporting that occurred during the quarter ended December 31, 2022 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.

 Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm 
 To the Shareholders and Board of Trustees 
 National Storage Affiliates Trust: 
 
 Opinion on the Consolidated Financial Statements 
 We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of National Storage Affiliates Trust and subsidiaries (the Company) as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, the related consolidated statements of operations, comprehensive income (loss), changes in equity, and cash flows for each of the years in the three year period ended December 31, 2022, and the related notes, and the financial statement schedule , Schedule III Real Estate and Accumulated Depreciation (collectively, the consolidated financial statements). In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the years in the three year period ended December 31, 2022, in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. 
 We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the Company s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2022, based on criteria established in Internal Control Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission, and our report dated February 27, 2023 expressed an unqualified opinion on the effectiveness of the Company s internal control over financial reporting. 
 Basis for Opinion 
 These consolidated financial statements are the responsibility of the Company s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these consolidated financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. 
 We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. Our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the consolidated financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the consolidated financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion. 
 Critical Audit Matter 
 The critical audit matter communicated below is a matter arising from the current period audit of the consolidated financial statements that was communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that: (1) relates to accounts or disclosures that are material to the consolidated financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of a critical audit matter does not alter in any way our opinion on the consolidated financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matter below, providing a separate opinion on the critical audit matter or on the accounts or disclosures to which it relates. 
 Purchase price allocation for self storage property acquisitions 
 As discussed in Note 6 to the consolidated financial statements, during the year ended December 31, 2022, the Company acquired 569.2 million of self storage properties that were recorded as asset acquisitions. The purchase price in an asset acquisition is allocated to the tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on their relative fair value. Assets acquired and liabilities assumed primarily comprise land, buildings and related improvements, customer in-place leases, furniture and equipment and assumed real estate leasehold interests. 
 F-2 

Table of Contents 

 We identified the evaluation of the estimated fair value of certain land and building assets acquired in certain property acquisitions as a critical audit matter. Specifically, subjective auditor judgment and the involvement of valuation professionals with specialized skills and knowledge was required to evaluate the assumptions used in the Company s determination of the estimated fair value, which included comparable land sales and estimated building replacement costs. 
 The following are the primary procedures we performed to address this critical audit matter. We evaluated the design and tested the operating effectiveness of certain internal controls related to the Company s process to estimate fair value, including controls related to developing estimated fair values of land and buildings. With the assistance of valuation professionals with specialized skills and knowledge, we evaluated the estimated fair value of: 
 land by comparing to market data of comparable land sales. 
 buildings by comparing the building replacement costs to market data, including appraisal guides used to estimate the depreciated value of similar self storage structures.

 Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm 
 To the Shareholders and Board of Trustees 
 National Storage Affiliates Trust: 
 Opinion on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting 
 We have audited National Storage Affiliates Trust and subsidiaries (the Company) internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2022, based on criteria established in Internal Control Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. In our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2022, based on criteria established in Internal Control Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. 
 We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the consolidated balance sheets of the Company as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, the related consolidated statements of operations, comprehensive income (loss), changes in equity, and cash flows for each of the years in the three-year period ended December 31, 2022, and the related notes, and the financial statement schedule, Schedule III Real Estate and Accumulated Depreciation (collectively, the consolidated financial statements), and our report dated February 27, 2023 expressed an unqualified opinion on those consolidated financial statements. 
 Basis for Opinion 
 The Company s management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in the accompanying Management s Annual Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company s internal control over financial reporting based on our audit. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. 
 We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audit of internal control over financial reporting included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk. Our audit also included performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion. 
 Definition and Limitations of Internal Control Over Financial Reporting 
 A company s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements. 
 Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

 MSAs in the United States. Pursuant to the Agreement of Limited Partnership (as amended, the "LP Agreement") of its operating partnership, the Company's operating partnership is authorized to issue preferred units, Class A Units ("OP units"), different series of Class B Units ("subordinated performance units"), and Long-Term Incentive Plan Units ("LTIP units"). The Company also owns certain of its self storage properties through other consolidated limited partnership subsidiaries of its operating partnership, which the Company refers to as "DownREIT partnerships." The DownREIT partnerships issue equity ownership interests that are intended to be economically equivalent to the Company's OP units ("DownREIT OP units") and subordinated performance units ("DownREIT subordinated performance units"). 
 The Company owned consolidated self storage properties in states and Puerto Rico with approximately million rentable square feet in approximately storage units as of December 31, 2022. These properties are managed with local operational focus and expertise by the Company and its participating regional operators ("PROs"). As of December 31, 2022, these PROs are Optivest Properties LLC and its controlled affiliates ("Optivest"), Move It Self Storage and its controlled affiliates ("Move It"), Guardian Storage Centers LLC and its controlled affiliates ("Guardian"), Southern Storage Management Systems, Inc. d/b/a Southern Self Storage ("Southern"), Blue Sky Self Storage LLC, a strategic partnership between Argus Professional Storage Management and Uplift Development Group (formerly known as GYS Development LLC) ("Blue Sky"), affiliates of Investment Real Estate Management, LLC d/b/a Moove In Self Storage ("Moove In"), Hide-Away Storage Services, Inc. and its controlled affiliates ("Hide-Away"), Arizona Mini Storage Management Company d/b/a Storage Solutions and its controlled affiliates ("Storage Solutions"), and an affiliate of Shader Brothers Corporation d/b/a Personal Mini Storage ("Personal Mini"). 
 During the year ended December 31, 2021, Northwest elected to retire as one of the Company's PROs. As a result of the retirement, on January 1, 2022, management of our properties in the Northwest managed portfolio was transferred to the Company and the Northwest brand name and related intellectual property was internalized by the Company, and the Company discontinued payment of any supervisory and administrative fees or reimbursements to Northwest. 
 During the year ended December 31, 2022, one of our PROs, Move It Self Storage and its controlled affiliates, notified us of Move It's election to retire as a PRO effective January 1, 2023. As a result of the retirement, on January 1, 2023, management of our properties in the Move It managed portfolio was transferred to us and the Move It brand name and related intellectual property was internalized by us, and we discontinued payment of any supervisory and administrative fees or reimbursements to Move It. In addition, on January 1, 2023, we issued a notice of non-voluntary conversion to convert all of the subordinated performance units related to Move It's managed portfolio into OP units. As part of the internalization, a majority of Move It's employees were offered and provided employment by us and will continue managing Move It's portfolio of properties as members of our existing property management platform. See Note 15 for additional information related to the Move It retirement and internalization. 
 As of December 31, 2022, the Company also managed through its property management platform an additional portfolio of properties owned by the Company's unconsolidated real estate ventures. These properties contain approximately million rentable square feet, configured in approximately storage units and located across states. The Company owns a equity interest in each of its unconsolidated real estate ventures. 
 As of December 31, 2022, in total, the Company operated and held ownership interests in self storage properties located across states and Puerto Rico with approximately million rentable square feet in approximately storage units.

 DownREIT partnerships that are considered VIEs, which owned self storage properties. The net book value of the real estate owned by these VIEs was million and million as of December 31, 2022 and December 31, 2021, respectively. For certain DownREIT partnerships which are subject to fixed rate mortgages payable, the carrying value of such fixed rate mortgages payable held by these VIEs was million and million as of December 31, 2022 and December 31, 2021, respectively. The creditors of the consolidated VIEs do not have recourse to the Company's general credit. 
 Noncontrolling Interests 
 All of the limited partner equity interests ("OP equity") in its operating partnership not held by the Company are reflected as noncontrolling interests. Noncontrolling interests also include ownership interests in DownREIT partnerships held by entities other than the Company's operating partnership. In the consolidated statements of operations, the Company allocates net income (loss) attributable to noncontrolling interests to arrive at net income (loss) attributable to National Storage Affiliates Trust. 
 For transactions that result in changes to the Company's ownership interest in its operating partnership, the carrying amount of noncontrolling interests is adjusted to reflect such changes. The difference between the fair value of the consideration received or paid and the amount by which the noncontrolling interests is adjusted is reflected as an adjustment to additional paid-in capital on the consolidated balance sheets.

The 2018 Joint Venture paid the Company a million acquisition fee related to the initial acquisition of properties by the 2018 Joint Venture (the "Initial 2018 JV Portfolio") during the year ended December 31, 2018, at the time of the Initial 2018 JV Portfolio acquisition. These fees are refundable to the unconsolidated real estate ventures, on a prorated basis, if the Company is removed as the managing member during the initial life of the unconsolidated real estate ventures and as such, the Company's performance obligation for these acquisition fees are satisfied over a period. Accordingly, the Company's performance obligation related to the Initial 2016 JV Portfolio was satisfied during the year ended December 31, 2020.

On May 19, 2021, the Company entered into an amendment to the sales agreement with certain sales agents, whereby the Company increased the aggregate gross sale price under the program to million, which included million of remaining available offered shares. The sales agreement contemplates that, in addition to the issuance and sale by the Company of offered shares to or through the sale agents, the Company may enter into separate forward sale agreements with any forward purchaser. Forward sale agreements, if any, will include only the Company's common shares and will not include any Series A Preferred Shares. If the Company enters into a forward sale agreement with any forward purchaser, such forward purchaser will attempt to borrow from third parties and sell, through the related agent, acting as sales agent for such forward purchaser (each, a "forward seller"), offered shares, in an amount equal to the offered shares subject to such forward sale agreement, to hedge such forward purchaser s exposure under such forward sale agreement. The Company may offer the common shares and Series A Preferred Shares through the agents, as the Company's sales agents, or, as applicable, as forward seller, or directly to the agents or forward sellers, acting as principals, by means of, among others, ordinary brokers transactions on the NYSE or otherwise at market prices prevailing at the time of sale or at negotiated prices.

 Series A-1 Cumulative Redeemable Preferred Units ("Series A-1 preferred units") rank senior to OP units and subordinated performance units in the Company's operating partnership with respect to distributions and liquidation. The Series A-1 preferred units have a stated value of per unit and receive distributions at an annual rate of . These distributions are cumulative. The Series A-1 preferred units are redeemable at the option of the holder after the first anniversary of the date of issuance, which redemption obligations may be satisfied at the Company s option in cash in an amount equal to the market value of an equivalent number of the Company's Series A Preferred Shares or the issuance of Series A Preferred Shares on a -for-one basis, subject to adjustments. Generally, the Series A-1 preferred units become redeemable by the Company beginning after the initial issuance of each Series A-1 preferred unit at a stated value of per unit, plus accrued but unpaid distributions. The increase in Series A-1 preferred units outstanding from December 31, 2021 to December 31, 2022 was due to the issuance of Series A-1 preferred units issued in connection with the acquisition of self storage properties partially offset by the redemption of Series A-1 preferred units for Series A Preferred Shares. 
 OP Units and DownREIT OP units 
 OP units in the Company's operating partnership are redeemable for cash or, at the Company's option, exchangeable for common shares on a -for-one basis, and DownREIT OP units are redeemable for cash or, at the Company's option, exchangeable for OP units in its operating partnership on a -for-one basis, subject to certain adjustments in each case. The holders of OP units are generally not entitled to elect redemption until after the issuance of the OP units. The holders of DownREIT OP units are generally not entitled to elect redemption until after the date of the contributor's initial contribution. 
 The increase in OP units outstanding from December 31, 2021 to December 31, 2022 was due to (i) OP units issued upon the non-voluntary conversion of subordinated performance units (as discussed further below) in connection with Northwest's retirement, (ii) OP units issued upon the voluntary conversion of subordinated performance units, (iii) the conversion of LTIP units into an equivalent number of OP units, (iv) the issuance of OP units in connection with the acquisition of self storage properties, and (v) the issuance of OP units in connection with the acquisition of Northwest's rights to property management contracts, brand, intellectual property, and certain tangible assets, partially offset by the conversion of OP units into subordinated performance units, and the redemption of OP units for an equal number of common shares. 
 Subordinated Performance Units and DownREIT Subordinated Performance Units 
 Subordinated performance units may also, under certain circumstances, be convertible into OP units which are exchangeable for common shares as described above, and DownREIT subordinated performance units may, under certain circumstances, be exchangeable for subordinated performance units on a -for-one basis. Subordinated performance units are only convertible into OP units after a lock-out period and then generally (i) at the holder s election only upon the achievement of certain performance thresholds relating to the properties to which such subordinated performance units relate or (ii) at the Company's election upon a retirement event of a PRO that holds such subordinated performance units or upon certain qualifying terminations. The holders of DownREIT subordinated performance units are generally not entitled to elect redemption until at least after the date of the contributor's initial contribution. 
 Following such lock-out period, a holder of subordinated performance units in the Company's operating partnership may elect a voluntary conversion one time each year on or prior to December 1st to convert a pre-determined portion of such subordinated performance units into OP units in the Company's operating partnership, with such conversion effective January 1st of the following year, with each subordinated performance unit being converted into the number of OP units determined by dividing the average cash available for distribution, or CAD, per unit on the series of specific subordinated performance units over the period prior to conversion by of the CAD per unit on the OP units determined over the same period. CAD per unit on the series of specific subordinated performance units and OP units is determined by the Company based generally upon the application of the provisions of the LP Agreement applicable to the distributions of operating cash flow and capital transactions proceeds.

 LTIP Units 
 LTIP units are a special class of partnership interest in the Company's operating partnership that allow the holder to participate in the ordinary and liquidating distributions received by holders of the OP units (subject to the achievement of specified levels of profitability by the Company's operating partnership or the achievement of certain events). LTIP units may also, under certain circumstances, be convertible into OP units on a -for-one basis, which are then exchangeable for common shares as described above. LTIP units do not have full parity with OP units with respect to liquidating distributions and may not receive ordinary distributions until such parity is reached pursuant to the terms of the LP Agreement. If such parity is reached under the LP Agreement, upon vesting, vested LTIP units may be converted into an equal number of OP units, and thereafter have all the rights of OP units, including redemption rights.

 As discussed in Note 2, the Company allocates GAAP income utilizing the HLBV method, in which the Company allocates income or loss based on the change in each unitholders' claim on the net assets of its operating partnership at period end after adjusting for any distributions or contributions made during such period. Due to the stated liquidation priorities and because the HLBV method incorporates non-cash items such as depreciation expense, in any given period, income or loss may be allocated disproportionately to National Storage Affiliates Trust and noncontrolling interests, resulting in volatile fluctuations of basic and diluted earnings (loss) per share. 
 Outstanding equity interests of the Company's operating partnership and DownREIT partnerships are considered potential common shares for purposes of calculating diluted earnings (loss) per share as the unitholders may, through the exercise of redemption rights, obtain common shares, subject to various restrictions. Basic earnings per share is calculated based on the weighted average number of common shares outstanding during the period. Diluted earnings per share is calculated by further adjusting for the dilutive impact using the treasury stock method for unvested LTIP units subject to a service condition outstanding during the period and the if-converted method for any convertible securities outstanding during the period.

 -for-one basis, subject to certain adjustments and DownREIT OP units are redeemable for cash or, at the Company's option, exchangeable for OP units in its operating partnership on a -for-one basis, subject to certain adjustments in each case. 
 LTIP units may also, under certain circumstances, be convertible into OP units on a -for-one basis, which are then exchangeable for common shares as described above. Vested LTIP units and unvested LTIP units that vest based on a service condition are allocated income or loss in a similar manner as OP units. Unvested LTIP units subject to a service or market condition are evaluated for dilution using the treasury stock method. For the year ended December 31, 2022, unvested LTIP units that vest based on a service or market condition are excluded from the calculation of diluted earnings per share as they are not dilutive to earnings per share. For the year ended December 31, 2022, unvested LTIP units that vest upon the future acquisition of properties are excluded from the calculation of diluted earnings per share because the contingency for the units to vest has not been attained as of the end of the reported period. 
 Subordinated performance units may also, under certain circumstances, be convertible into OP units which are exchangeable for common shares as described above, and DownREIT subordinated performance units may, under certain circumstances, be exchangeable for subordinated performance units on a -for-one basis. Subordinated performance units are only convertible into OP units, after a lock-out period and then generally (i) at the holder s election only upon the achievement of certain performance thresholds relating to the properties to which such subordinated performance units relate or (ii) at the Company's election upon a retirement event of a PRO that holds such subordinated performance units or upon certain qualifying terminations. Although subordinated performance units may only be convertible after a lock-out period, the Company assumes a hypothetical conversion of each subordinated performance unit (including each DownREIT subordinated performance unit) into OP units (with subsequently assumed redemption into common shares) for the purposes of calculating diluted weighted average common shares. This hypothetical conversion is calculated using historical financial information, and as a result, is not necessarily indicative of the results of operations, cash flows or financial position of the Company upon expiration of the lock out period on conversions. 
 For the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, potential common shares totaling million and million, respectively, related to OP units, DownREIT OP units, subordinated performance units, DownREIT subordinated performance units and vested LTIP units have been excluded from the calculation of diluted earnings per share as they are not dilutive to earnings per share. 
 Participating securities, which consist of unvested restricted common shares, receive dividends equal to those received by common shares. The effect of participating securities for the periods presented above is calculated using the two-class method of allocating distributed and undistributed earnings.

 Fair value at December 31, 2022 
 As of December 31, 2022 and 2021, the Company had outstanding interest rate swaps designated as cash flow hedges with aggregate notional amounts of million and million, respectively. As of December 31, 2022, the Company's swaps had a weighted average remaining term of years. The fair value of these swaps are presented within other assets and accounts payable and accrued liabilities in the accompanying balance sheets, and the Company recognizes any changes in the fair value as an adjustment of accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) within equity to the extent of their effectiveness. If the forward rates at December 31, 2022 remain constant, the Company estimates that during the next 12 months, the Company would reclassify into earnings approximately million of the unrealized gains included in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss). If market interest rates remain above the weighted average fixed rate under these interest rate swaps the Company will continue to benefit from net cash payments due to it from its counterparty to the interest rate swaps. 
 There were no transfers between levels during the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021. For financial assets and liabilities that utilize Level 2 inputs, the Company utilizes both direct and indirect observable price quotes, including LIBOR yield curves. The Company uses valuation techniques for Level 2 financial assets and liabilities which include LIBOR yield curves at the reporting date as well as assessing counterparty credit risk. Counterparties to these contracts are highly rated financial institutions. Although the Company has determined that the majority of the inputs used to value its derivatives fall within Level 2 of the fair value hierarchy, the credit valuation adjustments associated with the Company's derivatives utilize Level 3 inputs, such as estimates of current credit spreads, to evaluate the likelihood of default by the Company and the counterparties. As of December 31, 2022 and 2021, the Company determined that the effect of credit valuation adjustments on the overall valuation of its derivative positions are not significant to the overall valuation of its derivatives. Therefore, the Company has determined that its derivative valuations are appropriately classified in Level 2 of the fair value hierarchy. 
 Fair Value Disclosures 
 The carrying values of cash and cash equivalents, restricted cash, trade receivables, accounts payable and accrued liabilities reflected in the balance sheets at December 31, 2022 and 2021, approximate fair value due to the short term nature of these financial assets and liabilities. The carrying value of variable rate debt financing reflected in the balance sheets at December 31, 2022 and 2021 approximates fair value as the changes in their associated interest rates reflect the current market and credit risk is similar to when the loans were originally obtained.

If such Revolving Lender does not pay such amount forthwith upon demand therefor by the Administrative Agent or the Swingline Lender, and until such time as such Revolving Lender 
 51 

makes the required payment, the Swingline Lender shall be deemed to continue to have outstanding Swingline Loans in the amount of such unpaid participation obligation for all purposes of the Loan Documents (other than those provisions requiring the other Revolving Lenders to purchase a participation therein).

Any payments, prepayments or other amounts paid or payable to a Defaulting Lender that are applied (or held) to pay amounts owed by a Defaulting Lender or to post Cash Collateral pursuant to this subsection shall be deemed paid to and redirected by such Defaulting Lender, and each Lender irrevocably consents hereto. 
 (c) Certain Fees . 
 (i) No Defaulting Lender shall be entitled to receive any Fee payable under Section 3.6(a) , (b) or (d) for any period during which that Lender is a Defaulting Lender (and the Borrower shall not be required to pay any such fee that otherwise would have been required to have been paid to that Defaulting Lender).

 (iii) With respect to any Fee not required to be paid to any Defaulting Lender pursuant to the immediately preceding clauses (i) or (ii) , the Borrower shall (x) pay to each Revolving Lender that is a Non-Defaulting Lender that portion of any such Fee otherwise payable to such Defaulting Lender with respect to such Defaulting Lender s participation in Letter of Credit Liabilities or Swingline Loans that has been reallocated to such Non-Defaulting Lender pursuant to the immediately following subsection (d) , (y) pay to the Administrative Agent and Swingline Lender, as applicable, the amount of any such Fee otherwise payable to such Defaulting Lender to the extent allocable to the Administrative Agent s or Swingline Lender s Fronting Exposure to such Defaulting Lender, and (z) not be required to pay the remaining amount of any such Fee.

 70 

time), and (y) such reallocation does not cause the aggregate Revolving Credit Exposure of any Revolving Lender that is a Non-Defaulting Lender to exceed such Non-Defaulting Lender s Commitment. Subject to Section 13.20 , no reallocation hereunder shall constitute a waiver or release of any claim of any party hereunder against a Defaulting Lender arising from that Lender having become a Defaulting Lender, including any claim of a Non-Defaulting Lender as a result of such Non-Defaulting Lender s increased exposure following such reallocation. 
 (e) Cash Collateral, Repayment of Swingline Loans .

If at any time the Administrative Agent determines that Cash Collateral is subject to any right or claim of any Person other than the Administrative Agent as herein provided, or that the total amount of such Cash Collateral is less than 105 of the aggregate Fronting Exposure of the Administrative Agent with respect to Letters of Credit issued and outstanding at such time, the Borrower will, promptly upon demand by the Administrative Agent, pay or provide to the Administrative Agent additional Cash Collateral in an amount sufficient to eliminate such deficiency (after giving effect to any Cash Collateral provided by the Defaulting Lender). 
 (iv) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, Cash Collateral provided under this Section in respect of Letters of Credit shall be applied to the satisfaction of the Defaulting Lender s obligation to fund participations in respect of Letter of Credit Liabilities (including, as to Cash Collateral provided by a Defaulting Lender, any interest accrued on such obligation) for which the Cash Collateral was so provided, prior to any other application of such property as may otherwise be provided for herein.

 (g) New Swingline Loans Letters of Credit . So long as any Lender is a Defaulting Lender, (i) the Swingline Lender shall not be required to fund any Swingline Loans unless it is satisfied that it will have no Fronting Exposure after giving effect to such Swingline Loan and (ii) the Administrative Agent shall not be required to issue, extend, renew or increase any Letter of Credit unless it is satisfied that it will have no Fronting Exposure after giving effect thereto.

 (i) pay directly to the relevant Governmental Authority the full amount required to be so withheld or deducted 
 (ii) promptly forward to the Administrative Agent an official receipt or other documentation reasonably satisfactory to the Administrative Agent evidencing such payment to such Governmental Authority and 
 (iii) pay to the Administrative Agent for its account or the account of the applicable Lender such additional amount or amounts as is necessary to ensure that the net amount actually received by the Administrative Agent or such Lender will equal the full amount that the Administrative Agent or such Lender would have received had no such withholding or deduction of Taxes been required.

For purposes of this Section, a distribution hereunder by the Administrative Agent or any Lender to or for the account of any Lender shall be deemed a payment by the Borrower. 
 (c) Tax Forms . Prior to the date that any Lender becomes a party hereto, such Lender shall deliver to the Borrower and the Administrative Agent such certificates, documents or other evidence, as required by the Internal Revenue Code or Treasury Regulations issued pursuant thereto (including Internal Revenue Service Forms W-9, W-8ECI, W-8BEN-E and W-8EXP, as applicable, or appropriate successor forms), properly completed, currently effective and duly executed by such Lender establishing that payments to it hereunder and under the Notes are (i) not subject to United States Federal backup withholding tax and (ii) not subject to United States Federal withholding tax imposed under the Internal Revenue Code. Each such Lender shall, to the extent it may lawfully do so, (x) deliver further copies of such forms or other appropriate certifications on or before the date that any such forms expire or become obsolete and after the occurrence of any event requiring a change in the most recent form delivered to the Borrower or the Administrative Agent and (y) obtain such extensions of the time for filing, and

If any such Lender, to the extent it may lawfully do so, fails to deliver the above forms or other documentation, then the Administrative Agent may withhold from any payments to such Lender under any of the Loan Documents such amounts as are required by the Internal Revenue Code. If any Governmental Authority asserts that the Administrative Agent did not properly withhold or backup withhold, as the case may be, any tax or other amount from payments made to or for the account of any Lender, such Lender shall indemnify the Administrative Agent therefor, including all penalties and interest, any taxes imposed by any jurisdiction on the amounts payable to the Administrative Agent under this Section, and costs and expenses (including all reasonable fees and disbursements of any law firm or other external counsel and the allocated cost of internal legal services and all disbursements of internal counsel) of the Administrative Agent.

The Administrative Agent shall deliver the comparable information about its own status to the Borrower at such times. 
 (e) Treatment of Certain Refunds . If any party determines, in its sole discretion exercised in good faith, that it has received a refund of any Taxes as to which it has been indemnified pursuant to this Section 3.12 (including by the payment of additional amounts pursuant to this subsection (e) ), it shall pay to the indemnifying party an amount equal to such refund (but only to the extent of indemnity payments made under this Section with respect to the Taxes giving rise to such refund), net of all out-of-pocket expenses (including Taxes) of such indemnified party and without interest (other than any interest paid by the relevant Governmental Authority with respect to such refund). Such indemnifying party, upon the request of such indemnified party, shall repay to such indemnified party the amount paid over pursuant to this subsection (e) (plus any penalties, interest or other charges imposed by the relevant Governmental Authority) in the event that such indemnified party is required to repay such refund to such Governmental Authority. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this subsection (e) , in no event will the indemnified party be required to pay any amount to an indemnifying party pursuant to this subsection (e) the payment of which would place the indemnified party in a less favorable net after-Tax position than the indemnified party would have been in if the Tax subject to indemnification and giving rise to such refund had never been owed or paid. This paragraph shall not be construed to require any indemnified party to make available its Tax returns (or any other information relating to its Taxes that it deems confidential) to the indemnifying party or any other Person.

Any Participant s right to receive compensation pursuant to this subsection (a) is limited by the terms of Sections 13.5(d) and (e) . 
 (b) Additional Costs . In addition to, and not in limitation of the immediately preceding subsection (a) , the Borrower shall promptly pay to the Administrative Agent for the account of each affected Lender from time to time such amounts as such Lender may determine to be necessary to compensate such Lender for any costs incurred by such Lender that it determines are attributable to its making, continuing, converting to or maintaining of any SOFR Loans or its obligation to make any SOFR Loans hereunder, any reduction in any amount receivable by such Lender under this Agreement or any of the other Loan Documents in respect of any of such Loans or such obligation or the maintenance by such Lender of capital in respect of its Loans or its Commitments (such increases in costs and reductions in amounts receivable being herein called Additional Costs ), to the extent resulting from any Regulatory Change that (i) changes the basis of taxation of any amounts payable to such Lender under this Agreement or any of the other Loan Documents in respect of any of such Loans or its Commitments (other than taxes, fees, duties, levies, imposts, charges, deductions, withholdings or other charges which are excluded from the definition of Taxes pursuant to the first sentence of Section 3.12(a) and Taxes indemnified under Section 3.12 to the extent the Borrower (or any Person for the account or on behalf of the Borrower) has actually paid such indemnified amounts) or (ii) imposes or modifies any reserve, special deposit or similar requirements relating to any extensions of credit or other assets of, or any deposits with or other liabilities of, such Lender, or any commitment of such Lender (including, without limitation, the Commitments of such Lender hereunder) or (iii) has or would have the effect of reducing the rate of return on capital of such Lender to a level below that which such Lender could have achieved but for such Regulatory Change (taking into consideration such Lender s policies with respect to capital adequacy). 
 75 

(c) Lender s Suspension of SOFR Loans . Without limiting the effect of the provisions of the immediately preceding subsections (a) and (b) , if, by reason of any Regulatory Change, any Lender either (i) incurs Additional Costs based on or measured by the excess above a specified level of the amount of a category of deposits or other liabilities of such Lender that includes deposits by reference to which the interest rate on SOFR Loans is determined as provided in this Agreement or a category of extensions of credit or other assets of such Lender that includes SOFR Loans or (ii) becomes subject to restrictions on the amount of such a category of liabilities or assets that it may hold, then, if such Lender so elects by notice to the Borrower (with a copy to the Administrative Agent), the obligation of such Lender to make or Continue, or to Convert any other Type of Loans into, SOFR Loans hereunder shall be suspended until such Regulatory Change ceases to be in effect (in which case the provisions of Section 4.6 shall apply). 
 (d) Additional Costs in Respect of Letters of Credit . Without limiting the obligations of the Borrower under the preceding subsections of this Section (but without duplication), if as a result of any Regulatory Change (including any Regulatory Change pertaining to any risk-based capital guideline or other requirement issued by any Governmental Authority) there shall be imposed, modified or deemed applicable any tax, reserve, special deposit, capital adequacy or similar requirement against or with respect to or measured by reference to Letters of Credit and the result shall be to increase the cost to the Administrative Agent of issuing (or any Revolving Lender of purchasing participations in) or maintaining its obligation hereunder to issue (or purchase participations in) any Letter of Credit or reduce any amount receivable by the Administrative Agent or any Revolving Lender hereunder in respect of any Letter of Credit, then, upon demand by the Administrative Agent or such Revolving Lender, the Borrower shall pay promptly, and in any event within 3 Business Days of demand, to the Administrative Agent for its account or the account of such Revolving Lender, as applicable, from time to time as specified by the Administrative Agent or a Revolving Lender, such additional amounts as shall be sufficient to compensate the Administrative Agent or such Revolving Lender for such increased costs or reductions in amount. 
 (e) Notification and Determination of Additional Costs . Each of the Administrative Agent and each Lender and each Participant (through its participating Lender), as the case may be, agrees to notify the Borrower of any event occurring after the Agreement Date entitling the Administrative Agent or such Lender or such Participant to compensation under any of the preceding subsections of this Section as promptly as practicable provided, however, the failure of the Administrative Agent or any Lender or any Participant (through its participating Lender) to give such notice shall not release the Borrower from any of their obligations hereunder. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Borrower shall not be required to compensate the Administrative Agent, any Lender or any Participant pursuant to the foregoing provisions of this Section for any increased costs incurred or reductions suffered more than six months prior to the date that the Administrative Agent or such Lender or such Participant (through its participating Lender) notifies the Borrower of the Regulatory Change giving rise to such increases costs or reductions and of the Administrative Agent s or such Lender s or such Participant s intention to claim compensation therefor (except that, if the Regulatory Change giving rise to such increased costs or reductions is retroactive, then the six-month period referred to above shall be extended to include the period of retroactive effect thereof). The Administrative Agent or such Lender or such Participant (through its participating Lender) agrees to furnish to the Borrower (and in the case of a Lender or a Participant, to the Administrative Agent) a certificate setting forth in reasonable detail the basis and amount of each request by the Administrative Agent or such Lender for compensation under this Section. Absent manifest error, determinations by the Administrative Agent or any Lender or any Participant of the effect of any Regulatory Change shall be conclusive, provided that such determinations are made on a reasonable basis and in good faith. 
 76 

Section 1.2 Suspension of SOFR Loans. 
 (a) Anything herein to the contrary notwithstanding, if, on or prior to the determination of Adjusted Daily Simple SOFR or Adjusted Term SOFR for any Interest Period (as applicable) 
 (i) the Administrative Agent reasonably determines (which determination shall be conclusive) that by reason of circumstances affecting the relevant market, adequate and reasonable means do not exist for ascertaining Adjusted Daily Simple SOFR or Adjusted Term SOFR for any Interest Period (as applicable), or 
 (ii) the Administrative Agent reasonably determines (which determination shall be conclusive) that the relevant rates of interest referred to in the definitions of Daily Simple SOFR or Term SOFR upon the basis of which the rate of interest for such Daily Simple SOFR Loans or Term SOFR Loans for an Interest Period is to be determined are not likely to adequately cover the cost to the Requisite Lenders of making or maintaining such SOFR Loans 
 then the Administrative Agent shall give the Borrower and each Lender prompt notice thereof and, so long as such condition remains in effect, the Lenders shall be under no obligation to, and shall not, make additional SOFR Loans, Continue SOFR Loans or Convert Loans into SOFR Loans and the Borrower shall, on the last day of each current Interest Period for each outstanding SOFR Loan, either repay such Loan or Convert such Loan into a Base Rate Loan and if such determination affects the calculation of the Base Rate, the Administrative Agent shall during the period of such suspension compute the Base Rate without reference to clause (iii) of the definition of Base Rate until the Administrative Agent revokes such notice. 
 Section 1.3 Illegality. 
 Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, if any Lender shall reasonably determine (which determination shall be conclusive and binding) that it has become unlawful for such Lender to honor its obligation to make or maintain SOFR Loans hereunder, then such Lender shall promptly notify the Borrower thereof (with a copy to the Administrative Agent) and such Lender s obligation to make or Continue, or to Convert Loans of any other Type into, SOFR Loans shall be suspended until such time as such Lender may again make and maintain SOFR Loans (in which case the provisions of Section 4.6 shall be applicable). 
 Section 1.4 Compensation. 
 The Borrower shall pay to the Administrative Agent for the account of each Lender, within 15 days after the Borrower receives a request for such payment accompanied by the certificate described in the final paragraph of this Section, such amount or amounts as shall be sufficient (in the reasonable opinion of such Lender) to compensate it for any loss, cost or expense that such Lender reasonably determines is attributable to 
 (a) any payment or prepayment (whether mandatory or optional) of (i) a Term SOFR Loan or Conversion of a Term SOFR Loan, made by such Lender for any reason (including, without limitation, acceleration) on a date other than the last day of the Interest Period for such Loan or (ii) a Daily Simple SOFR Loan or Conversion of an Adjusted Daily Simple SOFR Loan, made by such Lender for any reason (including, without limitation, acceleration) on a date other than the applicable interest payment date for such Loan (as set forth in Section 2.5(c)) or 
 77 

(b) any failure by the Borrower for any reason (including, without limitation, the failure of any of the applicable conditions precedent specified in Article VI to be satisfied) to borrow a SOFR Loan from such Lender on the requested date for such borrowing, or to Convert a Base Rate Loan or an Adjusted Daily Simple SOFR Loan into a Term SOFR Loan, or to Convert a Base Rate Loan or Term SOFR Loan into an Adjusted Daily Simple SOFR Loan or Continue a Term SOFR Loan on the requested date of such Conversion or Continuation. 
 Not in limitation of the foregoing, such compensation shall include, without limitation, an amount equal to the then present value of (a) the amount of interest that would have accrued on such SOFR Loan for the remainder of the applicable Interest Period at the rate applicable to such SOFR Loan, less (b) the amount of interest that would accrue on the same SOFR Loan or for the same period if SOFR were set on the date on which such SOFR Loan was repaid, prepaid or Converted or the date on which the Borrower failed to borrow, Convert or Continue such SOFR Loan, calculating present value by using as a discount rate SOFR quoted on such date. Any Lender requesting compensation under this Section shall provide the Borrower with a statement setting forth in reasonable detail the basis for requesting such compensation and the method for determining the amount thereof. Absent manifest error, determinations by any Lender in any such statement shall be conclusive, provided that such determinations are made on a reasonable basis and in good faith. 
 Section 1.5 Affected Lenders and Non-Consenting Lenders. 
 If (a) a Lender requests compensation pursuant to Section 3.12 or 4.1 , and the Requisite Lenders are not also doing the same, or (b) the obligation of any Lender to make SOFR Loans or to Continue Term SOFR Loans, or to Convert Base Rate Loans or Adjusted Daily Simple SOFR Loans into Term SOFR Loans, or to Convert Base Rate Loans or Term SOFR Loans into Daily Simple SOFR Loans, shall be suspended pursuant to Section 4.1(c) , 4.2 or 4.3 but the obligation of the Requisite Lenders shall not have been suspended under such Sections, or (c) a Lender is a Non-Consenting Lender, then, so long as there does not then exist any Default or Event of Default, the Borrower may demand that such Lender (the Affected Lender ), and upon such demand the Affected Lender shall promptly, assign its Revolving Commitment and Loans to an Eligible Assignee (who, in the case of an assignment resulting from a Lender becoming a Non-Consenting Lender, shall have consented to the applicable amendment, waiver or consent) subject to and in accordance with the provisions of Section 13.5(b) for a purchase price equal to the aggregate principal balance of all Loans then owing to the Affected Lender plus any accrued but unpaid interest thereon and accrued but unpaid fees owing to the Affected Lender, or any other amount as may be mutually agreed upon by such Affected Lender and Eligible Assignee. Each of the Administrative Agent and the Affected Lender shall reasonably cooperate in effectuating the replacement of such Affected Lender under this Section, but at no time shall the Administrative Agent, such Affected Lender nor any other Lender be obligated in any way whatsoever to initiate any such replacement or to assist in finding an Eligible Assignee. The exercise by the Borrower of its rights under this Section shall be at the Borrower s sole cost and expense and at no cost or expense to the Administrative Agent, the Affected Lender or any of the other Lenders. The terms of this Section shall not in any way limit the Borrower s obligation to pay to any Affected Lender compensation owing to such Affected Lender pursuant to Section 3.12 or 4.1 with respect to periods up to the date of replacement. 
 Section 1.6 Treatment of Affected Loans. 
 If the obligation of any Lender to make SOFR Loans or to Continue Term SOFR Loans, or to Convert Base Rate Loans or Adjusted Daily Simple SOFR Loans into Term SOFR Loans, or to Convert Base Rate Loans or Term SOFR Loans into Adjusted Daily Simple SOFR Loans shall be suspended pursuant to Section 4.1(c) , 4.2 or 4.3 , then such Lender s SOFR Loans shall 
 78 

be automatically Converted into Base Rate Loans on the last day(s) of the then current Interest Period(s) for SOFR Loans (or, in the case of a Conversion required by Section 4.1(c) or 4.3 , on such earlier date as such Lender may specify to the Borrower with a copy to the Administrative Agent) and, unless and until such Lender gives notice as provided below that the circumstances specified in Section 4.1 or 4.3 that gave rise to such Conversion no longer exist 
 (a) to the extent that such Lender s SOFR Loans have been so Converted, all payments and prepayments of principal that would otherwise be applied to such Lender s SOFR Loans shall be applied instead to its Base Rate Loans and 
 (b) all Loans that would otherwise be made or Continued by such Lender as SOFR Loans shall be made or Continued instead as Base Rate Loans, and all Base Rate Loans of such Lender that would otherwise be Converted into SOFR Loans shall remain as Base Rate Loans. 
 If such Lender gives notice to the Borrower (with a copy to the Administrative Agent) that the circumstances specified in Section 4.1, 4.2 or 4.3 that gave rise to the Conversion of such Lender s SOFR Loans pursuant to this Section no longer exist (which such Lender agrees to do promptly upon such circumstances ceasing to exist) at a time when SOFR Loans made by other Lenders are outstanding, then such Lender s Base Rate Loans shall be automatically Converted, on the first day(s) of the next succeeding Interest Period(s) for such outstanding SOFR Loans, to the extent necessary so that, after giving effect thereto, all Loans held by the Lenders holding SOFR Loans and by such Lender are held pro rata (as to principal amounts, Types and Interest Periods) in accordance with their respective Revolving Commitments.

 Each Lender agrees that it will use reasonable efforts (consistent with legal and regulatory restrictions) to designate an alternate Lending Office with respect to any of its Loans affected by the matters or circumstances described in Section 3.12 , 4.1 or 4.3 to reduce the liability of the Borrower or avoid the results provided thereunder, so long as such designation is not disadvantageous to such Lender as determined by such Lender in its sole discretion, except that such Lender shall have no obligation to designate a Lending Office located in the United States of America. 
 Section 1.8 Assumptions Concerning Funding of SOFR Loans. 
 Calculation of all amounts payable to a Lender under this Article IV shall be made as though such Lender had actually funded SOFR Loans through the purchase of deposits in the relevant market bearing interest at the rate applicable to such SOFR Loans in an amount equal to the amount of the SOFR Loans and having a maturity comparable to the relevant Interest Period provided, however, that each Lender may fund each of its SOFR Loans in any manner it sees fit and the foregoing assumption shall be used only for calculation of amounts payable under this Article IV .

During any Benchmark Unavailability Period or 
 80 

at any time that a tenor for the then-current Benchmark is not an Available Tenor, the component of Base Rate based upon Adjusted Term SOFR (or then-current Benchmark) will not be used in any determination of Base Rate.

 Section 1.8 Resignation or Removal of Administrative Agent. 
 (a) The Administrative Agent may at any time give notice of its resignation to the Lenders and the Borrower.

If no such successor shall have been so appointed by the Requisite Lenders and shall have accepted such appointment within 50 days (the Removal Effective Date ), then such removal shall nonetheless become effective in accordance with such notice on the Removal Effective Date. 
 
 (c) With effect from the Resignation Effective Date or the Removal Effective Date (as applicable) (1) the retiring or removed Administrative Agent shall be discharged from its duties and obligations hereunder and under the other Loan Documents (except that in the case of any collateral security held by the Administrative Agent on behalf of the Lenders or the Administrative Agent (in its capacity as issuer of the Letters of Credit) under any of the Loan Documents, the retiring or removed Administrative Agent shall continue to hold such collateral security until such time as a successor Administrative Agent is appointed) and (2) except for any indemnity payments owed to the retiring or removed Administrative Agent, all payments, communications and determinations provided to be made by, to or through the Administrative Agent shall instead be made by or to each Lender and the Administrative Agent (in its capacity as issuer of the Letters of Credit) directly, until such time, if any, as the Requisite Lenders appoint a successor Administrative Agent as provided for above.

The fees payable by the Borrower to a successor Administrative Agent shall be the same as those payable to its predecessor unless otherwise agreed between the Borrower and such successor. 
 119 

After the retiring or removed Administrative Agent s resignation or removal hereunder and under the other Loan Documents, the provisions of this Article and Sections 13.2 and 13.10 shall continue in effect for the benefit of such retiring or removed Administrative Agent, its sub-agents and their respective related Indemnified Parties in respect of any actions taken or omitted to be taken by any of them while the retiring or removed Administrative Agent was acting as Administrative Agent.

 The Titled Agents, in such capacities, assume no duty, responsibility or obligation hereunder or under any of the other Loan Documents, including, without limitation, for servicing, enforcement or collection of any of the Loans, or for any duties as an agent hereunder for the Lenders. The titles of Lead Arranger and Bookrunner and Syndication Agent are solely honorific and imply no fiduciary responsibility on the part of the Titled Agents to the Administrative Agent, the Borrower, any other Loan Party, or any Lender and the use of such title does not impose on the Titled Agents any duties or obligations greater than those of any other Lender or entitle the Titled Agents to any rights other than those to which any other Lender is entitled. 
 Section 1.10 Collateral Matters. 
 Each of the Lenders irrevocably authorizes the Administrative Agent, at its option and in its discretion, to take any of the following actions 
 (a) to release any Lien on any property granted to or held by the Administrative Agent under any Loan Document, if any, (i) upon termination of the Commitments and payment in full of all Obligations (other than contingent indemnification obligations) and the expiration or termination of all Letters of Credit (other than Letters of Credit as to which other arrangements satisfactory to the Administrative Agent have been made), (ii) if, with respect to any such release of a Lien on the Equity Interests of a Subsidiary Guarantor, such Subsidiary Guarantor has ceased to be a Subsidiary Guarantor and has been released from its Obligations under the Loan Documents pursuant to Sections 8.13 or 8.14 , (iii) if approved, authorized or ratified in writing in accordance with Section 13.6 , or (iv) in connection with the Collateral Fallaway and

 (b) If and to the extent that any of the Loan Parties shall fail to make any payment with respect to any of the Obligations as and when due or to perform any of the 
 140 

Obligations in accordance with the terms thereof, then in each such event the other Loan Parties will make such payment with respect to, or perform, such Obligation. 
 (c) The Obligations of each of the Loan Parties under the provisions of this Section 13.19 constitute full recourse obligations of each such Loan Party enforceable against each such Loan Party to the full extent of its properties and assets.

Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, each of the Loan Parties assents to any other action or delay in acting or failure to act on the part of the Administrative Agent or any Lender with respect to the failure by any of the Loan Parties to comply with any of its respective Obligations, including any failure strictly or diligently to assert any right or to pursue any remedy or to comply fully with Applicable Laws thereunder, which might, but for the provisions of this Section 13.19 , afford grounds for terminating, discharging or relieving any Loan Party, in whole or in part, from any of its Obligations under this Section 13.19 , it being the intention of each of the Loan Parties that, so long as any of the Obligations hereunder remain unsatisfied, the Obligations of such Loan Parties under this Section 13.19 shall not be discharged except by performance and then only to the extent of such performance.

 (e) To the extent any Loan Party makes a payment hereunder in excess of the aggregate amount of the benefit received by such Loan Party in respect of the extensions of credit under this Agreement (the Benefit Amount ), then such Loan Party, after the irrevocable payment in full of all of the Obligations, shall be entitled to recover from each other Loan Party such excess payment, pro rata, in accordance with the ratio of the Benefit Amount received by each such other Loan Party to the total Benefit Amount received by all the Loan Parties, and the right to such recovery shall be deemed to be an asset and property of such Loan Party so funding

Any claim which any Loan Party may have against any other Loan Party with respect to any payments to the Administrative Agent or any Lender hereunder or under any other Loan Document are hereby expressly made subordinate and junior in right of payment, without limitation as to any increases in the Obligations arising hereunder or thereunder, to the prior irrevocable payment in full of the Obligations and, in the event of any insolvency, bankruptcy, receivership, liquidation, reorganization or other similar proceeding under the laws of any jurisdiction relating to any Loan Party, its debts or its assets, whether voluntary or involuntary, all such Obligations shall be irrevocably paid in full before any payment or distribution of any character, whether in cash, securities or other property, shall be made to any other Loan Party therefor. 
 (f) Each of the Loan Parties hereby agrees that the payment of any amounts due with respect to the indebtedness owing by any Loan Party to any other Loan Party is hereby subordinated to the prior irrevocable payment in full of the Obligations. Each Loan Party hereby agrees that after the occurrences and during the continuance of any Default or Event of Default, such Loan Party will not demand, sue for or otherwise attempt to collect any indebtedness of any other Loan Party owing to such Loan Party until the Obligations shall have been irrevocably paid in full.

 (i) a reduction in full or in part or cancellation of any such liability 
 (ii) a conversion of all, or a portion of, such liability into shares or other instruments of ownership in such Affected Financial Institution, its parent undertaking, or a bridge institution that may be issued to it or otherwise conferred on it, and that such shares or other instruments of ownership will be accepted by it in lieu of any rights with respect to any such liability under this Agreement or any other Loan Document or 
 142 

(iii) the variation of the terms of such liability in connection with the exercise of the write-down and conversion powers of the applicable Resolution Authority.

 (b) Deemed Assignment of Outstanding Loans and Commitments . In order to facilitate the amendment and restatement of the Existing Credit Agreement, the Administrative Agent and the Lenders, simultaneously with the Effective Date, hereby agree that the Commitments and outstanding principal amount of the Term Loans shall be as set forth in Schedule 1.1 and the portion of Loans and other amounts outstanding under (and as defined in) the Existing Credit Agreement shall, solely to the extent necessary after taking into account any additional Term Loans to be made on the Effective Date, be reallocated in accordance with such Commitments and outstanding Term Loans and the requisite assignments shall be deemed to be made in such amounts by and between the Lenders and from each applicable Lender under (and as defined in) the Existing Credit Agreement to each other applicable Lender hereunder, with the same force and effect as if such assignments were evidenced by applicable assignment agreements required pursuant to Section 13.5 of the Existing Credit Agreement. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in Section 13.5 of the Existing Credit Agreement or Section 13.5 of this Agreement, no other consents, documents, or instruments, including any assignment agreements, shall be executed in connection with these assignments (all of which requirements are hereby waived), and such assignments shall be deemed to be made with all applicable representations, warranties and covenants as if evidenced by an assignment agreement. On the Effective Date, and notwithstanding anything to the contrary in Section 3.2 of the Existing Credit Agreement or Section 3.2 of this Agreement, the applicable Lenders shall make full cash settlement with each other on the Effective Date through the Administrative Agent (or with each other directly, with the approval of the Administrative Agent), as the Administrative Agent may direct or approve, with respect to all assignments, reallocations and other changes in Commitments (as such term is defined in the Existing Credit Agreement) and outstanding Term Loans such that after giving effect to such settlements each Lender s Commitment Percentages and outstanding Term Loans shall be as set forth on Schedule 1.1 . 
 (c) NO NOVATION . THE PARTIES HERETO HAVE ENTERED INTO THIS AGREEMENT SOLELY TO AMEND AND RESTATE THE TERMS OF, AND THE OBLIGATIONS OWING UNDER AND IN CONNECTION WITH, THE EXISTING CREDIT AGREEMENT.

 143 

Section 1.22 Non-Recourse to NSA REIT . 
 This Agreement and the Obligations of the Borrower hereunder and under the other Loan Documents are fully recourse to the Borrower and the Subsidiary Guarantors. The parties hereto acknowledge and agree that, notwithstanding the inclusion of NSA REIT as a Loan Party for certain purposes of this Agreement, NSA REIT is not a guarantor of the Obligations of the Borrower. Notwithstanding any applicable law that would make the owner of a partnership or general partner liable for the debts and obligations of the partnership, nothing contained herein or in the Loan Documents shall be construed to create or impose upon NSA REIT (in its capacity as such), any obligation with respect to the repayment of Indebtedness hereunder provided that nothing contained in this Section 13.22 shall be deemed to (i) release the Borrower or any Guarantor from any liability pursuant to, or from any of its obligations under, this Agreement or the other Loan Documents to which it is a party, (ii) constitute a waiver of any Obligation arising under this Agreement or any of the other Loan Documents, (iii) limit the rights of the Administrative Agent or any of the Lenders to pursue any right or remedy or any judgment against, or proceed against or realize upon the assets of, the Borrower or any Subsidiary Guarantor or (iv) release NSA REIT, in its capacity as the general partner of the Borrower, from any Obligations other than the obligation to repay the Indebtedness hereunder, or release NSA REIT from any personal liability for the failure of NSA REIT, including in its capacity as the general partner of the Borrower, to satisfy and comply with all of the covenants and agreements (x) of NSA REIT set forth in this Agreement or (y) in its capacity as the general partner of the Borrower, of the Borrower set forth in this Agreement. In addition, (i) NSA REIT shall be fully liable to the Administrative Agent and the Lenders to the same extent that NSA REIT would be liable absent the foregoing provisions of this Section 13.22 for fraud or willful misrepresentation by the Borrower, NSA REIT or any of their respective Subsidiaries in connection with any Loan, any Letter of Credit or any of the other Obligations or any Loan Documents (to the full extent of losses suffered by the Administrative Agent or any Lender by reason of such fraud or willful misrepresentation) and (ii) nothing in this Section 13.22 shall be deemed to be a waiver of any right which the Administrative Agent may have under 506(a), 506(b), 1111(b) or any other provision of the Bankruptcy Code or any successor thereto or similar provisions under applicable state law to file a claim against the Borrower or any of the Subsidiary Guarantors for the full amount of the Obligations. For the avoidance of doubt, the obligations of the Borrower herein to cause NSA REIT to comply with the provisions hereof or to do or refrain from doing or taking certain actions as set forth herein will not be construed to depend upon the Borrower s ability to do so or upon any actual control of NSA REIT by the Borrower and it shall not be a defense to any failure by the Borrower to comply with such obligations that the Borrower did not actually control NSA REIT. 
 Section 1.23 Acknowledgement Regarding Any Supported QFCs . 
 To the extent that the Loan Documents provide support, through a guarantee or otherwise, for Derivatives Contracts or any other agreement or instrument that is a QFC (such support QFC Credit Support and each such QFC a Supported QFC ), the parties acknowledge and agree as follows with respect to the resolution power of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation under the Federal Deposit Insurance Act and Title II of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (together with the regulations promulgated thereunder, the U.S. Special Resolution Regimes in respect of such Supported QFC and QFC Credit Support (with the provisions below applicable notwithstanding that the Loan Documents and any Supported QFC may in fact be stated to be governed by the laws of the State of New York and or of the United States or any other state of the United States) 
 In the event a Covered Entity that is party to a Supported QFC (each, a Covered Party becomes subject to a proceeding under a U.S. Special Resolution Regime, the transfer of 
 144 

such Supported QFC and the benefit of such QFC Credit Support (and any interest and obligation in or under such Supported QFC and such QFC Credit Support, and any rights in property securing such Supported QFC or such QFC Credit Support) from such Covered Party will be effective to the same extent as the transfer would be effective under the U.S. Special Resolution Regime if the Supported QFC and such QFC Credit Support (and any such interest, obligation and rights in property) were governed by the laws of the United States or a state of the United States. In the event a Covered Party or a BHC Act Affiliate of a Covered Party becomes subject to a proceeding under a U.S. Special Resolution Regime, Default Rights under the Loan Documents that might otherwise apply to such Supported QFC or any QFC Credit Support that may be exercised against such Covered Party are permitted to be exercised to no greater extent than such Default Rights could be exercised under the U.S. Special Resolution Regime if the Supported QFC and the Loan Documents were governed by the laws of the United States or a state of the United States. Without limitation of the foregoing, it is understood and agreed that rights and remedies of the parties with respect to a Defaulting Lender shall in no event affect the rights of any Covered Party with respect to a Supported QFC or any QFC Credit Support.
