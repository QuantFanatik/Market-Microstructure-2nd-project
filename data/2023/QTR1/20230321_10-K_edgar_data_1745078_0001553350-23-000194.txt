have historically been our principal sources for acquiring new customers. In the case of paid advertising, we use both internal (managed
by us) and external (managed through affiliates or partner advertisers) advertising accounts.

Our Lifestyle
Blueprint is digitally delivered by us. We have engaged Argo Marketing Group, Inc. to provide customer relations services for us in connection
with sales of our products. Under the terms of the agreement entered into in November 2015, Argo Marketing Group, Inc. is responsible
for all customer service call handling, email management, and chargeback management. We agreed to pay the company various initial and
additional set up fees, customer services fees tiered to the weekly minutes, per transaction fees for email resolutions or return processing
and chargeback management, among other fees. The initial term of the agreement was for one year, with automatic one-year renewals unless
either party provides a 30 day written notice of non-renewal. The agreement may be terminated by Argo Marketing Group, Inc. for non-payment,
in the event of our bankruptcy or insolvency and by either party upon a breach or without cause. Mr. Mannine, our chief executive officer,
has personally guaranteed our obligations under this agreement. 

We do not manufacture the private
label nutritional supplements we sell. These nutritional supplements are manufactured on a per order basis for us by Food Science 
Corporation, a 40- year old Vermont-based family-owned company focused on nutritional research and product development. We utilize the
services of a third-party fulfillment company to ship the nutritional supplements to our customers, and pay this provider an order and
per item fee. 

We believe our relationships with
our supplement supplier and the third party providers we utilize for fulfillment and customer service are good. However, while we believe
we can replace the third party providers for fulfillment and customer service with comparable companies at similar costs to us, a disruption
in the relationship with our supplement supplier would materially impact our business until such time as we were able to establish a relationship
with an alternative supplier. 

We terminated our relationship with
Argo Marketing Group, Inc. after third quarter 2020.

Cost o f revenue de c re a sed
 3,270 , or 10.07 , to 29,197 in 2022 compared to 32,467
 in 20 21 . Our cost of revenue includes the cost of the supplements we sell as well as
shipping and handling costs for shipments to customers, merchant processing fees, call center support, and order processing. The increase
in cost of revenues as a percent of revenues is due to the decline in revenue across all product lines and subscriptions. 

Selling, general and administrative expenses decreased 2,690, or 1.15 , to 232,100 in 2022 from 234,790 in 2021. The
decrease in SG A is principally attributable to decreases in consulting and accounting expenses, legal
expenses, office expenses and general expenses.

The reduction in total current

an increase in notes payable, accounts payable, and accrued expenses. We do not have any capital commitments and do not have any external
sources of working capital available.

The COVID-19 pandemic
has materially and adversely impacted the U.S. economy and financial markets, with legislative and regulatory responses including unprecedented
monetary and fiscal policy actions across all sectors, and there is significant uncertainty as to timing of stabilization and recovery.
The extent of the COVID-19 impacts will depend on future actions and outcomes, which are highly uncertain and cannot be predicted with
confidence, including the scope, severity and duration of the outbreak, the short-term and long-term economic impact of the outbreak (including
the effect on advertising activity, consumer discretionary spending and our employees), and the actions taken to mitigate the impact of
the virus, and the pace of economic and financial market recovery when the COVID-19 pandemic subsides, among others. 

We have experienced recurring
operating losses and negative operating cash flows, and have financed our recent working capital requirements primarily through the issuance
of notes payable. During the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, we have reported net losses of 273,624 and 271,581, respectively.
As of December 31, 2022, our working capital was a deficit of 635,489, our accumulated deficit was 2,260,901, and we had negative cash
flows from operations of 123,693 These factors, among others, raise substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern.
Our Financial Statements do not include any adjustments that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty. The accompanying Financial
Statements have been prepared on a going concern basis, which contemplates the realization of assets and the satisfaction of liabilities
in the normal course of business. There are no assurances we will be successful in our efforts to report profitable operations or to continue
as a going concern, in which event investors would lose their entire investment in our company. 

Our ability to continue
to grow our business is dependent upon our ability to raise additional sufficient capital to fund our operating expenses, including advertising,
until such time, if ever, that we are able to report profitable operations, as well as for our short-term and long-term growth plans.
We do not generate operating income and we are presently relying on cash we receive from the holdback receivable to pay our operating
expenses. Our management estimates that we require approximately 5,500,000 in additional working capital during the next 12 months in
order to meet our current business objectives, including the development of new indicators for our Lifestyle Blueprint platform, the addition
of print versions of our DWD Protocol, expanding our supplement product line and additional subscription content offerings for our customers.
This additional working capital is also necessary to fund increases in our advertising and marketing costs, costs associated with the
development of additional infrastructure to support our expected growth, as well as funds to pay our operating expenses and general working
capital. We currently do not have any firm commitments to provide any additional capital to us. There are no assurances we will be successful
in securing the additional capital necessary to grow our company and pay our operating expenses. Any delay in raising sufficient funds
could adversely impact our ability to continue to increase our revenues in future periods. In addition, if we are unable to raise the
necessary additional working capital, we may be forced to reduce certain operating expenses in an effort to conserve our working capital
which will adversely impact our revenues and results of operations in future periods and there are no assurances we could continue as
a going concern.

The increase in cash used in our operating activities in 2022 as compared
to 2021 is due to an increase in net loss and courtesy PPP loan credit offset by increases in accounts payable and capital contribution
from the CEO and a decrease in the holdback receivable and prepaid expenses.

Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates 

Our financial statements have been prepared in conformity with U.S. GAAP
and are based upon certain critical accounting policies. These policies may require management to make estimates, judgments and assumptions
that we believe are reasonable based on our historical experience, contract terms, observance of known trends in our Company and the industry
as a whole, and information available from other outside sources. Our estimates affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities
and related disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue
and expense during the reporting period. Actual results may differ from those initial estimates. Our significant accounting policies are
more fully described in Note 3 of the Financial Statements. 

Revenue recognition Our product revenues are generated
through online channels, in which customers provide their credit and/or debit cards for processing payments to purchase our products and
services. The credit cards go through various checks and balances to ensure these are valid charges. We use our judgment in various ways
including: that the payment is valid if it is approved by the various credible checks in place by the online banking systems, we have
engaged with to complete each transaction. In some cases, the banking partners in place will address charges as invalid or fraudulent,
due to a lost credit card, or related, and can redress payments issued for up to 12 months or longer. These adjustments are typically
done via chargebacks. Every transaction is tracked, but we are unable to ever completely verify a valid transaction. Beyond that, there
are also estimated elements of when a consumer changes their mind on sale transactions, and leveraging their banking relationships
to chargeback the transaction. (Also known as friendly fraud in the space.) In addition to these elements and judgements, there is the
case of all of our products having a 60-day money back guarantee. In some cases, customers will take advantage of this system to use our
digital services and products for 1-59 days, then decide to request a refund. As these and future events and their effects of these revenue-impacting
elements cannot be determined with complete precision, actual results could differ from these estimates and assumptions, and those differences
could be material to the Financial Statements. 

Holdback Receivables Since a primary source of our
income is generated through online channels, in which a merchant account and merchant bank relationship is developed, we naturally must
account for holdback receivables. These merchant banks require holdbacks, based on the level of risk associated to a specific
business or merchant account. In our case, to ensure we can continue processing credit/debit card sales online, our merchant bank requires
they holdback a percentage of that receivable money as a guarantee. The money they hold back is held in their accounts as a reserve. 
They are able to hold a percentage of our monies based on our receivables. We use our judgment in various ways including: we believe the
merchant bank will honor their agreement, and release funds based on what is agreed upon in our merchant agreement. We also believe they
will continue to operate as expected, and allow us to process sales and transactions accordingly. We also expect our partner merchant
bank to be truthful and honorable should we close our accounts and request our monies to be released, in which they are able to hold those
funds for upwards of 12 months to cover refunds, chargebacks, and related processing fees. As these and future events and their effects
of these holdback receivable elements cannot be determined with complete precision, actual results could differ from these estimates and
assumptions, and those differences could be material to the Financial Statements. 

Income Taxes The provision for income taxes includes federal,
state, local and foreign taxes. Income taxes are accounted for under the liability method. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized
for the estimated future tax consequences of temporary differences between the financial statement carrying amounts and their respective
tax bases. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the year in
which the temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled. We evaluate the realizability of our deferred tax assets and
establish a valuation allowance when it is more likely than not that all or a portion of deferred tax assets will not be realized.

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT
REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM 

To the Board of Directors and 
Stockholders of Vynleads, Inc. 

Opinion on the Financial Statements 

We have audited the accompanying balance sheets of
Vynleads, Inc. (the Company) as of December 31, 2022, and the related statements of operations, stockholders deficit, and cash
flows for the year then ended December 31, 2022, and the related notes (collectively referred to as the financial statements). In our
opinion, the financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of December 31, 2022,
and the results of its operations and its cash flows for the year then ended December 31, 2022, in conformity with accounting principles
generally accepted in the United States of America. 

Explanatory Paragraph Going Concern 

The accompanying financial statements have been prepared
assuming that the Company will continue as a going concern. As discussed in Note 2 to the financial statements, the Company has experienced
recurring operating losses since inception and negative cash flows from operations and has financed its recent working capital requirements
primarily through the issuance of debt. These factors raise substantial doubt about the Company's ability to continue as a going concern.
Management s plans in regard to these matters are described in Note 2. The financial statements do not include any adjustments that
might result from the outcome of this uncertainty. 

Basis for Opinion 

These financial statements are the responsibility
of the Company s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company s financial statements based on our
audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB) and are
required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and
regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. 

We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards
of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements
are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. The Company is not required to have, nor were we engaged to perform,
an audit of its internal control over financial reporting. As part of our audits, we are required to obtain an understanding of internal
control over financial reporting, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Company s internal
control over financial reporting. Accordingly, we express no such opinion. 

Our audits included performing procedures to assess
the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond
to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements.
Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating
the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion. 

Critical Audit Matters 

The critical audit matters to be communicated are matters arising from the current period audit of the financial statements that were communicated or required to be
communicated to the audit committee and that: (1) relate to accounts or disclosures that are material to the financial statements
and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. 

We did not identify critical audit matters that need
to be communicated. 

We have served as the Company s auditor since 2022.

On May 21, 2018, we entered into an Amended and Restated Strategic Financing
 Corporate Development Agreement with CRG which was amended and restated an earlier agreement entered into in October 2017. We have
engaged this company to serve as our non-exclusive strategic financing and corporate development services provider and to render certain
advice and services to us as we may reasonably request concerning equity or debt financings, strategic planning, merger and acquisition
possibilities, and business development activities. The scope of services under this agreement also includes introducing us to one or
more non-U.S. persons, as that term is defined in Regulation S under the Securities Act, in connection with possible debt or equity financings
or potential lenders. The initial term of the agreement expired in May 2019, but pursuant to the terms of the agreement, renews automatically
for one-year periods unless notice of non-renewal is provided by either party at least 30 days prior to the renewal term commencement.
The agreement was renewed until May 2023.
