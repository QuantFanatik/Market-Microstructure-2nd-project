our
 success in retaining or recruiting, or changes required in, our officers, key employees or
 directors following our initial business combination; 

our
 officers and directors allocating their time to other businesses and potentially having conflicts

the
 ability of our officers and directors to generate a number of potential acquisition opportunities; 

our
 pool of prospective target businesses; 

the
 ability of our officers and directors to generate a number of potential acquisition opportunities;

 use of proceeds not held in the trust account or available to us from interest income on
 the trust account balance; or 

our
 financial performance. 

The
forward-looking statements contained in this Report are based on our current expectations and beliefs concerning future developments
and their potential effects on us. Future developments affecting us may not be those that we have anticipated. These forward-looking
statements involve a number of risks, uncertainties (some of which are beyond our control) or other assumptions that may cause actual
results or performance to be materially different from those expressed or implied by these forward-looking statements. Should one or
more of these risks or uncertainties materialize, or should any of our assumptions prove incorrect, actual results may vary in material
respects from those projected in these forward-looking statements. We undertake no obligation to update or revise any forward-looking
statements, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise, except as may be required under applicable securities
laws.

PART I 

Item 1. Business. 

Overview 

We are a blank check company incorporated
on December 6, 2021, as a Cayman Islands exempted company, for the purpose of effecting a merger, share exchange, asset acquisition, share
purchase, reorganization or other similar business combination with one or more businesses or entities, which we refer to throughout this
prospectus as our initial business combination. To date, our efforts have been limited to organizational activities as well as activities
related to this offering. None of our officers, directors, promoters or other affiliates have engaged in any substantive discussions on
our behalf with representatives of other companies regarding the possibility of a potential merger, capital share exchange, asset acquisition
or other similar business combination with us. 

While we may pursue an acquisition
opportunity in any business, industry, sector or geographical location, we intend to focus our search on new emerging technology companies
with an acute growth potential in Southeast Asia, Australia and New Zealand in sectors such as the Web 3.0, blockchain, cryptocurrency,
digital ledger, e-gaming and other new financial technology and services sectors. 

Initial Public Offering 

On April 18, 2022 we consummated
our initial public offering of 11,500,000 units, including the underwriters over-allotment option of an additional 1,500,000 units. Each
unit consists of one Class A ordinary share of the Company, par value 0.0001 per share, and one redeemable warrant of the Company,
with each warrant entitling the holder thereof to purchase one Class A Ordinary share for 11.50 per share. The units were sold at
a price of 10.00 per unit, generating gross proceeds to the Company of 115,000,000. 

Simultaneously with the closing
of the initial public offering, we completed the private sale of an aggregate of 5,000,000 Private Placement Warrants at a price of 1.00
per Private Placement Warrant in a private placement to the Sponsor generating gross proceeds to the Company in the amount of 5,000,000. 

It is the job of our sponsor and
management team to complete our initial business combination. Our management team is led by our Chairman of the Board and Co-Chief Executive
Officer, Tristan Lo, and our Co-Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, David Andrada, who are well positioned to take advantage
of the growing set of acquisition opportunities focused on healthcare and technology and that our contacts and relationships, ranging
from owners and management teams of private and public companies, private equity funds, investment bankers, attorneys, to accountants
and business brokers will allow us to generate an attractive transaction for our shareholders. We will have only 15 months from the closing
of the IPO, or July 18, 2023, to consummate an initial business combination. However, if we anticipate that we may not be able to consummate
our initial business combination within 15 months, we may, by resolution of our board if requested by our sponsor, extend the period of
time to consummate a business combination up to two times, each by an additional three months (for a total of up to 21 months, or until
January 18, 2024, to complete a business combination), subject to the sponsor depositing additional funds into the trust account as set
out below. If our initial business combination is not consummated by July 18, 2023 (or until January 18, 2024 if we extend the period
of time to consummate a business combination), then our existence will terminate, and we will distribute all amounts in the trust account. 

Business Strategy and Competitive Strengths 

Our business strategy is
to identify and complete our initial business combination with a company that our management and board believes has compelling
potential for value creation. Given the reputation, experience and track record of our management team and board of directors, we
believe the company is well-positioned to identify unique opportunities within our targeted sectors. Our selection process will
leverage our relationships and involve blockchain development firms and protocols, angel investors, venture capitalists, private
equity and growth equity funds, as well as the deep network within the financial technology industry of our team and board of
directors, which we believe should provide us with a key competitive advantage in sourcing potential business combination
targets. 

1 

Specifically, we believe that
our unique ability to source and attract business combination targets comes from our position as a SPAC primarily focused on new financial
services technology and our management team s: 

Deep and global base of relationships among the leading industry venture capital firms, executives, press, and bankers. 

Unique collection of deal-sourcing assets, direct investments, advisory work and community building assets. 

Track record of leading, managing or supporting investments in companies to accelerate their growth and maturation, including venture-based investments led by our team. 

Deep and prolific experience in helping private companies prepare and manage the transition to the public markets. 

Demonstrated ability to develop and grow companies, both organically and through strategic transactions and acquisitions, and expanding the product range and geographic footprint of a number of target businesses. 

Numerous other examples can be
drawn from our management team s many combined years of business specific to the Asia Pacific (specifically Southeast Asian and
Australia) region. 

Business Combination Criteria 

Consistent with our business
strategy, we have identified the following general criteria and guidelines that we believe are important in evaluating prospective target
businesses. We plan to use these criteria and guidelines in evaluating initial business combination opportunities, but we may decide to
consummate our initial business combination with a target business that does not meet one or more of these criteria and guidelines. We
intend to seek to acquire companies within industries that exhibit strong characteristics including, but not limited to, the following: 

significant established market position and domestic and international expansion potential, 

its own solid technological base or access to a stable, capable outside supplier, 

capability and commitment to full financial markets regulation and SEC compliance, and 

a motivated and capable management team. 

While we may pursue an
initial business combination opportunity in any business, industry, sector or geographic region, we intend to focus on the
acquisition of new emerging technology company with a significant Web 3.0, blockchain, cryptocurrency, digital ledger, e-gaming and
other new financial technology and services application. We view our most attractive emerging cryptocurrency markets as Southeast
Asia (such as Singapore, Indonesia, Vietnam, Thailand, Malaysia and the Philippines), Australia, and New Zealand. We will not pursue
any target nor consummate an initial business combination with any entity that is incorporated, organized or has its principal
business operations in China, Hong Kong or Macau. 

These criteria and guidelines are not intended to be exhaustive. Any evaluation relating to the merits
of a particular initial business combination may be based, to the extent relevant, on these general criteria and guidelines as well as
other considerations, factors and criteria that our management may deem relevant. In the event that we decide to enter into an initial
business combination with a target business that does not meet the above criteria and guidelines, we will disclose that the target business
does not meet the above criteria and guidelines in our shareholder communications related to our initial business, which, as discussed
in this prospectus, would be in the form of proxy solicitation or tender offer materials, as applicable, that we would file with the SEC. 

2 

Initial Business Combination 

Nasdaq rules require that
we must complete one or more business combinations having an aggregate fair market value of at least 80 of the value of the assets held
in the trust account (excluding the deferred underwriting commissions and taxes payable on the interest earned on the trust account) at
the time of our signing a definitive agreement in connection with our initial business combination. Our board of directors will make the
determination as to the fair market value of our initial business combination. If our board of directors is not able to independently
determine the fair market value of our initial business combination, we will obtain an opinion from an independent investment banking
firm or another independent entity that commonly renders valuation opinions with respect to the satisfaction of such criteria. While we
consider it unlikely that our board of directors will not be able to make an independent determination of the fair market value of our
initial business combination, it may be unable to do so if it is less familiar or experienced with the business of a particular target
or if there is a significant amount of uncertainty as to the value of a target s assets or prospects. Additionally, pursuant to
Nasdaq rules, any initial business combination must be approved by a majority of our independent directors. 

We anticipate structuring our
initial business combination so that the post-transaction company in which our public shareholders own shares will own or acquire 100 
of the equity interests or assets of the target business or businesses. We may, however, structure our initial business combination such
that the post-transaction company owns or acquires less than 100 of such interests or assets of the target business in order to meet
certain objectives of the prior owners of the target business, the target management team or shareholders or for other reasons, but we
will only complete such business combination if the post-transaction company owns or acquires 50 or more of the outstanding voting securities
of the target or otherwise acquires a controlling interest in the target sufficient for it not to be required to register as an investment
company under the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended (the Investment Company Act ). Even if the post-transaction
company owns or acquires 50 or more of the voting securities of the target, our shareholders prior to the business combination may collectively
own a minority interest in the post-transaction company, depending on valuations ascribed to the target and us in the business combination
transaction. For example, we could pursue a transaction in which we issue a substantial number of new shares in exchange for all of the
outstanding capital stock, shares or other equity interests of a target. In this case, we would acquire a 100 controlling interest in
the target. However, as a result of the issuance of a substantial number of new shares, our shareholders immediately prior to our initial
business combination could own less than a majority of our issued and outstanding shares subsequent to our initial business combination.
If less than 100 of the equity interests or assets of a target business or businesses are owned or acquired by the post-transaction company,
the portion of such business or businesses that is owned or acquired is what will be valued for purposes of the 80 of net assets test.
If the business combination involves more than one target business, the 80 of net assets test will be based on the aggregate value of
all of the target businesses, and we will treat the target businesses together as our initial business combination for purposes of a tender
offer or for seeking shareholder approval, as applicable. 

Our Business Combination Process 

In evaluating a prospective target
business, we expect to conduct a thorough due diligence review that will encompass, among other things, meetings with incumbent management
and employees, document reviews, interviews of customers and suppliers, inspection of facilities, as well as reviewing financial and other
information that will be made available to us. We will also utilize our operational and capital allocation experience. 

Our acquisition criteria, due
diligence processes and value creation methods are not intended to be exhaustive. Any evaluation relating to the merits of a particular
initial business combination may be based, to the extent relevant, on these general guidelines as well as other considerations, factors
and criteria that our management may deem relevant. In the event that we decide to enter into our initial business combination with a
target business that does not meet the above criteria and guidelines, we will disclose that the target business does not meet the above
criteria in our shareholder communications related to our initial business combination, which would be in the form of tender offer documents
or proxy solicitation materials that we would file with the SEC. 

Sourcing of Potential Business Combination
Targets 

We believe that the operational
and transactional experience of our management team and our sponsor and their respective affiliates and related entities and the relationships
they have developed as a result of such experience, will provide us with a substantial number of potential business combination targets.
These individuals and entities have developed a broad network of contacts and corporate relationships around the world. This network has
grown through sourcing, acquiring and financing businesses and maintaining relationships with sellers, financing sources and target management
teams. Our management team and members of our sponsor and their respective affiliates and related entities have significant experience
in executing transactions under varying economic and financial market conditions. We believe that these networks of relationships and
this experience will provide us with important sources of investment opportunities. In addition, we anticipate that target business candidates
may be brought to our attention from various unaffiliated sources, including investment market participants, private equity funds and
large business enterprises seeking to divest noncore assets or divisions. 

3 

We are not prohibited from pursuing
an initial business combination with a business combination target that is affiliated with our sponsor, officers or directors (or their
respective affiliates or related entities) or making the acquisition through a joint venture or other form of shared ownership with our
sponsor, officers or directors (or their respective affiliates or related entities). In the event we seek to complete our initial business
combination with a company that is affiliated with our sponsor, officers or directors (or their respective affiliates or related entities),
we, or a committee of independent directors, will obtain an opinion from an independent investment banking firm or another independent
firm that commonly renders valuation opinions for the type of company we are seeking to acquire or an independent accounting firm that
our initial business combination is fair to our company from a financial point of view. We are not required to obtain such an opinion
in any other context. As more fully discussed in our Registration Statement if any of our officers or directors becomes aware of a business
combination opportunity that falls within the line of business of any entity to which he or she has then-current fiduciary or contractual
obligations, he or she may be required to present such business combination opportunity to such entity prior to presenting such business
combination opportunity to us, subject to his or her fiduciary duties under Cayman Islands law. Our officers and directors currently have
certain relevant fiduciary duties or contractual obligations that may take priority over their duties to us. 

Status as a Public Company 

We believe our structure
will make us an attractive business combination partner to target businesses. As a public company, we offer a target business an
alternative to the traditional initial public offering through a merger or other business combination with us. Following an initial
business combination, we believe the target business would have greater access to capital and additional means of creating
management incentives that are better aligned with shareholders interests than it would as a private company. A target
business can further benefit by augmenting its profile among potential new customers and vendors and aid in attracting talented
employees. In a business combination transaction with us, the owners of the target business may, for example, exchange their shares
of stock in the target business for our shares of Class A ordinary share (or shares of a new holding company) or for a
combination of our shares of Class A ordinary share and cash, allowing us to tailor the consideration to the specific needs of
the sellers. 

Although there are various costs
and obligations associated with being a public company, we believe target businesses will find this method a more expeditious and cost-effective
method to becoming a public company than the typical initial public offering. The typical initial public offering process takes a significantly
longer period of time than the typical business combination transaction process, and there are significant expenses in the initial public
offering process, including underwriting discounts and commissions, marketing and road show efforts that may not be present to the same
extent in connection with an initial business combination with us. 

Furthermore, once a proposed initial
business combination is completed, the target business will have effectively become public, whereas an initial public offering is always
subject to the underwriters ability to complete the offering, as well as general market conditions, which could delay or prevent
the offering from occurring or could have negative valuation consequences. Following an initial business combination, we believe the target
business would then have greater access to capital and an additional means of providing management incentives consistent with shareholders 
interests and the ability to use its shares as currency for acquisitions. Being a public company can offer further benefits by augmenting
a company s profile among potential new customers and vendors and aid in attracting talented employees. 

While we believe that our structure
and our management team s backgrounds will make us an attractive business partner, some potential target businesses may view our
status as a blank check company, such as our lack of an operating history and our ability to seek shareholder approval of any proposed
initial business combination, negatively. 

We are an emerging growth
company, as defined in Section 2(a) of the Securities Act, as modified by the JOBS Act. As such, we are eligible to take
advantage of certain exemptions from various reporting requirements that are applicable to other public companies that are not emerging
growth companies including, but not limited to, not being required to comply with the independent registered public accounting
firm attestation requirements of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, reduced disclosure obligations regarding executive compensation
in our periodic reports and proxy statements, and exemptions from the requirements of holding a non-binding advisory vote on executive
compensation and shareholder approval of any golden parachute payments not previously approved. If some investors find our securities
less attractive as a result, there may be a less active trading market for our securities and the prices of our securities may be more
volatile. 

In addition, Section 107
of the JOBS Act also provides that an emerging growth company can take advantage of the extended transition period provided
in Section 7(a)(2)(B) of the Securities Act for complying with new or revised accounting standards. In other words, an emerging
growth company can delay the adoption of certain accounting standards until those standards would otherwise apply to private companies.
We intend to take advantage of the benefits of this extended transition period. 

4 

We will remain an emerging growth
company until the earlier of (1) the last day of the fiscal year (a) following April 18, 2027 the fifth anniversary of
the completion of our initial public offering, (b) in which we have total annual gross revenue of at least 1.235 billion, or (c) in
which we are deemed to be a large accelerated filer, which means the market value of our Class A ordinary share that is held by non-affiliates
exceeds 700 million as of the prior June 30 th , and (2) the date on which we have issued more than 1.0 billion in
non-convertible debt securities during the prior three-year period. 

Additionally, we are a
 smaller reporting company as defined in Rule 10(f)(1) of Regulation S-K. Smaller reporting companies may
take advantage of certain reduced disclosure obligations, including, among other things, providing only two years of audited
financial statements. We will remain a smaller reporting company until the last day of the fiscal year in which (1) the
market value of our ordinary share held by non-affiliates equals or exceeds 250 million as of the end of the prior
June 30 th , or (2) our annual revenues equaled or exceeded 100 million during such completed fiscal year
and the market value of our ordinary share held by non-affiliates exceeds 700 million as of the prior
June 30 th . 

Financial Position 

With funds available for an initial
business combination in the amount of 118,785,342 as of November 30, 2022, we offer a target business a variety of options such as creating
a liquidity event for its owners, providing capital for the potential growth and expansion of its operations or strengthening its balance
sheet by reducing its debt or leverage ratio. Because we are able to complete our initial business combination using our cash, debt or
equity securities, or a combination of the foregoing, we have the flexibility to use the most efficient combination that will allow us
to tailor the consideration to be paid to the target business to fit its needs and desires. However, we have not taken any steps to secure
third party financing and there can be no assurance it will be available to us. 

Effecting Our Initial Business Combination 

We are not presently engaged in,
and we will not engage in, any operations other than the pursuit of our initial business combination, for an indefinite period of time.
We intend to effectuate our initial business combination using cash from the proceeds of our initial public offering and the private placement
of the private placement warrants, the proceeds of the sale of our shares in connection with our initial business combination (pursuant
to backstop agreements we may enter into following the consummation of our initial public offering or otherwise), shares issued to the
owners of the target, debt issued to bank or other lenders or the owners of the target, or a combination of the foregoing. We may seek
to complete our initial business combination with a company or business that may be financially unstable or in its early stages of development
or growth, which would subject us to the numerous risks inherent in such companies and businesses. 

If our initial business combination
is paid for using equity or debt securities, or not all of the funds released from the trust account are used for payment of the consideration
in connection with our initial business combination or used for redemptions of our Class A ordinary share, we may apply the balance
of the cash released to us from the trust account for general corporate purposes, including for maintenance or expansion of operations
of the post-transaction company, the payment of principal or interest due on indebtedness incurred in completing our initial business
combination, to fund the purchase of other companies or for working capital. 

We may seek to raise additional
funds through a private offering of debt or equity securities in connection with the completion of our initial business combination, and
we may effectuate our initial business combination using the proceeds of such offering rather than using the amounts held in the trust
account. In addition, we are targeting businesses larger than we could acquire with the net proceeds of our initial public offering and
the sale of the private placement warrants, and may as a result be required to seek additional financing to complete such proposed initial
business combination. Subject to compliance with applicable securities laws, we would expect to complete such financing only simultaneously
with the completion of our initial business combination. In the case of an initial business combination funded with assets other than
the trust account assets, our proxy materials or tender offer documents disclosing the initial business combination would disclose the
terms of the financing and, only if required by law, we would seek shareholder approval of such financing. There are no prohibitions on
our ability to raise funds privately, or through loans in connection with our initial business combination. At this time, we are not a
party to any arrangement or understanding with any third party with respect to raising any additional funds through the sale of securities
or otherwise.

Sources of Target Businesses 

Target business candidates are
brought to our attention from various unaffiliated sources, including investment bankers and investment professionals. Target businesses
are also brought to our attention by such unaffiliated sources as a result of being solicited by us by calls or mailings. These sources
introduce us to target businesses in which they think we may be interested on an unsolicited basis, since many of these sources will have
read the prospectus of our initial public offering and know what types of businesses we are targeting. Our officers and directors, as
well as our sponsor and their affiliates, also bring to our attention target business candidates that they become aware of through their
business contacts as a result of formal or informal inquiries or discussions they may have, as well as attending trade shows or conventions.
In addition, we expect to receive a number of deal flow opportunities that would not otherwise necessarily be available to us as a result
of the business relationships of our officers and directors and our sponsor and their affiliates. While we do not presently anticipate
engaging the services of professional firms or other individuals that specialize in business acquisitions on any formal basis, we may
engage these firms or other individuals in the future, in which event we may pay a finder s fee, consulting fee, advisory fee or
other compensation to be determined in an arm s length negotiation based on the terms of the transaction. We will engage a finder
only to the extent our management determines that the use of a finder may bring opportunities to us that may not otherwise be available
to us or if finders approach us on an unsolicited basis with a potential transaction that our management determines is in our best interest
to pursue. Payment of finder s fees is customarily tied to completion of a transaction, in which case any such fee will be paid
out of the funds held in the trust account. In no event, however, will our sponsor or any of our existing officers or directors be paid
any finder s fee, reimbursement, consulting fee, monies in respect of any payment of a loan or other compensation by the company
prior to, or in connection with any services rendered for any services they render in order to effectuate, the completion of our initial
business combination (regardless of the type of transaction that it is). None of our sponsor, executive officers or directors, or any
of their respective affiliates, will be allowed to receive any compensation, finder s fees or consulting fees from a prospective
business combination target in connection with a contemplated initial business combination except as set forth herein. We pay Fat Ventures
Pte. Ltd.., an affiliate of our sponsor, a total of 20,000 per month for office space, utilities and secretarial and administrative
support and to reimburse our sponsor for any out-of-pocket expenses related to identifying, investigating, and completing an initial business
combination. Some of our officers and directors may enter into employment or consulting agreements with the post-transaction company following
our initial business combination. The presence or absence of any such fees or arrangements will not be used as a criterion in our selection
process of an initial business combination candidate. 

We are not prohibited from pursuing
an initial business combination with an initial business combination target that is affiliated with our sponsor, officers or directors
or making the initial business combination through a joint venture or other form of shared ownership with our sponsor, officers or directors.
In the event we seek to complete our initial business combination with an initial business combination target that is affiliated with
our sponsor, officers or directors, we, or a committee of independent directors, would obtain an opinion from an independent investment
banking firm or another independent entity that commonly renders valuation opinions that such an initial business combination is fair
to our company from a financial point of view. We are not required to obtain such an opinion in any other context. 

If any of our officers or directors
becomes aware of an initial business combination opportunity that falls within the line of business of any entity to which he or she has
pre-existing fiduciary or contractual obligations, he or she may be required to present such business combination opportunity to such
entity prior to presenting such business combination opportunity to us. Our officers and directors currently have certain relevant fiduciary
duties or contractual obligations that may take priority over their duties to us. 

Selection of a Target Business and Structuring
of our Initial Business Combination 

Nasdaq rules require
that we must complete one or more business combinations having an aggregate fair market value of at least 80 of the value of the
assets held in the trust account (excluding the deferred underwriting commissions and taxes payable on the interest earned on the
trust account) at the time of our signing a definitive agreement in connection with our initial business combination. The fair
market value of our initial business combination will be determined by our board of directors based upon one or more standards
generally accepted by the financial community, such as discounted cash flow valuation, a valuation based on trading multiples of
comparable public businesses or a valuation based on the financial metrics of M A transactions of comparable businesses. If our
board of directors is not able to independently determine the fair market value of our initial business combination, we will obtain
an opinion from an independent investment banking firm or another independent entity that commonly renders valuation opinions with
respect to the satisfaction of such criteria. While we consider it unlikely that our board of directors will not be able to make an
independent determination of the fair market value of our initial business combination, it may be unable to do so if it is less
familiar or experienced with the business of a particular target or if there is a significant amount of uncertainty as to the value
of a target s assets or prospects. We do not intend to purchase multiple businesses in unrelated industries in conjunction
with our initial business combination. Subject to this requirement, our management will have virtually unrestricted flexibility in
identifying and selecting one or more prospective target businesses, although we will not be permitted to effectuate our initial
business combination with another blank check company or a similar company with nominal operations. 

6 

In any case, we will only complete
an initial business combination in which we own or acquire 50 or more of the outstanding voting securities of the target or otherwise
acquire a controlling interest in the target sufficient for it not to be required to register as an investment company under the Investment
Company Act. If we own or acquire less than 100 of the equity interests or assets of a target business or businesses, the portion of
such business or businesses that are owned or acquired by the post-transaction company is what will be taken into account for purposes
of Nasdaq s 80 fair market value test. There is no basis for our investors to evaluate the possible merits or risks of any target
business with which we may ultimately complete our initial business combination. 

To the extent we effect our initial
business combination with a company or business that may be financially unstable or in its early stages of development or growth we may
be affected by numerous risks inherent in such company or business. Although our management will endeavor to evaluate the risks inherent
in a particular target business, we cannot assure you that we will properly ascertain or assess all significant risk factors. 

In evaluating a prospective business
target, we expect to conduct a thorough due diligence review, which may encompass, among other things, meetings with incumbent management
and employees, document reviews, interviews of customers and suppliers, inspection of facilities, as well as a review of financial and
other information that will be made available to us. 

The time required to select and
evaluate a target business and to structure and complete our initial business combination, and the costs associated with this process,
are not currently ascertainable with any degree of certainty. Any costs incurred with respect to the identification and evaluation of
a prospective target business with which our initial business combination is not ultimately completed will result in our incurring losses
and will reduce the funds we can use to complete another business combination. 

Lack of Business Diversification 

For an indefinite period of time
after the completion of our initial business combination, the prospects for our success may depend entirely on the future performance
of a single business. Unlike other entities that have the resources to complete business combinations with multiple entities in one or
several industries, it is probable that we will not have the resources to diversify our operations and mitigate the risks of being in
a single line of business. In addition, we are focusing our search for an initial business combination in a single industry. By completing
our initial business combination with only a single entity, our lack of diversification may: 

subject us to negative economic, competitive and regulatory developments, any or all of which may have
a substantial adverse impact on the particular industry in which we operate after our initial business combination, and 

cause us to depend on the marketing and sale of a single product or limited number of products or services. 

Limited Ability to Evaluate the Target s
Management Team 

Although we closely scrutinize
the management of a prospective target business when evaluating the desirability of effecting our initial business combination with that
business, our assessment of the target business management may not prove to be correct. In addition, the future management may
not have the necessary skills, qualifications or abilities to manage a public company. Furthermore, the future role of members of our
management team, if any, in the target business cannot presently be stated with any certainty. The determination as to whether any of
the members of our management team will remain with the combined company will be made at the time of our initial business combination.
While it is possible that one or more of our directors will remain associated in some capacity with us following our initial business
combination, it is unlikely that any of them will devote their full efforts to our affairs subsequent to our initial business combination.
Moreover, we cannot assure you that members of our management team will have significant experience or knowledge relating to the operations
of the particular target business. 

We cannot assure you that any
of our key personnel will remain in senior management or advisory positions with the combined company. The determination as to whether
any of our key personnel will remain with the combined company will be made at the time of our initial business combination. 

Following an initial business
combination, we may seek to recruit additional managers to supplement the incumbent management of the target business. We cannot assure
you that we will have the ability to recruit additional managers, or that additional managers will have the requisite skills, knowledge
or experience necessary to enhance the incumbent management.

Shareholders May Not Have the Ability
to Approve Our Initial Business Combination 

We may conduct redemptions
without a shareholder vote pursuant to the tender offer rules of the SEC. However, we will seek shareholder approval if it is required
by law or applicable stock exchange rule, or we may decide to seek shareholder approval for business or other legal reasons. Presented
in the table below is a graphic explanation of the types of initial business combinations we may consider and whether shareholder approval
is currently required un der Cayman law for each such transaction.

Under Nasdaq s listing rules,
shareholder approval would be required for our initial business combination if, for example: 

we issue Class A ordinary shares that will be equal to or in excess of 20 of the number of Class A
ordinary shares then outstanding; 

any of our directors, officers or substantial shareholders (as defined by Nasdaq rules) has a 5 or greater
interest (or such persons collectively have a 10 or greater interest), directly or indirectly, in the target business or assets to be
acquired or otherwise and the present or potential issuance of ordinary share could result in an increase in outstanding ordinary shares
or voting power of 5 or more; or 

the issuance or potential issuance of ordinary shares will result in our undergoing a change of control. 

Permitted Purchases of our Securities 

If we seek shareholder approval
of our initial business combination and we do not conduct redemptions in connection with our initial business combination pursuant to
the tender offer rules, our sponsor, initial shareholders, directors, officers, or their affiliates may purchase public shares or public
warrants in privately negotiated transactions or in the open market either prior to or following the completion of our initial business
combination. There is no limit on the number of shares our initial shareholders, directors, officers or their affiliates may purchase
in such transactions, subject to compliance with applicable law and Nasdaq rules. However, they have no current commitments, plans or
intentions to engage in such transactions and have not formulated any terms or conditions for any such transactions. If they engage in
such transactions, they will not make any such purchases when they are in possession of any material nonpublic information not disclosed
to the seller or if such purchases are prohibited by Regulation M under the Exchange Act. We do not currently anticipate that such purchases,
if any, would constitute a tender offer subject to the tender offer rules under the Exchange Act or a going-private transaction subject
to the going-private rules under the Exchange Act; however, if the purchasers determine at the time of any such purchases that the
purchases are subject to such rules, the purchasers will comply with such rules. Any such purchases will be reported pursuant to Section 13
and Section 16 of the Exchange Act to the extent such purchasers are subject to such reporting requirements. None of the funds held
in the trust account will be used to purchase shares or public warrants in such transactions prior to completion of our initial business
combination. 

The purpose of any such purchases
of shares could be to vote such shares in favor of the initial business combination and thereby increase the likelihood of obtaining shareholder
approval of the initial business combination or to satisfy a closing condition in an agreement with a target that requires us to have
a minimum net worth or a certain amount of cash at the closing of our initial business combination, where it appears that such requirement
would otherwise not be met. The purpose of any such purchases of public warrants could be to reduce the number of public warrants outstanding
or to vote such warrants on any matters submitted to the warrant holders for approval in connection with our initial business combination.
Any such purchases of our securities may result in the completion of our initial business combination that may not otherwise have been
possible. In addition, if such purchases are made, the public float of our Class A ordinary shares or warrants may
be reduced and the number of beneficial holders of our securities may be reduced, which may make it difficult to maintain or obtain the
quotation, listing or trading of our securities on a national securities exchange. 

8 

Our sponsor, officers, directors
and/or their affiliates anticipate that they may identify the shareholders with whom our sponsor, officers, directors or their affiliates
may pursue privately negotiated purchases by either the shareholders contacting us directly or by our receipt of redemption requests submitted
by shareholders following our mailing of proxy materials in connection with our initial business combination. To the extent that our sponsor,
officers, directors or their affiliates enter into a private purchase, they would identify and contact only potential selling shareholders
who have expressed their election to redeem their shares for a pro rata share of the trust account or vote against our initial business
combination, whether or not such shareholder has already submitted a proxy with respect to our initial business combination. Our sponsor,
officers, directors or their affiliates will only purchase public shares if such purchases comply with Regulation M under the Exchange
Act and the other federal securities laws. 

Any purchases by our
sponsor, officers, directors and/or their affiliates who are affiliated purchasers under Rule 10b 18 under the Exchange Act
will only be made to the extent such purchases are able to be made in compliance with Rule 10b 18, which is a safe harbor
from liability for manipulation under Section 9(a)(2) and Rule 10b 5 of the Exchange Act. Rule 10b 18
has certain technical requirements that must be complied with in order for the safe harbor to be available to the purchaser. Our
sponsor, officers, directors and/or their affiliates will not make purchases of ordinary shares if the purchases would violate
Section 9(a)(2) or Rule 10b 5 of the Exchange Act. Any such purchases will be reported pursuant to
Section 13 and Section 16 of the Exchange Act to the extent such purchases are subject to such reporting requirements. 

Redemption Rights for Public Shareholders
upon Completion of our Initial Business Combination 

We will provide our public shareholders
with the opportunity to redeem all or a portion of their Class A ordinary shares upon the completion of our initial business combination
at a per-share price, payable in cash, equal to the aggregate amount then on deposit in the trust account as of two business days
prior to the consummation of the initial business combination including interest earned on the funds held in the trust account and not
previously released to us to pay our taxes, divided by the number of then outstanding public shares, subject to the limitations described
herein. As of November 30, 2022, the amount in the trust account was approximately 10.33 per public share. The per-share amount we will
distribute to investors who properly redeem their shares will not be reduced by the deferred underwriting commissions we will pay to the
underwriters. Our sponsor, officers and directors have entered into a letter agreement with us, pursuant to which they have agreed to
waive their redemption rights with respect to any founder shares and any public shares held by them in connection with the completion
of our initial business combination. 

Manner of Conducting Redemptions 

We will provide our public shareholders
with the opportunity to redeem all or a portion of their Class A ordinary shares upon the completion of our initial business combination
either (i) in connection with a shareholder meeting called to approve the initial business combination or (ii) by means of a
tender offer. The decision as to whether we will seek shareholder approval of a proposed initial business combination or conduct a tender
offer will be made by us, solely in our discretion, and will be based on a variety of factors such as the timing of the transaction and
whether the terms of the transaction would require us to seek shareholder approval under the law or stock exchange listing requirement.
Under Nasdaq rules, asset acquisitions and stock purchases would not typically require shareholder approval while direct mergers with
our company where we do not survive and any transactions where we issue more than 20 of our outstanding ordinary share or seek to amend
our amended and restated memorandum and articles of association would require shareholder approval. If we structure an initial business
combination with a target company in a manner that requires shareholder approval, we will not have discretion as to whether to seek a
shareholder vote to approve the proposed initial business combination. We may conduct redemptions without a shareholder vote pursuant
to the tender offer rules of the SEC unless shareholder approval is required by law or stock exchange listing requirements or we
choose to seek shareholder approval for business or other legal reasons. So long as we obtain and maintain a listing for our securities
on Nasdaq, we will be required to comply with such rules. 

If shareholder approval of the
transaction is required by law or stock exchange listing requirement, or we decide to obtain shareholder approval for business or other
legal reasons, we will, pursuant to our amended and restated memorandum and articles of association: 

conduct the redemptions in conjunction with a proxy solicitation pursuant to Regulation 14A of the Exchange
Act, which regulates the solicitation of proxies, and not pursuant to the tender offer rules, and 

file proxy materials with the SEC. 

9 

In the event that we seek shareholder
approval of our initial business combination, we will distribute proxy materials and, in connection therewith, provide our public shareholders
with the redemption rights described above upon completion of the initial business combination. 

If we seek shareholder approval,
we will complete our initial business combination only if a majority of the outstanding ordinary shares voted are voted in favor of the
initial business combination. A quorum for such meeting will consist of the holders present in person or by proxy of shares of outstanding
capital stock of the company representing a majority of the voting power of all outstanding shares of capital stock of the company entitled
to vote at such meeting. Our initial shareholders will count toward this quorum and pursuant to the letter agreement, our sponsor, officers
and directors have agreed to vote their founder shares and any public shares purchased during or after our initial public offering (including
in open market and privately negotiated transactions) in favor of our initial business combination. For purposes of seeking approval of
the majority of our outstanding ordinary shares voted, non-votes will have no effect on the approval of our initial business combination
once a quorum is obtained. We intend to give approximately 30 days (but not less than 10 days nor more than 60 days) prior
written notice of any such meeting, if required, at which a vote shall be taken to approve our initial business combination. These quorum
and voting thresholds, and the voting agreements of our initial shareholders, may make it more likely that we will consummate our initial
business combination. Each public shareholder may elect to redeem its public shares irrespective of whether they vote for or against the
proposed transaction. 

If a shareholder vote is not required
and we do not decide to hold a shareholder vote for business or other legal reasons, we will, pursuant to our amended and restated memorandum
and articles of association: 

conduct the redemptions pursuant to Rule 13e 4 and Regulation 14E of the Exchange Act, which
regulate issuer tender offers, and 

file tender offer documents with the SEC prior to completing our initial business combination which contain
substantially the same financial and other information about the initial business combination and the redemption rights as is required
under Regulation 14A of the Exchange Act, which regulates the solicitation of proxies. 

Upon the public announcement of
our initial business combination, we or our sponsor will terminate any plan established in accordance with Rule 10b5 1 to purchase
Class A ordinary shares in the open market if we elect to redeem our public shares through a tender offer, to comply with Rule 14e 5
under the Exchange Act. 

In the event we conduct redemptions
pursuant to the tender offer rules, our offer to redeem will remain open for at least 20 business days, in accordance with Rule 14e 1(a) under
the Exchange Act, and we will not be permitted to complete our initial business combination until the expiration of the tender offer period.
In addition, the tender offer will be conditioned on public shareholders not tendering more than a specified number of public shares which
are not purchased by our sponsor, which number will be based on the requirement that we will only redeem our public shares so long as
(after such redemption) our net tangible assets will be at least 5,000,001 either immediately prior to or upon consummation of our initial
business combination and after payment of underwriters fees and commissions (so that we are not subject to the SEC s penny
stock rules) or any greater net tangible asset or cash requirement which may be contained in the agreement relating to our initial
business combination. If public shareholders tender more shares than we have offered to purchase, we will withdraw the tender offer and
not complete the initial business combination. If public shareholders tender more shares than we have offered to purchase, we will withdraw
the tender offer and not complete the initial business combination. 

Our amended and restated
memorandum and articles of association provides that we may not redeem our public shares unless our net tangible assets are at least
 5,000,001 either immediately prior to or upon consummation of our initial business combination and after payment of
underwriters fees and commissions (so that we are not subject to the SEC s penny stock rules) or any
greater net tangible asset or cash requirement which may be contained in the agreement relating to our initial business combination.
For example, the proposed initial business combination may require: (i) cash consideration to be paid to the target or its
owners, (ii) cash to be transferred to the target for working capital or other general corporate purposes or (iii) the
retention of cash to satisfy other conditions in accordance with the terms of the proposed initial business combination. In the
event the aggregate cash consideration we would be required to pay for all Class A ordinary shares that are validly submitted
for redemption plus any amount required to satisfy cash conditions pursuant to the terms of the proposed initial business
combination exceed the aggregate amount of cash available to us, we will not complete the initial business combination or redeem any
shares, and all Class A ordinary shares submitted for redemption will be returned to the holders thereof. 

10 

In the event that the anchor investors
hold all purchased units until prior to consummation of our initial business combination and vote their public shares in favor of our
initial business combination, in addition to the founder shares, no affirmative votes from other public shareholders would be required
to approve our initial business combination. However, because our anchor investors are not obligated to continue owning any public shares
following the closing and are not obligated to vote any public shares in favor of our initial business combination, we cannot assure you
that any of these anchor investors will be shareholders at the time our shareholders vote on our initial business combination, and, if
they are shareholders, we cannot assure you as to how such anchor investors will vote on any business combination 

Limitation on Redemption upon Completion
of our Initial Business Combination if we Seek Shareholder Approval 

Notwithstanding the foregoing,
if we seek shareholder approval of our initial business combination and we do not conduct redemptions in connection with our initial business
combination pursuant to the tender offer rules, our amended and restated memorandum and articles of association provides that a public
shareholder, together with any affiliate of such shareholder or any other person with whom such shareholder is acting in concert or as
a group (as defined under Section 13 of the Exchange Act), will be restricted from seeking redemption rights with respect
to more than an aggregate of 15 of the shares sold in our initial public offering, which we refer to as the Excess Shares. 
Such restriction shall also be applicable to our affiliates. We believe this restriction will discourage shareholders from accumulating
large blocks of shares, and subsequent attempts by such holders to use their ability to exercise their redemption rights against a proposed
initial business combination as a means to force us or our management to purchase their shares at a significant premium to the then-current
market price or on other undesirable terms. By limiting our shareholders ability to redeem no more than 15 of the shares sold
in our initial public offering without our prior consent, we believe we will limit the ability of a small group of shareholders to unreasonably
attempt to block our ability to complete our initial business combination, particularly in connection with an initial business combination
with a target that requires as a closing condition that we have a minimum net worth or a certain amount of cash. However, we would not
be restricting our shareholders ability to vote all of their shares (including Excess Shares) for or against our initial business
combination. 

Tendering Stock Certificates in
Connection with Redemption Rights 

We may require our public shareholders
seeking to exercise their redemption rights, whether they are record holders or hold their shares in street name, to either
tender their certificates to our transfer agent up to two business days prior to the vote on the proposal to approve the initial
business combination, or to deliver their shares to the transfer agent electronically using the DWAC System, at the holder s option.
The proxy materials that we will furnish to holders of our public shares in connection with our initial business combination will indicate
whether we are requiring public shareholders to satisfy such delivery requirements. Accordingly, a public shareholder would have up to
two days prior to the vote on the initial business combination to tender its shares if it wishes to seek to exercise its redemption
rights. Given the relatively short exercise period, it is advisable for shareholders to use electronic delivery of their public shares. 

There is a nominal cost associated
with the above-referenced tendering process and the act of certificating the shares or delivering them through the DWAC System. The transfer
agent will typically charge the tendering broker 80.00 and it would be up to the broker whether or not to pass this cost on to the redeeming
holder. However, this fee would be incurred regardless of whether or not we require holders seeking to exercise redemption rights to tender
their shares. The need to deliver shares is a requirement of exercising redemption rights regardless of the timing of when such delivery
must be effectuated. 

The foregoing is different from
the procedures used by many blank check companies. In order to perfect redemption rights in connection with their business combinations,
many blank check companies would distribute proxy materials for the shareholders vote on an initial business combination, and a
holder could simply vote against a proposed initial business combination and check a box on the proxy card indicating such holder was
seeking to exercise his or her redemption rights. After the initial business combination was approved, the company would contact such
shareholder to arrange for him or her to deliver his or her certificate to verify ownership. As a result, the shareholder then had an
 option window after the completion of the initial business combination during which he or she could monitor the price of
the company s stock in the market. If the price rose above the redemption price, he or she could sell his or her shares in the open
market before actually delivering his or her shares to the company for cancellation. As a result, the redemption rights, to which shareholders
were aware they needed to commit before the shareholder meeting, would become option rights surviving past the completion
of the initial business combination until the redeeming holder delivered its certificate. The requirement for physical or electronic delivery
prior to the meeting ensures that a redeeming holder s election to redeem is irrevocable once the initial business combination is
approved. 

11 

Any request to redeem such shares,
once made, may be withdrawn at any time up to the date of the shareholder meeting. Furthermore, if a holder of a public share delivered
its certificate in connection with an election of redemption rights and subsequently decides prior to the applicable date not to elect
to exercise such rights, such holder may simply request that the transfer agent return the certificate (physically or electronically).
It is anticipated that the funds to be distributed to holders of our public shares electing to redeem their shares will be distributed
promptly after the completion of our initial business combination. 

If our initial business combination
is not approved or completed for any reason, then our public shareholders who elected to exercise their redemption rights would not be
entitled to redeem their shares for the applicable pro rata share of the trust account. In such case, we will promptly return any certificates
delivered by public holders who elected to redeem their shares. 

If our initial proposed initial
business combination is not completed, we may continue to try to complete an initial business combination with a different target by July
18, 2023 (or until January 18, 2024 if we extend the period of time to consummate a business combination). 

Redemption of Public Shares and
Liquidation if no Initial Business Combination 

Our amended and restated memorandum
and articles of association provides that we have only 15 months from April 18, 2022, the closing of our Initial Public Offering We may
seek ordinary resolution of the public shareholders for any extension beyond 15 months at a meeting called for such purpose. Public shareholders
will be offered the opportunity to vote on and/or redeem their shares in connection with the approval of such extension. Alternatively,
or in the event that there is an unsuccessful effort to obtain public shareholder approval for the proposed extensions(s), we may, but
are not obligated to, extend the period in which we must complete our initial business combination twice, for an additional three months
each time, up to 21 months by depositing into the trust account on or prior to the applicable deadline for each three-month extension
 1,150,000 0.10 per unit in either case). Public shareholders, in this situation, will not be offered the opportunity to vote on and/or
redeem their shares in connection with such extension. If we are unable to complete our initial business combination by July 18, 2023
(or by January 18, 2024), we will: (i) cease all operations except for the purpose of winding up, (ii) as promptly as reasonably
possible but not more than ten business days thereafter, redeem the public shares, at a per-share price, payable in cash, equal to
the aggregate amount then on deposit in the trust account including interest earned on the funds held in the trust account and not previously
released to us to pay our taxes (less up to 100,000 of interest to pay dissolution expenses), divided by the number of then outstanding
public shares, which redemption will completely extinguish public shareholders rights as shareholders (including the right to receive
further liquidating distributions, if any), subject to applicable law, and (iii) as promptly as reasonably possible following such
redemption, subject to the approval of our remaining shareholders and our board of directors, dissolve and liquidate, subject in the case
of clauses (ii) and (iii) above to our obligations under Cayman Islands law to provide for claims of creditors and the requirements
of other applicable law. 

There will be no redemption rights
or liquidating distributions with respect to our warrants, which will expire worthless if we fail to complete our initial business combination
within the 15-month time period (or up to 21 month period). 

Our sponsor, senior advisors,
officers and directors have entered into a letter agreement with us, pursuant to which they have waived their rights to liquidating distributions
from the trust account with respect to any founder shares held by them if we fail to complete our initial business combination within
15 months from the closing of the IPO (or up to 21 months if we extend the period of time to consummate a business combination, or
as extended by the Company s shareholders in accordance with our amended and restated memorandum and articles of association). The
anchor investors will not be entitled to rights to liquidating distributions from the trust account with respect to any founder shares
held by them if we fail to complete our initial business combination within the prescribed time frame. However, if our sponsor, senior
advisors, officers, directors, or anchor investors acquire public shares in or after the IPO, they will be entitled to liquidating distributions
from the trust account with respect to such public shares if we fail to complete our initial business combination within 15 months from
the closing of the IPO (or up to 21 months if we extend the period of time to consummate a business combination, or as extended by
the Company s shareholders in accordance with our amended and restated memorandum and articles of association). 

12 

Our sponsor, officers and directors
have agreed, pursuant to a written agreement with us, that they will not propose any amendment to our amended and restated memorandum
and articles of association (i) to modify the substance or timing of our obligation to allow redemption in connection with our initial
business combination or certain amendments to our amended and restated memorandum and articles of association, prior thereto or to redeem
100 of our public shares if we do not complete our initial business combination within 15 months from the closing of the IPO (or up to
21 months if we extend the period of time to consummate a business combination, or as extended by the Company s shareholders
in accordance with our amended and restated memorandum and articles of association) or (ii) with respect to any other provision relating
to shareholders rights or pre-initial business combination activity, unless we provide our public shareholders with the opportunity
to redeem their Class A ordinary shares upon approval of any such amendment at a per-share price, payable in cash, equal to the aggregate
amount then on deposit in the trust account including interest earned on the funds held in the trust account and not previously released
to us to pay our taxes divided by the number of then outstanding public shares. However, we may not redeem our public shares unless our
net tangible assets are at least 5,000,001 either immediately prior to or upon consummation of our initial business combination and after
payment of underwriters fees and commissions (so that we are not subject to the SEC s penny stock rules). If
this optional redemption right is exercised with respect to an excessive number of public shares such that we cannot satisfy the net tangible
asset requirement (described above), we would not proceed with the amendment or the related redemption of our public shares at such time. 

We expect that all costs and expenses
associated with implementing our plan of dissolution, as well as payments to any creditors, will be funded from amounts remaining out
of the approximately 360,530 of proceeds held outside the trust account, although we cannot assure you that there will be sufficient
funds for such purpose. We will depend on sufficient interest being earned on the proceeds held in the trust account to pay any tax obligations
we may owe. However, if those funds are not sufficient to cover the costs and expenses associated with implementing our plan of dissolution,
to the extent that there is any interest accrued in the trust account not required to pay taxes, we may request the trustee to release
to us an additional amount of up to 100,000 of such accrued interest to pay those costs and expenses. 

If we were to expend all
of the net proceeds of our Initial Public Offering and the sale of the placement warrant, other than the proceeds deposited in the
trust account, and without taking into account interest, if any, earned on the trust account, the per-share redemption amount
received by shareholders upon our dissolution would be approximately 10.20. The proceeds deposited in the trust account could,
however, become subject to the claims of our creditors which would have higher priority than the claims of our public shareholders.
We cannot assure you that the actual per-share redemption amount received by shareholders will not be substantially less than
 10.20. While we intend to pay such amounts, if any, we cannot assure you that we will have funds sufficient to pay or provide for
all creditors claims. 

Although we will seek to have
all vendors, service providers, prospective target businesses or other entities with which we do business execute agreements with us waiving
any right, title, interest or claim of any kind in or to any monies held in the trust account for the benefit of our public shareholders,
there is no guarantee that they will execute such agreements or even if they execute such agreements that they would be prevented from
bringing claims against the trust account including but not limited to fraudulent inducement, breach of fiduciary responsibility or other
similar claims, as well as claims challenging the enforceability of the waiver, in each case in order to gain an advantage with respect
to a claim against our assets, including the funds held in the trust account. If any third party refuses to execute an agreement waiving
such claims to the monies held in the trust account, our management will perform an analysis of the alternatives available to it and will
only enter into an agreement with a third party that has not executed a waiver if management believes that such third party s engagement
would be significantly more beneficial to us than any alternative. Examples of possible instances where we may engage a third party that
refuses to execute a waiver include the engagement of a third party consultant whose particular expertise or skills are believed by management
to be significantly superior to those of other consultants that would agree to execute a waiver or in cases where management is unable
to find a service provider willing to execute a waiver. MaloneBailey, our independent registered public accounting firm, and the underwriters
of the offering, will not execute agreements with us waiving such claims to the monies held in the trust account. 

13 

In addition, there is no guarantee
that such entities will agree to waive any claims they may have in the future as a result of, or arising out of, any negotiations, contracts
or agreements with us and will not seek recourse against the trust account for any reason. Our sponsor has agreed that it will be liable
to us if and to the extent any claims by a third party for services rendered or products sold to us, or a prospective target business
with which we have entered into a written letter of intent, confidentiality or similar agreement or business combination agreement, reduce
the amount of funds in the trust account to below the lesser of (i) 10.00 per public share and (ii) the actual amount per public
share held in the trust account as of the date of the liquidation of the trust account, if less than 10.00 per share due to reductions
in the value of the trust assets, less taxes payable, provided that such liability will not apply to any claims by a third party or prospective
target business who executed a waiver of any and all rights to the monies held in the trust account (whether or not such waiver is enforceable)
nor will it apply to any claims under our indemnity of the underwriters of the IPO against certain liabilities, including liabilities
under the Securities Act. However, we have not asked our sponsor to reserve for such indemnification obligations, nor have we independently
verified whether our sponsor has sufficient funds to satisfy its indemnity obligations and believe that our sponsor s only assets
are securities of our company. Therefore, we cannot assure you that our sponsor would be able to satisfy those obligations. None of our
officers or directors will indemnify us for claims by third parties including, without limitation, claims by vendors and prospective target
businesses. 

In the event that the proceeds
in the trust account are reduced below (i) 10.20 per public share or (ii) such lesser amount per public share held in the trust
account as of the date of the liquidation of the trust account, due to reductions in value of the trust assets, in each case net of the
amount of interest which may be withdrawn to pay taxes, and our sponsor asserts that it is unable to satisfy its indemnification obligations
or that it has no indemnification obligations related to a particular claim, our independent directors would determine whether to take
legal action against our sponsor to enforce its indemnification obligations. While we currently expect that our independent directors
would take legal action on our behalf against our sponsor to enforce its indemnification obligations to us, it is possible that our independent
directors in exercising their business judgment may choose not to do so if, for example, the cost of such legal action is deemed by the
independent directors to be too high relative to the amount recoverable or if the independent directors determine that a favorable outcome
is not likely. We have not asked our sponsor to reserve for such indemnification obligations and we cannot assure you that our sponsor
would be able to satisfy those obligations. Accordingly, we cannot assure you that due to claims of creditors the actual value of the
per-share redemption price will not be less than 10.20 per public share. 

We will seek to reduce the possibility
that our sponsor will have to indemnify the trust account due to claims of creditors by endeavoring to have all vendors, service providers,
prospective target businesses or other entities with which we do business execute agreements with us waiving any right, title, interest
or claim of any kind in or to monies held in the trust account. Our sponsor will also not be liable as to any claims under our indemnity
of the underwriters of the IPO against certain liabilities, including liabilities under the Securities Act. As of November 30, 2022, we
have access to up to approximately 360,530 from the proceeds of the IPO and the sale of the placement warrant with which to pay any such
potential claims (including costs and expenses incurred in connection with our liquidation, currently estimated to be no more than approximately
 100,000). In the event that we liquidate and it is subsequently determined that the reserve for claims and liabilities is insufficient,
shareholders who received funds from our trust account could be liable for claims made by creditors. 

If we file a bankruptcy petition
or an involuntary bankruptcy petition is filed against us that is not dismissed, the proceeds held in the trust account could be subject
to applicable bankruptcy law, and may be included in our bankruptcy estate and subject to the claims of third parties with priority over
the claims of our shareholders. To the extent any bankruptcy claims deplete the trust account, we cannot assure you we will be able to
return 10.20 per share to our public shareholders. Additionally, if we file a bankruptcy petition or an involuntary bankruptcy petition
is filed against us that is not dismissed, any distributions received by shareholders could be viewed under applicable debtor/creditor
and/or bankruptcy laws as either a preferential transfer or a fraudulent conveyance. As a result, a bankruptcy
court could seek to recover some or all amounts received by our shareholders. Furthermore, our board of directors may be viewed as having
breached its fiduciary duty to our creditors and/or may have acted in bad faith, thereby exposing itself and our company to claims of
punitive damages, by paying public shareholders from the trust account prior to addressing the claims of creditors. We cannot assure you
that claims will not be brought against us for these reasons. 

14 

Our public shareholders will be
entitled to receive funds from the trust account only upon the earlier to occur of: (i) the completion of our initial business combination,
(ii) the redemption of any public shares properly tendered in connection with a shareholder vote to amend any provisions of our amended
and restated memorandum and articles of association (A) to modify the substance or timing of our obligation to allow redemption in
connection with our initial business combination or certain amendments to our amended and restated memorandum and articles of association,
prior thereto or to redeem 100 of our public shares if we do not complete our initial business combination within 15 months from the
closing of the IPO (or up to 21 months if we extend the period of time to consummate a business combination, or as extended by the
Company s shareholders in accordance with our amended and restated memorandum and articles of association) or (B) with respect
to any other provision relating to shareholders rights or pre-initial business combination activity, and (iii) the redemption
of all of our public shares if we are unable to complete our business combination within 15 months from the closing of the IPO (or up
to 21 months if we extend the period of time to consummate a business combination, or as extended by the Company s shareholders
in accordance with our amended and restated memorandum and articles of association), subject to applicable law. In no other circumstances
will a shareholder have any right or interest of any kind to or in the trust account. In the event we seek shareholder approval in connection
with our initial business combination, a shareholder s voting in connection with the initial business combination alone will not
result in a shareholder s redeeming its shares to us for an applicable pro rata share of the trust account. Such shareholder must
have also exercised its redemption rights as described above. These provisions of our amended and restated memorandum and articles of
association, like all provisions of our amended and restated memorandum and articles of association, may be amended by special resolution. 

Competition 

In identifying, evaluating
and selecting a target business for our initial business combination, we may encounter intense competition from other entities
having a business objective similar to ours, including other blank check companies, private equity groups and leveraged buyout
funds, and operating businesses seeking strategic business combinations. Many of these entities are well established and have
extensive experience identifying and effecting business combinations directly or through affiliates. Moreover, many of these
competitors possess greater financial, technical, human and other resources than we do. Our ability to acquire larger target
businesses will be limited by our available financial resources. This inherent limitation gives others an advantage in pursuing the
initial business combination of a target business. Furthermore, our obligation to pay cash in connection with our public
shareholders who exercise their redemption rights may reduce the resources available to us for our initial business combination and
our outstanding warrants, and the future dilution they potentially represent, may not be viewed favorably by certain target
businesses. Either of these factors may place us at a competitive disadvantage in successfully negotiating an initial business
combination. 

Employees 

We have two officers. These individuals
are not obligated to devote any specific number of hours to our matters but they devote as much of their time as they deem necessary,
in the exercise of their respective business judgement, to our affairs until we have completed our initial business combination. The amount
of time our officers devote in any time period varies based on the stage of the initial business combination process we are in. We do
not intend to have any full time employees prior to the completion of our initial business combination. We do not have an employment agreement
with any member of our management team. 

Periodic Reporting and Financial Information 

We have registered our units,
Class A ordinary share and warrants under the Exchange Act and have reporting obligations, including the requirement that we file
annual, quarterly and current reports with the SEC. In accordance with the requirements of the Exchange Act, our annual reports will contain
financial statements audited and reported on by our independent registered public accountants. 

15 

We will provide shareholders with
audited financial statements of the prospective target business as part of the tender offer materials or proxy solicitation materials
sent to shareholders to assist them in assessing the target business. In all likelihood, these financial statements will need to be prepared
in accordance with, or reconciled to, GAAP, or IFRS, depending on the circumstances, and the historical financial statements may be required
to be audited in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. These financial statement requirements may limit the pool of potential targets
we may conduct an initial business combination with because some targets may be unable to provide such statements in time for us to disclose
such statements in accordance with federal proxy rules and complete our initial business combination within the prescribed time frame.
We cannot assure you that any particular target business identified by us as a potential business combination candidate will have financial
statements prepared in accordance with GAAP or that the potential target business will be able to prepare its financial statements in
accordance with the requirements outlined above. To the extent that these requirements cannot be met, we may not be able to acquire the
proposed target business. While this may limit the pool of potential business combination candidates, we do not believe that this limitation
will be material. 

We will be required to evaluate
our internal control procedures for the fiscal year ending November 30, 2023 as required by the Sarbanes-Oxley Act. A target company
may not be in compliance with the provisions of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act regarding adequacy of their internal controls. The development
of the internal controls of any such entity to achieve compliance with the Sarbanes-Oxley Act may increase the time and costs necessary
to complete any such business combination. 

We have filed a Registration Statement
on Form 8 A with the SEC to voluntarily register our securities under Section 12 of the Exchange Act. As a result, we are
subject to the rules and regulations promulgated under the Exchange Act. We have no current intention of filing a Form 15 to
suspend our reporting or other obligations under the Exchange Act prior or subsequent to the consummation of our initial business combination. 

We are a Cayman Islands exempted
company. Exempted companies are Cayman Islands companies conducting business mainly outside the Cayman Islands and, as such, are exempted
from complying with certain provisions of the Companies Act. 

We are an emerging growth
company, as defined in Section 2(a) of the Securities Act, as modified by the JOBS Act. As such, we are eligible to take
advantage of certain exemptions from various reporting requirements that are applicable to other public companies that are not emerging
growth companies including, but not limited to, not being required to comply with the auditor attestation requirements of Section 404
of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, reduced disclosure obligations regarding executive compensation in our periodic reports and proxy statements,
and exemptions from the requirements of holding a non-binding advisory vote on executive compensation and shareholder approval of any
golden parachute payments not previously approved. If some investors find our securities less attractive as a result, there may be a less
active trading market for our securities and the prices of our securities may be more volatile. 

In addition, Section 107
of the JOBS Act also provides that an emerging growth company can take advantage of the extended transition period provided in Section 7(a)(2)(B) of
the Securities Act for complying with new or revised accounting standards. In other words, an emerging growth company can delay the adoption
of certain accounting standards until those standards would otherwise apply to private companies. We intend to take advantage of the benefits
of this extended transition period. 

We will remain an emerging growth
company until the earlier of (1) the last day of the fiscal year (a) following April 18, 2027, the fifth anniversary of
the completion of our initial public offering, (b) in which we have total annual gross revenue of at least 1.235 billion, or (c) in
which we are deemed to be a large accelerated filer, which means the market value of our shares of Class A ordinary share that are
held by non-affiliates exceeds 700 million as of the prior June 30 th , and (2) the date on which we have issued more
than 1.0 billion in non-convertible debt during the prior three-year period. References herein to emerging growth company 
will have the meaning associated with it in the JOBS Act. 

Additionally, we are a smaller
reporting company as defined in Item 10(f)(1) of Regulation S-K. Smaller reporting companies may take advantage of certain
reduced disclosure obligations, including, among other things, providing only two years of audited financial statements. We will
remain a smaller reporting company until the last day of the fiscal year in which (1) the market value of our ordinary share
held by non-affiliates exceeds 250 million as of the end of that year s second fiscal quarter, or (2) our annual revenues
exceeded 100 million during such completed fiscal year and the market value of our ordinary share held by nonaffiliates exceeds
 700 million as of the end of that year s second fiscal quarter. 

16 

Item 1A. Risk Factors. 

As a smaller reporting company,
we are not required to include risk factors in this Report. However, below is a partial list of material risks, uncertainties and other
factors that could have a material effect on the Company and its operations: 

we are a newly incorporated Cayman Islands exempt company with no operating history and no revenues; 

our ability to continue as a going concern 

as a result of the low initial price paid by our sponsor and the anchor investors for the founder shares,
our sponsor, its affiliates and our management team as well as the anchor investors stand to make a substantial profit even if an initial
business combination subsequently declines in value or is unprofitable for our public shareholders; 

we may not be able to complete our initial business combination within the prescribed time frame; 

you will not have any rights or interests in funds from the trust account, except under certain limited
circumstances; 

negative interest rate for securities in which we invest the funds held in the trust account; 

our shareholders may be held liable for claims by third parties against us; 

if third parties bring claims against us, the proceeds held in the trust account could be reduced and
the per-share redemption amount received by shareholders may be less than 10.20 per share 

subsequent to completion of our initial business combination, we may be required to take write-downs or
write-offs, restructuring and impairment or other charges; 

conflicts of interest of our sponsor, officers and directors and our anchor investors; 

we may have a limited ability to assess the management of a prospective target business; 

our public shareholders may not be afforded an opportunity to vote on our proposed business combination; 

the absence of a redemption threshold may make it possible for us to complete a business combination with
which a substantial majority of our shareholders do not agree; 

we may redeem your unexpired warrants prior to their exercise at a time that is disadvantageous to you; 

we may amend the terms of the public warrants in a manner that may be adverse to holders of public warrants
with the approval by the holders of at least 65 of the then outstanding public warrants; 

our competitors have advantages over us in seeking business combinations; 

we may be unable to obtain additional financing; 

our warrants may have an adverse effect on the market price of our ordinary shares; 

we may issue additional equity and/or debt securities to complete our initial business combination; 

our sponsor controls a substantial interest in us; 

17 

if we seek shareholder approval of our initial business combination, our sponsor, who controls a substantial
interest in us, has agreed to vote in favor of such initial business combination, regardless of how our public shareholders vote; 

the ability of our public shareholders to redeem their shares for cash may make our financial condition
unattractive to potential business combination targets, may not allow us to complete the most desirable business combination or optimize
our capital structure, and will increase the probability that our initial business combination would be unsuccessful; 

lack of protections normally afforded to investors of blank check companies; 

possibility of losing the ability to redeem all shares equal to or in excess of 15 of our ordinary shares
if we seek shareholder approval of our initial business combination and we do not conduct redemptions pursuant to the tender offer rules; 

Nasdaq may delist our securities from trading on its exchange; 

we will likely only be able to complete one business combination with the proceeds of the IPO and the
sale of the placement warrants, which will cause us to be solely dependent on a single business which may have a limited number of products
or services; 

we are not registering the ordinary shares issuable upon exercise of the warrants sold as part of the
units in the IPO at this time, and such registration may not be in place when an investor desires to exercise such warrants; 

shares being redeemed and warrants becoming worthless; 

events which may result in the per-share amount held in our trust account dropping below 10.20 per public
share; 

our directors may decide not to enforce the indemnification obligations of our sponsor; 

if, before distributing the proceeds in the trust account to our public shareholders, we file a bankruptcy
petition or an involuntary bankruptcy petition is filed against us that is not dismissed, the claims of creditors in such proceeding may
have priority over the claims of our shareholders and the per-share amount that would otherwise be received by our shareholders in connection
with our liquidation may be reduced; 

because we are not limited to a particular industry or any specific target businesses with which to pursue
our initial business combination, you will be unable to ascertain the merits or risks of any particular target business s operations; 

we may seek acquisition opportunities in companies that may be outside of our management s areas
of expertise; 

impact of COVID 19 and related risks; the potential inability to enforce judgments against us or our
management or board of directors 

if we effect our initial business combination with a company with operations or opportunities outside
of the United States, we would be subject to a variety of additional risks that may negatively impact our operations; and 

changes in laws or regulations, or a failure to comply with any laws and regulations, tax consequences
to business combinations may adversely affect our business, investments and results of operations. 

Our auditors have identified a material weakness in our accounting
controls as a result of repayment of certain amounts to our Sponsor and its Affiliate prior to, and at the time, we completed our initial
public offering. We are working to correct those weaknesses. 

For the complete list of risks
relating to our operations, see the section titled Risk Factors contained in our Registration Statement.

Item 7. Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. 

The following discussion and
analysis of the Company s financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with our audited financial
statements and the notes related thereto which are included in Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data of this
Annual Report on Form 10-K. Certain information contained in the discussion and analysis set forth below includes forward-looking statements.
Our actual results may differ materially from those anticipated in these forward-looking statements as a result of many factors, including
those set forth under Special Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements, Item 1A. Risk Factors and elsewhere
in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. 

Overview 

We are a blank check company incorporated
in the Cayman Islands on December 6, 2021 formed for the purpose of entering into a merger, capital stock exchange, asset acquisition,
stock purchase, recapitalization, reorganization or other similar business combination with one or more businesses or entities Business
Combination ). We intend to effectuate our Business Combination using cash derived from the proceeds of the Initial Public Offering
and the sale of the Private Placement Warrants, our shares, debt or a combination of cash, shares and debt. 

We expect to continue to incur
significant costs in the pursuit of our acquisition plans. We cannot assure you that our plans to complete a Business Combination will
be successful. 

Results of Operations 

We have neither engaged in
any operations nor generated any revenues to date. Our only activities from December 6, 2021 (inception) through November 30, 2022
were organizational activities, those necessary to prepare for the Initial Public Offering, described below, and identifying a target
company for a Business Combination. We do not expect to generate any operating revenues until after the completion of our Business Combination.
We generate non-operating income in the form of interest income on marketable securities held in the Trust Account. We incur expenses
as a result of being a public company (for legal, financial reporting, accounting and auditing compliance), as well as for due diligence
expenses. 

For the period from December 6, 2021 (inception) through November 30, 2022, we had a net income of 817,089, which consists
of interest income on marketable securities held in the Trust Account of 1,483,349 and an unrealized gain on marketable securities held
in our Trust Account of 1,993, offset by operating and formation costs of 668,253. 

Liquidity and Capital Resources 

On April 18, 2022, we consummated
the Initial Public Offering of 11,500,000 Units, at a price of 10.00 per Unit, which includes the exercise of the over-allotment option
in full of 1,500,000 Units, generating gross proceeds of 115,000,000. Simultaneously with the closing of the Initial Public Offering,
we consummated the private sale of 5,000,000 Private Placement Warrants at a price of 1.00 per Private Placement Warrant in a private
placement to the Sponsor generating gross proceeds to the Company in the amount of 5,000,000. 

Following the Initial Public Offering,
the full exercise of the over-allotment option, and the sale of the Private Units, a total of 117,300,000 was placed in the Trust Account.
We incurred 5,724,785 in Initial Public Offering related costs, including 1,150,000 of underwriting fees and 4,025,000 of deferred
underwriting fees and 549,784 of other offering costs. 

For the period from December 6,
2021 (inception) through November 30, 2022, cash used in operating activities was 664,685. Net income of 817,089 was affected by interest
earned on marketable securities held in the Trust Account of 1,483,349 and an unrealized gain on marketable securities held in the Trust
account of 1,993. Changes in operating assets and liabilities used 3,568 of cash for operating activities. 

21 

As of November 30, 2022, we had
marketable securities held in the Trust Account of 118,785,342 (including 1,485,342 of interest income and unrealized gains) consisting
of U.S. Treasury Bills with a maturity of 185 days or less. We may withdraw interest from the Trust Account to pay taxes, if any. We intend
to use substantially all of the funds held in the Trust Account, including any amounts representing interest earned on the Trust Account
(less income taxes payable), to complete our Business Combination. To the extent that our share capital or debt is used, in whole or in
part, as consideration to complete our Business Combination, the remaining proceeds held in the Trust Account will be used as working
capital to finance the operations of the target business or businesses, make other acquisitions and pursue our growth strategies. 

As of November 30, 2022, we had
cash of 360,530. We intend to use the funds held outside the Trust Account primarily to identify and evaluate target businesses, perform
business due diligence on prospective target businesses, travel to and from the offices, plants or similar locations of prospective target
businesses or their representatives or owners, review corporate documents and material agreements of prospective target businesses, and
structure, negotiate and complete a Business Combination. 

In order to fund working capital
deficiencies or finance transaction costs in connection with a Business Combination, the Sponsor, or certain of our officers and directors
or their affiliates may, but are not obligated to, loan us funds as may be required. If we complete a Business Combination, we would repay
such loaned amounts. In the event that a Business Combination does not close, we may use a portion of the working capital held outside
the Trust Account to repay such loaned amounts but no proceeds from our Trust Account would be used for such repayment. Up to 1,500,000
of such Working Capital Loans may be convertible into warrants of the post-Business Combination entity at a price of 1.00 per warrant
at the option of the lender. 

If our estimate of the costs of
identifying a target business, undertaking in-depth due diligence and negotiating a Business Combination are less than the actual amount
necessary to do so, we may have insufficient funds available to operate our business prior to our Business Combination. Moreover, we may
need to obtain additional financing either to complete our Business Combination or because we become obligated to redeem a significant
number of our Public Shares upon consummation of our Business Combination, in which case we may issue additional securities or incur debt
in connection with such Business Combination. 

In connection with our
assessment of going concern considerations in accordance with FASB ASU 2014-15, Disclosures of Uncertainties about an
Entity s ability to Continue as a Going Concern, we have determined that if we are unable to raise additional funds to
alleviate liquidity needs as well as complete a Business Combination by July 18, 2023, then we will cease all operations except
for the purpose of liquidating. The liquidity condition and the date for mandatory liquidation and subsequent dissolution raises
substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern. We plan to consummate a Business Combination prior to the
mandatory liquidation date. No adjustments have been made to the carrying amounts of assets or liabilities should we be required to
liquidate after July 18, 2023. 

Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements 

We have no obligations, assets
or liabilities, which would be considered off-balance sheet arrangements as of November 30, 2022. We do not participate in transactions
that create relationships with unconsolidated entities or financial partnerships, often referred to as variable interest entities, which
would have been established for the purpose of facilitating off-balance sheet arrangements. We have not entered into any off-balance sheet
financing arrangements, established any special purpose entities, guaranteed any debt or commitments of other entities, or purchased any
non-financial assets. 

Contractual obligations 

We do not have any long-term debt,
capital lease obligations, operating lease obligations or long-term liabilities, other than an agreement to pay an affiliate of the Sponsor
 20,000 per month for office space, utilities and secretarial and administrative support and to reimburse the Sponsor for any out-of-pocket
expenses related to identifying, investigating, and completing an initial Business Combination commencing on the filing of the initial
draft registration statement. We began incurring these fees on January 27, 2022 and will continue to incur these fees monthly until
the earlier of the completion of the Business Combination and our liquidation. 

The underwriters will be entitled
to a deferred underwriting discount of 3.5 of the gross proceeds of the IPO, which aggregates to 4,025,000, upon the completion of
the Company s initial Business Combination, subject to the terms of the underwriting agreement. 

22 

Critical Accounting Policies 

The preparation of financial statements
and related disclosures in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America requires management
to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities
at the date of the financial statements, and income and expenses during the periods reported. Actual results could materially differ from
those estimates. We have not identified any critical accounting policies. 

Recent Accounting Standards 

In August 2020, the Financial
Accounting Standards Board FASB issued Accounting Standards Update ASU 2020-06, Debt Debt with
Conversion and Other Options (Subtopic 470-20) and Derivatives and Hedging Contracts in Entity s Own Equity (Subtopic 815-40) ASU 2020-06 to simplify accounting for certain financial instruments. ASU 2020-06 eliminates the current models that require
separation of beneficial conversion and cash conversion features from convertible instruments and simplifies the derivative scope exception
guidance pertaining to equity classification of contracts in an entity s own equity. The new standard also introduces additional
disclosures for convertible debt and freestanding instruments that are indexed to and settled in an entity s own equity. ASU 2020-06
amends the diluted earnings per share guidance, including the requirement to use the if-converted method for all convertible instruments.
ASU 2020-06 is effective January 1, 2024 and should be applied on a full or modified retrospective basis, with early adoption permitted
beginning on January 1, 2021. The Company continues to evaluate the impact of ASU 2020-06 on its financial statements. 

Management does not believe that
any other recently issued, but not yet effective, accounting pronouncements, if currently adopted, would have a material effect on the
Company s financial statements. 

Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk 

Not required for smaller reporting
companies. 

Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data. 

This information appears following
Item 15 of this Report and is included herein by reference. 

Item 9. Changes in and Disagreements with Accountants on Accounting and Financial Disclosure. 

None. 

Item 9A. Controls and Procedures. 

Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures 

Disclosure controls and procedures
are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by us in our Exchange Act reports is recorded, processed, summarized,
and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC s rules and forms, and that such information is accumulated and communicated
to our management, including our principal executive officer and principal financial officer or persons performing similar functions,
as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. 

As required by Rules 13a-15 and
15d-15 under the Exchange Act, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer carried out an evaluation of the effectiveness
of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures as of November 30, 2022. Based upon their evaluation, our Chief
Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and
15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act) were effective. 

We do not expect that our disclosure
controls and procedures will prevent all errors and all instances of fraud. Disclosure controls and procedures, no matter how well conceived
and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the objectives of the disclosure controls and procedures are met.
Further, the design of disclosure controls and procedures must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints, and the benefits
must be considered relative to their costs. Because of the inherent limitations in all disclosure controls, no evaluation of disclosure
controls and procedures can provide absolute assurance that we have detected all our control deficiencies and instances of fraud, if any.
The design of disclosure controls and procedures also is based partly on certain assumptions about the likelihood of future events, and
there can be no assurance that any design will succeed in achieving its stated goals under all potential conditions.

of our independent registered public accounting firm due to a transition period established by rules of the SEC for newly public companies. 

Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting 

There were no changes in our internal
control over financial reporting (as such term is defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) of the Exchange Act) during the most recent
fiscal quarter that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.

Our officers are appointed by
the board of directors and serve at the discretion of the board of directors, rather than for specific terms of office. Our board of directors
is authorized to appoint persons to the offices set forth in our amended and restated memorandum and articles of association as it deems
appropriate. Our amended and restated memorandum and articles of association provide that our officers may consist of a Chairman of the
Board, Chief Executive Officer, Chief Financial Officer, President, Vice Presidents, Secretary, Treasurer, Assistant Secretaries and such
other offices as may be determined by the board of directors. 

Number and Terms of Office of Officers and
Directors 

We have 8 directors. In accordance
with Nasdaq corporate governance requirements, we are not required to hold an annual meeting until one year after our first fiscal year
end following our listing on Nasdaq. Our officers are appointed by the board of directors and serve at the discretion of the board of
directors, rather than for specific terms of office. Our board of directors is authorized to appoint persons to the offices set forth
in our amended and restated memorandum and articles of association as it deems appropriate. Our amended and restated memorandum and articles
of association provide that our officers may consist of a Chairman of the Board, Chief Executive Officer, Chief Financial Officer,
President, Vice Presidents, Secretary, Treasurer, Assistant Secretaries and such other offices as may be determined by the board of directors. 

28 

Committees of the Board of Directors 

Our board of directors has
two standing committees: an audit committee and a compensation committee. Subject to phase-in rules and a limited exception,
Nasdaq rules and Rule 10A 3 of the Exchange Act require that the audit committee of a listed company be comprised
solely of independent directors, and Nasdaq rules require that the compensation committee of a listed company be comprised
solely of independent directors. Each committee operates under a charter that has been approved by our board of directors and has
the composition and responsibilities described below. 

Audit Committee 

We have established an audit committee
of the board of directors. Jay McCarthy, John Laurens and Thorsten Neumann will serve as members of our audit committee, and John Laurens
chairs the audit committee. Under the Nasdaq listing standards and applicable SEC rules, we are required to have at least three members
of the audit committee, all of whom must be independent. Each of Jay McCarthy, John Laurens and Thorsten Neumann meets the independent
director standard under Nasdaq listing standards and under Rule 10-A-3(b)(1) of the Exchange Act. 

Each member of the audit committee
is financially literate and our board of directors has determined that that Mr. John Laurens qualifies as an audit committee
financial expert as defined in applicable SEC rules. 

We have adopted an audit committee
charter, which details the principal functions of the audit committee, including: 

the appointment, compensation, retention, replacement, and oversight of the work of the independent registered
public accounting firm engaged by us; 

pre-approving all audit and permitted non-audit services to be provided by the independent registered
public accounting firm engaged by us, and establishing pre-approval policies and procedures; 

setting clear hiring policies for employees or former employees of the independent registered public accounting
firm, including but not limited to, as required by applicable laws and regulations; 

setting clear policies for audit partner rotation in compliance with applicable laws and regulations; 

obtaining and reviewing a report, at least annually, from the independent registered public accounting
firm describing (i) the independent registered public accounting firm s internal quality-control procedures, (ii) any material
issues raised by the most recent internal quality-control review, or peer review, of the audit firm, or by any inquiry or investigation
by governmental or professional authorities within the preceding five years respecting one or more independent audits carried out
by the firm and any steps taken to deal with such issues and (iii) all relationships between the independent registered public accounting
firm and us to assess the independent registered public accounting firm s independence; 

reviewing and approving any related party transaction required to be disclosed pursuant to Item 404
of Regulation S-K promulgated by the SEC prior to us entering into such transaction; and 

reviewing with management, the independent registered public accounting firm, and our legal advisors,
as appropriate, any legal, regulatory or compliance matters, including any correspondence with regulators or government agencies and any
employee complaints or published reports that raise material issues regarding our financial statements or accounting policies and any
significant changes in accounting standards or rules promulgated by the Financial Accounting Standards Board, the SEC or other regulatory
authorities. 

Compensation Committee 

We have established a compensation
committee of the board of directors. Andrew Porter and Aneel Ranadive serve as members of our compensation committee. Under the Nasdaq
listing standards and applicable SEC rules, we are required to have at least two members of the compensation committee, all of whom must
be independent. Each of Andrew Porter and Aneel Ranadive independent and Mr. Porter chairs the compensation committee. 

29 

We have adopted a compensation
committee charter, which details the principal functions of the compensation committee, including: 

reviewing and approving on an annual basis the corporate goals and objectives relevant to our Chief Executive
Officer s compensation, if any is paid by us, evaluating our Chief Executive Officer s performance in light of such goals and
objectives and determining and approving the remuneration (if any) of our Chief Executive Officer based on such evaluation; 

reviewing and approving on an annual basis the compensation, if any is paid by us, of all of our other
officers; 

reviewing on an annual basis our executive compensation policies and plans; 

implementing and administering our incentive compensation equity-based remuneration plans; 

assisting management in complying with our proxy statement and annual report disclosure requirements; 

approving all special perquisites, special cash payments and other special compensation and benefit arrangements
for our officers and employees; 

if required, producing a report on executive compensation to be included in our annual proxy statement;
and 

reviewing, evaluating and recommending changes, if appropriate, to the remuneration for directors. 

Notwithstanding the foregoing,
as indicated above, other than the payment to Fat Ventures Pte. Ltd., an affiliate of our sponsor of 20,000 per month for office
space, utilities and secretarial and administrative support and reimbursement of expenses, no compensation of any kind, including finders,
consulting or other similar fees, will be paid to any of our existing shareholders, officers, directors or any of their respective affiliates,
prior to, or for any services they render in order to effectuate the consummation of an initial business combination. Accordingly, it
is likely that prior to the consummation of an initial business combination, the compensation committee will only be responsible for the
review and recommendation of any compensation arrangements to be entered into in connection with such initial business combination. 

The charter also provides that
the compensation committee may, in its sole discretion, retain or obtain the advice of a compensation consultant, legal counsel or other
adviser and will be directly responsible for the appointment, compensation and oversight of the work of any such adviser. However, before
engaging or receiving advice from a compensation consultant, external legal counsel or any other adviser, the compensation committee
will consider the independence of each such adviser, including the factors required by Nasdaq and the SEC. 

Director Nominations 

We do not have a standing nominating
committee though we intend to form a corporate governance and nominating committee as and when required to do so by law or Nasdaq rules.
In accordance with Rule 5605 of the Nasdaq rules, a majority of the independent directors may recommend a director nominee for selection
by the board of directors. The board of directors believes that the independent directors can satisfactorily carry out the responsibility
of properly selecting or approving director nominees without the formation of a standing nominating committee. Our independent directors
will participate in the consideration and recommendation of director nominees. In accordance with Rule 5605 of the Nasdaq rules,
all such directors are independent. As there is no standing nominating committee, we do not have a nominating committee charter in place. 

The board of directors will also
consider director candidates recommended for nomination by our shareholders during such times as they are seeking proposed nominees to
stand for election at the next annual meeting of shareholders (or, if applicable, a special meeting of shareholders). Our shareholders
that wish to nominate a director for election to our board of directors should follow the procedures set forth in our amended and restated
memorandum and articles of association. 

We have not formally established
any specific, minimum qualifications that must be met or skills that are necessary for directors to possess. In general, in identifying
and evaluating nominees for director, the board of directors considers educational background, diversity of professional experience, knowledge
of our business, integrity, professional reputation, independence, wisdom, and the ability to represent the best interests of our shareholders. 

Code of Ethics 

We have adopted a Code of Ethics
applicable to our directors, officers and employees. We have filed a copy of our Code of Ethics and our audit and compensation committee
charters with the SEC and copies are available on our website. You are able to review these documents by accessing our public filings
at the SEC s web site at www.sec.gov . In addition, a copy of the Code of Ethics will be provided without charge upon request
from us. We intend to disclose any amendments to or waivers of certain provisions of our Code of Ethics in a Current Report on Form 8 K. 

30 

Item 11. Executive Compensation 

Compensation Discussion and Analysis 

None of our officers has received
any cash compensation for services rendered to us. Other than the payment to Fat Ventures Pte. Ltd., an affiliate of our sponsor of 20,000
per month described elsewhere in this Report, no compensation of any kind, including any finder s fee, reimbursement, consulting
fee or monies in respect of any payment of a loan, will be paid by us to our sponsor, officers, directors or any affiliate of our sponsor,
officers, or directors prior to, or in connection with any services rendered in order to effectuate, the consummation of our initial business
combination (regardless of the type of transaction that it is). However, these individuals will be reimbursed for any out-of-pocket expenses
incurred in connection with activities on our behalf such as identifying potential target businesses and performing due diligence on suitable
business combinations. Our audit committee reviews on a quarterly basis all payments that were made to our sponsor, officers, or directors,
or our or their affiliates. Any such payments prior to an initial business combination will be made using funds held outside the trust
account. Other than quarterly audit committee review of such payments, we do not expect to have any additional controls in place governing
our reimbursement payments to our directors and executive officers for their out-of-pocket expenses incurred in connection with identifying
and consummating an initial business combination. 

After the completion of
our initial business combination, directors or members of our management team who remain with us may be paid consulting or
management fees from the combined company. All of these fees will be fully disclosed to shareholders, to the extent then known, in
the tender offer materials or proxy solicitation materials furnished to our shareholders in connection with a proposed initial
business combination. We have not established any limit on the amount of such fees that may be paid by the combined company to our
directors or members of management. It is unlikely the amount of such compensation will be known at the time of the proposed initial
business combination, because the directors of the post-combination business will be responsible for determining officer and
director compensation. Any compensation to be paid to our officers will be determined, or recommended to the board of directors for
determination, either by a compensation committee constituted solely by independent directors or by a majority of the independent
directors on our board of directors. 

We do not intend to take any action
to ensure that members of our management team maintain their positions with us after the consummation of our initial business combination,
although it is possible that some or all of our officers and directors may negotiate employment or consulting arrangements to remain with
us after our initial business combination. The existence or terms of any such employment or consulting arrangements to retain their positions
with us may influence our management s motivation in identifying or selecting a target business but we do not believe that the ability
of our management to remain with us after the consummation of our initial business combination will be a determining factor in our decision
to proceed with any potential business combination. We are not party to any agreements with our officers and directors that provide for
benefits upon termination of employment. The compensation committee has reviewed and discussed this Compensation Discussion and Analysis
with management and, based upon its review and discussions, the compensation committee recommended to the board of directors that the
Compensation Discussion and Analysis be included in this Report.

Item 12. Security Ownership of Certain Beneficial Owners and Management and Related Shareholder Matters 

The following table sets forth
information regarding the beneficial ownership of our ordinary share as of February 21, 2023 based on information obtained from the persons
named below, with respect to the beneficial ownership of ordinary share, by: 

each person known by us to be the beneficial owner of more than 5 of our outstanding ordinary share; 

each of our executive officers and directors that beneficially owns our ordinary share; and 

all our executive officers and directors as a group. 

In the table below, percentage
ownership is based on 14,183,551 shares of our ordinary share, consisting of (i) 11,308,551 shares of our Class A ordinary share,
and (ii) 2,875,000 shares of our Class B ordinary share, issued and outstanding as of February 21, 2023. On all matters to be
voted upon, holders of the shares of Class A ordinary share and shares of Class B ordinary share vote together as a single class.
Currently, all of the shares of Class B ordinary share are convertible into Class A ordinary share on a one-for-one basis. 

The Sponsor, directors and executive
officers have agreed not to transfer, assign or sell any of their Founder Shares until earliest of (A) one year after the completion
of the initial Business Combination and (B) subsequent to the initial Business Combination, (x) if the closing price of the
Company s Class A ordinary shares equals or exceeds 12.00 per share (as adjusted for share splits, share capitalizations,
reorganizations, recapitalizations and the like) for any 20 trading days within any 30 trading day period commencing at least
150 days after the initial Business Combination, or (y) the date on which the Company completes a liquidation, merger, share
exchange or other similar transaction that results in all of the Company s public shareholders having the right to exchange their
ordinary shares for cash, securities or other property. Unless otherwise indicated, we believe that all persons named in the table have
sole voting and investment power with respect to all ordinary share ordinary shares beneficially owned by them. The following table does
not reflect record or beneficial ownership of the private placement warrants as these warrants are not exercisable within 60 days
of the date of this Report.

Item 13. Certain Relationships and Related Transactions, and Director Independence 

On January 7, 2022, our
sponsor purchased 2,875,000 founder shares for an aggregate purchase price of 25,000, or approximately 0.009 per share. The
founder shares (including the Class A ordinary share issuable upon exercise thereof) may not, subject to certain limited
exceptions, be transferred, assigned or sold by the holder. Up to 375,000 Founder Shares were subject to forfeiture by the Sponsor
depending on the extent to which the underwriters over-allotment option is exercised. The underwriters fully exercised their
over-allotment option at the IPO resulting in no founder shares subject to forfeiture. 

As previously reported on a Form 8 K,
on April 18, 2022, simultaneously with the closing of our initial public offering on April 18, 2022, our sponsor purchased an aggregate
of 5,000,000 private placement warrants at a price of 1.00 per private placement warrant, for an aggregate purchase price of 5,000,000.
Each whole private placement warrant is exercisable to purchase one share of Class A ordinary share at a price of 11.50 per share.
The proceeds from the private placement warrants were added to the proceeds from our initial public offering held in the trust account.
If we do not complete an initial business combination by July 18, 2023 (or by January 18, 2024), the proceeds from the sale of the private
placement warrants will be used to fund the redemption of the public shares (subject to the requirements of applicable law), and the private
placement warrants and all underlying securities will expire worthless. 

Commencing on April 18, 2022,
we pay Fat Projects Pte. Ltd., an affiliate of our sponsor, a total of 20,000 per month for office space, utilities and secretarial
and administrative support. Upon completion of our initial business combination or our liquidation, we will cease paying these monthly
fees. 

Other than the foregoing, no compensation
of any kind, including any finder s fee, reimbursement, consulting fee or monies in respect of any payment of a loan, will be paid
by us to our sponsor, officers, or directors or any affiliate of our sponsor, officers, or directors prior to, or in connection with any
services rendered in order to effectuate, the consummation of an initial business combination (regardless of the type of transaction that
it is). However, these individuals will be reimbursed for any out-of-pocket expenses incurred in connection with activities on our behalf
such as identifying potential target businesses and performing due diligence on suitable business combinations. Our audit committee reviews
on a quarterly basis all payments that were made to our sponsor, officers, directors, or our or their affiliates and determines which
expenses and the amount of expenses that will be reimbursed. There is no cap or ceiling on the reimbursement of out-of-pocket expenses
incurred by such persons in connection with activities on our behalf. 

On January 7, 2022, our sponsor
agreed to loan us up to 300,000 to be used for a portion of the expenses of our initial public offering and we issued an unsecured promissory
note to our sponsor. Pursuant to the terms of our promissory note, we may borrow up to an aggregate principal amount of 300,000. The
promissory note was non-interest bearing and was payable on the earlier of (i) October 31, 2021 and (ii) the completion
of our initial public offering. On June 22, 2022 the Company paid the balance due on the promissory note of 83,954. As of November 30,
2022, there was no balance outstanding under the Promissory Note. Borrowings under the Promissory Note are no longer available. 

In addition, in order to finance
transaction costs in connection with an intended initial business combination, our sponsor or an affiliate of our sponsor or certain of
our officers and directors may, but are not obligated to, loan us funds on a non-interest-bearing basis as may be required. If we complete
an initial business combination, we would repay such loaned amounts. In the event that the initial business combination does not close,
we may use a portion of the working capital held outside the trust account to repay such loaned amounts but no proceeds from our trust
account would be used for such repayment. Up to 1,500,000 of such loans may be convertible into warrants, at a price of 1.00 per warrant
at the option of the lender, upon consummation of our initial business combination. The warrants would be identical to the private placement
warrants. Other than as described above, the terms of such loans by our officers and directors, if any, have not been determined and no
written agreements exist with respect to such loans. We do not expect to seek loans from parties other than our sponsor or an affiliate
of our sponsor as we do not believe third parties will be willing to loan such funds and provide a waiver against any and all rights to
seek access to funds in our trust account. As of November 30, 2022, there were no amounts outstanding under the any such loans. 

33 

After our initial business
combination, members of our management team who remain with us may be paid consulting, management or other fees from the combined
company with any and all amounts being fully disclosed to our shareholders, to the extent then known, in the tender offer or proxy
solicitation materials, as applicable, furnished to our shareholders. It is unlikely the amount of such compensation will be known
at the time of distribution of such tender offer materials or at the time of a shareholder meeting held to consider our initial
business combination, as applicable, as it will be up to the directors of the post-combination business to determine executive and
director compensation. 

The holders of the founder shares,
private placement warrants, and warrants that may be issued upon conversion of working capital loans (and in each case holders of their
component securities, as applicable) have registration rights to require us to register a sale of any of our securities held by them pursuant
to a registration rights agreement entered into in connection with our initial public offering. These holders are entitled to make up
to three demands, excluding short form registration demands, that we register such securities for sale under the Securities Act. In addition,
these holders have piggy-back registration rights to include their securities in other registration statements filed by
us. 

We have entered into agreements
with our officers and directors to provide contractual indemnification in addition to the indemnification provided for in our amended
and restated memorandum and articles of association. Our amended and restated memorandum and articles of association also permit us to
secure insurance on behalf of any officer, director or employee for any liability arising out of his or her actions, regardless of whether
Cayman law would permit such indemnification. We have purchased a policy of directors and officers liability insurance that
insures our officers and directors against the cost of defense, settlement or payment of a judgment in some circumstances and insures
us against our obligations to indemnify our officers and directors. 

Related Party Policy 

We have adopted a code of ethics
requiring us to avoid, wherever possible, all conflicts of interests, except under guidelines or resolutions approved by our board of
directors (or the appropriate committee of our board) or as disclosed in our public filings with the SEC. Under our code of ethics, conflict
of interest situations will include any financial transaction, arrangement or relationship (including any indebtedness or guarantee of
indebtedness) involving the company. We have filed a copy of our code of ethics with the SEC and a copy is available on our website. You
are able to review our code of ethics by accessing our public filings at the SEC s web site at www.sec.gov. In addition, a copy
of the code of ethics will be provided without charge upon request from us. We intend to disclose any amendments to or waivers of certain
provisions of our code of ethics in a Current Report on Form 8 K 

In addition, our audit committee,
pursuant to a written charter that we have adopted, is responsible for reviewing and approving related party transactions to the extent
that we enter into such transactions. An affirmative vote of a majority of the members of the audit committee present at a meeting at
which a quorum is present will be required in order to approve a related party transaction. A majority of the members of the entire audit
committee will constitute a quorum. Without a meeting, the unanimous written consent of all of the members of the audit committee will
be required to approve a related party transaction. We have filed a copy of our audit committee charter with the SEC and a copy is available
on our website. We also require each of our directors and executive officers to complete a directors and officers questionnaire
that elicits information about related party transactions. 

These procedures are intended
to determine whether any such related party transaction impairs the independence of a director or presents a conflict of interest on the
part of a director, employee or officer. 

To further minimize
conflicts of interest, we have agreed not to consummate an initial business combination with an entity that is affiliated with any
of our sponsor, officers or directors unless we, or a committee of independent directors, have obtained an opinion from an
independent investment banking firm or another independent entity that commonly renders valuation opinions that our initial business
combination is fair to our company from a financial point of view. Furthermore, no finder s fees, reimbursements, consulting
fee, monies in respect of any payment of a loan or other compensation will be paid by us to our sponsor, officers or directors or
any affiliate of our sponsor, officers or directors prior to, for services rendered to us prior to, or in connection with any
services rendered in order to effectuate, the consummation of our initial business combination (regardless of the type of
transaction that it is). However, the following payments will be made to our sponsor, officers, or directors, or our or their
affiliates, none of which will be made from the proceeds of the IPO held in the trust account prior to the completion of our initial
business combination: 

Repayment of up to an aggregate of 300,000 in loans made to us by our sponsor to cover offering-related
and organizational expenses; 

34 

Payment to Fat Projects Pte. Ltd., an affiliate of our sponsor, or its affiliate of 20,000 per month,
for up to 21 months, for office space, utilities and secretarial and administrative support; 

Reimbursement for any out-of-pocket expenses related to identifying, investigating and completing an initial
business combination; and 

Repayment of non-interest bearing loans which may be made by our sponsor or an affiliate of our sponsor
or certain of our officers and directors to finance transaction costs in connection with an intended initial business combination, the
terms of which (other than as described above) have not been determined nor have any written agreements been executed with respect thereto.
Up to 1,500,000 of such loans may be convertible into warrants, at a price of 1.00 per warrant at the option of the lender, upon consummation
of our initial business combination. The warrants would be identical to the private placement warrants. 

Our audit committee reviews on
a quarterly basis all payments that were made to our sponsor, officers, directors or our or their affiliates. 

Director Independence 

Nasdaq listing standards require
that a majority of our board of directors be independent. An independent director is defined generally as a person other
than an officer or employee of the company or its subsidiaries or any other individual having a relationship which in the opinion of the
company s board of directors, would interfere with the director s exercise of independent judgment in carrying out the responsibilities
of a director. Our board of directors has determined that all of our directors, other than Tristan Lo, David Andrada, Nils Michaelis and
Calvin Ng, are independent directors as defined in the Nasdaq listing standards and applicable SEC rules.

REPORT
OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM 

To
the Shareholders and Board of Directors of 

 Aura
FAT Projects Acquisition Corp. 

Opinion
on the Financial Statements 

We
have audited the accompanying balance sheet of Aura FAT Projects Acquisition Corp. (the Company as of November 30, 2022,
and the related statements of operations, stockholders equity, and cash flows for the period from December 6, 2021 (inception)
through November 30, 2022, and the related notes (collectively referred to as the financial statements ). In our opinion,
the financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of November 30, 2022, and
the results of its operations and its cash flows for the period from December 6, 2021 (inception) through November 30, 2022, in conformity
with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. 

Going
Concern Matter 

The
accompanying financial statements have been prepared assuming that the Company will continue as a going concern. As more fully described
in Note 1 to the financial statements, the Company s business plan is dependent on the completion of a business combination within
a prescribed period of time and if not completed will cease all operations except for the purpose of liquidating. The date for mandatory
liquidation and subsequent dissolution raise substantial doubt about the Company s ability to continue as a going concern. Management s
plans in regard to these matters are also described in Note 1. The financial statements do not include any adjustments that might result
from the outcome of this uncertainty. 

Basis
for Opinion 

These
financial statements are the responsibility of the Company s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company s
financial statements based on our audit. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board
(United States) PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal
securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. 

We
conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain
reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. The Company
is not required to have, nor were we engaged to perform, an audit of its internal control over financial reporting. As part of our audit
we are required to obtain an understanding of internal control over financial reporting but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion
on the effectiveness of the Company s internal control over financial reporting. Accordingly, we express no such opinion. 

Our
audit included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or
fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding
the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audit also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant
estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe that our audit provides
a reasonable basis for our opinion.

units Units ), which includes the exercise of the
over-allotment option in full of Units, generating gross proceeds of , which is described in Note 3. 

Simultaneously
with the closing of the Initial Public Offering, the Company consummated the private sale of warrants (the Private Placement
Warrants at a price of per Private Placement Warrant in a private placement to Aura FAT Projects Capital LLC generating
gross proceeds to the Company in the amount of . 

Transaction
costs amounted to consisting of of underwriting fees paid in cash, of deferred underwriting fees payable
(which are held in a trust account with Continental Stock Transfer Trust Company acting as trustee (the Trust Account )),
and of costs related to the Initial Public Offering. Cash of was held outside of the Trust Account on November 30,
2022 and was available for working capital purposes. As described in Note 6, the deferred underwriting fees are contingent
upon the consummation of the Business Combination. 

The
Company must complete one or more initial Business Combinations having an aggregate fair market value of at least 80 of the net assets
held in the Trust Account (as defined below) (excluding the deferred underwriting commissions and taxes payable on the interest earned
on the Trust Account) at the time of signing a definitive agreement in connection with the initial Business Combination. However, the
Company will complete the initial Business Combination only if the post-Business Combination company in which its public shareholders
own shares will own or acquire 50 or more of the outstanding voting securities of the target or is otherwise not required to register
as an investment company under the Investment Company Act. There is no assurance that the Company will be able to complete a Business
Combination successfully. 

Upon
the closing of the Initial Public Offering, an amount of per Unit) from the net proceeds of the sale of the Units
in the Initial Public Offering and the Private Placement was placed in a trust account Trust Account and may only be
invested in United States government securities within the meaning set forth in Section 2(a)(16) of the Investment
Company Act of 1940, as amended (the Investment Company Act ), having a maturity of 185 days or less or in money market
funds meeting certain conditions under Rule 2a-7 promulgated under the Investment Company Act which invest only in direct U.S. government
treasury obligations. Except with respect to interest earned on the funds held in the Trust Account that may be released to the Company
to pay its tax obligations and up to of interest that may be used for its dissolution expenses, the proceeds from the Initial
Public Offering and the sale of the Private Placement Warrants held in the Trust Account will not be released from the Trust Account
until the earliest to occur of: (a) the completion of the initial Business Combination, (b) the redemption of any public shares properly
submitted in connection with a shareholder vote to amend the Company s amended and restated memorandum and articles of association
(i) to modify the substance or timing of the Company s obligation to allow redemption in connection with the initial Business Combination
or certain amendments to the memorandum and articles of association prior thereto or to redeem 100 of the public shares if the Company
does not complete the initial Business Combination within 15 months from the closing of the Initial Public Offering (or as extended by
the Company s shareholders in accordance with the Company s amended and restated memorandum and articles of association)
(the Combination Period or (ii) with respect to any other provision relating to shareholders rights or pre-Business
Combination activity, and (c) the redemption of the public shares if the Company is unable to complete the initial Business Combination
within the Combination Period, subject to applicable law. The proceeds deposited in the Trust Account could become subject to the claims
of the Company s creditors, if any, which could have priority over the claims of its public shareholders. 

The
Company will provide its public shareholders with the opportunity to redeem all or a portion of their public shares upon the completion
of the initial Business Combination either (i) in connection with a shareholder meeting called to approve the initial Business Combination
or (ii) by means of a tender offer. The decision as to whether the Company will seek shareholder approval of a proposed initial Business
Combination or conduct a tender offer will be made by the Company, solely in its discretion, and will be based on a variety of factors
such as the timing of the transaction and whether the terms of the transaction would require the Company to seek shareholder approval
under applicable law or share exchange listing requirements. 

The
public shareholders are entitled to redeem all or a portion of their public shares upon the completion of the initial Business Combination
at a per-share price, payable in cash, equal to the aggregate amount then on deposit in the Trust Account as of two business days prior
to the consummation of the initial Business Combination, including interest earned on the funds held in the Trust Account (which interest
shall be net of taxes payable), divided by the number of then outstanding public shares, subject to the limitations described herein.
The amount in the Trust Account is initially anticipated to be 10.20 per public share, however, there is no guarantee that investors
will receive 10.20 per share upon redemption. 

The
shares of ordinary share subject to redemption were recorded at a redemption value and classified as temporary equity upon the completion
of the Initial Public Offering, in accordance with Financial Accounting Standards Board s FASB Accounting Standards
Codification ASC Topic 480 Distinguishing Liabilities from Equity. In such case, the Company will proceed
with a Business Combination if the Company s Class A ordinary shares are not classified as a penny stock upon such
consummation of a Business Combination and, if the Company seeks shareholder approval, a majority of the issued and outstanding shares
voted are voted in favor of the Business Combination. 

The
Company will have only 15 months (or up to a 21-month if the Company chooses to extend such period, as described in more detail in the
final prospectus, or as extended by the Company s shareholders in accordance with the amended and restated memorandum and articles
of association) from the closing of the Initial Public Offering to consummate the initial Business Combination. If the Company is unable
to complete the initial Business Combination within the Combination Period, the Company will: (i) cease all operations except for the
purpose of winding up, (ii) as promptly as reasonably possible but not more than ten business days thereafter, redeem the public shares,
at a per-share price, payable in cash, equal to the aggregate amount then on deposit in the Trust Account including interest earned on
the funds held in the Trust Account and not previously released to the Company to pay its taxes (less up to of interest to pay
dissolution expenses), divided by the number of then outstanding public shares, which redemption will completely extinguish public shareholders 
rights as shareholders (including the right to receive further liquidating distributions, if any), subject to applicable law, and (iii)
as promptly as reasonably possible following such redemption, subject to the approval of the Company s remaining shareholders and
its board of directors, dissolve and liquidate, subject in the case of clauses (ii) and (iii) above to the Company s obligations
under the laws of Cayman Islands to provide for claims of creditors and the requirements of other applicable law. 

The
Sponsor, officers and directors will enter into a letter agreement with Company, pursuant to which they will agree to (i) waive their
redemption rights with respect to any founder shares and public shares held by them in connection with the completion of the initial
Business Combination, (ii) waive their redemption rights with respect to any founder shares and public shares held by them in connection
with a shareholder vote to approve an amendment to the Company s amended and restated memorandum and articles of association (A)
to modify the substance or timing of the Company s obligation to allow redemption in connection with the initial Business Combination
or certain amendments to the Company s amended and restated memorandum and articles of association prior thereto or to redeem 100 
of the public shares if the Company does not complete the initial Business Combination within the Combination Period for each three month
extension, into the Trust Account, or as extended by the Company s shareholders in accordance with the Company s amended
and restated memorandum and articles of association), or (B) with respect to any other provision relating to any other provision relating
to the rights of holders of the Class A ordinary shares and (iii) waive their rights to liquidating distributions from the Trust Account
with respect to any founder shares held by them if the Company fails to complete the initial Business Combination within the Combination
Period although the Company will be entitled to liquidating distributions from the Trust Account with respect to any public shares they
hold if the Company fails to complete the initial Business Combination within the prescribed time frame. 

The
Sponsor has agreed that it will be liable to the Company if and to the extent any claims by a third party for services rendered or products
sold to the Company, or a prospective target business with which the Company has entered into a written letter of intent, confidentiality
or similar agreement or Business Combination agreement, reduce the amount of funds in the Trust Account to below the lesser of (i) 10.20
per public share and (ii) the actual amount per public share held in the Trust Account as of the date of the liquidation of the Trust
Account, if less than 10.20 per share due to reductions in the value of the trust assets, less taxes payable, provided that such liability
will not apply to any claims by a third party or prospective target business who executed a waiver of any and all rights to the monies
held in the Trust Account (whether or not such waiver is enforceable) nor will it apply to any claims under the Company s indemnity
of the underwriters of the Initial Public Offering against certain liabilities, including liabilities under the Securities Act. However,
the Company has not asked the Sponsor to reserve for such indemnification obligations, nor has the Company independently verified whether
the Sponsor has sufficient funds to satisfy its indemnity obligations and believe that the Sponsor s only assets are securities
of the Company. Therefore, the Company cannot assure you that the Sponsor would be able to satisfy those obligations. 

Going
Concern Consideration 

As
of November 30, 2022, the Company had in its operating bank accounts and working capital of , which excludes 
of income earned on the Trust Account, which may be used to pay tax obligations. 

Until
the consummation of a Business Combination, the Company will be using the funds not held in the Trust Account for identifying and evaluating
prospective acquisition candidates, performing due diligence on prospective target businesses, paying for travel expenditures, selecting
the target business to acquire, and structuring, negotiating and consummating the Business Combination. 

The
Company expects to incur significant costs in pursuit of its acquisition plans and will not generate any operating revenues until after
the completion of its initial business combination. The Company will need to raise additional capital through loans or additional investments
from its Sponsor, shareholders, officers, directors, or third parties. The Company s officers, directors and Sponsor may, but are
not obligated to, loan the Company funds, from time to time or at any time, in whatever amount they deem reasonable in their sole discretion,
to meet the Company s working capital needs. Accordingly, the Company may not be able to obtain additional financing. If the Company
is unable to raise additional capital, it may be required to take additional measures to conserve liquidity, which could include, but
not necessarily be limited to, curtailing operations, suspending the pursuit of a potential transaction, and reducing overhead expenses.
The Company cannot provide any assurance that new financing will be available to it on commercially acceptable terms, if at all. If the
Company is unable to complete the Business Combination because it does not have sufficient funds available, the Company will be forced
to cease operations and liquidate the Trust Account. In connection with the Company s assessment of going concern considerations
in accordance with Accounting Standards Update ASU 2014-15, Disclosures of Uncertainties about an Entity s
Ability to Continue as a Going Concern , management has determined that if the Company is unable to raise additional funds
to alleviate liquidity needs as well as complete an Initial Business Combination by July 18, 2023, then the Company will cease all
operations, except for the purpose of liquidating. The liquidity condition and the date for mandatory liquidation and subsequent dissolution
raise substantial doubt about the Company s ability to continue as a going concern. Management plans to consummate a business combination
prior to the mandatory liquidation date. No adjustments have been made to the carrying amounts of assets or liabilities should the Company
be required to liquidate after July 18, 2023. 

Risks
and Uncertainties 

Management
continues to evaluate the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic and has concluded that while it is reasonably possible that the virus could
have a negative effect on the Company s financial position, results of its operations and/or search for a target company, the specific
impact is not readily determinable as of the date of this financial statement. The financial statement does not include any adjustments
that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty. 

Additionally,
as a result of the military action commenced in February 2022 by the Russian Federation and Belarus in the country of Ukraine and
related economic sanctions, the Company s ability to consummate a Business Combination, or the operations of a target business
with which the Company ultimately consummates a Business Combination, may be materially and adversely affected. Further, the Company s
ability to consummate a transaction may be dependent on the ability to raise equity and debt financing which may be impacted by these
events, including as a result of increased market volatility, or decreased market liquidity in third-party financing being unavailable
on terms acceptable to the Company or at all. The impact of this action and related sanctions on the world economy and the specific impact
on the Company s financial position, results of operations and/or ability to consummate a Business Combination are not yet determinable.
The financial statements do not include any adjustments that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty.

Company is considered to be an exempted Cayman Islands company with no connection to any other taxable jurisdiction and is presently
not subject to income taxes or income tax filing requirements in the Cayman Islands or the United States. As such, the Company s

tax benefits will materially change over the next twelve months.

the Company did not have any dilutive securities or other contracts that could, potentially, be exercised or converted into ordinary

Each
Private Placement Warrant is identical to the warrants offered by the Initial Public Offering, except as described below. There will
be no redemption rights or liquidating distributions from the Trust Account with respect to the Private Placement Warrants, which will
expire worthless if the Company does not consummate a Business Combination within the Combination Period. The Private Placement Warrants
(including the Class A ordinary shares issuable upon exercise of the placement warrants) are identical to the warrants sold in the Initial
Public Offering except that (a) the placement warrants and their component securities will not be transferable, assignable or saleable

results in all of the Company s shareholders having the right to exchange their ordinary shares for cash, securities or other property
(the Lock-up ). Any permitted transferees will be subject to the same restrictions and other agreements of the Company s
initial shareholders with respect to any Founder Shares. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the converted Class A ordinary shares will be
released from the Lock-up if (i) the last reported sale price of the Class A ordinary share equals or exceeds 12.00 per share (as adjusted
for share subdivisions, share capitalizations, reorganizations, recapitalizations and other transactions) for any 20 trading days within
any 30-trading day period commencing at least 150 days after the initial Business Combination or (ii) if the Company completes a transaction
after the initial Business Combination which results in all of the Company s shareholders having the right to exchange their shares
for cash, securities or other property.

to reimburse the Sponsor for any out-of-pocket expenses related to identifying, investigating, and completing an initial Business Combination
commencing on the filing of the initial draft registration statement, which was January 27, 2022. Upon completion of the initial
Business Combination or the Company s liquidation, the Company will cease paying these monthly fees. For the year ended November

In
order to finance transaction costs in connection with an intended Business Combination, the Sponsor or an affiliate of the Sponsor, or
certain of the Company s officers and directors may, but are not obligated to, loan the Company funds as may be required (the Working
Capital Loans ). If the Company completes the initial Business Combination, the Company may repay the Working Capital Loans out
of the proceeds of the Trust Account released to the Company. Otherwise, the Working Capital Loans may be repaid only out of funds held
outside the Trust Account. In the event that the initial Business Combination does not close. The Company may use a portion of the working
capital held outside the Trust Account to repay the Working Capital Loans but no proceeds from the Trust Account would be used to repay
the Working Capital Loans. The warrants would be identical to the Private Placement Warrants.
As of November 30, 2022, the Company had borrowings under the Working Capital Loans.

Offering. Additionally, the underwriters will be entitled to a deferred underwriting discount of of the gross proceeds of the IPO,
which aggregates to , upon the completion of the Company s initial Business Combination.

Class
A Ordinary Shares The Company is authorized to issue Class A ordinary shares with a par value of 
per share. At November 30, 2022, there were Class A ordinary shares issued and outstanding (excluding shares subject
to possible redemption that were classified as temporary equity in the accompanying balance sheet). 

Class
B Ordinary Shares The Company is authorized to issue Class B ordinary shares with a par value of per
share. Holders are entitled to one vote for each share of Class B ordinary shares. At November 30, 2022, there were Class B
ordinary shares issued and outstanding. 

Only
holders of the Founder Shares will have the right to vote on the appointment of directors. Holders of the public shares will not be entitled
to vote on the appointment of directors during such time. In addition, prior to the completion of an initial Business Combination, holders
of a majority of the Company s Founder Shares may remove a member of the board of directors for any reason by ordinary resolution.
These provisions of the Company s amended and restated memorandum and articles of association may only be amended by a special
resolution passed by not less than 90 of the ordinary shares who attend and vote at the Company s general meeting. Additionally,
in a vote to continue the company in a jurisdiction outside the Cayman Islands (which a special resolution), holders of the Company s
Founder Shares will have ten votes for every founder share and holders of the Class A ordinary shares will have one vote for every Class
A ordinary share. With respect to any other matter submitted to a vote of the Company s shareholders, including any vote in connection
without initial Business Combination, except as required by law, holders of the Company s Founder Shares and holders of the public
shares will vote together as a single class, with each share entitling the holder of one vote. 

The
Class B ordinary shares will automatically convert into Class A ordinary shares at the time of the consummation of the initial Business
Combination on a one-for-one basis, subject to adjustment for share subdivisions, share dividends, reorganizations, recapitalizations
and the like, and subject to further adjustment as provided herein. In the case that additional Class A ordinary shares, or equity-linked
securities, are issued or deemed issued in excess of the amounts offered in this prospectus and related to the closing of the initial
Business Combination, the ratio at which Class B ordinary shares shall convert into Class A ordinary shares will be adjusted (unless
the holders of a majority of the outstanding Class B ordinary shares agree to waive such adjustment with respect to any such issuance
or deemed issuance) so that the number of Class A ordinary shares issuable upon conversion of all Class B ordinary shares will equal,
in the aggregate, on an as-converted basis, 20 of the sum of the total number of all ordinary shares outstanding upon the completion
of the Initial Public Offering (excluding the Private Placement Warrants and underlying securities and the representative shares) plus
all Class A ordinary shares and equity-linked securities issued or deemed issued in connection with the initial Business Combination
(excluding any shares or equity-linked securities issued, or to be issued, to any seller in the initial Business Combination or any private
placement-equivalent units and their underlying securities issued to the Sponsor or its affiliates upon conversion of Working Capital
Loans made to the Company). The term equity-linked securities refers to any debt or equity securities that are convertible,
exercisable or exchangeable for Class A ordinary shares issued in a financing transaction in connection with the initial Business Combination,
including but not limited to a private placement of equity or debt. Securities could be deemed issued for purposes of the
conversion rate adjustment if such shares are issuable upon the conversion or exercise of convertible securities, warrants or similar
securities. Any conversion of Class B ordinary shares described herein will take effect as a compulsory redemption of Class B ordinary
shares and an issuance of Class A ordinary shares as a matter of Cayman Islands law. In no event will the Class B ordinary shares convert
into Class A ordinary shares at a rate of less than one-to-one. 

Warrants
 Each whole warrant entitles the holder to purchase one Class A ordinary share at a price of per share, subject
to adjustment as discussed herein. In addition, if (x) the Company issue additional Class A ordinary shares or equity-linked securities
for capital raising purposes in connection with the closing of the initial Business Combination at an issue price or effective issue
price of less than per Class A ordinary share (with such issue price or effective issue price to be determined in good faith by
the Company s board of directors and, in the case of any such issuance to the Sponsor or its affiliates, without taking into account
any Founder Shares held by the Sponsor or such affiliates, as applicable, prior to such issuance) (the Newly Issued Price ),
(y) the aggregate gross proceeds from such issuances represent more than of the total equity proceeds, and interest thereon, available
for the funding of the initial Business Combination on the date of the consummation of the initial Business Combination (net of redemptions),
and (z) the volume weighted average trading price of the Company s Class A ordinary share during the trading day period starting
on the trading day prior to the day on which the Company consummate the initial Business Combination (such price, the Market Value is below per share, then the exercise price of the warrants will be adjusted (to the nearest cent) to be equal to of the greater
of the Market Value and the Newly Issued Price, and the 18.00 per share redemption trigger price described below under Redemption
of warrants will be adjusted (to the nearest cent) to be equal to of the greater of the Market Value and the Newly Issued
Price. 

The
warrants will become exercisable on the later of 12 months from closing of the Initial Public Offering and the date of the consummation
of the initial Business Combination and will expire five years after the completion of the Company s initial Business Combination,
at 5:00 p.m., New York City time, or earlier upon redemption or liquidation. 

The
Company is not registering the Class A ordinary shares issuable upon exercise of the warrants at this time. However, the Company has
agreed the Company will use its best efforts to file with the SEC a registration statement covering the issuance of the Class A ordinary
shares issuable upon exercise of the warrants, to cause such registration statement to become effective within business days following
the initial Business Combination and to maintain a current prospectus relating to those Class A ordinary shares until the warrants expire
or are redeemed, as specified in the warrant agreement. If a registration statement covering the issuance of the Class A ordinary shares
issuable upon exercise of the warrants is not effective by the 60 th business day after the closing of the initial Business
Combination, warrant holders may, until such time as there is an effective registration statement and during any period when the Company
will have failed to maintain an effective registration statement, exercise warrants on a cashless basis in accordance with
Section 3(a)(9) of the Securities Act or another exemption. If that exemption, or another exemption, is not available, holders will
not be able to exercise their warrants on a cashless basis. 

Redemption
of warrants when the price per Class A ordinary share equals or exceeds 18.00 . Once the warrants become exercisable, the Company
may redeem the outstanding warrants: 

in
 whole and not in part; 

at
 a price of per warrant; 

upon
 not less than days prior written notice of redemption given after the warrants become exercisable (the 30-day redemption
 period to each warrant holder; and 

if,
 and only if, the reported last sale price of the Class A ordinary share equals or exceeds 18.00 per share (as adjusted for share
 subdivisions, share dividends, rights issuances, reorganizations, recapitalizations and the like) for any 20 trading days within
 a 30-trading day period commencing once the warrants become exercisable and ending 3 business days before the Company send the notice
 of redemption to the warrant holders. 

If
holders of Private Placement Warrants elect to exercise them on a cashless basis, they would pay the exercise price by surrendering the
warrants for that number of Class A ordinary shares equal to the quotient obtained by dividing (x) the product of the number of Class
A ordinary shares underlying the warrants, multiplied by the excess of the fair market value (defined below) over the exercise
price, by (y) the fair market value. The fair market value for this purpose shall mean the average reported last sale price
of the Class A ordinary share for the 10 trading days ending on the third trading day prior to the date on which the notice of redemption
is sent to the holders of warrants. 

Representative
Shares 

The
Company issued to the representative or its designees shares of Class A ordinary shares upon the consummation of the Initial
Public Offering. These shares are referred to as the representative shares . The holders of the representative shares have
agreed not to transfer, assign or sell any such ordinary shares until the completion of the initial Business Combination. 

In
addition, the holders of the representative s shares have agreed (i) that they will not transfer, assign or sell any such shares
without the Company s prior consent until the completion of the initial Business Combination, (ii) to waive their redemption rights
(or right to participate in any tender offer) with respect to such shares in connection with the completion of the initial Business Combination
and (iii) to waive their rights to liquidating distributions from the Trust Account with respect to such shares if the Company fails
to complete the initial Business Combination within the Combination Period. The representative s shares are deemed to be underwriters 
compensation by FINRA pursuant to FINRA Rule 5110.

the year ended November 30, 2022, the Company did not withdraw any interest income from the Trust Account.

 EXHIBIT 4.5

Exhibit 4.5 

DESCRIPTION
OF SECURITIES 

Pursuant
to our amended and restated memorandum and articles of association, our authorized share capital consists of 300,000,000 Class A
ordinary shares, 0.0001 par value, 30,000,000 Class B ordinary shares, 0.0001 par value, and 1,000,000 preference shares, 0.0001
par value. The following description summarizes the material terms of our shares. Because it is only a summary, it may not contain all
the information that is important to you. 

Units 

Each
unit had an offering price of 10.00 and consists of one Class A ordinary share and one redeemable warrant. Only whole warrants
are exercisable. Each whole warrant entitles the holder to purchase one Class A ordinary share at a price of 11.50 per whole share,
subject to adjustment. Pursuant to the warrant agreement, a warrant holder may exercise his, her or its warrants only for a whole number
of Class A ordinary share. 

We
Class A ordinary shares and warrants comprising the units began separate trading on June 3, 2022. Holders have the option to continue
to hold units or separate their units into the component securities. Holders will need to have their brokers contact our transfer agent
in order to separate the units into Class A ordinary shares and warrants. 

Ordinary
Shares 

Prior
to our initial public offering, there were 2,875,000 Class B ordinary shares issued and outstanding, all of which were held of record
by our initial shareholders, so that our initial shareholders will own 19.84 of our issued and outstanding shares after this offering
and the expiration of the underwriters option to purchase additional units. Upon the closing of our initial public offering, 14,490,000
of our ordinary shares are outstanding including: 

11,500,000
Class A ordinary shares underlying the units issued as part of this offering; 

2,875,000
Class B ordinary shares held by our initial shareholders; and 

115,000
Class A ordinary shares issuable to Hutton upon the consummation of this offering. 

Ordinary
shareholders of record are entitled to one vote for each share held on all matters to be voted on by shareholders. Except as described
below, holders of Class A ordinary shares and holders of Class B ordinary shares will vote together as a single class on all
matters submitted to a vote of our shareholders except as required by law. Unless specified in our amended and restated memorandum and
articles of association, or as required by applicable provisions of the Companies Act or applicable share exchange rules, an ordinary
resolution is required to approve any such matter voted on by our shareholders. Approval of certain actions requires a special resolution;
such actions include amending our amended and restated memorandum and articles of association and approving a statutory merger or consolidation
with another company. There is no cumulative voting with respect to the appointment of directors, with the result that the holders of
more than 50 of the shares voted for the appointment of directors can appoint all of the directors. Our shareholders are entitled to
receive ratable dividends when, as and if declared by the board of directors out of funds legally available therefor. Prior to our initial
business combination, only holders of our founder shares will have the right to vote on the appointment of directors. Holders of our
public shares will not be entitled to vote on the appointment of directors during such time. In addition, prior to the completion of
an initial business combination, holders of a majority of our founder shares may remove a member of the board of directors for any reason
by ordinary resolution. The provisions of our amended and restated memorandum and articles of association governing the appointment or
removal of directors prior to our initial business combination may only be amended by a special resolution passed by not less than 90 
of our ordinary shares who attend and vote at our general meeting. Additionally, in a vote to continue the company in a jurisdiction
outside the Cayman Islands (which requires a special resolution), holders of our founder shares will have ten votes for every founder
share and holders of our Class A ordinary shares will have one vote for every Class A ordinary share. 

Because
our amended and restated memorandum and articles of association authorizes the issuance of up to 300,000,000 Class A ordinary shares,
if we were to enter into a business combination, we may (depending on the terms of such a business combination) be required to increase
the number of Class A ordinary shares that we will be authorized to issue at the same time as our shareholders vote on the business
combination to the extent we seek shareholder approval in connection with our initial business combination. 

In
accordance with the Nasdaq corporate governance requirements, we are not required to hold an annual general meeting until one year after
our first fiscal year end following our listing on Nasdaq. There is no requirement under the Companies Act for us to hold annual or extraordinary
general meetings to appoint directors. We may not hold an annual general meeting to appoint new directors prior to the consummation of
our initial business combination. Prior to the completion of an initial business combination, any vacancy on the board of directors may
be filled by a nominee chosen by holders of a majority of our founder shares by ordinary resolution. In addition, prior to the completion
of an initial business combination, holders of a majority of our founder shares may remove a member of the board of directors for any
reason by ordinary resolution. 

We
will provide our public shareholders with the opportunity to redeem all or a portion of their public shares upon the completion of our
initial business combination at a per-share price, payable in cash, equal to the aggregate amount then on deposit in the trust account
calculated as of two business days prior to the consummation of our initial business combination, including interest earned on the funds
held in the trust account and not previously released to us to pay our income taxes, if any, divided by the number of the then-outstanding
public shares, subject to the limitations described herein. The amount in the trust account is initially anticipated to be 10.20 per
public share. The per share amount we will distribute to investors who properly redeem their shares will not be reduced by the deferred
underwriting commissions we will pay to the underwriters. The redemption rights will include the requirement that a beneficial owner
must identify itself in order to validly redeem its shares Our sponsor, officers and directors have entered into a letter agreement with
us, pursuant to which they will agree to waive their redemption rights with respect to any founder shares and public shares held by them
in connection with (i) the completion of our initial business combination and (ii) a shareholder vote to approve an amendment to our
amended and restated memorandum and articles of association (A) that would modify the substance or timing of our obligation to provide
holders of our Class A ordinary shares the right to have their shares redeemed in connection with our initial business combination or
to redeem 100 of our public shares if we do not complete our initial business combination within 15 months from the closing of this
offering (or up to a 21-month period if we choose to extend such period, or as extended by the Company s shareholders in accordance
with our amended and restated memorandum and articles of association) or (B) with respect to any other provision relating to the rights
of holders of our Class A ordinary shares. 

Unlike
many blank check companies that hold shareholder votes and conduct proxy solicitations in conjunction with their initial business combinations
and provide for related redemptions of public shares for cash upon the completion of such initial business combinations even when a vote
is not required by law, if a shareholder vote is not required by applicable law or share exchange listing requirements and we do not
decide to hold a shareholder vote for business or other reasons, we will, pursuant to our amended and restated memorandum and articles
of association, conduct the redemptions pursuant to the tender offer rules of the SEC, and file tender offer documents with the
SEC prior to completing our initial business combination. Our amended and restated memorandum and articles of association requires these
tender offer documents to contain substantially the same financial and other information about the initial business combination and the
redemption rights as is required under the SEC s proxy rules. If, however, a shareholder approval of the transaction is required
by applicable law or share exchange listing requirements, or we decide to obtain shareholder approval for business or other reasons,
we will, like many blank check companies, offer to redeem shares in conjunction with a proxy solicitation pursuant to the proxy rules and
not pursuant to the tender offer rules. If we seek shareholder approval, we will complete our initial business combination only if we
obtain the approval of an ordinary resolution. However, the participation of our sponsor, officers, directors or their affiliates in
privately-negotiated transactions, if any, could result in the approval of our initial business combination even if a majority of our
public shareholders vote, or indicate their intention to vote, against such initial business combination. Our sponsor, officers and directors
has agreed to vote their respective founder shares and any public shares held by them in favor of our initial business combination. The
Representative has not committed to vote any shares held by it in favor of our initial business combination. For purposes of seeking
approval of the majority of our issued and outstanding ordinary shares, non-votes will have no effect on the approval of our initial
business combination once a quorum is obtained. We intend to give approximately 30 days (but not less than 5 clear days 
nor more than 60 days prior written notice of any such meeting, if required, at which a vote shall be taken to approve our initial
business combination. These quorum and voting thresholds, and the voting agreements of our initial shareholders, may make it more likely
that we will consummate our initial business combination. 

2 

If
we seek shareholder approval of our initial business combination and we do not conduct redemptions in connection with our initial business
combination pursuant to the tender offer rules, then, pursuant to our amended and restated memorandum and articles of association, a
public shareholder, together with any affiliate of such shareholder or any other person with whom such shareholder is acting in concert
or as a group (as defined under Section 13 of the Exchange Act), will be restricted from redeeming its shares with
respect to Excess Shares, without our prior consent. However, we would not be restricting our shareholders ability to vote all
of their shares (including Excess Shares) for or against our initial business combination. Our shareholders inability to redeem
the Excess Shares will reduce their influence over our ability to complete our initial business combination, and such shareholders could
suffer a material loss in their investment if they sell such Excess Shares on the open market. Additionally, such shareholders will not
receive redemption distributions with respect to the Excess Shares if we complete our initial business combination. And, as a result,
such shareholders will continue to hold that number of shares exceeding 15 and, would be required to sell their shares in open market
transactions in order to dispose such shares, potentially at a loss. 

If
we seek shareholder approval, we will complete our initial business combination only if we obtain the approval of an ordinary resolution.
In such case, our initial shareholders have agreed to vote their founder shares and public shares in favor of our initial business combination.
As a result, in addition to the founder shares, we would need 550,001 shares or 5.5 (assuming only the minimum number of shares representing
a quorum are voted and the over-allotment option is not exercised and the representative shares are voted in favor of the initial business
combination), or 3,700,0001 or 37.0 (assuming all issued and outstanding shares are voted and the over-allotment option is not exercised
and the representative shares are voted in favor of the initial business combination), of the 10,000,000 public shares sold in this offering
to be voted in favor of an initial business combination in order to have our initial business combination approved. Additionally, each
public shareholder may elect to redeem their public shares irrespective of whether they vote for or against the proposed transaction
or vote at all. 

Pursuant
to our amended and restated memorandum and articles of association, if we have not consummated an initial business combination within
15 months from the closing of this offering (or up to a 21-month period if we choose to extend such period, or as extended by the Company s
shareholders in accordance with our amended and restated memorandum and articles of association), we will (i) cease all operations except
for the purpose of winding up; (ii) as promptly as reasonably possible but not more than ten business days thereafter, redeem the public
shares, at a per-share price, payable in cash, equal to the aggregate amount then on deposit in the trust account, including interest
earned on the funds held in the trust account and not previously released to us to pay our income taxes, if any (less up to 100,000
of interest to pay dissolution expenses) divided by the number of the then-outstanding public shares, which redemption will completely
extinguish public shareholders rights as shareholders (including the right to receive further liquidation distributions, if any);
and (iii) as promptly as reasonably possible following such redemption, subject to the approval of our remaining shareholders and our
board of directors, liquidate and dissolve, subject, in each case to our obligations under Cayman Islands law to provide for claims of
creditors and the requirements of other applicable law. Our sponsor, officers and directors have entered into a letter agreement with
us, pursuant to which they will agree to waive their rights to liquidating distributions from the trust account with respect to any founder
shares they hold if we fail to consummate an initial business combination within 15 months from the closing of this offering (or as extended
by the Company s shareholders in accordance with our amended and restated memorandum and articles of association) (although they
will be entitled to liquidating distributions from the trust account with respect to any public shares they hold if we fail to complete
our initial business combination within the prescribed time frame). However, if our sponsor, our directors, our directors, our advisers,
EF Hutton, or any of their respective affiliates acquire public shares after this offering, they will be entitled to liquidating distributions
from the trust account with respect to such public shares if we fail to complete our initial business combination within the prescribed
time period. Our amended and restated memorandum and articles of association provides that, if we wind up for any other reason prior
to the consummation of our initial business combination, we will follow the foregoing procedures with respect to the liquidation of the
trust account as promptly as reasonably possible but not more than ten business days thereafter, subject to applicable Cayman Islands
law. 

In
the event of a liquidation, dissolution or winding up of the company after a business combination, our shareholders are entitled to share
ratably in all assets remaining available for distribution to them after payment of liabilities and after provision is made for each
class of shares, if any, having preference over the ordinary shares. Our shareholders have no preemptive or other subscription rights.
There are no sinking fund provisions applicable to the ordinary shares, except that we will provide our public shareholders with the
opportunity to redeem their public shares for cash at a per share price equal to the aggregate amount then on deposit in the trust account,
including interest earned on the funds held in the trust account and not previously released to us to pay our income taxes, if any, divided
by the number of the then-outstanding public shares, upon the completion of our initial business combination, subject to the limitations
described herein.

Founder
Shares 

The
founder shares are designated as Class B ordinary shares and, except as described below, are identical to the Class A ordinary
shares included in the units being sold in this offering, and holders of founder shares have the same shareholder rights as public shareholders,
except that: (a) prior to our initial business combination, only holders of the founder shares have the right to vote on the appointment
of directors and holders of a majority of our founder shares may remove a member of the board of directors for any reason by ordinary
resolution; (b) the founder shares are subject to certain transfer restrictions, as described in more detail below; (c) our sponsor,
officers and directors have entered into a letter agreement with us, pursuant to which they will agree to (i) waive their redemption
rights with respect to their founder shares in connection with the completion of our initial business combination, (ii) waive their
redemption rights with respect to their founder shares and public shares in connection with a shareholder vote to approve an amendment
to our amended and restated memorandum and articles of association (A) that would modify the substance or timing of our obligation
to provide holders of our Class A ordinary shares the right to have their shares redeemed in connection with our initial business
combination or to redeem 100 of our public shares if we do not complete our initial business combination within 15 months from the closing
of this offering (or as extended by the Company s shareholders in accordance with our amended and restated memorandum and articles
of association) or (B) with respect to any other provision relating to the rights of holders of our Class A ordinary shares;
and (iii) waive their rights to liquidating distributions from the trust account with respect to any founder shares they hold if
we fail to consummate an initial business combination within 15 months from the closing of this offering (or as extended by the Company s
shareholders in accordance with our amended and restated memorandum and articles of association) (although they will be entitled to liquidating
distributions from the trust account with respect to any public shares they hold if we fail to complete our initial business combination
within the prescribed time frame); (d) the founder shares will automatically convert into our Class A ordinary shares at the
time of our initial business combination or earlier at the option of the holders thereof as described herein; (e) the founder shares
are entitled to registration rights; and (f) in a vote to continue the company in a jurisdiction outside the Cayman Islands (which
requires a special resolution), holders of our founder shares will have ten votes for every founder share and holders of our Class A
ordinary shares will have one vote for every Class A ordinary share. If we seek shareholder approval, we will complete our initial
business combination only if we obtain the approval of an ordinary resolution. In such case, our initial shareholders have agreed to
vote their founder shares and public shares in favor of our initial business combination. 

The
founder shares are designated as Class B ordinary shares and will automatically convert into Class A ordinary shares (which
such Class A ordinary shares delivered upon conversion will not have redemption rights or be entitled to liquidating distributions
from the trust account if we do not consummate an initial business combination) at the time of our initial business combination or earlier
at the option of the holders thereof at a ratio such that the number of Class A ordinary shares issuable upon conversion of all
founder shares will equal, in the aggregate, on an as-converted basis, 20 of the sum of (i) the total number of ordinary shares
issued and outstanding upon the completion of this offering, plus (ii) the total number of Class A ordinary shares issued,
deemed issued or issuable upon conversion or exercise of any equity-linked securities or rights issued or deemed issued by the company
in connection with or in relation to the consummation of the initial business combination, excluding any Class A ordinary shares
or equity-linked securities exercisable for or convertible into Class A ordinary shares issued, deemed issued or to be issued to
any seller in the initial business combination and any placement warrants issued to our sponsor, its affiliates or any member of our
management team upon conversion of working capital loans and the representative shares, unless the holders of a majority of the then-outstanding
Class B ordinary shares agree to waive such adjustment with respect to such issuance or deemed issuance at the time thereof. In
no event will the Class B ordinary shares convert into Class A ordinary shares at a rate of less than one-to-one. 

4 

Except
as described herein, our sponsor, directors and executive officers have agreed not to transfer, assign or sell any of their founder shares
until earliest of (A) six months after the completion of our initial business combination and (B) subsequent to our initial
business combination, (x) if the closing price of our Class A ordinary shares equals or exceeds 12.00 per share (as adjusted
for share subdivisions, share capitalizations, reorganizations, recapitalizations and the like) for any 20 trading days within any 30-trading
day period commencing at least 150 days after our initial business combination, or (y) the date on which we complete a liquidation,
merger, share exchange or other similar transaction that results in all of our public shareholders having the right to exchange their
ordinary shares for cash, securities or other property. We refer to such transfer restrictions as the lock-up. Any permitted transferees
would be subject to the same restrictions and other agreements of our sponsor, directors and executive officers with respect to any founder
shares. 

Prior
to our initial business combination, only holders of our founder shares will have the right to vote on the appointment of directors.
Holders of our public shares will not be entitled to vote on the appointment of directors during such time. In addition, prior to the
completion of an initial business combination, holders of a majority of our founder shares may remove a member of the board of directors
for any reason by ordinary resolution. These provisions of our amended and restated memorandum and articles of association may only be
amended by a special resolution passed by not less than 90 of our ordinary shares who attend and vote at our general meeting. With respect
to any other matter submitted to a vote of our shareholders, including any vote in connection with our initial business combination,
except as required by law, holders of our founder shares and holders of our public shares will vote together as a single class, with
each share entitling the holder to one vote. 

Register
of Members 

Under
Cayman Islands law, we must keep a register of members and there will be entered therein: 

the
names and addresses of the members, a statement of the shares held by each member and of the amount paid or agreed to be considered as
paid on the shares of each member, and the voting rights of shares of each member (and whether such voting rights are conditional); 

whether
voting rights attached to the shares in issue; 

the
date on which the name of any person was entered on the register as a member; and 

the
date on which any person ceased to be a member. 

Under
Cayman Islands law, the register of members of our company is prima facie evidence of the matters set out therein (i.e., the register
of members will raise a presumption of fact on the matters referred to above unless rebutted) and a member registered in the register
of members will be deemed as a matter of Cayman Islands law to have legal title to the shares as set against its name in the register
of members. Upon the closing of this public offering, the register of members will be immediately updated to reflect the issue of shares
by us. Once our register of members has been updated, the shareholders recorded in the register of members will be deemed to have legal
title to the shares set against their name. However, there are certain limited circumstances where an application may be made to a Cayman
Islands court for a determination on whether the register of members reflects the correct legal position. Further, the Cayman Islands
court has the power to order that the register of members maintained by a company should be rectified where it considers that the register
of members does not reflect the correct legal position. If an application for an order for rectification of the register of members were
made in respect of our ordinary shares, then the validity of such shares may be subject to re-examination by a Cayman Islands court. 

Preference
Shares 

Our
amended and restated memorandum and articles of association authorizes 1,000,000 preference shares and provide that preference shares
may be issued from time to time in one or more series. Our board of directors will be authorized to fix the voting rights, if any, designations,
powers, preferences, the relative, participating, optional or other special rights and any qualifications, limitations and restrictions
thereof, applicable to the shares of each series. Our board of directors will be able to, without shareholder approval, issue preference
shares with voting and other rights that could adversely affect the voting power and other rights of the holders of the ordinary shares
and could have anti-takeover effects. The ability of our board of directors to issue preference shares without shareholder approval could
have the effect of delaying, deferring or preventing a change of control of us or the removal of existing management. We have no preference
shares issued and outstanding at the date hereof. Although we do not currently intend to issue any preference shares, we cannot assure
you that we will not do so in the future. No preference shares are being issued or registered in this offering. 

5 

Redeemable
Warrants 

Public
Shareholders Warrants 

Each
whole warrant entitles the registered holder to purchase one Class A ordinary share at a price of 11.50 per share, subject to adjustment
as discussed below, at any time commencing on the later of 12 months from the closing of the offering and the date of the consummation
of our initial business combination. Pursuant to the warrant agreement, a warrant holder may exercise its warrants only for a whole number
of Class A ordinary shares. This means that only a whole warrant may be exercised at any given time by a warrant holder. No fractional
warrants will be issued upon separation of the units and only whole warrants will trade. 

The
warrants will expire five years after the completion of our initial business combination, at 5:00 p.m., New York City time, or earlier
upon redemption or liquidation. 

We
will not be obligated to deliver any Class A ordinary shares pursuant to the exercise of a warrant and will have no obligation to
settle such warrant exercise unless a registration statement under the Securities Act with respect to the Class A ordinary shares
underlying the warrants is then effective and a prospectus relating thereto is current, subject to our satisfying our obligations described
below with respect to registration. No warrant will be exercisable and we will not be obligated to issue Class A ordinary shares
upon exercise of a warrant unless Class A ordinary share issuable upon such warrant exercise has been registered, qualified or deemed
to be exempt under the securities laws of the state of residence of the registered holder of the warrants. In the event that the conditions
in the two immediately preceding sentences are not satisfied with respect to a warrant, the holder of such warrant will not be entitled
to exercise such warrant and such warrant may have no value and expire worthless. In no event will we be required to net cash settle
any warrant. In the event that a registration statement is not effective for the exercised warrants, the purchaser of a unit containing
such warrant will have paid the full purchase price for the unit solely for the share of Class A ordinary share underlying such
unit. 

We
are not registering the Class A ordinary shares issuable upon exercise of the warrants at this time. However, we have agreed that
we will use our best efforts to file with the SEC a registration statement covering the Class A ordinary shares issuable upon exercise
of the warrants, to cause such registration statement to become effective and to maintain a current prospectus relating to those Class A
ordinary shares until the warrants expire or are redeemed, as specified in the warrant agreement. If a registration statement covering
the Class A ordinary shares issuable upon exercise of the warrants is not effective by the 60th business day after the closing of
our initial business combination, warrant holders may, until such time as there is an effective registration statement and during any
period when we will have failed to maintain an effective registration statement, exercise warrants on a cashless basis 
in accordance with Section 3(a)(9) of the Securities Act or another exemption. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if a registration
statement covering the Class A ordinary share issuable upon exercise of the warrants is not effective within a specified period
following the consummation of our initial business combination, warrant holders may, until such time as there is an effective registration
statement and during any period when we shall have failed to maintain an effective registration statement, exercise warrants on a cashless
basis pursuant to the exemption provided by Section 3(a)(9) of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, or the Securities Act,
provided that such exemption is available. If that exemption, or another exemption, is not available, holders will not be able to exercise
their warrants on a cashless basis. 

Once
the warrants become exercisable, we may call the warrants for redemption: 

in
 whole and not in part; 

at
 a price of 0.01 per warrant; 

upon
 not less than 30 days prior written notice of redemption given after the warrants become exercisable (the 30-day
 redemption period to each warrant holder; and 

if,
 and only if, the reported last sale price of the Class A ordinary share equals or exceeds 18.00 per share (as adjusted for
 share subdivisions, share dividends, right issuances, reorganizations, recapitalizations and the like) for any 20 trading days within
 a 30-trading day period commencing once the warrants become exercisable and ending three business days before we send the notice
 of redemption to the warrant holders. 

6 

If
and when the warrants become redeemable by us, we may not exercise our redemption right if the issuance of ordinary shares upon exercise
of the warrants is not exempt from registration or qualification under applicable state blue sky laws or we are unable to effect such
registration or qualification. We will use our best efforts to register or qualify such ordinary shares under the blue sky laws of the
state of residence in those states in which the warrants were offered by us in this offering. 

We
have established the last of the redemption criterion discussed above to prevent a redemption call unless there is at the time of the
call a significant premium to the warrant exercise price. If the foregoing conditions are satisfied and we issue a notice of redemption
of the warrants, each warrant holder will be entitled to exercise its warrant prior to the scheduled redemption date. However, the price
of the Class A ordinary share may fall below the 18.00 redemption trigger price (as adjusted for share subdivisions, share dividends,
reorganizations, recapitalizations and the like) as well as the 11.50 warrant exercise price after the redemption notice is issued. 

If
we call the warrants for redemption as described above, our management will have the option to require any holder that wishes to exercise
its warrant to do so on a cashless basis. In determining whether to require all holders to exercise their warrants on a
 cashless basis, our management will consider, among other factors, our cash position, the number of warrants that are outstanding
and the dilutive effect on our shareholders of issuing the maximum number of Class A ordinary shares issuable upon the exercise
of our warrants. If our management takes advantage of this option, all holders of warrants would pay the exercise price by surrendering
their warrants for that number of Class A ordinary shares equal to the quotient obtained by dividing (x) the product of the
number of Class A ordinary shares underlying the warrants, multiplied by the excess of the fair market value (defined
below) over the exercise price, by (y) the fair market value. The fair market value for this purpose shall mean the
average reported last sale price of the Class A ordinary share for the 10 trading days ending on the third trading day prior to
the date on which the notice of redemption is sent to the holders of warrants. If our management takes advantage of this option, the
notice of redemption will contain the information necessary to calculate the number of Class A ordinary shares to be received upon
exercise of the warrants, including the fair market value in such case. Requiring a cashless exercise in this manner will
reduce the number of shares to be issued and thereby lessen the dilutive effect of a warrant redemption. We believe this feature is an
attractive option to us if we do not need the cash from the exercise of the warrants after our initial business combination. If we call
our warrants for redemption and our management does not take advantage of this option, our sponsor and its permitted transferees would
still be entitled to exercise their placement warrants for cash or on a cashless basis using the same formula described above that other
warrant holders would have been required to use had all warrant holders been required to exercise their warrants on a cashless basis,
as described in more detail below. 

A
holder of a warrant may notify us in writing in the event it elects to be subject to a requirement that such holder will not have the
right to exercise such warrant, to the extent that after giving effect to such exercise, such person (together with such person s
affiliates), to the warrant agent s actual knowledge, would beneficially own in excess of 4.9 or 9.8 (or such other amount as
a holder may specify) of the Class A ordinary shares outstanding immediately after giving effect to such exercise. 

If
the number of outstanding Class A ordinary shares is increased by a share dividend payable in Class A ordinary shares, or by
a split-up of Class A ordinary shares or other similar event, then, on the effective date of such share dividend, split-up or similar
event, the number of Class A ordinary shares issuable on exercise of each warrant will be increased in proportion to such increase
in the outstanding Class A ordinary shares. 

7 

In
addition, if we, at any time while the warrants are outstanding and unexpired, pay a dividend or make a distribution in cash, securities
or other assets to the holders of Class A ordinary share on account of such Class A ordinary shares (or other shares into which the warrants
are convertible), other than (a) as described above, (b) certain ordinary cash dividends, (c) to satisfy the redemption rights of the
holders of Class A ordinary share in connection with a proposed initial business combination, (d) to satisfy the redemption rights of
the holders of Class A ordinary share in connection with a shareholder vote to amend our amended and restated memorandum and articles
of association (i) to modify the substance or timing of our obligation to allow redemption in connection with our initial business combination
or certain amendments to our amended and restated memorandum and articles of association prior thereto or to redeem 100 of our Class
A ordinary share if we do not complete our initial business combination within 15 months from the closing of this offering (or up to
a 21-month period if we choose to extend such period or as extended by the Company s shareholders in accordance with our amended
and restated memorandum and articles of association) or (ii) with respect to any other provision relating to shareholders rights
or pre-initial business combination activity, or (e) in connection with the redemption of our public shares upon our failure to complete
our initial business combination, then the warrant exercise price will be decreased, effective immediately after the effective date of
such event, by the amount of cash and/or the fair market value of any securities or other assets paid on each share of Class A ordinary
share in respect of such event. 

If
the number of our issued and outstanding Class A ordinary shares is decreased by a consolidation, combination, or re-designation
of Class A ordinary shares or other similar event, then, on the effective date of such consolidation, combination, re-designation
or similar event, the number of Class A ordinary shares issuable on exercise of each warrant will be decreased in proportion to
such decrease in outstanding Class A ordinary shares. 

Whenever
the number of Class A ordinary shares purchasable upon the exercise of the warrants is adjusted, as described above, the warrant
exercise price will be adjusted by multiplying the warrant exercise price immediately prior to such adjustment by a fraction (x) the
numerator of which will be the number of Class A ordinary shares purchasable upon the exercise of the warrants immediately prior
to such adjustment, and (y) the denominator of which will be the number of Class A ordinary shares so purchasable immediately
thereafter. 

The
warrants were issued in registered form under a warrant agreement between Continental Stock Transfer Trust Company, as warrant
agent, and us. You should review a copy of the warrant agreement, for a complete description of the terms and conditions applicable to
the warrants. The warrant agreement provides that the terms of the warrants may be amended without the consent of any holder to cure
any ambiguity or correct any mistake, including to conform the provisions of the warrant agreement to the description of the terms of
the warrants and the warrant agreement set forth in the prospectus, or defective provision, but requires the approval by the holders
of at least a majority of the then outstanding public warrants to make any change that adversely affects the interests of the registered
holders of public warrants. 

In
addition, if (x) we issue additional Class A ordinary shares or equity-linked securities for capital raising purposes in connection
with the closing of our initial business combination at a Newly Issued Price of less than 9.20 per share of Class A ordinary share
(with such issue price or effective issue price to be determined in good faith by our board of directors and, in the case of any such
issuance to our sponsor or its affiliates, without taking into account any founder shares held by our sponsor or such affiliates, as
applicable, prior to such issuance), (y) the aggregate gross proceeds from such issuances represent more than 60 of the total equity
proceeds, and interest thereon, available for the funding of our initial business combination on the date of the consummation of our
initial business combination (net of redemptions), and (z) the Market Value is below 9.20 per share, then the exercise price of
the warrants will be adjusted (to the nearest cent) to be equal to 115 of the greater of the Market Value and the Newly Issued Price,
and the 18.00 per share redemption trigger price described above will be adjusted (to the nearest cent) to be equal to 180 of the greater
of the Market Value and the Newly Issued Price. 

The
warrants may be exercised upon surrender of the warrant certificate on or prior to the expiration date at the offices of the warrant
agent, with the exercise form on the reverse side of the warrant certificate completed and executed as indicated, accompanied by full
payment of the exercise price (or on a cashless basis, if applicable), by certified or official bank check payable to us, for the number
of warrants being exercised. The warrant holders do not have the rights or privileges of holders of Class A ordinary share and any
voting rights until they exercise their warrants and receive Class A ordinary shares. After the issuance of Class A ordinary
shares upon exercise of the warrants, each holder will be entitled to one (1) vote for each share held of record on all matters
to be voted on by shareholders. 

8 

No
fractional shares will be issued upon exercise of the warrants. If, upon exercise of the warrants, a holder would be entitled to receive
a fractional interest in a share, we will, upon exercise, round down to the nearest whole number of Class A ordinary shares to be
issued to the warrant holder. 

We
have agreed that, subject to applicable law, any action, proceeding or claim against us arising out of or relating in any way to the
warrant agreement will be brought and enforced in the courts of the State of New York or the United States District Court for the Southern
District of New York, and we irrevocably submit to such jurisdiction, which jurisdiction will be the exclusive forum for any such action,
proceeding or claim. See Risk Factors Our warrant agreement designates the courts of the State of New York or the United
States District Court for the Southern District of New York as the sole and exclusive forum for certain types of actions and proceedings
that may be initiated by holders of our warrants, which could limit the ability of warrant holders to obtain a favorable judicial forum
for disputes with our company. This provision applies to claims under the Securities Act but does not apply to claims under the
Exchange Act or any claim for which the federal district courts of the United States of America are the sole and exclusive forum. 

Placement
warrants 

Except
as described below, the placement warrants have terms and provisions that are identical to those of the warrants being sold as part of
the units in this offering, including as to exercise price, exercisability and exercise period. The placement warrants (including the
Class A ordinary share issuable upon exercise of the placement warrants) will not be transferable, assignable or salable until the
completion of our initial business combination. 

In
addition, holders of our placement warrants are entitled to certain registration rights. 

In
order to finance transaction costs in connection with an intended initial business combination, our sponsor or an affiliate of our sponsor
or certain of our officers and directors may, but are not obligated to, loan us funds as may be required. Up to 1,500,000 of such loans
may be convertible into warrants, at a price of 1.00 per warrant at the option of the lender, upon consummation of our initial business
combination. The warrants would be identical to the placement warrants. 

Our
sponsor has agreed not to transfer, assign or sell any of the placement warrants (including the Class A ordinary shares issuable
upon exercise of any of these warrants) until the date we complete our initial business combination, except that, among other limited
exceptions made to our officers and directors and other persons or entities affiliated with our sponsor. 

Dividends 

We
have not paid any cash dividends on our ordinary shares to date and do not intend to pay cash dividends prior to the completion of an
initial business combination. The payment of cash dividends in the future will be dependent upon our revenues and earnings, if any, capital
requirements and general financial conditions subsequent to completion of an initial business combination. The payment of any cash dividends
subsequent to an initial business combination will be within the discretion of our board of directors at such time. Further, if we incur
any indebtedness, our ability to declare dividends may be limited by restrictive covenants we may agree to in connection therewith. 

Our
Transfer Agent and Warrant Agent 

The
transfer agent for our ordinary shares and warrant agent for our warrants is Continental Stock Transfer Trust Company. We
have agreed to indemnify Continental Stock Transfer Trust Company in its roles as transfer agent and warrant agent, its agents
and each of its shareholders, directors, officers and employees against all claims and losses that may arise out of acts performed or
omitted for its activities in that capacity, except for any liability due to any gross negligence, wilful misconduct or bad faith of
the indemnified person or entity. 

9 

Certain
Differences in Corporate Law 

Cayman
Islands companies are governed by the Companies Act. The Companies Act is modeled on English law but does not follow recent English law
statutory enactments, and differs from laws applicable to United States corporations and their shareholders. Set forth below is a summary
of the material differences between the provisions of the Companies Act applicable to us and the laws applicable to companies incorporated
in the United States and their shareholders. 

Mergers
and Similar Arrangements. In certain circumstances, the Companies Act allows for mergers or consolidations between two Cayman Islands
companies, or between a Cayman Islands exempted company and a company incorporated in another jurisdiction (provided that is facilitated
by the laws of that other jurisdiction). 

Where
the merger or consolidation is between two Cayman Islands companies, the directors of each company must approve a written plan of merger
or consolidation containing certain prescribed information. That plan of merger or consolidation must then be authorized by either (a) a
special resolution (usually a majority of at least two-thirds in value of the voting shares voted at a general meeting) of the shareholders
of each company; or (b) such other authorization, if any, as may be specified in such constituent company s articles of association.
No shareholder resolution is required for a merger between a parent company (i.e., a company that holds issued shares that together represent
90 of the votes at a general meeting of the subsidiary company) and its subsidiary company. The consent of each holder of a fixed or
floating security interest of a constituent company must be obtained, unless the court waives such requirement. If the Cayman Islands
Registrar of Companies is satisfied that the requirements of the Companies Act (which includes certain other formalities) have been complied
with, the Registrar of Companies will register the plan of merger or consolidation. 

Where
the merger or consolidation involves a foreign company, the procedure is similar, save that with respect to the foreign company, the
directors of the Cayman Islands exempted company are required to make a declaration to the effect that, having made due enquiry, they
are of the opinion that the requirements set out below have been met: (i) that the merger or consolidation is permitted or not prohibited
by the constitutional documents of the foreign company and by the laws of the jurisdiction in which the foreign company is incorporated,
and that those laws and any requirements of those constitutional documents have been or will be complied with; (ii) that no petition
or other similar proceeding has been filed and remains outstanding or order made or resolution adopted to wind up or liquidate the foreign
company in any jurisdictions; (iii) that no receiver, trustee, administrator or other similar person has been appointed in any jurisdiction
and is acting in respect of the foreign company, its affairs or its property or any part thereof; and (iv) that no scheme, order,
compromise or other similar arrangement has been entered into or made in any jurisdiction whereby the rights of creditors of the foreign
company are and continue to be suspended or restricted. 

Where
the surviving company is the Cayman Islands exempted company, the directors of the Cayman Islands exempted company are further required
to make a declaration to the effect that, having made due enquiry, they are of the opinion that the requirements set out below have been
met: (i) that the foreign company is able to pay its debts as they fall due and that the merger or consolidation is bona fide and
not intended to defraud unsecured creditors of the foreign company; (ii) that in respect of the transfer of any security interest
granted by the foreign company to the surviving or consolidated company (a) consent or approval to the transfer has been obtained,
released or waived; (b) the transfer is permitted by and has been approved in accordance with the constitutional documents of the
foreign company; and (c) the laws of the jurisdiction of the foreign company with respect to the transfer have been or will be complied
with; (iii) that the foreign company will, upon the merger or consolidation becoming effective, cease to be incorporated, registered
or exist under the laws of the relevant foreign jurisdiction; and (iv) that there is no other reason why it would be against the
public interest to permit the merger or consolidation. 

10 

Where
the above procedures are adopted, the Companies Act provides for a right of dissenting shareholders to be paid a payment of the fair
value of his shares upon their dissenting to the merger or consolidation if they follow a prescribed procedure. In essence, that procedure
is as follows: (a) the shareholder must give his written objection to the merger or consolidation to the constituent company before
the vote on the merger or consolidation, including a statement that the shareholder proposes to demand payment for his shares if the
merger or consolidation is authorized by the vote; (b) within 20 days following the date on which the merger or consolidation is
approved by the shareholders, the constituent company must give written notice to each shareholder who made a written objection; (c) a
shareholder must within 20 days following receipt of such notice from the constituent company, give the constituent company a written
notice of his intention to dissent including, among other details, a demand for payment of the fair value of his shares; (d) within
seven days following the date of the expiration of the period set out in paragraph (b) above or seven days following the date on
which the plan of merger or consolidation is filed, whichever is later, the constituent company, the surviving company or the consolidated
company must make a written offer to each dissenting shareholder to purchase his shares at a price that the company determines is the
fair value and if the company and the shareholder agree the price within 30 days following the date on which the offer was made, the
company must pay the shareholder such amount; and (e) if the company and the shareholder fail to agree a price within such 30 day
period, within 20 days following the date on which such 30 day period expires, the company (and any dissenting shareholder) must file
a petition with the Cayman Islands Grand Court to determine the fair value and such petition must be accompanied by a list of the names
and addresses of the dissenting shareholders with whom agreements as to the fair value of their shares have not been reached by the company.
At the hearing of that petition, the court has the power to determine the fair value of the shares together with a fair rate of interest,
if any, to be paid by the company upon the amount determined to be the fair value. Any dissenting shareholder whose name appears on the
list filed by the company may participate fully in all proceedings until the determination of fair value is reached. These rights of
a dissenting shareholder are not available in certain circumstances, for example, to dissenters holding shares of any class in respect
of which an open market exists on a recognized stock exchange or recognized interdealer quotation system at the relevant date or where
the consideration for such shares to be contributed are shares of any company listed on a national securities exchange or shares of the
surviving or consolidated company. 

Moreover,
Cayman Islands law has separate statutory provisions that facilitate the reconstruction or amalgamation of companies in certain circumstances.
Such schemes of arrangement will generally be more suited for complex mergers or other transactions involving widely held companies,
commonly referred to in the Cayman Islands as a Scheme of arrangement which may be tantamount to a merger. In the event
that a merger was sought pursuant to a scheme of arrangement (the procedures for which are more rigorous and take longer to complete
than the procedures typically required to consummate a merger in the United States), the arrangement in question must be approved by
a majority in number of each class of shareholders and creditors with whom the arrangement is to be made and who must in addition represent
three-fourths in value of each such class of shareholders or creditors, as the case may be, that are present and voting either in person
or by proxy at a general meeting, or meeting summoned for that purpose. The convening of the meetings and subsequently the terms of the
arrangement must be sanctioned by the Grand Court of the Cayman Islands. While a dissenting shareholder would have the right to express
to the court the view that the transaction should not be approved, the court can be expected to approve the arrangement if it satisfies
itself that: 

we
 are not proposing to act illegally or beyond the scope of our corporate authority and the statutory provisions as to majority vote
 have been complied with; 

the
 shareholders have been fairly represented at the meeting in question; 

the
 arrangement is such as a businessman would reasonably approve; and 

the
 arrangement is not one that would more properly be sanctioned under some other provision of the Companies Act or that would amount
 to a fraud on the minority. 

If
a scheme of arrangement or takeover offer (as described below) is approved, any dissenting shareholder would have no rights comparable
to appraisal rights (providing rights to receive payment in cash for the judicially determined value of the shares), which would otherwise
ordinarily be available to dissenting shareholders of United States corporations. 

Squeeze-out
Provisions. When a takeover offer is made and accepted by holders of 90 of the shares to whom the offer relates within four months,
the offeror may, within a two-month period, require the holders of the remaining shares to transfer such shares on the terms of the offer.
An objection can be made to the Grand Court of the Cayman Islands, but this is unlikely to succeed unless there is evidence of fraud,
bad faith, collusion or inequitable treatment of the shareholders. 

Further,
transactions similar to a merger, reconstruction and/or an amalgamation may in some circumstances be achieved through means other than
these statutory provisions, such as a share capital exchange, asset acquisition or control, or through contractual arrangements of an
operating business. 

11 

Shareholders 
Suits. Harney Westwood Riegels, our Cayman Islands legal counsel, is not aware of any reported class action having been brought
in a Cayman Islands court. Derivative actions have been brought in the Cayman Islands courts, and the Cayman Islands courts have confirmed
the availability for such actions. In most cases, we will be the proper plaintiff in any claim based on a breach of duty owed to us,
and a claim against (for example) our officers or directors usually may not be brought by a shareholder. However, based both on Cayman
Islands authorities and on English authorities, which would in all likelihood be of persuasive authority and be applied by a court in
the Cayman Islands, exceptions to the foregoing principle apply in circumstances in which: 

a
 company is acting, or proposing to act, illegally or beyond the scope of its authority; 

the
 act complained of, although not beyond the scope of the authority, could be effected if duly authorized by more than the number of
 votes which have actually been obtained; or 

those
 who control the company are perpetrating a fraud on the minority. 

A
shareholder may have a direct right of action against us where the individual rights of that shareholder have been infringed or are about
to be infringed. 

Enforcement
of Civil Liabilities. The Cayman Islands has a different body of securities laws as compared to the United States and provides less
protection to investors. Additionally, Cayman Islands companies may not have standing to sue before the federal courts of the United
States. 

We
have been advised by Harney Westwood Riegels, our Cayman Islands legal counsel, that the courts of the Cayman Islands are unlikely
(i) to recognize or enforce against us judgments of courts of the United States predicated upon the civil liability provisions of
the federal securities laws of the United States or any state; and (ii) in original actions brought in the Cayman Islands, to impose
liabilities against us predicated upon the civil liability provisions of the federal securities laws of the United States or any state,
so far as the liabilities imposed by those provisions are penal in nature. In those circumstances, although there is no statutory enforcement
in the Cayman Islands of judgments obtained in the United States, the courts of the Cayman Islands will recognize and enforce a foreign
money judgment of a foreign court of competent jurisdiction without retrial on the merits based on the principle that a judgment of a
competent foreign court imposes upon the judgment debtor an obligation to pay the sum for which judgment has been given provided certain
conditions are met. For a foreign judgment to be enforced in the Cayman Islands, such judgment must be final and conclusive and for a
liquidated sum, and must not be in respect of taxes or a fine or penalty, inconsistent with a Cayman Islands judgment in respect of the
same matter, impeachable on the grounds of fraud or obtained in a manner, and or be of a kind the enforcement of which is contrary to
natural justice or the public policy of the Cayman Islands (awards of punitive or multiple damages may well be held to be contrary to
public policy). A Cayman Islands Court may stay enforcement proceedings if concurrent proceedings are being brought elsewhere. 

Special
Considerations for Exempted Companies. We are an exempted company with limited liability under the Companies Act. The Companies Act
distinguishes between ordinary resident companies and exempted companies. Any company that is registered in the Cayman Islands but conducts
business mainly outside of the Cayman Islands may apply to be registered as an exempted company. The requirements for an exempted company
are essentially the same as for an ordinary company except for certain exemptions and privileges including those listed below: 

annual
 reporting requirements are minimal and consist mainly of a statement that the company has conducted its operations mainly outside
 of the Cayman Islands and has compiled with the provisions of the Companies Act; 

an
 exempted company s register of members is not open to inspection and can be kept outside of the Cayman Islands; 

an
 exempted company does not have to hold an annual general meeting; 

12 

an
 exempted company may issue shares with no par value; 

an
 exempted company may obtain an undertaking against the imposition of any future taxation (such undertakings are usually given for
 30 years in the first instance); 

an
 exempted company may register by way of continuation in another jurisdiction and be deregistered in the Cayman Islands; 

an
 exempted company may register as a limited duration company; and 

an
 exempted company may register as a segregated portfolio company. 

Limited
liability means that the liability of each shareholder is limited to the amount if any unpaid on the shares held by such shareholder
in the company (except in exceptional circumstances, such as involving fraud, the establishment of an agency relationship or an illegal
or improper purpose or other circumstances in which a court may be prepared to pierce or lift the corporate veil). 

Our
Second Amended and Restated Memorandum and Articles of Association. 

Our
amended and restated memorandum and articles of association contain provisions designed to provide certain rights and protections relating
to this offering that will apply to us until the completion of our initial business combination. These provisions cannot be amended without
a special resolution under Cayman Islands law. As a matter of Cayman Islands law, a resolution is deemed to be a special resolution where
it has been adopted by the affirmative vote of at least a two-thirds majority (or such higher threshold as specified in the company s
amended and restated memorandum and articles of association) of the votes cast by the holders of the issued shares present in person
or represented by proxy at a general meeting of the company and entitled to vote on such matter or a resolution approved in writing by
all of the holders of the issued shares entitled to vote on such matter. Other than as described above, our amended and restated memorandum
and articles of association provides that special resolutions must be approved either by at least two-thirds (or such higher threshold
as specified in the company s amended and restated articles of association) of the shares voted at a general meeting of the company
(i.e., the lowest threshold permissible under Cayman Islands law), or by a unanimous written resolution of all of our shareholders. 

Our
initial shareholders, who will collectively beneficially own 19.84 of our ordinary shares upon the closing of this offering (assuming
they do not purchase any units in this offering), will participate in any vote to amend our amended and restated memorandum and articles
of association and will have the discretion to vote in any manner they choose. Specifically, our amended and restated memorandum and
articles of association provides, among other things, that: 

If
 we have not consummated an initial business combination within 15 months from the closing of this offering (or up to a 21-month period
 if we choose to extend such period, or as extended by the Company s shareholders in accordance with our amended and restated
 memorandum and articles of association), we will (i) cease all operations except for the purpose of winding up; (ii) as
 promptly as reasonably possible but no more than ten business days thereafter, redeem the public shares, at a per-share price, payable
 in cash, equal to the aggregate amount then on deposit in the trust account, including interest earned on the funds held in the trust
 account and not previously released to us to pay our income taxes that were paid by us or are payable by us, if any (less up to 100,000
 of interest to pay dissolution expenses) divided by the number of the then-outstanding public shares, which redemption will completely
 extinguish public shareholders rights as shareholders (including the right to receive further liquidation distributions, if
 any); and (iii) as promptly as reasonably possible following such redemption, subject to the approval of our remaining shareholders
 and our board of directors, liquidate and dissolve, subject, in each case to our obligations under Cayman Islands law to provide
 for claims of creditors and the requirements of other applicable law; 

Prior
 to or in connection with our initial business combination, we may not issue additional securities that would entitle the holders
 thereof to (i) receive funds from the trust account or (ii) vote as a class with our public shares (a) on our initial
 business combination or on any other proposal presented to shareholders prior to or in connection with the completion of an initial
 business combination or (b) to approve an amendment to our amended and restated memorandum and articles of association to (x) extend
 the time we have to consummate a business combination beyond 15 months from the closing of this offering (or up to a 21-month period
 if we choose to extend such period, or as extended by the Company s shareholders in accordance with our amended and restated
 memorandum and articles of association) or (y) amend the foregoing provisions; 

13 

Although
 we do not intend to enter into a business combination with a target business that is affiliated with our sponsor, officers or directors,
 we are not prohibited from doing so. In the event we enter into such a transaction, we, or a committee of independent directors,
 will obtain an opinion from independent investment banking firm or another independent entity that commonly renders valuation opinions
 that such a business combination is fair to our company from a financial point of view; 

If
 a shareholder vote on our initial business combination is not required by applicable law or share exchange listing requirements and
 we do not decide to hold a shareholder vote for business or other reasons, we will offer to redeem our public shares pursuant to
 Rule 13e-4 and Regulation 14E of the Exchange Act, and will file tender offer documents with the SEC prior to completing our
 initial business combination, which contain substantially the same financial and other information about our initial business combination
 and the redemption rights as is required under Regulation 14A of the Exchange Act; 

So
long as our securities are then listed on Nasdaq, our initial business combination must occur with one or more target businesses that
together have an aggregate fair market value of at least 80 of the value of the net assets held in the trust account (excluding the
amount of deferred underwriting commissions held in trust and taxes payable on the income earned on the trust account) at the time of
signing a definitive agreement in connection with our initial business combination; 

If
 our shareholders approve an amendment to our amended and restated memorandum and articles of association (A) that would modify
 the substance or timing of our obligation to provide holders of our Class A ordinary shares the right to have their shares redeemed
 in connection with our initial business combination or to redeem 100 of our public shares if we do not complete our initial business
 combination within 15 months from the closing of this offering (or up to a 21-month period if we choose to extend such period, or
 as extended by the Company s shareholders in accordance with our amended and restated memorandum and articles of association)
 or (B) with respect to any other provision relating to the rights of holders of our Class A ordinary shares, we will provide
 our public shareholders with the opportunity to redeem all or a portion of their ordinary shares upon such approval at a per-share
 price, payable in cash, equal to the aggregate amount then on deposit in the trust account, including interest earned on the funds
 held in the trust account and not previously released to us to pay our income taxes, if any, divided by the number of the then-outstanding
 public shares, subject to the limitations described herein; and 

We
 will not effectuate our initial business combination solely with another blank check company or a similar company with nominal operations. 

In
addition, our amended and restated memorandum and articles of association provides that under no circumstances will we redeem our public
shares in an amount that would cause our net tangible assets to be less than 5,000,001. 

The
Companies Act permits a company incorporated in the Cayman Islands to amend its memorandum and articles of association with the approval
of a special resolution. A company s articles of association may specify that the approval of a higher majority is required but,
provided the approval of the required majority is obtained, any Cayman Islands exempted company may amend its memorandum and articles
of association regardless of whether its memorandum and articles of association provide otherwise. Accordingly, although we could amend
any of the provisions relating to our proposed offering, structure and business plan which are contained in our amended and restated
memorandum and articles of association, we view all of these provisions as binding obligations to our shareholders and neither we, nor
our officers or directors, will take any action to amend or waive any of these provisions unless we provide dissenting public shareholders
with the opportunity to redeem their public shares.

Anti-Money
Laundering, Counter-Terrorist Financing, Prevention of Proliferation Financing and Financial Sanctions Compliance Cayman Islands 

If
any person resident in the Cayman Islands knows or suspects, or has reasonable grounds for knowing or suspecting, that another person
is engaged in criminal conduct, is involved with terrorism or terrorist property or proliferation financing or is the business combination
partner of a financial sanction and the information for that knowledge or suspicion came to their attention in the course of business
in the regulated sector or other trade, profession, business or employment, the person will be required to report such knowledge or suspicion
to (i) the Financial Reporting Authority of the Cayman Islands, pursuant to the Proceeds of Crime Act (As Revised) of the Cayman
Islands if the disclosure relates to criminal conduct, money laundering, or proliferation financing or is the business combination partner
of a financial sanction; or (ii) a police officer of the rank of constable or higher, or the Financial Reporting Authority, pursuant
to the Terrorism Act (As Revised) of the Cayman Islands, if the disclosure relates to involvement with terrorism or terrorist financing
and property. Such a report will not be treated as a breach of confidence or of any restriction upon the disclosure of information imposed
by any enactment or otherwise. We reserve the right to refuse to make any payment to a shareholder if our directors or officers suspect
or are advised that the payment to such shareholder might result in a breach of applicable anti-money laundering, counter-terrorist financing,
prevention of proliferation financing and financial sanctions or other laws or regulations by any person in any relevant jurisdiction,
or if such refusal is considered necessary or appropriate to ensure our compliance with any such laws or regulations in any applicable
jurisdiction.

records, passport number, bank account details, source of funds details and details relating to the shareholders investment activity. 

15 

Who

you are a natural person, this will affect you directly. If you are a corporate investor (including, for these purposes, legal arrangements
such as trusts or exempted limited partnerships) that provides us with personal data on individuals connected to you for any reason in
relation your investment in the company, this will be relevant for those individuals and you should transmit the content of this Privacy
Notice to such individuals or otherwise advise them of its content. 

How
the Company May Use a Shareholder s Personal Data 

The
company, as the data controller, may collect, store and use personal data for lawful purposes, including, in particular: 

a)
where this is necessary for the performance of our rights and obligations under any purchase agreements; 

b)
where this is necessary for compliance with a legal and regulatory obligation to which we are subject (such as compliance with anti-money
laundering and FATCA/CRS requirements); and/or 

c)
where this is necessary for the purposes of our legitimate interests and such interests are not overridden by your interests, fundamental
rights or freedoms. 

Should
we wish to use personal data for other specific purposes (including, if applicable, any purpose that requires your consent), we will
contact you. 

Why
We May Transfer Your Personal Data 

In
certain circumstances we may be legally obliged to share personal data and other information with respect to your shareholding with the
relevant regulatory authorities such as the Cayman Islands Monetary Authority or the Tax Information Authority. They, in turn, may exchange
this information with foreign authorities, including tax authorities. 

We
anticipate disclosing personal data to persons who provide services to us and their respective affiliates (which may include certain
entities located outside the United States, the Cayman Islands or the European Economic Area), who will process your personal data on
our behalf. 

The
Data Protection Measures We Take 

Any
transfer of personal data by us or our duly authorized affiliates and/or delegates outside of the Cayman Islands shall be in accordance
with the requirements of the DPA. 

We

be
 informed of a personal data breach (unless the breach is unlikely to be prejudicial to you); 

complain
 to the Data Protection Ombudsman; and 

require

Certain
Anti-takeover Provisions of our Second Amended and Restated Memorandum and Articles of Association 

Our
authorized but unissued Class A ordinary shares and preference shares will be available for future issuances without shareholder
approval and could be utilized for a variety of corporate purposes, including future offerings to raise additional capital, acquisitions
and employee benefit plans. The existence of authorized but unissued and unreserved Class A ordinary shares and preference shares
could render more difficult or discourage an attempt to obtain control of us by means of a proxy contest, tender offer, merger or otherwise. 

Variation
of Class Rights 

For
so long as any Class B ordinary shares remain issued and outstanding, we may not, without the prior written consent of the holders
of a two-thirds majority of the Class B ordinary shares then outstanding, or the sanction of a resolution passed at a separate meeting
of the holders of the Class B ordinary shares by a majority of two-thirds of the votes cast at a quorate meeting, voting separately as
a single class, amend, alter or repeal any provision of our memorandum and articles of association, if such amendment, alteration or
repeal would materially adversely vary or abrogate the powers, preferences or relative, participating, optional or other rights of the
Class B ordinary shares. 

Securities
Eligible for Future Sale 

Immediately
after the consummation of this offering (assuming no exercise of the underwriters over-allotment option) we will have 12,600,000
(or 14,490,000 if the underwriters over-allotment option is exercised in full) ordinary shares outstanding. Of these shares, the
10,000,000 shares (or 11,500,000 if the underwriters over-allotment option is exercised in full) sold in this offering will be
freely tradable without restriction or further registration under the Securities Act, except for any shares purchased by one of our affiliates
within the meaning of Rule 144 under the Securities Act. All of the remaining 2,500,000 (or 2,875,000 if the underwriters 
over-allotment option is exercised in full) founder shares are restricted securities under Rule 144, in that they were issued in
private transactions not involving a public offering, and the Class B ordinary shares are subject to transfer restrictions. These
restricted securities will be entitled to registration rights as more fully described below under Registration Rights. 

Rule
144 

Pursuant
to Rule 144, a person who has beneficially owned restricted ordinary shares or warrants for at least six months would be entitled
to sell their securities provided that (i) such person is not deemed to have been one of our affiliates at the time of, or at any
time during the three months preceding, a sale and (ii) we are subject to the Exchange Act periodic reporting requirements for at least
three months before the sale and have filed all required reports under Section 13 or 15(d) of the Exchange Act during the 12 months
(or such shorter period as we were required to file reports) preceding the sale. 

17 

Persons
who have beneficially owned our restricted ordinary shares or warrants for at least six months but who are our affiliates at the time
of, or at any time during the three months preceding, a sale, would be subject to additional restrictions, by which such person would
be entitled to sell within any three-month period only a number of securities that does not exceed the greater of: 

1 
 of the total number of Class A ordinary shares then outstanding, which will equal 126,000 shares immediately after this offering
 (or 144,900) if the underwriters exercise their over-allotment option in full); or 

the
 average weekly reported trading volume of the ordinary shares during the four calendar weeks preceding the filing of a notice on
 Form 144 with respect to the sale. 

Sales
by our affiliates under Rule 144 are also limited by manner of sale provisions and notice requirements and to the availability of
current public information about us. 

Restrictions
on the Use of Rule 144 by Shell Companies or Former Shell Companies 

Rule 144
is not available for the resale of securities initially issued by shell companies (other than business combination related shell companies)
or issuers that have been at any time previously a shell company. However, Rule 144 also includes an important exception to this
prohibition if the following conditions are met: 

the
 issuer of the securities that was formerly a shell company has ceased to be a shell company; 

the
 issuer of the securities is subject to the reporting requirements of Section 13 or 15(d) of the Exchange Act; 

the
 issuer of the securities has filed all Exchange Act reports and materials required to be filed, as applicable, during the preceding
 12 months (or such shorter period that the issuer was required to file such reports and materials), other than Current Reports on
 Form 8-K; and 

at
 least one year has elapsed from the time that the issuer filed current Form 10 type information with the SEC reflecting its
 status as an entity that is not a shell company. 

As
a result, our initial shareholders will be able to sell their founder shares and placement warrant (including component securities contained
therein), as applicable, pursuant to Rule 144 without registration one year after we have completed our initial business combination. 

Registration
Rights 

The
holders of the founder shares, the representative shares, placement warrant (including component securities contained therein) and warrants
(including securities contained therein) that may be issued upon conversion of working capital loans, any Class A ordinary shares
issuable upon the exercise of the placement warrants and any Class A ordinary shares and warrants (and underlying Class A ordinary
share) that may be issued upon exercise of the warrants as part of the working capital loans and Class A ordinary share issuable
upon conversion of the founder shares, will be entitled to registration rights pursuant to a registration rights agreement, requiring
us to register such securities for resale (in the case of the founder shares, only after conversion to our Class A ordinary share).
The holders of the majority of these securities are entitled to make up to three demands, excluding short form demands, that we register
such securities. In addition, the holders have certain piggy-back registration rights with respect to registration statements
filed subsequent to our completion of our initial business combination and rights to require us to register for resale such securities
pursuant to Rule 415 under the Securities Act. The registration rights agreement does not contain liquidated damages or other cash
settlement provisions resulting from delays in registering our securities. We will bear the expenses incurred in connection with the
filing of any such registration statements. We will bear the expenses incurred in connection with the filing of any such registration
statements. 

Listing
of Securities 

Our
units, Class A ordinary shares and warrant are listed on Nasdaq under the symbols AFARU, AFAR , and
