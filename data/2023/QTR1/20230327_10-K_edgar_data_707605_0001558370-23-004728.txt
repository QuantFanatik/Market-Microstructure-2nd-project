 PART I ITEM 1. BUSINESS GENERAL AmeriServ Financial, Inc. (the Company) is a bank holding company organized under the Pennsylvania Business Corporation Law. The Company became a holding company upon acquiring all of the outstanding shares of AmeriServ Financial Bank (the Bank) in January 1983. The Company s other wholly owned subsidiary is AmeriServ Trust and Financial Services Company (the Trust Company) which was formed in October 1992. AmeriServ Life Insurance Company (AmeriServ Life), formed in October 1987, was a captive insurance company that engaged in underwriting as a reinsurer of credit life and disability insurance. New business ceased being generated by AmeriServ Life in 2005. Since that time, the outstanding insurance policies have been running off and the final policy has expired. On September 30, 2020, the Arizona Corporation Commission approved the Articles of Dissolution for AmeriServ Life. The remaining assets of AmeriServ Life were transferred to AmeriServ Financial, Inc. and the subsidiary was formally closed on December 31, 2020. When used in this report, the Company may refer, depending on the context, to AmeriServ Financial, Inc. individually or AmeriServ Financial, Inc. and its direct and indirect subsidiaries. The Company s principal activities consist of owning and operating its two wholly owned subsidiary entities. At December 31, 2022, the Company had, on a consolidated basis, total assets, deposits, and shareholders equity of 1.4 billion, 1.1 billion, and 106.2 million, respectively. The Company and its subsidiaries derive substantially all of their income from banking, bank related services, and trust and wealth management related services. The Company functions primarily as a coordinating and servicing unit for its subsidiary entities in general management, accounting and taxes, loan review, auditing, investment accounting, marketing and risk management. As a bank holding company, the Company is subject to supervision and regular examination by the Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia and the Pennsylvania Department of Banking and Securities (PDB). The Company is also under the jurisdiction of the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) for matters relating to registered offerings and sales of its securities under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and the disclosure and regulatory requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended. The Company s common stock is listed on The NASDAQ Stock Market under the trading symbol ASRV, and the Company is subject to the NASDAQ rules applicable to listed companies. AMERISERV FINANCIAL BANK The Bank is a state bank chartered under the Pennsylvania Banking Code of 1965, as amended (Banking Code). Through 17 branch locations in Allegheny, Cambria, Centre, Somerset, and Westmoreland counties, Pennsylvania and Washington county, Maryland, the Bank conducts a general banking business. It is a full-service bank offering (i) retail banking services, such as demand, savings and time deposits, checking accounts, money market accounts, secured and unsecured consumer loans, mortgage loans, safe deposit boxes, holiday club accounts, and money orders; and (ii) lending, depository and related financial services to commercial, industrial, financial, and governmental customers, such as commercial real estate mortgage loans (CRE), short and medium-term loans, revolving credit arrangements, lines of credit, inventory and accounts receivable financing, real estate construction loans, business savings accounts, certificates of deposit, wire transfers, night depository, and lock box services. The Bank also operates 18 automated bank teller machines (ATMs) through its 24-hour banking network that is linked with NYCE, a regional ATM network, and CIRRUS, a national ATM network. West Chester Capital Advisors (WCCA), a SEC-registered investment advisor, is a subsidiary of the Bank. The Company also operates loan production offices (LPOs) in Altoona and Wilkins Township in Pennsylvania. We believe that the loss of one depositor or a related group of depositors would not have a materially adverse effect on the Bank s business. The Bank s business is not seasonal, nor does it have any risks attendant to foreign sources. A significant majority of the Bank s customer base is located within a 250-mile radius of Johnstown, Pennsylvania, the Bank s headquarters.

Table of Contents 
 The Bank is subject to supervision and regular examination by the Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia and the PDB. Various federal and state laws and regulations govern many aspects of its banking operations. The following is a summary of key data (dollars in thousands) and ratios of the Bank at December 31, 2022: 

Headquarters Johnstown, PA Total Assets 1,350,198 Total Investment Securities 231,750 Total Loans and Loans Held for Sale (net of unearned income) 990,825 Total Deposits 1,111,276 Total Net Income 8,593 Asset Leverage Ratio 9.39 Return on Average Assets 0.65 Return on Average Equity 7.10 Total Full-time Equivalent Employees 247 RISK MANAGEMENT OVERVIEW Risk identification and management are essential elements for the successful management of the Company. In the normal course of business, the Company is subject to various types of risk, which includes credit, interest rate and market, liquidity, operational, legal/compliance, strategic/reputational and security risk. Additionally, in 2022, the Company continued to monitor the risks stemming from the COVID-19 pandemic. The Company seeks to identify, manage and monitor these risks with policies, procedures, and various levels of oversight from the Company s Board of Directors (the Board) and management. The Company has a Management Enterprise Risk Committee with Board of Director representation to help manage and monitor the Company s risk position, which is reported formally to the Board, at a minimum, on a semi-annual basis. Interest rate risk is the sensitivity of net interest income and the market value of financial instruments to the magnitude, direction, and frequency of changes in interest rates. Interest rate risk results from various repricing frequencies and the maturity structure of assets and liabilities. The Company uses its asset liability management policy to monitor and manage interest rate risk. Liquidity risk represents the inability to generate cash or otherwise obtain funds at reasonable rates to satisfy commitments to borrowers, as well as the obligations to depositors, debtholders and the funding of operating costs. The Company uses its asset liability management policy and contingency funding plan to monitor and manage liquidity risk. Credit risk represents the possibility that a customer may not perform in accordance with contractual terms resulting in an economic loss to the organization. Credit risk results from extending credit to customers, purchasing securities, and entering into certain off-balance sheet loan funding commitments. The Company s primary credit risk occurs in the loan portfolio with limited credit risk within the investment portfolio due to holdings of corporate and municipal securities. The Company uses its credit policy and disciplined approach to evaluating the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses (the ALL) to monitor and manage credit risk. The Company s investment policy and hedging policy seeks to limit the amount of credit risk that may be assumed in the investment portfolio and through hedging activities. The following summarizes and describes the Company s various loan categories and the underwriting standards applied to each: Commercial Loans This category includes credit extensions to commercial and industrial borrowers. Business assets, including accounts receivable, inventory and/or equipment, typically secure these credits. The commercial loan segment includes commercial loans secured by owner occupied real estate. In appropriate instances, extensions of credit in this category are subject to collateral advance formulas. Balance sheet strength and profitability are considered when analyzing these credits, with special attention given to historical, current and prospective sources of cash flow, and the ability of the customer to sustain cash flow at acceptable levels. The Bank s policy permits flexibility in determining acceptable debt service coverage ratios. Personal guarantees are frequently required; however, as the financial strength of the borrower increases, the Bank s ability to obtain personal guarantees decreases. In addition to economic risk, this category is impacted by the strength of the borrower s management, industry risk and portfolio concentration risk each of which are also monitored and considered during the underwriting process.

Table of Contents 
 The commercial loan segment also includes Paycheck Protection Program (PPP) loans. The Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act (CARES Act) authorized the Small Business Administration (SBA) to guarantee 100 of the PPP loans made to eligible borrowers pursuant to standards as defined by the SBA. The SBA guarantee on PPP loans minimizes the level of credit risk associated with the loans. As a result, such loans are assigned a 0 risk weight for purposes of calculating the Company s risk-based capital ratios. Therefore, it was deemed appropriate to not allocate any portion of the loan loss reserve for the PPP loans. As of December 31, 2022, the Company had 1 PPP loan outstanding totaling 22,000. Commercial Loans Secured by Non-Owner Occupied Real Estate This category includes various types of loans, including acquisition and construction of investment property. Maximum term, minimum cash flow coverage, leasing requirements, maximum amortization and maximum loan to value ratios are controlled by the Bank s credit policy and follow industry guidelines and norms, and regulatory limitations. Personal guarantees are normally required during the construction phase on construction credits and are frequently obtained on mid to smaller CRE loans. In addition to economic risk, this category is subject to geographic and portfolio concentration risk, each of which are monitored and considered in underwriting. The Company utilizes a robust and diligent risk management framework to monitor the non-owner occupied commercial real estate segment of the portfolio. This analysis considers more forward looking credit metrics such as stress test results and underwriting trend data, coupled with risk tolerance and concentration guidelines. The process is intended to allow identification of emerging risk, in part, to determine any future change to lending policy, underwriting practices or broader lending strategy prior to any indication of performance deterioration. Residential Real Estate Mortgages This category includes mortgages that are secured by residential property. Underwriting of loans within this category is pursuant to Freddie Mac/Fannie Mae underwriting guidelines, with the exception of Community Reinvestment Act (CRA) loans, which have more liberal standards. A meaningful portion of this portfolio consists of home equity loans. The major risk in this category is that a significant downward economic trend would increase unemployment and cause payment default. The Bank does not engage, and has never engaged, in subprime residential mortgage lending. Consumer Loans This category includes consumer installment loans and revolving credit plans. Underwriting is pursuant to industry norms and guidelines. The major risk in this category is a significant economic downturn. INVESTMENTS The strategic focus of the investment securities portfolio is managed for liquidity and earnings in a prudent manner that is consistent with proper bank asset/liability management and current banking practices. The objectives of portfolio management include consideration of proper liquidity levels, interest rate and market valuation sensitivity, and profitability. The investment portfolio of the Company and its subsidiaries are proactively managed, including in accordance with federal and state laws and regulations and in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP). All holdings must meet standards documented in its investment policy, unless otherwise approved by the Company s CEO or the Asset/Liability Management Committee. The investment portfolio is primarily made up of AAA rated agency mortgage-backed securities, high quality corporate securities, taxable municipal securities, and agency securities. Management strives to maintain a portfolio duration that is less than 60 months. Investment securities classified as held to maturity are carried at amortized cost while investment securities classified as available for sale are reported at fair market value.

The estimate of uninsured deposits was done at a single account level and does not take into account total customer balances in the Bank. It should be noted that approximately 50 of these uninsured deposits relate to public funds from municipalities, government entities, and

 school districts which by law are required to be collateralized with investment securities or FHLB letters of credit to protect these depositor funds. The maturities on CDs with balances that exceed the FDIC insurance limit of 250,000 as of December 31, 2022, are as follows:

Mortgages sold in the secondary market are sold to investors on a flow basis; mortgages are priced and delivered on a best efforts pricing basis, with servicing released to the investor. Fannie Mae/Freddie Mac guidelines are used in underwriting all mortgages with the exception of a limited amount of CRA loans and internal special programs. Mortgages with longer terms, such as 30-year, FHA, and VA loans, are usually sold. The remaining production of the department includes construction, adjustable rate mortgages, and quality non-salable loans. These loans are usually kept in the Bank s portfolio. AMERISERV TRUST AND FINANCIAL SERVICES COMPANY AmeriServ Trust and Financial Services Company is a trust company organized under Pennsylvania law in October 1992. Its staff of approximately 45 professionals administers assets valued at approximately 2.3 billion that are not recognized on the Company s balance sheet at December 31, 2022. The Trust Company focuses on wealth management. Wealth management includes personal trust products and services such as personal portfolio investment management, estate planning and administration, custodial services and pre-need trusts. Also, institutional trust products and services such as 401(k) plans, defined benefit and defined contribution employee benefit plans, and individual retirement accounts are included in this segment. This segment also includes financial services, which provide the sale of mutual funds, annuities, and insurance products. The wealth management business also includes the union collective investment funds, the ERECT funds, which are designed to use union pension dollars in construction projects that utilize union labor. At December 31, 2022, the Trust Company had total assets of 6.7 million and total stockholder s equity of 6.5 million. In 2022, the Trust Company contributed earnings to the Company as its gross revenue amounted to 10.6 million and the net income contribution was 1.3 million. The Trust Company is subject to regulation and supervision by the Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia and the PDB. MONETARY POLICIES Commercial banks are affected by policies of various regulatory authorities including the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (the Federal Reserve). An important function of the Federal Reserve is to regulate the national supply of bank credit. Among the instruments of monetary policy used by the Federal Reserve are: open market operations in U.S. Government securities, changes in the federal funds rate and discount rate on member bank borrowings, and changes in reserve requirements on bank deposits. These means are used in varying combinations to influence overall growth of bank loans, investments, and deposits, and may also affect interest rate charges on loans or interest paid for deposits. The monetary policies of the Federal Reserve have had a significant effect on the operating results of commercial banks in the past and are expected to continue to do so in the future. COMPETITION Our subsidiaries face strong competition from other commercial banks, savings banks, credit unions, savings and loan associations, and other financial or investment service institutions for business in the communities they serve.

 Several of these institutions are affiliated with major banking and financial institutions which are substantially larger and have greater financial resources than the Bank and the Trust Company. As the financial services industry continues to consolidate, the scope of potential competition affecting our subsidiaries will also increase. Brokerage houses, consumer finance companies, insurance companies, financial technology firms, and pension trusts are important competitors for various types of financial services. Personal and corporate trust investment counseling services are offered by insurance companies, other firms, and individuals. In addition, some of these competitors, such as credit unions, are subject to a lesser degree of regulation or taxation than that imposed on us. MARKET AREA ECONOMY U.S. inflation surged with in 2022, reaching heights unseen since the early 1980s. Increasing prices shrank Americans inflation-adjusted pay despite high wage growth for many. Pandemic price pressures, dismissed as transitory, turned out to be enduring and the Russia / Ukraine war caused a fresh spike in food and energy costs. A surge in demand coming out of the COVID-19 recession, coupled with lingering supply-chain disruptions and labor shortages, created a perfect storm for price increases. The Fed increased interest rates aggressively at the risk of plunging the world s largest economy into recession. Positive second half 2022 GDP growth tempered recessionary fears, though 2023 concerns continue to exist. Interest rate-sensitive sectors like autos and housing were impacted the most by the Fed tightening, but pent-up demand and pandemic savings kept spending elevated. The labor market remains historically tight, showing strong wage pressures and solid job growth despite 425 basis points of Fed tightening. Job growth slowed somewhat over the course of 2022, but with the 12-month average around 400k it is nearly double the pre-pandemic average. The Fed is looking for much slower job growth as it aims to rebalance labor supply and demand in its mission to cool wage pressures. Supply chain improvements have cooled some producer price inflation. Rising mortgage rates and elevated house prices have pulled sales down from their pandemic peaks. Johnstown, Pennsylvania, where the Company is headquartered, continues to have a cost of living that is lower than the national average. Johnstown is home to The University of Pittsburgh at Johnstown, Pennsylvania Highlands Community College and Conemaugh Health System. The high-tech defense industry is the main non-health care staple of the Johnstown economy, with the region fulfilling many federal government contracts, punctuated by one of the premier defense trade shows in the U.S., the annual Showcase for Commerce. The city also hosts annual events such as the Flood City Music Festival and the Thunder in the Valley Motorcycle Rally, each of which draw several thousand visitors. The Johnstown, PA MSA unemployment rate decreased from a 7.0 average in 2021 to a 5.1 average in 2022. The Johnstown, PA MSA continues to have one of the highest jobless rates among the 18 metropolitan statistical areas across the state. As of December 31, 2022, employment within the Johnstown MSA has not yet recovered to pre-pandemic levels as there were 83,600 persons employed compared to 88,400 employed at December 31, 2019 representing a decline of 4,800 jobs, or 5.4 . This economic data, coupled with a declining population trend, creates a growth challenge moving forward. Economic conditions are stronger in the State College market and have demonstrated the same improvement experienced in the national economy. The community is a college town, dominated economically and demographically by the presence of the University Park campus of the Pennsylvania State University. Happy Valley is another often-used term to refer to the State College area, including the borough and the townships of College, Harris, Patton, and Ferguson. The unemployment rate for the State College MSA decreased from a 4.6 average in 2021 to a 3.2 average in 2022 and remains one of the lowest of all regions in the Commonwealth. A large percentage of the population in State College falls into the 18 to 34-year-old age group, while potential customers in the Cambria/Somerset markets tend to be over 50 years of age. Hagerstown in Washington County, Maryland offers a rare combination of business advantages providing a major crossroads location that is convenient to the entire East Coast at the intersection of I-81 and I-70. It has a workforce of over 400,000 with strengths in manufacturing and technology. It also offers an affordable cost of doing business and living, all within an hour of the Washington, D.C./Baltimore regions.

The Hagerstown, MD-Martinsburg, WV MSA unemployment rate decreased from a 4.5 average in 2021 to a 3.4 average in 2022. The Company also has loan production offices in Wilkins Township in Allegheny County and Altoona in Blair County, Pennsylvania. Wilkins Township in Allegheny County, Pennsylvania is located 15 miles east of the city of Pittsburgh.

Pittsburgh is also the home of the Pirates, Steelers and Penguins. The unemployment rate for the Pittsburgh MSA decreased from a 6.4 average in 2021 to a 4.3 average in 2022. Altoona is the business center of Blair County, Pennsylvania with a strong retail, government and manufacturing base. The top field of employment in Altoona and the metro area is healthcare.

The Company is under a four-year labor contract with the United Steelworkers Local, which will expire on October 15, 2025. The contract calls for annual wage increases of 2 during the life of the contract. The Company has not experienced a work stoppage since 1979. Unionization in financial institutions remains exceptionally low with less than 0.25 of banks nationwide being covered by a Collective Bargaining Agreement. This unique unionization situation creates both challenges and opportunities for the Company. The key goals of organized labor are to provide their members with strong wages and benefits, stable jobs, and safe and respectable workplaces. As a result of these key union goals, the Company s salaries and benefit costs are higher than its non-union peers as we offer good wages and strong benefits which include affordable health care and strong retirement benefits with the majority of current union employees participating in a defined benefit pension plan. The Company has consistently viewed its positive union relationships as a potential source of additional revenue. Examples of success in these efforts include the previously mentioned ERECT Fund where the wealth management group is trustee for this 250 million fund whose purpose is to invest in commercial construction projects with the requirement that they utilize union labor. The Bank has also been a preferred mortgage and consumer loan provider for the Pennsylvania State Education Association for almost 10 years which provides us with the opportunity to expand our lending in these products throughout Pennsylvania. Since inception of the partnership, the Bank has funded approximately 280 million in mortgage and consumer loans to unionized teachers and their family members. INDUSTRY REGULATION The banking and trust industry, and the operation of bank holding companies, is highly regulated by federal and state law, and by numerous regulations adopted by the federal and state banking agencies. Bank regulation affects all aspects of conducting business as a bank, including such major items as minimum capital requirements, limits on types and amounts of investments, loans and other assets, as well as borrowings and other liabilities, and numerous restrictions or requirements on the loan terms and other products made available to customers, particularly consumers. Federal deposit insurance from the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) is required for all banks in the United States, and maintaining FDIC insurance requires observation of the various rules of the FDIC, as well as payment of deposit insurance premiums. New branches, or acquisitions or mergers, are required to be pre-approved by the responsible agency, which in the case of the Company and the Bank is the Federal Reserve and the PDB. The Bank provides detailed financial information to its regulators, including a quarterly call report that is filed pursuant to detailed prescribed instructions to ensure that all U.S. banks report the same way. The U.S. banking laws and regulations are frequently updated and amended, especially in response to crises in the financial industry, such as the global financial crisis of 2008, which resulted in the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act enacted in 2010 (the Dodd-Frank Act), a statute affecting many facets of the financial industry. The Economic Growth, Regulatory Relief, and Consumer Protection Act was enacted into law in 2018 and was designed to ease certain restrictions imposed by the Dodd-Frank Act. The Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act (CARES Act) was enacted into law on March 27, 2020 in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. On March 12, 2023, the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System established a new Bank Term Funding Program (BTFP), offering loans of up to one year in length to banks, savings associations, credit unions, and other eligible depository institutions pledging U.S. Treasuries, agency debt and mortgage-backed securities, and other qualifying assets as collateral. These assets will be valued at par. The BTFP is intended to be an additional source of

 liquidity against high-quality securities, eliminating an institution s need to quickly sell those securities in times of stress it will make available additional funding to eligible depository institutions to help assure banks have the ability to meet the needs of all their depositors. While it is impractical to discuss all laws and regulations that regularly affect the business of the Company and its subsidiaries, set forth below is an overview of some of the major provisions and statutes that apply. CAPITAL REQUIREMENTS One of the most significant regulatory requirements for banking institutions is minimum capital, imposed as a ratio of capital to assets. The Federal Deposit Insurance Act, as amended (FDIA), identifies five capital categories for insured depository institutions: well capitalized, adequately capitalized, undercapitalized, significantly undercapitalized and critically undercapitalized. It requires U.S. federal bank regulatory agencies to implement systems for prompt corrective action for insured depository institutions that do not meet minimum capital requirements based on these categories. Both federal and state banking regulation impose progressively more restrictive constraints on operations, management and capital distributions, depending on the category in which an institution is classified. Unless a bank is well capitalized, it is subject to restrictions on its ability to utilize brokered deposits and on other aspects of its operations. Generally, a bank is prohibited from paying any dividend or making any capital distribution or paying any management fee to its holding company if the bank would thereafter be undercapitalized. As of December 31, 2022, the Company believes that its bank subsidiary was well capitalized, based on the prompt corrective action guidelines described above. On January 1, 2015, U.S. federal banking agencies implemented the Basel III capital standards, which establish the minimum capital levels to be considered well-capitalized and revised the prompt corrective action requirements under banking regulations. The revisions from the previous standards include a revised definition of capital, the introduction of a minimum common equity tier 1 capital ratio and changed risk weightings for certain assets. Under the current rules, in order to avoid limitations on capital distributions (including dividend payments and certain discretionary bonus payments to executive officers), a banking organization must hold a capital conservation buffer above its minimum risk-based capital requirements of 2.50 of total risk weighted assets. The capital to risk-adjusted assets requirements for minimum capital plus the applicable buffer, and the requirement to be well capitalized, are as follows: 

Minimum Capital Well Plus Buffer Capitalized Common equity tier 1 capital ratio 7.00 6.50 Tier 1 capital ratio 8.50 8.00 Total capital ratio 10.50 10.00 DIVIDEND RESTRICTIONS The primary source of cash to pay dividends, if any, to the Company s shareholders and to meet the Company s obligations is dividends paid to the Company by the Bank and the Trust Company. Dividend payments by the Bank to the Company are subject to the laws of the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania, the Banking Code, the FDIA and the regulation of the PDB and the Federal Reserve. Under the Banking Act and the FDIA, a bank may not pay any dividends if, after paying such dividends, it would be undercapitalized under applicable capital requirements. In addition to these explicit limitations, the federal regulatory agencies are authorized to prohibit a banking subsidiary or bank holding company from engaging in unsafe or unsound banking practices. Depending upon the circumstances, the agencies could take the position that paying a dividend would constitute an unsafe or unsound banking practice. It is the policy of the Federal Reserve that bank holding companies should pay cash dividends on common stock only out of income available from the immediately preceding year and only if prospective earnings retention is consistent with the organization s expected future needs and financial condition. The policy provides that bank holding companies should not maintain a level of cash dividend that undermines the bank holding company s ability to serve as a source of strength to its banking subsidiary. A bank holding company may not pay dividends when it is insolvent. For more information regarding quarterly cash dividends, see Part II, Item 5. Market for the Registrant s Common Equity, Related Stockholder Matters and Issuer Purchases of Equity Securities below.

 PRIVACY PROVISIONS Federal banking regulators adopted rules that limit the ability of banks and other financial institutions to disclose non-public information about customers to non-affiliated third parties. These limitations require disclosure of privacy policies to consumers and, in some circumstances, allow consumers to prevent disclosure of certain personal information to non-affiliated third parties. The privacy provisions affect how consumer information is transmitted through diversified financial companies and conveyed to outside vendors. The Company believes it is in compliance with the various provisions. USA PATRIOT ACT A major focus of governmental policy on financial institutions has been aimed at combating money laundering and terrorist financing. The USA Patriot Act substantially broadened the scope of United States anti-money laundering laws and regulations by imposing significant new compliance and due diligence obligations, creating new crimes and penalties and expanding the extra-territorial jurisdiction of the United States. The United States Treasury Department has issued and, in some cases, proposed a number of regulations that apply various requirements of the USA Patriot Act to financial institutions. These regulations impose obligations on financial institutions to maintain appropriate policies, procedures and controls to detect, prevent and report money laundering and terrorist financing and to verify the identity of their customers. Failure of a financial institution to maintain and implement adequate programs to combat money laundering and terrorist financing, or to comply with all of the relevant laws or regulations, could have serious legal and reputational consequences for the Company. CORONAVIRUS AID, RELIEF, AND ECONOMIC SECURITY ACT The Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act (CARES Act) was enacted into law on March 27, 2020. Federal, state, and local governments adopted various statutes, rules, regulations, orders, and guidelines in order to address the COVID-19 pandemic and the adverse economic effects of the pandemic on individuals, families, businesses, and governments. Financial institutions, including the Company, were affected by many of these measures, including measures that were broadly applicable to businesses operating in the communities where the Company does business. Financial services firms, like the Company, were required to operate in a manner that seeked to protect the health and safety of their customers and employees. In addition, the federal banking agencies along with state bank regulators issued an interagency statement on March 22, 2020, addressing loan modifications that were made by financial institutions for borrowers affected by the COVID-19 crisis. The agencies stated that short-term loan modifications made on a good faith basis in response to COVID-19 for borrowers who were current prior to any relief did not need to be categorized as TDRs and that financial institutions were not expected to designate loans with deferrals granted due to COVID-19 as past due because of the deferral. The CARES Act contained a number of provisions that affected banking organizations. The CARES Act provided funding for various programs under which the federal government lended to, guaranteed loans to, or made investments in businesses. Banking organizations were expected to play a role in some of those programs, and when they did so, they were subject to certain requirements. One of those programs was the Paycheck Protection Program (PPP), a program administered by the Small Business Administration (SBA) that provided loans to small businesses for payroll and other basic expenses during the COVID-19 crisis. The loans could be made by SBA-certified lenders and were 100 guaranteed by the SBA. The loans were eligible to be forgiven if certain conditions were satisfied, in which event the SBA would make payment to the lender for the forgiven amounts. The Bank participated in the PPP as a lender. In accordance with the CARES Act, a PPP loan is assigned a risk weight of zero percent under the federal banking agencies risk-based capital rules. The CARES Act also authorized temporary changes to certain provisions applicable to banking organizations. Among other changes, Section 4013 of the CARES Act gave financial institutions the right to elect to suspend GAAP principles and regulatory determinations for loan modifications relating to COVID-19 that would otherwise be categorized as TDRs from March 1, 2020, through the earlier of December 31, 2020, or 60 days after the COVID-19 national emergency ended. On April 7, 2020, the federal banking agencies, in consultation with state bank regulators, issued an interagency statement clarifying the interaction between (i) their earlier statement discussing whether loan modifications relating to COVD-19 need to be treated as TDRs and (ii) the CARES Act provision on this subject. In this interagency statement, the agencies also said that when exercising supervisory and enforcement responsibility with respect to consumer protection requirements, they would take into account the unique circumstances impacting

 borrowers and institutions resulting from the COVID-19 emergency and that they did not expect to take a consumer compliance public enforcement action against an institution, provided that the circumstances were related to this emergency and the institution made good faith efforts to support borrowers and comply with the consumer protection requirements and addressed any needed corrective action. The suspension of TDR identification and accounting triggered by the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic was extended by the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2021, signed into law on December 27, 2020. The period established by Section 4013 of the CARES Act was extended to the earlier of January 1, 2022 or 60 days after the date on which the national COVID-19 emergency terminated. It is currently anticipated that the national COVID-19 emergency will terminate on May 11, 2023.

 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (MD A) The following discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations of the Company should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements of the Company including the related notes thereto, included elsewhere herein. RESULTS OF OPERATIONS FOR THE YEARS ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2022, 2021, AND 2020 2022 SUMMARY OVERVIEW: During a period of extreme economic volatility in 2022, characterized by the highest inflation in almost 40 years and a more than 4 increase in short-term interest rates by the Federal Reserve, the Company was able to achieve its highest earnings per share (EPS) performance in over 20 years and a 15 increase in dividend payments to shareholders. The Company is proud of the hard work of the AmeriServ bankers that made this success happen and allowed us to get mostly back to normal when it comes to customer service. These efforts included overcoming the challenges created by the pandemic and we are deeply grateful to our very patient customers and staff members who have been more than willing to go the extra mile. Turning back to financial performance: Net income for 2022 totaled 7,448,000, or 0.43 diluted earnings per share, which represented a 4.9 increase over the full year of 2021. On an adjusted non-GAAP basis, excluding the impact of pension settlement charges which are not reflective of the operations of the Company, adjusted net income totaled 9,470,000, or 0.55 adjusted diluted earnings per share 1 )( 2 . This represented an even stronger 12 increase in EPS from the adjusted 2021 full year results. The improved earnings performance for 2022, on both an actual and adjusted basis, reflects the full benefit of several important strategic actions that the Company executed in 2021 to reduce our cost of funding, the successful management of our asset quality throughout the pandemic, and effective balance sheet management. While 2021 was a year with near record loan demand, 2022 was still very active but less strong. A late year surge in lending permitted AmeriServ to report good loan totals in December and end the year on a positive note. We hope this continues into 2023, and we believe we have the capacity for our loan portfolio to reach 1 billion for the first time as our lending continues to be an important economic driver in the communities where we operate. The media has perpetuated the narrative that, as the Federal Reserve continues to raise interest rates, loans may become scarce. However, here in western Pennsylvania, more folks are savers than spenders. This means that our friends and neighbors have provided us with more stable deposits to continue to focus on growing the loan portfolio. AmeriServ will continue to be active in lending, but we also will continue to be rigorous in our loan underwriting standards. This will permit us to grow loans while maintaining a high-quality portfolio. Wealth management is involved in a day-to-day struggle with the turmoil in securities markets. The bear market in equities and bonds has been punishing individual estate plans. There have been market value losses even in the AmeriServ Pathroad portfolio. However, our team of professionals have taken their customary stop loss actions. Our clients understand the Pathroad investment logic and are patiently watching the markets for any signs of an impending turnaround. Fortunately, the Pathroad logic has been tested by similar recessions over the years and it has always proven to keep losses below other investment strategies. We note that not only has the number of clients involved in the Pathroad logic remained virtually stable during this market but also, the number of new clients has increased as investors have taken notice of the Pathroad records. We believe our clients biggest concern is about the duration of this bear market. History tells us that the most significant market value gains often occur during the beginning of a turnaround. It is our job to monitor for that turnaround and be ready to take the appropriate actions for our clients. Our Board, management group, and team of banking and investment professionals are studying and working hard every day. We support their efforts and have the utmost confidence in their strategies. Understanding western Pennsylvania as we do, it is not difficult for us to build the kind of banking and investment strategies needed by our

 customers. It is also our goal to offer a solid stock that continues to build value for all our shareholders. Our stock currently has a 3 dividend yield and an active trading market. PERFORMANCE OVERVIEW. The following table summarizes some of the Company s key profitability performance indicators for each of the past three years. 

YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2022 2021 2020 (IN THOUSANDS, EXCEPT PER SHARE DATA AND RATIOS) Net income 7,448 7,072 4,598 Net income, adjusted (1)(2) 9,470 8,471 4,598 Diluted earnings per share 0.43 0.41 0.27 Diluted earnings per share, adjusted (1)(2) 0.55 0.49 0.27 Return on average assets 0.55 0.52 0.37 Return on average assets, adjusted (1)(2) 0.70 0.63 0.37 Return on average equity 6.83 6.48 4.52 Return on average equity, adjusted (1)(2) 8.69 7.76 4.52 The Company reported net income of 7,448,000, or 0.43 per diluted common share, in 2022. This represents a 4.9 increase in earnings per share from the full year of 2021 when net income totaled 7,072,000, or 0.41 per diluted common share. On an adjusted basis, eliminating the impact of the pension settlement charge, diluted earnings per share for the 2022 year increased by 12 to 0.55 1 )( 2 , while adjusted net income improved to 9,470,000 (1)(2) . Due to the effects of eliminating the pension settlement charge, the Company s return on average assets (ROA) in 2022 would improve from 0.55 to an adjusted ROA of 0.70 (1)(2) . Further, the Company s return on average equity (ROE) in 2022 would improve from 6.83 to an adjusted ROE of 8.69 (1)(2) . The improved earnings performance for the 2022 year, on both an actual and adjusted basis, reflects the full benefit of several important strategic actions that the Company executed in 2021, the successful management of our asset quality throughout the pandemic, and effective balance sheet management. Overall, the increase in net interest income, along with a reduced loan loss provision, more than offset a lower level of non-interest income and higher non-interest expense resulting in an improved earnings performance in 2022. Finally, the Company s tangible book value per share ended 2022 at 5.40 (1) a decrease of 10.3 from 2021. The decline in tangible book value per share in 2022 reflects a decrease in the fair value of the Company s available for sale investment securities due to higher interest rates. The Company continued to maintain strong capital ratios that exceed the regulatory defined well capitalized status. The Company reported net income of 7.1 million, or 0.41 per diluted common share, for 2021. This represented a 51.9 increase in earnings per share from 2020 when net income totaled 4.6 million, or 0.27 per diluted common share. During 2021, earnings demonstrated meaningful improvement as the Company realized the benefit of several important strategic actions that were executed during the year. Overall, increased net interest income, a growing level of non-interest income, and a reduced loan loss provision more than offset a higher level of non-interest expense resulting in an improved earnings performance. The Company reported net income of 4.6 million, or 0.27 per diluted common share, for 2020. This represented a 22.9 decrease in earnings per share from 2019 when net income totaled 6.0 million, or 0.35 per diluted common share. During 2020, the Company dealt with the many unexpected challenges resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic. We continued our conservative risk management posture and prudently built our allowance for loan losses to address increased credit risk in certain sectors of our loan portfolio which was a primary factor causing the decline in earnings between years. NET INTEREST INCOME AND MARGIN. The Company s net interest income represents the amount by which interest income on earning assets exceeds interest paid on interest bearing liabilities. Net interest income is a primary source of the Company s earnings; it is affected by interest rate fluctuations as well as changes in the amount

Table of Contents 
 and mix of earning assets and interest bearing liabilities. The following table summarizes the Company s net interest income performance for each of the past three years: 

YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2022 2021 2020 (IN THOUSANDS, EXCEPT RATIOS) Interest income 49,058 46,669 46,882 Interest expense 8,495 7,586 10,515 Net interest income 40,563 39,083 36,367 Net interest margin 3.27 3.15 3.19 2022 NET INTEREST PERFORMANCE OVERVIEW. The Company s net interest income for the full year of 2022 increased by 1.5 million, or 3.8 , when compared to the full year of 2021. The Company s net interest margin was 3.27 for the full year of 2022 representing a 12 basis point improvement from the full year of 2021. Net interest income demonstrated an increasing trend through the first three quarters of 2022 as interest income increased to a higher level than the increase in interest expense. However, this positive trend reversed in the fourth quarter as interest expense increased to a higher level than the increase in interest income. The Company benefitted from the higher U.S. Treasury yield curve as interest rates increased due to the Federal Reserve s action to tighten monetary policy in their effort to tame decades high inflation. The higher interest rate environment along with increased investment in the securities portfolio more than offset a reduced level of Paycheck Protection Program (PPP) loan fee income and caused total interest income to increase for the full year of 2022 when compared to last year. The increased national interest rates also resulted in total deposit and borrowing costs increasing in 2022. However, the increase in deposit interest expense was partially offset by a 26 reduction in total borrowings interest expense, as the strategic actions taken by management in 2021 to lower funding costs favorably impacted financial performance. Overall, in 2022, the average balance of total interest earning assets was consistent with the full year 2021 average, totaling 1.2 billion. Specifically, total loans averaged 978 million in 2022 which is 11.2 million, or 1.1 , lower than the 2021 full year average. Short-term investments including commercial paper averaged 23.2 million in 2022 which is 24.1 million, or 50.9 , lower than the 2021 full year average. Total investment securities averaged 245.2 million in 2022 which is 35.3 million, or 16.8 , higher than the 2021 full year average. Despite the balance of total average interest earning assets remaining relatively unchanged from the prior year, total interest income increased by 2.4 million, or 5.1 , between years due to an increase in the yield on earning assets, which increased from 3.76 to 3.95 . Total deposits, including non-interest bearing demand deposits, averaged 1.156 billion for the full year of 2022, which was 1.9 million, or 0.2 , higher than the 1.154 billion average for the full year of 2021. The 2022 full year average of short-term and FHLB borrowed funds was 43 million, which represented a decrease of 7.2 million, or 14.5 . Overall, the cost of total interest bearing liabilities increased from 0.75 to 0.84 . COMPONENT CHANGES IN NET INTEREST INCOME: 2022 VERSUS 2021. Regarding the separate components of net interest income, the Company s total interest income in 2022 increased by 2.4 million, or 5.1 , when compared to 2021. Total average earning assets remained consistent in 2022 as there was a decreased level of average total loans and short-term investments which were offset by an increased level of average total investment securities. Despite this, interest income was favorably impacted by an increase in the earning asset yield which improved by 19 basis points from 3.76 to 3.95 . All categories within the earning asset base demonstrated an interest income increase between years. The average total loan portfolio yield increased by 14 basis points from 4.11 to 4.25 in 2022 while the average yield on total investment securities increased by 13 basis points from 2.87 to 3.00 . Total average loans for the full year of 2022 were 11.2 million, or 1.1 , lower than the 2021 full year average. Strong loan pipelines resulted in 2022 production more than offsetting a higher than typical level of payoff activity during the year. Excluding PPP loans, total average loans for the full year of 2022 exceeded the 2021 full year average by 30.1 million, or 3.2 , as growth of commercial real estate (CRE) and home equity loans along with a higher volume of residential mortgage loans more than offset a decrease in the level of commercial industrial loans. Of the approximately 100 million of PPP loans originated from the government stimulus programs, only one very small PPP loan remains on the balance sheet, reflecting the Company s successful efforts working with our customers through the Small Business Administration (SBA) to complete the forgiveness process. Overall, the higher interest rate environment along with the higher average volumes of CRE, residential mortgages and home equity loans, resulted in total loan

 interest income improving by 899,000, or 2.2 , for 2022 when compared to last year. This results from the favorable impact of the higher volume of traditional loans and the higher interest rate environment being partially offset by a 1.8 million, or 80.9 , reduction in PPP loan fee related income. Finally, on an end of period basis at December 31, 2022 and excluding total PPP loans, the total loan portfolio is approximately 22.1 million, or 2.3 , higher than the December 31, 2021 level. Total investment securities averaged 245.2 million for the full year of 2022 which is 35.3 million, or 16.8 , higher than the 209.9 million average for the twelve months of last year. The increase in the U.S. Treasury yield curve resulted in a more favorable market for securities purchasing activity in 2022. The two-year to ten-year portion of the yield curve increased by approximately 225 to 363 basis points since the beginning of the year, with shorter yields in that range increasing to a higher degree than the longer yields, resulting in yield curve inversion. Overall, the higher rates resulted in yields for new federal agency mortgage-backed securities and federal agency bonds improving and exceeding the overall average yield of the existing securities portfolio. Management purchased more of these investments by redeploying the cash flow from the excess payoff activity from the loan portfolio and profitably utilizing the increased short-term liquidity on our balance sheet. This redeployment of funds contributed to total securities growing between years. Management also continued to purchase taxable municipals and corporate securities to maintain a well-diversified portfolio. Due to a combination of increased investment in securities, loan growth and total deposits modestly declining, short-term investments decreased throughout the year and are now at pre-pandemic levels before government stimulus impacted the economy. Total short-term investments including commercial paper averaged 23.2 million in 2022, which is 24.1 million, or 50.9 , lower than the 2021 average. Despite this decline, the Company s liquidity position remains strong. We will continue to carefully monitor our liquidity position and short-term investments as we expect deposits related to government stimulus programs to continue to decline in 2023. On the liability side of the balance sheet, total average deposits for 2022 are relatively consistent with the 2021 full year average, exceeding by 1.9 million, or 0.2 . Total deposits continued to demonstrate stability over the past year despite a 16.3 million, or 1.4 , decrease in total average deposits when comparing the 2022 fourth quarter to last year s fourth quarter. Deposit volumes continue to reflect the favorable impact of government stimulus which provided support to many Americans and financial assistance to municipalities and school districts during the pandemic. However, the quarterly decrease reflects a portion of the funds from the government stimulus programs leaving the balance sheet and also reflects greater pricing competition in the market to retain deposits because of the increasing national interest rates. Overall, the loan to deposit ratio averaged 85.4 in the fourth quarter of 2022, which indicates that the Company has ample capacity to continue to grow its loan portfolio and is strongly positioned to support our customers and our community during times of economic volatility. Total interest expense for the full year of 2022 increased by 909,000, or 12.0 , when compared to the full year of 2021, due to higher deposit and short-term borrowings interest expense. Deposit interest expense was higher by 1.6 million, or 33.7 , despite the full year average volume of total deposits remaining relatively consistent with the 2021 full year average. The impact that the higher national interest rates had on deposit costs combined with increased market competition to retain and attract deposits became more evident during the fourth quarter of 2022. In 2022, the Company benefitted from management s decision to allow a high-cost, institutional deposit to mature during the third quarter of 2021 which proved to be beneficial since the interest rate on this particular deposit was indexed to the market and would have become more expensive with the rising national interest rates experienced this year. This large institutional deposit was replaced by the additional low cost, fixed rate deposits from the Somerset County branch acquisition and resulted in significant interest expense savings. The rising national interest rates this year did result in certain deposit products, particularly public funds, that are tied to a market index, repricing upward with the move in national interest rates and causing interest expense to increase. Specifically, total deposit cost averaged 0.56 in 2022, which is 14 basis points higher than total deposit cost of 0.42 in 2021. Total borrowings interest expense decreased by 709,000, or 25.5 , when comparing the full year of 2022 to the full year of 2021. The decrease results from the favorable impact of the August 2021 subordinated debt offering which was used to replace higher cost debt. This transaction effectively lowered debt cost on these long-term funds by nearly 4.0 . This savings is recognized even though the size of the new subordinated debt is 7.0 million higher than the debt instruments it replaced. Note that included in 2021 borrowings interest expense is 202,000 of additional interest expense that the Company had to recognize from the write-off of the unamortized issuance costs from the original debt instruments that the new sub-debt replaced. Borrowings interest expense was favorably impacted by reduced interest

 expense from Federal Home Loan Bank (FHLB) term borrowings, which declined by 322,000, or 36.8 , for the year. The average balance of FHLB term borrowings was lower in 2022 by 16.1 million, or 32.6 , as strength of the Company s liquidity position allowed management to let FHLB term advances mature and not be replaced. 2021 NET INTEREST PERFORMANCE OVERVIEW. The Company s net interest income for the full year of 2021 increased by 2.7 million, or 7.5 , when compared to the full year of 2020. The Company s net interest margin was 3.15 for the full year of 2021 which represented a four basis point decline from the full year of 2020. Financial results when comparing 2021 to 2020 were indicative of an improving economic environment as well as the Company s execution of strategies to effectively meet the challenge presented by the low interest rate environment. This included the execution of several strategies to reduce our cost of funds. However, the emergence of the omicron variant, high inflation and supply chain issues reminded us that many risks remained. AmeriServ has proven to be resilient given the complex challenges we have confronted. The Company continued to adapt in the fluid environment and prioritized the well-being of our employees and the communities we serve. The Company demonstrated significantly higher than historical levels of both total average loans and total average deposits during 2021. This growth was due to successful business development efforts, the impact from the government stimulus programs and the 2021 Somerset County branch acquisition. Net interest income improved due to (i) the positive impact of commercial real estate and residential mortgage loan growth, (ii) significant interest expense savings from the issuance of the subordinated debt during the third quarter of 2021, which was used to retire higher cost existing subordinated debt and trust preferred securities, and (iii) the utilization of acquired low-cost core deposits to replace higher cost institutional deposits that were on our balance sheet. The combination of these three factors more than offset the unfavorable impact of net interest margin pressure from lower earning asset yields. The significant decrease to total interest expense in 2021 was the primary driver for net interest income increasing compared to the prior year. Total average earning assets increased by 102.9 million, or 9.0 , in 2021. Specifically, total loans averaged 989 million in 2021 which is 65.5 million, or 7.1 , higher than the 2020 full year average. Short-term investments and commercial paper averaged 47 million in 2021 which was 15.3 million, or 48.0 , higher than the 2020 full year average. Total investment securities averaged 210 million in 2021 which was 22.1 million, or 11.8 , higher than the 2020 full year average. These increases were largely offset by decreases in the yield on earning assets. Total deposits, including non-interest bearing demand deposits, averaged 1.154 billion for the full year of 2021, which was 119.6 million, or 11.6 , higher than the 1.035 billion average for the full year of 2020. The Company s loan to deposit ratio averaged 85.5 in the fourth quarter of 2021. The 2021 full year average of short-term and FHLB borrowed funds was 50 million, which represented a decrease of 19.3 million, or 27.9 . Overall, the cost of total interest bearing liabilities decreased from 1.10 to 0.75 . COMPONENT CHANGES IN NET INTEREST INCOME: 2021 VERSUS 2020. Regarding the separate components of net interest income, the Company s total interest income in 2021 decreased by 213,000, or 0.5 , when compared to 2020. Total average earning assets increased by 102.9 million, or 9.0 , in 2021 as there was an increased level of average total loans, short-term investments, and total investment securities. Despite the growth in average earning assets, interest income was unfavorably impacted by a decrease in the earning asset yield which declined by 35 basis points from 4.11 to 3.76 . All categories within the earning asset base demonstrated an interest income decrease between years. The average total loan portfolio yield decreased by 29 basis points from 4.40 to 4.11 in 2021 while the average yield on total investment securities decreased by 33 basis points from 3.20 to 2.87 . Total investment securities averaged 210 million for the full year of 2021, which was 22.1 million, or 11.8 , higher than the 188 million average in 2020. The Company continued to be selective in 2021 when purchasing securities due to the low interest rate environment. Specifically, the steeper U.S. Treasury yield curve resulted in improved yields for federal agency mortgage-backed securities and federal agency bonds. Once this occurred, management purchased more of those investments for our portfolio. This provided us with the opportunity to more profitably deploy a portion of the increased liquidity on our balance sheet into the securities portfolio as opposed to leaving the funds in low yielding federal funds sold. This redeployment of funds contributed to total securities growing between years. Management also continued to purchase taxable municipal and corporate securities to maintain a well-diversified portfolio. The economic recovery had been evident in our lending activity as we continued to experience good loan production throughout 2021. Commercial loan pipelines returned to pre-COVID levels early in the year. The overall total loan portfolio volume stabilized during the second half of the year as additional loan growth was offset by a high level of

 early payoff activity, particularly during the fourth quarter. Also, PPP loans continued to decline as they completed the forgiveness process. Overall, when compared to the pre-pandemic year of 2019, total loan production was over 79 million, or 31.2 , higher in 2021. Although reduced from its peak in 2020, strong residential mortgage loan production continued throughout 2021. Residential mortgage loan production totaled 90.5 million in 2021 which declined by 36.5 from the production level of 142.5 million achieved in 2020. Despite the decline between years, this was the second highest level of residential mortgage loan production during the most recently completed eight-year period. The Company revised strategy in 2021 and retained a higher percentage of our residential mortgage loan production in the loan portfolio as opposed to selling into the secondary market. This strategic change allowed us to more profitably deploy a portion of the increased liquidity that we had on our balance sheet. As stated previously, total loans continued to be significantly higher than historical levels and averaged 989 million for the full year of 2021, which was 65.5 million, or 7.1 , higher than the 2020 full year average. The growth experienced in our commercial real estate portfolio resulted in traditional loan fee income increasing by 465,000, or 41.9 , for the full year of 2021 when compared to the prior year. Total PPP loans averaged 23.4 million for the fourth quarter of 2021, decreasing by 41.4 million, or 63.9 , from the prior year s fourth quarter average as we continued to work with our customers through the forgiveness process. The Company recorded a total of 2.3 million of processing fee income and interest income from PPP lending activity in 2021, which was 398,000, or 21.2 , higher than the 2020 level. Finally, on an end of period basis, excluding total PPP loans, the total loan portfolio grew by approximately 48.7 million, or 5.3 , since the end of the fourth quarter of 2020. Similar to what was occurring across the banking industry, our liquidity position continued to be strong due to the significant influx of deposits. During the first quarter of 2021, the President signed into law another round of economic stimulus as part of the American Rescue Plan Act of 2021. The stimulus checks delivered to most Americans and the financial assistance provided to municipalities and school districts as part of the program contributed to total deposits increasing significantly. Our deposit balances were also positively impacted in the second quarter of 2021 by the Somerset County branch acquisition, which provided approximately 42 million of additional deposits. The challenges the increased liquidity presented were twofold. First, there was the uncertainty regarding the duration that these increased funds would remain on the balance sheet which would be determined by customer behavior as economic conditions changed. The second challenge was to profitably deploy the increased liquidity given the low yields on short-term investment products. As a result, short-term investment and commercial paper balances averaged 47.3 million for the full year of 2021, which remained high by historical standards. Late in the third quarter of 2021, the Company benefitted from utilizing a significant portion of our increased liquidity to allow a 33 million, high-cost, institutional deposit to mature. This resulted in total short-term investments declining to a more manageable level. Total interest expense for the twelve months of 2021 decreased by 2.9 million, or 27.9 , when compared to 2020, due to lower levels of both deposit and Federal Home Loan Bank (FHLB) borrowings interest expense. Specifically, deposit interest expense in 2021 was lower by 2.8 million, or 37.0 , despite the previously mentioned increase in deposits that occurred between years. The deposit growth reflected new deposit inflows as well as the loyalty of the bank s core deposit base. The previously mentioned late third quarter 2021 maturity of a 33 million institutional deposit that had an annual cost of 2.95 resulted in approximately 240,000 of interest expense savings during the fourth quarter. Additionally, management continued to effectively execute several deposit product pricing reductions to address the net interest margin challenges presented by the low interest rate environment. As a result, the Company experienced deposit cost relief. Specifically, our total deposit cost averaged 0.42 for the full year of 2021 compared to 0.74 in 2020, which represented a meaningful decrease of 32 basis points. Note that total deposit cost in the fourth quarter of 2021 averaged 0.31 . Total FHLB borrowings interest expense for the full year of 2021 was lower by 252,000, or 22.3 , compared to 2020. The strong liquidity position allowed the Company to paydown short-term and FHLB advances, which typically cost more than similar term deposit products. At December 31, 2021, total short-term and FHLB advances were 42.7 million, which was 47 million, or 52.4 , lower than the December 31, 2020 level. The Company completed a private placement of 27 million in fixed-to-floating rate subordinated notes on August 26, 2021. The notes have a fixed annual interest rate of 3.75 , payable until September 1, 2026. From and including September 1, 2026, the interest rate will reset quarterly to the then-current three-month Secured Overnight Financing Rate (SOFR) plus 3.11 . The Company used approximately 20 million of the net proceeds to retire its existing subordinated debt and trust preferred securities that had a weighted average cost of 7.73 . This strategy favorably reduced fourth quarter 2021 interest expense by 147,000. The remainder of the proceeds were utilized for general corporate purposes, including the downstream of 3.5 million of capital to the bank which supported additional loan growth. Long-term debt interest expense was higher for the full year of 2021 when compared to 2020 because the Company was required to immediately write off the remaining portion of the unamortized issuance costs from both

 original debt instruments which generated 202,000 of additional borrowings interest expense in the third quarter of 2021. Therefore, in aggregate, when considering the reduced short-term and FHLB borrowings interest cost, total borrowings interest expense decreased by 101,000, or 3.5 , for the full year. The table that follows provides an analysis of net interest income on a tax-equivalent basis (non-GAAP) setting forth (i) average assets, liabilities, and stockholders equity, (ii) interest income earned on interest earning assets and interest expense paid on interest bearing liabilities, (iii) average yields earned on interest earning assets and average rates paid on interest bearing liabilities, (iv) interest rate spread (the difference between the average yield earned on interest earning assets and the average rate paid on interest bearing liabilities), and (v) net interest margin (net interest income as a percentage of average total interest earning assets). For purposes of this table, loan balances include non-accrual loans, and interest income on loans includes loan fees or amortization of such fees which have been deferred. Regulatory stock is included within available for sale investment securities for this analysis. Additionally, a tax rate of 21 was used to compute tax-equivalent interest income and yields (non-GAAP). The tax equivalent adjustments to interest income on loans and municipal securities for the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021, and 2020 was 13,000, 18,000, and 24,000, respectively, which is reconciled to the corresponding GAAP measure at the bottom of the table. Differences between the net interest spread and margin from a GAAP basis to a tax-equivalent basis were not material.

The Company s written lending policies require underwriting, loan documentation, and credit analysis standards to be met prior to funding any loan. After the loan has been approved and funded, continued periodic credit review is required. The Company s policy is to individually review, as circumstances warrant, each of its commercial and commercial mortgage loans to determine if a loan is impaired. At a minimum, credit reviews are mandatory for all commercial and commercial mortgage loan relationships with aggregate balances in excess of 1,000,000 within a 12-month period. The Company has also identified three pools of small dollar value homogeneous loans which are evaluated collectively for impairment. These separate pools are for small business relationships with aggregate balances of 250,000 or less, residential mortgage loans and consumer loans. Individual loans within these pools are reviewed and removed from the pool if factors such as significant delinquency in payments of 90 days or more, bankruptcy, or other negative economic concerns indicate impairment. Overall, the Company continues to maintain good asset quality. The continued successful ongoing problem credit resolution efforts of the Company is demonstrated as levels of non-accrual loans, non-performing assets, and loan delinquency are well below 1 of total loans. Overall, we believe that non-performing assets remain well controlled totaling 5.2 million, or 0.53 of total loans, at December 31, 2022 which is an increase from the December 31, 2021 total of 3.3 million, or 0.34 of total loans. The increase in non-performing assets, as well as non-accrual loans, reflects the partial charge-down and transfer of one commercial real estate loan relationship into non-accrual status while the borrower pursues the sale of the property. Total classified loans increased 6.8 million since the prior year-end and now total 23.8 million. The increase in classified loans is the result of the risk rating downgrade of a large commercial real estate loan as well as a commercial and industrial loan relationship which were partially offset by the payoff of a substandard credit and the previously mentioned partial charge-down of a substandard credit during 2022. We also continue to closely monitor the loan portfolio given the number of relatively large-sized commercial and commercial real estate loans within the portfolio. As of December 31, 2022, the 25 largest credits represented 21.7 of total loans outstanding, which represents a decrease from December 31, 2021 when it was 22.3 .

 ALLOWANCE AND PROVISION FOR LOAN LOSSES. As described in more detail in the Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates section of this MD A, the Company uses a comprehensive methodology and procedural discipline to maintain an ALL to absorb inherent losses in the loan portfolio. The Company believes this is a critical accounting policy since it involves significant estimates and judgments. The following table sets forth changes in the ALL and certain ratios for the periods ended. 

YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2022 2021 2020 (IN THOUSANDS, EXCEPT RATIOS AND PERCENTAGES) Loans and loans held for sale, net of unearned income: Average for the year: Commercial 225,487 275,795 294,630 Commercial loans secured by non-owner occupied real estate 443,406 424,765 378,781 Real estate residential mortgage 295,528 274,016 242,823 Consumer 14,218 15,796 17,131 Total loans and loans held for sale, net of unearned income 977,541 988,761 923,269 At December 31, 990,825 986,037 978,345 As a percent of average loans: Net charge-offs (recoveries): Commercial 0.04 0.02 0.04 Commercial loans secured by non-owner occupied real estate 0.30 (0.01) (0.01) Real estate residential mortgage (0.01) 0.07 Consumer 1.88 0.46 0.44 Total loans and loans held for sale, net of unearned income 0.17 0.03 Provision (credit) for loan losses 0.01 0.11 0.26 Allowance, as a percent of each of the following: Total loans, net of unearned income 1.08 1.26 1.16 Total accruing delinquent loans (past due 30 to 89 days) 170.63 195.68 206.12 Total non-accrual loans 208.16 373.10 453.80 Total non-performing assets 206.60 373.10 340.59 Allowance, as a multiple of net charge-offs 6.30x 263.79x 36.72x Non-accrual loans, as a percentage of total loans, net of unearned income 0.52 0.34 0.26 For 2022, the Company recorded a 50,000 provision expense for loan losses compared to a 1.1 million provision expense in 2021. The 1,050,000 favorable comparison for total provision expense for the full year of 2022 reflects improved credit quality for the overall portfolio due to several loan upgrades and increased payoff and paydown activity of criticized loans. As demonstrated historically, the Company continues its strategic conviction that a strong allowance for loan losses is needed, which has proven to be essential given the support provided to certain borrowers as they fully recover from the COVID-19 pandemic. Note that the Small Business Administration guarantees 100 of the PPP loans made to eligible borrowers which minimizes the level of credit risk associated with these loans. As a result, such loans are assigned a 0 risk weight for purposes of calculating the Bank s risk-based capital ratios. Therefore, it was deemed appropriate to not allocate any portion of the loan loss reserve for the PPP loans. Overall non-performing assets remain well controlled totaling 5.2 million, or 0.53 of total loans, on December 31, 2022. The Company experienced net loan charge-offs of 1.7 million, or 0.17 of total average loans, for the 2022 year and is higher than net loan charge-offs of 47,000, which equates to 0.00 of total average loans, for the full year of 2021. The higher level of net charge-offs in 2022 is primarily related to the partial charge-down and transfer of one non-owner occupied commercial real estate loan relationship into non-accrual status while the borrower pursues the sale of the property. In summary, the allowance for loan losses provided 207 coverage of non-performing assets, and 1.08 of total loans, on December 31, 2022, compared to 373 coverage of non-performing assets, and 1.26 of total loans, on December 31, 2021. For 2021, the Company recorded a 1.1 million provision expense for loan losses compared to a 2.4 million provision expense in 2020. The lower 2021 provision reflected an improved credit quality outlook for the overall portfolio due to several loan upgrades as well as reduced criticized asset levels and delinquent loan balances

 demonstrating improvement during the year. This was reflective of the Company s loan officers working effectively with our customers as the economy improved and as businesses returned to normal operations with limited restrictions. The Company continued to grow the allowance for loan losses given the portfolio growth achieved during 2021, specifically in the non-owner occupied commercial real estate and residential mortgage portfolios, which was dampened by a decline in the commercial portfolio. The need to fund the allowance for portfolio growth was somewhat eased by numerous upgrades, which occurred during 2021. The Company experienced low net loan charge-offs of 47,000, which equates to 0.00 of total loans, in 2021 and compared favorably to net loan charge-offs of 309,000, or 0.03 of total loans, in 2020. Overall, non-performing assets totaled 3.3 million, or 0.34 of total loans, at December 31, 2021. In summary, the allowance for loan losses provided 373 coverage of non-performing assets, and 1.26 of total loans, at December 31, 2021, compared to 341 coverage of non-performing assets, and 1.16 of total loans, at December 31, 2020. The following schedule sets forth the allocation of the ALL among various loan categories. This allocation is determined by using the consistent quarterly procedural discipline that was previously discussed. The entire ALL is available to absorb future loan losses in any loan category. AT DECEMBER 31, 2022 2021 2020 2019 2018 PERCENT PERCENT PERCENT PERCENT PERCENT OF LOANS OF LOANS OF LOANS OF LOANS OF LOANS IN EACH IN EACH IN EACH IN EACH IN EACH CATEGORY CATEGORY CATEGORY CATEGORY CATEGORY TO TOTAL TO TOTAL TO TOTAL TO TOTAL TO TOTAL AMOUNT LOANS AMOUNT LOANS AMOUNT LOANS AMOUNT LOANS AMOUNT LOANS (IN THOUSANDS, EXCEPT PERCENTAGES) Commercial 2,653 23.1 3,071 25.5 3,472 31.4 3,951 30.1 3,057 29.0 Commercial loans secured by non-owner occupied real estate 5,972 45.5 6,392 43.8 5,373 41.2 3,119 41.2 3,389 41.4 Real estate residential mortgage 1,380 30.1 1,590 29.2 1,292 25.7 1,159 26.6 1,235 27.6 Consumer 85 1.3 113 1.5 115 1.7 126 2.1 127 2.0 Allocation to general risk 653 1,232 1,093 924 863 Total 10,743 100.0 12,398 100.0 11,345 100.0 9,279 100.0 8,671 100.0 Even though residential real estate mortgage loans comprise 30.1 of the Company s total loan portfolio, only 1.4 million, or 12.8 , of the total ALL is allocated against this loan category. The residential real estate mortgage loan allocation is based upon the Company s three-year historical average of actual loan charge-offs experienced in that category and other qualitative factors. The disproportionately higher allocations for commercial loans and commercial loans secured by non-owner occupied real estate reflect the increased credit risk associated with those types of lending, the Company s historical loss experience in these categories, and other qualitative factors. Based on the Company s current ALL methodology and the related assessment of the inherent risk factors contained within the Company s loan portfolio, we believe that the ALL is adequate at December 31, 2022 to cover losses within the Company s loan portfolio. NON-INTEREST INCOME. Non-interest income for 2022 totaled 16.7 million, a decrease of 1.1 million, or 6.0 , from 2021. Factors contributing to this lower level of non-interest income in 2022 included: a 456,000, or 68.7 , decrease in net gains on loans held for sale due to the lower level of residential mortgage loan production which reflects a reduced level of mortgage loan refinance activity because of the rapid escalation of interest rates since the beginning of 2022. Residential mortgage loan production through twelve months in 2022 totaled 24.8 million representing a 65.8 million, or 72.6 , reduction from the 2021 production level. The reduced level of mortgage loan production also caused mortgage related fees to decline by 243,000, or 67.9 ; a 366,000, or 3.1 , decline in wealth management fees due to the unfavorable impact of the declining equity markets as well as the unfavorable impact that the move in the bond market is having on wealth management asset values, both of which were partially offset by new customer business growth. The fair market value of wealth management assets declined since the fourth quarter of 2021 by 398.3 million, or 14.7 , and totaled 2.3 billion at December 31, 2022;

Table of Contents 
 a 143,000, or 14.8 , increase in service charges on deposit accounts as consumers are more active this year, increasing their spending habits; and the Company recognized an 84,000 gain on investment securities in 2021 as compared to this year when no such gain was recognized. 
 Non-interest income for 2021 totaled 17.8 million, an increase of 1.5 million, or 9.1 , from 2020. Factors contributing to this higher level of non-interest income in 2021 included: a 1.8 million, or 17.4 , increase in wealth management fees as the entire wealth management group had performed exceptionally well through the pandemic, actively working for clients to increase the value of their holdings in the financial markets and adding new business. The fair market value of wealth management assets totaled 2.7 billion and increased from the early pandemic fair market value low point on March 31, 2020 by 728.7 million, or 36.7 ; an 859,000, or 56.4 , decrease in net gains on loans held for sale due to a lower level of mortgage loan refinance activity in 2021 and the Company s revised strategy to retain a higher percentage of our residential mortgage loan production in the portfolio as opposed to selling into the secondary market. The Company had retained 79 of all residential mortgage loan originations into the loan portfolio in 2021 compared to 40 in 2020; a 335,000, or 42.8 , increase in revenue from bank owned life insurance due to the receipt of 310,000 in death claims as well as 2021 income being positively impacted by a financial floor taking hold which caused increased earnings and a higher rate of return on certain policies; a 291,000, or 12.7 , increase in other income primarily due to higher interchange fee income that resulted from increased usage of debit cards as the pandemic caused consumers to increase online purchases and many businesses to implement contactless services by not accepting cash due to health safety concerns. Also, service charges on deposit accounts increased by 62,000, or 6.9 , in 2021 as consumers became more active and increased their spending habits; a 201,000, or 36.0 , decrease in mortgage related fees due to a lower level of residential mortgage loan production; and the Company recognized an 84,000 gain on investment security sales in 2021 as compared to 2020 when no securities were sold. 
 NON-INTEREST EXPENSE. The Company has demonstrated good expense control in this inflationary environment as non-interest expense for 2022 totaled 48.0 million and increased by 1.0 million, or 2.2 , from 2021. Factors contributing to the higher non-interest expense in 2022 included: the Company was required to recognize a settlement charge in connection with its defined benefit pension plan in 2022, which is explained in Note 17, Employee Benefit Plans. The amount of the 2022 charge was 2.5 million which is 762,000, or 43.9 , higher than the 1.7 million settlement charge recognized in 2021; a 645,000, or 2.3 , increase in salaries and employee benefits expense. Within total salaries and benefits expense, salaries cost increased by 1.4 million, or 7.8 , due to merit increases and a higher level of full-time equivalent employees as the Company has been able to fill certain open positions this year. Also, contributing to the higher salaries and employee benefits costs were additional increases to health care, payroll taxes and other employee benefits. Partially offsetting these higher costs within salaries and benefits expense was lower incentive compensation by 808,000, or 38.2 , due to the reduced level of loan production and no performance related executive incentive payments in 2022; a 338,000, or 11.8 , increase in professional fees due primarily to higher legal costs within our wealth management group; no additional costs related to the branch acquisition were recognized in 2022 after 389,000 was recognized in 2021; 
 25 

Table of Contents 
 a 279,000, or 7.6 , increase in data processing and IT expense resulted from additional costs from our core data provider and increased costs related to monitoring our computing and network environment; a 263,000, or 10.0 , increase in net occupancy expense due to increased utilities cost along with maintenance and repair expense which was primarily related to the new branch office; other expense was favorably impacted by a 243,000 credit for the unfunded commitment reserve after 117,000 of expense was recognized last year, resulting in a 360,000 favorable shift; and a 140,000, or 21.4 , reduction in FDIC deposit insurance expense. 
 The Company anticipates that costs related to its ongoing proxy contest will impact the level of non-interest expense during 2023. Non-interest expense for 2021 totaled 47.0 million, which represents a 2.5 million, or 5.7 , increase from 2020. Factors contributing to the higher non-interest expense in 2021 included: a 1.1 million, or 19.8 , increase in other expense primarily due to the recognition of a 1.7 million settlement charge in connection with the Company s defined benefit pension plan. Also, contributing to the higher level of other expense was the Company recognizing 117,000 of expense associated with the unfunded commitment reserve in 2021 which represented a 271,000 unfavorable shift from 2020; a 457,000, or 1.7 , increase in salaries and employee benefits expense. Factors causing the increase included greater incentive compensation primarily due to commissions earned as a result of strong performance in the wealth management businesses and continued good residential mortgage and commercial loan production. Also, contributing to the higher salaries and employee benefits expense was increased health care costs which were partially offset by the Company s basic salary expense declining due to fewer employees; the Company recognized costs for the branch acquisition totaling 389,000 for 2021; a 238,000, or 6.9 , increase in data processing and IT expense due to increased costs from our core data provider and increased software related expenses; a 174,000, or 36.2 , increase in FDIC deposit insurance expense due to an increase in the asset assessment base and the benefit of the Small Bank Assessment Credit being fully utilized in the first quarter of 2020; a 110,000, or 4.4 , increase in net occupancy expense primarily due to the additional costs related to the branch acquisition; and 
 a 46,000, or 6.4 , decrease in supplies, postage and freight expense as the majority of the personal protective equipment to protect our employees and customers during the pandemic were purchased in 2020. 
 INCOME TAX EXPENSE. The Company recorded an income tax expense of 1.8 million, or an effective tax rate of 19.1 , in 2022, compared to income tax expense of 1.7 million, or a 19.4 effective tax rate, in 2021, and compared to income tax expense of 1.2 million, or a 20.9 effective tax rate, in 2020. The higher effective tax rate in 2020 resulted from the write-off of a deferred tax asset related to the dissolution of the Company s former small life insurance subsidiary. The Company s deferred tax asset was 2.8 million at December 31, 2022 compared to a deferred tax liability of 934,000 at December 31, 2021, resulting primarily from the decrease in the fair value of the available for sale investment securities portfolio. SEGMENT RESULTS. The community banking segment reported a net income contribution of 12.4 million in 2022 which improved from the 12.1 million contribution in 2021 and also increased from the 10.1 million contribution in 2020. The improvement between years is due to a higher level of net interest income and a reduced loan loss provision which more than offset decreased non-interest income and an increased level of non-interest expense. Net interest income improved between years as the increase in total interest income more than offset the increase to total interest expense. Total loan interest income improved by 901,000, or 2.2 , and resulted from the favorable impact of higher total loan volumes and the higher interest rate environment which more than offset a 1.8 million, or 80.9 , reduction in PPP loan fee related income and a 550,000, or 34.9 , reduction in total loan charge income. This segment

 benefitted from the continued strong production of commercial real estate loans in 2022 and the residential real estate loan production that occurred throughout 2021, which resulted in the 2022 full year average balance for both of these loan categories exceeding the 2021 full year average by 32.1 million. This segment also benefitted from a greater level of production of home equity loans, as the 2022 full year average for this loan category exceeds the 2021 full year average by 6.2 million. Total interest income from CRE, residential mortgage, and home equity loans was 2.9 million higher in 2022 when compared to 2021. Deposit interest expense was higher by 1.6 million, or 33.7 , despite the full year average volume of total deposits remaining relatively consistent with the 2021 full year average. The increased deposit interest expense occurred due to the impact that the higher national interest rates had on deposit costs combined with increased market competition to retain and attract deposits. The rising national interest rates resulted in certain deposit products, particularly public funds, that are tied to a market index, repricing upward with the move in national interest rates and causing interest expense to increase. This segment did benefit from management s decision to allow a high-cost institutional deposit to mature during 2021, which was indexed to the market, and replaced by the low cost deposits from the Somerset County branch acquisition (discussed previously in the MD A). Overall, total deposit cost of 56 basis points in 2022 was 14 basis points higher than total deposit cost in 2021. The Company recorded a 50,000 provision expense for loan losses in 2022 compared to a 1,100,000 provision in 2021. This also was discussed previously in the Allowance and Provision for Loan Losses section within this document. Non-interest income was unfavorably impacted by by a reduced level of loan sale gain income by 456,000 due to the lower level of residential mortgage loan production in 2022, which also caused mortgage related fees to decline by 243,000. Overall, these unfavorable items more than offset the favorable impact of higher service charges on deposit accounts by 143,000. Non-interest expense in 2022 compares unfavorably to 2021 results due to higher total employee costs and occupance expense which more than offset lower FDIC insurance expense and miscellaneous expense. Total employee costs were unfavorably impacted by higher salaries and increased pension costs that were related to the higher settlement charge recognized on the defined benefit pension obligation in 2022. This is explained in Note 17. Both of these items more than offset reduced incentive compensation. Within miscellaneous expense, the Company had 389,000 of additional costs for the the branch acquisition in 2021 while there was very minimal costs in 2022. Also, the Company recognized a credit to the unfunded commitment reserve of 243,000 after 117,000 of expense was recognized last year, resulting in a 360,000 favorable shift. The wealth management segment s net income contribution was 2.2 million in 2022 compared to 2.9 million in 2021 and 2.0 million in 2020. The decrease reflects the unfavorable impact of the declining equity markets on wealth management fee income as well as the unfavorable impact that the move in the bond market is having on wealth management asset values. Both unfavorable items were partially offset by new customer business growth. Also contributing to the decline in 2022, were higher levels of legal fees, total employee costs and meals travel related expenses for business development. Overall, the fair market value of wealth management assets declined since the end of 2021 by 398.3 million, or 14.7 , and totaled 2.3 billion at December 31, 2022. The investment/parent segment reported a net loss of 7.1 million in 2022, which was lower than the net loss of 7.8 million in 2021 and 7.5 million in 2020. The reduced loss results from lower borrowings interest expense primarily due to the favorable impact of the 2021 subordinated debt offering which was used to replace higher cost debt. This transaction effectively lowered debt cost on long-term funds by nearly 4.0 , resulting in 744,000 of reduced interest expense on long term borrowings. The remaining portion of the favorable variance in borrowings interest expense between years is due to reduced interest expense from Federal Home Loan Bank (FHLB) borrowings. Finally, and also contributing to the reduced loss in this segment, was an increase in interest income from the securities portfolio due to the higher average volume of total securities. The increase to the U.S. Treasury yield curve resulted in improved yields for federal agency mortgage-backed securities and federal agency bonds making purchases of these investments more attractive. Therefore, management was able to more profitably deploy a portion of the increased liquidity on our balance sheet into the securities portfolio. BALANCE SHEET. The Company s total consolidated assets of 1.364 billion at December 31, 2022 increased by 28.3 million, or 2.1 , from the 1.336 billion level at December 31, 2021. This change was related, primarily, to increased levels of investment securities, loans, and other assets which were partially offset by a decrease in cash and cash equivalents. Specifically, total investment securities increased 24.5 million, or 11.3 , as the increase in the U.S. Treasury yield curve resulted in a more favorable market for securities purchasing activity in 2022. The higher rates resulted in yields for new federal agency mortgage-backed securities and federal agency bonds improving and exceeding the overall average yield of the existing securities portfolio. As a result, management purchased more of these types of securities. The Company also continued to purchase corporate and taxable municipal securities to maintain a well-diversified portfolio. Loans, net of unearned fees, and loans held for sale modestly increased by 4.8 million, or 0.5 . Strong loan pipelines resulted in 2022 production more than offsetting a higher than typical level of payoff activity

 during the year as growth of commercial real estate and home equity loans along with a higher volume of residential mortgage loans more than offset a decrease in the level of commercial and industrial loans. Other assets increased 8.8 million, or 35.1 , as a result of an increase in the positive balance of the accrued pension liability, which totaled 21.3 million and 19.5 million as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. Due to the positive (debit) balance of the accrued pension liability, it was reclassified to other assets on the Consolidated Balance Sheets as of December 31, 2022 and 2021. The positive value of the accrued pension liability increased as a result of the 4.0 million contribution made in 2022 and the revaluation of the obligation due to the recognition of the settlement charge. In addition, the balance of other assets was impacted by a 5.8 million increase in the fair value of the interest rate swap agreements. These increases were partially offset by a decrease of 18.1 million, or 44.1 , in cash and cash equivalents. Due to a combination of increased investment in securities, loan growth, and total deposits modestly declining, cash and cash equivalents decreased throughout the year and are now at pre-pandemic levels. Despite this decline, the Company s liquidity position remains strong. Total deposits decreased by 30.8 million, or 2.7 , during 2022. Deposit volumes continue to reflect the favorable impact of government stimulus which provided support to many Americans and financial assistance to municipalities and school districts during the pandemic. However, the decrease reflects a portion of the funds from the government stimulus programs leaving the balance sheet and also reflects greater pricing competition in the market to retain deposits because of the increasing national interest rates. As of December 31, 2022, the 25 largest depositors represented 18.8 of total deposits and remained relatively unchanged from December 31, 2021 when it was 18.9 . Total borrowings have increased 65.5 million, or 90.0 , since year-end 2021. This change was driven by an increase in short-term borrowings which was partially offset by a decrease in FHLB term advances. Specifically, short-term borrowings totaled 88.6 million at December 31, 2022 compared to no short-term borrowings being outstanding at December 31, 2021. In addition, FHLB term advances decreased by 22.9 million, or 53.7 , and totaled 19.8 million at December 31, 2022. The current strong liquidity position has allowed the Company to let higher cost FHLB term advances mature and not be replaced. However, the Company does continue to utilize the FHLB term advances to help manage interest rate risk. The Company s total shareholders equity decreased by 10.4 million, or 8.9 , since year-end 2021. Capital was increased during 2022 by the Company s 7.4 million of net income and the 316,000 positive impact on accumulated other comprehensive loss from the recording of the settlement charge in connection with the defined benefit pension plan and the revaluation of the pension obligation. More than offsetting these increases was the 2.0 million common stock cash dividend and the 16.3 million negative impact experienced due to the reduced market value of the available for sale investment securities portfolio. The Company returned approximately 26 of our 2022 earnings to our shareholders through the quarterly common stock cash dividend. The Company continues to be considered well capitalized for regulatory purposes with a risk based capital ratio of 13.87 and an asset leverage ratio of 8.52 at December 31, 2022. The Company s book value per common share was 6.20, its tangible book value per common share was 5.40 (1) and its tangible common equity to tangible assets ratio was 6.85 (1) at December 31, 2022. The decline in the Company s book value and tangible book value per share in 2022 reflects a decrease in the fair value of the Company s available for sale investment securities due to higher interest rates. 

 (1) Non-GAAP financial information, see Reconciliation of Non-GAAP Financial Measures later in this MD A. LIQUIDITY. The Company s liquidity position continues to be strong. Deposit volumes remain at a high level by historical standards and continue to reflect the favorable impact of government stimulus which provided support to many Americans and financial assistance to municipalities and school districts during the pandemic. Deposit volumes have been positively impacted due to effective business development efforts as well as management s ability to retain the significant influx of deposits that resulted from the government stimulus programs. Also, deposit levels were positively impacted in the second quarter of 2021 by the Somerset County branch acquisition which more than offset the third quarter 2021 maturity of the high cost, institutional deposit. In addition, the Company s loyal core deposit base continues to prove to be a source of strength for the Company during periods of market volatility. Overall, total deposits continued to demonstrate stability during 2022 despite a modest decrease during the fourth quarter of 2022 reflecting the greater pricing competition in the market to retain deposits because of the increasing national interest rates. Total average deposits for the full year of 2022 were 1.9 million, or 0.2 , higher compared to the full year of 2021. The core deposit base is adequate to fund the Company s operations. Cash flow from maturities, prepayments and amortization of securities is used to help fund loan growth when needed. Due to a combination of increased investment in securities, loan growth and total deposits modestly declining in the fourth quarter of 2022, short-term investments decreased throughout 2022 and are now at pre-pandemic levels before

 government stimulus impacted the economy. The challenge remains as to the uncertainty regarding the duration that the existing government stimulus funds will remain on the balance sheet which will be determined by customer behavior as the economic conditions change. Diligent monitoring and management of our short-term investment position remains a priority. Continued loan growth and prudent investment in securities are critical to achieve the best return on the remaining liquid funds. On an end of period basis, at December 31, 2022, total interest bearing deposits and short-term investments decreased by 12.2 million since December 31, 2021. Given the increase to national interest rates experienced in 2022, a portion of the increased balance sheet liquidity was invested in additional securities to more profitably deploy these funds. Loan production during 2022 more than offset a higher than typical level of payoff activity causing total loans and loans held for sale to increase since the end of 2021 by 4.8 million. We strive to operate our loan to deposit ratio in a range of 80 to 100 . The Company s loan to deposit ratio averaged 85.4 in the fourth quarter of 2022, which indicates that the Company has ample capacity to continue to grow its loan portfolio and is well positioned to support our customers and our community during times of economic volatility. We are also well positioned to service our existing loan pipeline and grow our loan to deposit ratio while remaining within our guideline parameters. Liquidity can also be analyzed by utilizing the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows. Cash and cash equivalents decreased by 18.1 million from December 31, 2021, to 22.9 million at December 31, 2022, due to 56.3 million of net cash used in investing activities which more than offset 32.9 million of net cash provided by financing activities and 5.2 million of net cash provided by operating activities. Within investing activities, cash advanced for new loans originated totaled 223.7 million and was 6.9 million higher than the 216.8 million of cash received from loan principal payments. Within financing activities, total short-term borrowings increased by 88.6 million, total FHLB borrowings decreased by 22.9 million and total deposits decreased by 30.7 million. Within operating activities, 9.4 million of mortgage loans held for sale were originated while 10.6 million of mortgage loans were sold into the secondary market. The holding company had 9.6 million of cash, short-term investments, and investment securities at December 31, 2022, which represents a 300,000 increase from the holding company s cash position since December 31, 2021. Dividend payments from our subsidiaries also provide ongoing cash to the holding company. At December 31, 2022, our subsidiary Bank had 14.4 million of cash available for immediate dividends to the holding company under applicable regulatory formulas. Management follows a policy that limits dividend payments from the Trust Company to 75 of annual net income. Overall, we believe that the holding company has sufficient liquidity to meet its subordinated debt interest payments, and its dividend payout level with respect to its common stock. Financial institutions must maintain liquidity to meet day-to-day requirements of depositors and borrowers, take advantage of market opportunities, and provide a cushion against unforeseen needs. Liquidity needs can be met by either reducing assets or increasing liabilities. Sources of asset liquidity are provided by short-term investments, interest bearing deposits with banks, and federal funds sold. These assets totaled 23.0 million and 41.1 million at December 31, 2022 and December 31, 2021, respectively. Maturing and repaying loans, as well as the monthly cash flow associated with mortgage-backed securities and security maturities are other significant sources of asset liquidity for the Company. Liability liquidity can be met by attracting deposits with competitive rates, using repurchase agreements, buying federal funds, or utilizing the facilities of the Federal Reserve or the FHLB systems. The Company utilizes a variety of these methods of liability liquidity. Additionally, the Company s subsidiary bank is a member of the FHLB, which provides the opportunity to obtain short-term to longer-term advances based upon the Company s investment in certain residential mortgage, commercial real estate, and commercial and industrial loans. At December 31, 2022, the Company had 302 million of overnight borrowing availability at the FHLB, 41 million of short-term borrowing availability at the Federal Reserve Bank and 35 million of unsecured federal funds lines with correspondent banks. The Company believes it has ample liquidity available to fund outstanding loan commitments if they were fully drawn upon. CAPITAL RESOURCES. The Bank meaningfully exceeds all regulatory capital ratios for each of the periods presented and is considered well capitalized. The Company s common equity tier 1 capital ratio was 10.41 , the tier 1 capital ratio was 10.41 , and the total capital ratio was 13.87 at December 31, 2022. The Company s tier 1 leverage ratio was 8.52 at December 31, 2022. We anticipate that we will maintain our strong capital ratios throughout 2023. Capital generated from earnings will be utilized to pay the common stock cash dividend and will support controlled balance sheet growth. Our common dividend payout ratio for the full year 2022 was 26.7 . Total Parent Company cash was 9.6 million at December 31, 2022. There is a particular emphasis on ensuring that the subsidiary bank has appropriate levels of capital to support its non-owner occupied commercial real estate loan concentration, which stood at 
 29 

Table of Contents 
 350 of regulatory capital at December 31, 2022. It should be noted that this ratio weakened slightly from 347 at December 31, 2021 due to growth in total non-owner occupied commercial real estate loans between years. Our focus is on preserving capital to support customer lending and allow the Company to take advantage of business opportunities as they arise. We currently believe that we have sufficient capital and earnings power to continue to pay our common stock cash dividend at its current rate of 0.03 per quarter. While the Company has frequently executed common stock buyback programs in the past, we presently do not have one in place due to the drop in our tangible common equity ratio to 6.85 (1) as a result of the decline in value of our AFS securities portfolio in 2022. At December 31, 2022, the Company had approximately 17.1 million common shares outstanding. The Basel III capital standards establish the minimum capital levels in addition to the well capitalized requirements under the federal banking regulations prompt corrective action. The capital rules also impose a 2.5 capital conservation buffer (CCB) on top of the three minimum risk-weighted asset ratios. Banking institutions that fail to meet the effective minimum ratios once the CCB is taken into account will be subject to constraints on capital distributions, including dividends and share repurchases, and certain discretionary executive compensation. The severity of the constraints depends on the amount of the shortfall and the institution s eligible retained income (four quarter trailing net income, net of distributions and tax effects not reflected in net income). The Company and the Bank meet all capital requirements, including the CCB, and continue to be committed to maintaining strong capital levels that exceed regulatory requirements while also supporting balance sheet growth and providing a return to our shareholders. Under the Basel III capital standards, the minimum capital ratios are: 

MINIMUM CAPITAL RATIO MINIMUM PLUS CAPITAL CAPITAL RATIO CONSERVATION BUFFER Common equity tier 1 capital to risk-weighted assets 4.5 7.0 Tier 1 capital to risk-weighted assets 6.0 8.5 Total capital to risk-weighted assets 8.0 10.5 Tier 1 capital to total average consolidated assets 4.0

Asset/liability management involves managing the risks associated with changing interest rates and the resulting impact on the Company s net interest income, net income and capital. The management and measurement of interest rate risk at the Company is performed by using the following tools: (i) simulation modeling, which analyzes the impact of interest rate changes on net interest income, net income and capital levels over specific future time periods. The simulation modeling forecasts earnings under a variety of scenarios that incorporate changes in the absolute level of interest rates, the shape of the yield curve, prepayments and changes in the volumes and rates of various loan and deposit categories. The simulation modeling incorporates assumptions about reinvestment and the repricing characteristics of certain assets and liabilities without stated contractual maturities; (ii) market value of portfolio equity sensitivity analysis; and (iii) static GAP analysis, which analyzes the extent to which interest rate sensitive assets and interest rate sensitive liabilities are matched at specific points in time. The overall interest rate risk position and strategies are reviewed by senior management and the Company s Board of Directors on an ongoing basis.

 The following table presents a summary of the Company s static GAP positions at December 31, 2022: OVER OVER 3 MONTHS 6 MONTHS 3 MONTHS OR THROUGH THROUGH OVER INTEREST SENSITIVITY PERIOD LESS 6 MONTHS 1 YEAR 1 YEAR TOTAL (IN THOUSANDS, EXCEPT RATIOS AND PERCENTAGES) RATE SENSITIVE ASSETS: Loans and loans held for sale 275,555 46,331 98,507 570,432 990,825 Investment securities 28,427 5,721 13,454 193,784 241,386 Short-term assets 4,132 4,132 Regulatory stock 5,754 2,125 7,879 Bank owned life insurance 38,895 38,895 Total rate sensitive assets 313,868 52,052 150,856 766,341 1,283,117 RATE SENSITIVE LIABILITIES: Deposits: Non-interest bearing demand deposits 195,123 195,123 Interest bearing demand deposits 79,611 730 1,461 154,944 236,746 Savings 730 730 1,460 132,876 135,796 Money market 82,930 7,099 14,199 150,640 254,868 Certificates of deposit 116,578 26,792 39,688 102,946 286,004 Total deposits 279,849 35,351 56,808 736,529 1,108,537 Borrowings 98,563 4,790 1,142 33,878 138,373 Total rate sensitive liabilities 378,412 40,141 57,950 770,407 1,246,910 INTEREST SENSITIVITY GAP: Interval (64,544) 11,911 92,906 (4,066) Cumulative (64,544) (52,633) 40,273 36,207 36,207 Period GAP ratio 0.83X 1.30X 2.60X 0.99X Cumulative GAP ratio 0.83 0.87 1.08 1.03 Ratio of cumulative GAP to total assets (4.73) (3.86) 2.95 2.65 When December 31, 2022 is compared to December 31, 2021, the Company s cumulative GAP ratio through six months indicates that the Company s balance sheet is liability sensitive, representing a shift from an asset sensitivity position at the end of 2021. The shift results from an increased level of short-term borrowings, which are immediately impacted by changes to national interest rates. The Comppany also experienced an increase balance of deposits that have an interest rate that is indexed to the market. Customers have shifted funds into money market type accounts in order to benefit from the rising interest rates in the economy. We continue to see loan customer preference for fixed rate loans given the expectation for additional futures national interest rate increases. The Company s interest rate sensitivity position shifts from being liability to an asset sensitive position over six months and beyond as more of our loans begin to reprice. Finally, even though the balance of FHLB term advances at December 31, 2022 decreased 22.9 million, or 53.7 , from the prior year, the Company continues to utilize such advances to help manage our interest rate risk position. Management places primary emphasis on simulation modeling to manage and measure interest rate risk. The Company s asset/liability management policy seeks to limit net interest income variability over the first twelve months of the forecast period to -5.0 and -7.5 , which include interest rate movements of 100 and 200 basis points, respectively. Additionally, the Company also uses market value sensitivity measures to further evaluate the balance sheet exposure to changes in interest rates. The Company monitors the trends in market value of portfolio equity sensitivity analysis on a quarterly basis. The following table presents an analysis of the sensitivity inherent in the Company s net interest income and market value of portfolio equity. The interest rate scenarios in the table compare the Company s base forecast, which was prepared using a flat interest rate scenario, to scenarios that reflect immediate interest rate changes of 100 and 200 basis

 points. Each rate scenario contains unique prepayment and repricing assumptions that are applied to the Company s existing balance sheet that was developed under the flat interest rate scenario. 

VARIABILITY OF CHANGE IN NET INTEREST MARKET VALUE OF INTEREST RATE SCENARIO INCOME PORTFOLIO EQUITY 200 bp increase (2.3) (3.8) 100 bp increase (1.2) (1.1) 100 bp decrease 0.7 (2.7) 200 bp decrease 0.8 (10.1) The Company believes that its overall interest rate risk position is well controlled. The variability of net interest income is negative in the upward rate shocks due to the increased short-term borrowings position and increased level of deposit balances that have rates indexed to market interest rates. This is partially offset by the Company s shorter duration investment securities portfolio and the scheduled repricing of loans tied to an index, such as SOFR or prime. Also, the Company has effectively utilized interest rate swaps for interest rate risk management purposes. The interest rate swaps allow our customers to lock in fixed interest rates while the Company retains the benefit of interest rates moving with the market. Regarding interest bearing liabilities, management continues its disciplined approach to price its core term deposit accounts in a controlled but competitive manner. The variability of net interest income is positive in the downward rate scenarios as the Company has more exposure to short-term liabilities repricing downward to a greater extent than assets. As of December 31, 2022, the fed funds rate is at a targeted range of 4.25 to 4.50 as the Federal Reserve took action several times in 2022 to increase the rate a total of 425 basis points. Further, there is an expectation of additional short-term interest rate increases by the Federal Reserve during 2023. Subsequent to year-end, the Company executed a 50 million swap to fix the cost of certain deposits that are indexed and move with short-term interest rates. This transaction brought the Company s variability of net interest income to a more neutral position. The market value of portfolio equity decreases in the upward rate shocks due to the fact that the improved value of the Company s core deposit base was more than offset by the downward movement in the market value of the AFS investment securities portfolio and loans. Negative variability of market value of portfolio equity occurs in the downward rate shocks due to a reduced value for core deposits. Within the investment securities portfolio at December 31, 2022, 76.2 of the portfolio is classified as available for sale and 23.8 as held to maturity. The available for sale classification provides management with greater flexibility to manage the securities portfolio to better achieve overall balance sheet rate sensitivity goals and provide liquidity if needed. The mark to market of the available for sale securities does inject more volatility in the book value of equity, but has no impact on regulatory capital. There are 426 securities that are temporarily impaired at December 31, 2022. The Company reviews its securities quarterly and has asserted that at December 31, 2022, the impaired value of securities represents temporary declines due to movements in interest rates and the Company does have the ability and intent to hold those securities to maturity or to allow a market recovery. Furthermore, it is the Company s intent to manage its long-term interest rate risk by continuing to sell a portion of newly originated fixed-rate 30-year mortgage loans into the secondary market (excluding construction and any jumbo loans). The Company sells 15-year fixed-rate mortgage loans into the secondary market as well, depending on market conditions. For the year 2022, 41.8 of all residential mortgage loan production was sold into the secondary market.

The Company incurs off-balance sheet risks in the normal course of business in order to meet the financing needs of its customers. These risks derive from commitments to extend credit and standby letters of credit. Such commitments and standby letters of credit involve, to varying degrees, elements of credit risk in excess of the amount recognized in the consolidated financial statements. The Company s exposure to credit loss in the event of nonperformance by the other party to these commitments to extend credit and standby letters of credit is represented by their contractual amounts. The Company uses the same credit and collateral policies in making commitments and conditional obligations as for all other lending. The Company had various outstanding commitments to extend credit approximating 227.6 million and standby letters of credit of 9.0 million as of December 31, 2022. The Company can also use various interest rate contracts, such as interest rate swaps, caps, floors and swaptions to help manage interest rate and market valuation risk exposure, which is incurred in normal recurrent banking activities. As of December 31, 2022, the Company had 130.9 million in the notional amount of interest rate swaps outstanding, with a fair value of 7.0 million. In addition, the Company entered into a risk participation agreement (RPA) with the lead bank of a commercial real estate loan arrangement. As a participating bank, the Company 
 33 

Table of Contents 
 guarantees the performance on a borrower-related interest rate swap contract. The notional amount of the RPA outstanding at December 31, 2022 was 2.1 million, with a fair value of zero. As of December 31, 2022 and 2021, municipal deposit letters of credit issued by the Federal Home Loan Bank of Pittsburgh on behalf of AmeriServ Financial Bank naming applicable municipalities as beneficiaries totaled 72.9 million and 62.2 million, respectively. The letters of credit serve as collateral, in place of pledged securities, for municipal deposits maintained at AmeriServ Financial Bank. RECONCILIATION OF NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES. This document contains certain financial information determined by methods other than in accordance with generally accepted accounting policies in the United States (GAAP). These non-GAAP diclosures, which includes adjusted net income, adjusted diluted earnings per share, adjusted return on average assets, and adjusted return on average equity, have limitations as an analytical tool and should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for analysis of the Company s results as reported under GAAP, nor is it necessarily comparable to non-GAAP performance measures that may be presented by other companies. These non-GAAP measures are used by management in their analysis of the Company s performance or, management believes, facilitate an understanding of the Company s performance. Management also believes that presenting non-GAAP financial measures provides additional information to facilitate comparison of the Company s historical operating results and trends in the underlying operating results. Management considers quantitative and qualitative factors in assessing whether to adjust for the impact of items that may be significant or that could affect an understanding of our ongoing financial and business performance or trends. Currently, the only adjustment included is for non-cash settlement charges in connection with the Company s pension plan distributions.

 The tangible common equity ratio and tangible book value per share are considered to be non-GAAP measures and are calculated by dividing tangible equity by tangible assets or shares outstanding. The following table sets forth the calculation of the Company s tangible common equity ratio and tangible book value per share at December 31, 2022 and 2021 (in thousands, except share and ratio data): 

AT DECEMBER 31, 2022 2021 Total shareholders equity 106,178 116,549 Less: Intangible assets 13,739 13,769 Tangible common equity 92,439 102,780 Total assets 1,363,874 1,335,560 Less: Intangible assets 13,739 13,769 Tangible assets 1,350,135 1,321,791 Tangible common equity ratio (non-GAAP) 6.85 7.78 Total shares outstanding 17,117,617 17,081,500 Tangible book value per share (non-GAAP) 5.40 6.02 CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES. The accounting and reporting policies of the Company are in accordance with Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP) and conform to general practices within the banking industry. Accounting and reporting policies for the pension liability, allowance for loan losses, intangible assets, income taxes, and investment securities are deemed critical because they involve the use of estimates and require significant management judgments. Application of assumptions different than those used by the Company could result in material changes in the Company s financial position or results of operation. ACCOUNT Pension liability BALANCE SHEET REFERENCE Other assets INCOME STATEMENT REFERENCE Salaries and employee benefits and Other expense DESCRIPTION Pension costs and liabilities are dependent on assumptions used in calculating such amounts. These assumptions include discount rates, benefits earned, interest costs, expected return on plan assets, mortality rates, and other factors. In accordance with GAAP, actual results that differ from the assumptions are accumulated and amortized over future periods and, therefore, generally affect recognized expense and the recorded obligation of future periods. While management believes that the assumptions used are appropriate, differences in actual experience or changes in assumptions may affect the Company s pension obligations and future expense. Additionally, pension expense can also be impacted by settlement accounting charges if the amount of employee selected lump sum distributions exceed the total amount of service and interest component costs of the net periodic pension cost in a particular year. Our pension benefits are described further in Note 17 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. ACCOUNT Allowance for loan losses BALANCE SHEET REFERENCE Allowance for loan losses INCOME STATEMENT REFERENCE Provision for loan losses DESCRIPTION The allowance for loan losses is calculated with the objective of maintaining reserve levels believed by management to be sufficient to absorb estimated probable credit losses. Management s determination of the adequacy of the allowance is based on periodic evaluations of the credit portfolio and other relevant factors. However, this quarterly evaluation is inherently subjective as it requires material estimates, including, among others, likelihood of customer default, loss given default, exposure at default, the amounts and timing of expected future cash flows on impaired loans, value of collateral, estimated losses on consumer loans and residential mortgages, and general amounts for historical loss experience. This process also considers economic conditions, uncertainties in estimating losses and inherent risks in the various credit portfolios. All of these factors may be susceptible to significant change. Also, the allocation of the allowance for credit losses to specific loan pools is based on historical loss trends and management s judgment concerning those trends. Commercial and commercial real estate loans are the largest category of credits and the most sensitive to changes in assumptions and judgments underlying the determination of the allowance for loan losses. Approximately 8.6 million, or 80 , of the total allowance for loan losses at December 31, 2022 has been allocated to these two loan categories. This allocation also considers other relevant factors such as actual versus estimated losses, economic trends, delinquencies, 
 35 

Table of Contents 
 levels of non-performing and troubled debt restructured (TDR) loans, concentrations of credit, trends in loan volume, experience and depth of management, examination and audit results, effects of any changes in lending policies and trends in policy, financial information and documentation exceptions. To the extent actual outcomes differ from management estimates, additional provision for loan losses may be required that would adversely impact earnings in future periods. ACCOUNT Intangible assets BALANCE SHEET REFERENCE Intangible assets INCOME STATEMENT REFERENCE Other expense DESCRIPTION The Company considers our accounting policies related to goodwill and core deposit intangible to be critical because the assumptions or judgment used in determining the fair value of assets and liabilities acquired in past acquisitions are subjective and complex. As a result, changes in these assumptions or judgment could have a significant impact on our financial condition or results of operations. The fair value of acquired assets and liabilities, including the resulting goodwill and core deposit intangible, was based either on quoted market prices or provided by other third party sources, when available. When third party information was not available, estimates were made in good faith by management primarily through the use of internal cash flow modeling techniques. The assumptions that were used in the cash flow modeling were subjective and are susceptible to significant changes. The Company routinely utilizes the services of an independent third party that is regarded within the banking industry as an expert in valuing core deposits to monitor the ongoing value and changes in the Company s core deposit base. These core deposit valuation updates are based upon specific data provided from statistical analysis of the Company s own deposit behavior to estimate the duration of these non-maturity deposits combined with market interest rates and other economic factors. Goodwill arising from business combinations represents the value attributable to unidentifiable intangible elements in the business acquired. The Company s goodwill relates to value inherent in the banking and wealth management businesses, and the value is dependent upon the Company s ability to provide quality, cost-effective services in the face of free competition from other market participants on a regional basis. This ability relies upon continuing investments in processing systems, the development of value-added service features and the ease of use of the Company s services. As such, goodwill value is supported ultimately by revenue that is driven by the volume of business transacted and the loyalty of the Company s deposit and customer base over a longer time frame. The quality and value of a Company s assets is also an important factor to consider when performing goodwill impairment testing. A decline in earnings as a result of a lack of growth or the inability to deliver cost-effective value added services over sustained periods can lead to the impairment of goodwill. Goodwill, which has an indefinite useful life, is tested for impairment at least annually and written down and charged to results of operations only in periods in which the recorded value is more than the estimated fair value. The core deposit intangible, which is a wasting asset, is amortized and reported in other expense for a period of ten years using the sum of the years digits amortization method. ACCOUNT Income taxes BALANCE SHEET REFERENCE Net deferred tax asset and Net deferred tax liability INCOME STATEMENT REFERENCE Provision for income taxes DESCRIPTION The provision for income taxes is the sum of income taxes both currently payable and deferred. The changes in deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based upon the changes in differences between the basis of assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and the basis of assets and liabilities as measured by the enacted tax rates that management estimates will be in effect when the differences reverse. This income tax review is completed on a quarterly basis. In relation to recording the provision for income taxes, management must estimate the future tax rates applicable to the reversal of tax differences, make certain assumptions regarding whether tax differences are permanent or temporary and the related timing of the expected reversal. Also, estimates are made as to whether taxable operating income in future periods will be sufficient to fully recognize any gross deferred tax assets. If recovery is not likely, we must increase our provision for taxes by recording a valuation allowance against the deferred tax assets that we estimate will 
 36 

Table of Contents 
 not ultimately be recoverable. Alternatively, we may make estimates about the potential usage of deferred tax assets that decrease our valuation allowances. As of December 31, 2022, we believe that all of the deferred tax assets recorded on our balance sheet will ultimately be recovered and that no valuation allowances were needed. In addition, the calculation of our tax liabilities involves dealing with uncertainties in the application of complex tax regulations. We recognize liabilities for anticipated tax audit issues based on our estimate of whether, and the extent to which, additional taxes will be due. If we ultimately determine that payment of these amounts is unnecessary, we reverse the liability and recognize a tax benefit during the period in which we determine that the liability is no longer necessary. We record an additional charge in our provision for income taxes in the period in which we determine that the recorded tax liability is less than we expect the ultimate assessment to be. ACCOUNT Investment securities BALANCE SHEET REFERENCE Investment securities INCOME STATEMENT REFERENCE Net realized gains on investment securities DESCRIPTION Available-for-sale and held-to-maturity securities are reviewed quarterly for possible other-than-temporary impairment. The review includes an analysis of the facts and circumstances of each individual investment such as the severity of loss, the length of time the fair value has been below cost, the expectation for that security s performance, the creditworthiness of the issuer and the Company s intent and ability to hold the security to recovery. A decline in value that is considered to be other-than-temporary is recorded as a loss within non-interest income in the Consolidated Statements of Operations. At December 31, 2022, the unrealized losses in the available-for-sale security portfolio were comprised of securities issued by government agencies or government sponsored agencies and certain high quality corporate and taxable municipal securities. The Company believes the unrealized losses are primarily a result of increases in market yields from the time of purchase. In general, as market yields rise, the value of securities will decrease; as market yields fall, the fair value of securities will increase. Management generally views changes in fair value caused by changes in interest rates as temporary; therefore, these securities have not been classified as other-than-temporarily impaired. Management has also concluded that based on current information we expect to continue to receive scheduled interest payments as well as the entire principal balance. Furthermore, management does not intend to sell these securities and does not believe it will be required to sell these securities before they recover in value.

 ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK Risk identification and management are essential elements for the successful management of the Company. In the normal course of business, the Company is subject to various types of risk, including interest rate, credit, and liquidity risk. The Company seeks to identify, manage and monitor these risks with policies, procedures, and various levels of managerial and Board oversight. The Company s objective is to optimize profitability while managing and monitoring risk within Board approved policy limits. Interest rate risk is the sensitivity of net interest income and the market value of financial instruments to the magnitude, direction, and frequency of changes in interest rates. Interest rate risk results from various repricing frequencies and the maturity structure of assets, liabilities, and hedges. The Company uses its asset liability management policy and hedging policy to control and manage interest rate risk. For information regarding the effect of changing interest rates on the Company s net interest income and market value of its investment portfolio, see Management s Discussion and Analysis of Consolidated Financial Condition and Results of Operations Interest Rate Sensitivity. Liquidity risk represents the inability to generate cash or otherwise obtain funds at reasonable rates to satisfy commitments to borrowers, as well as, the obligations to depositors, debtholders and to fund operating expenses. The Company uses its asset liability management policy and contingency funding plan to control and manage liquidity risk. See Management s Discussion and Analysis of Consolidated Financial Condition and Results of Operations Liquidity. Credit risk represents the possibility that a customer may not perform in accordance with contractual terms. Credit risk results from extending credit to customers, purchasing securities, and entering into certain off-balance sheet loan funding commitments. The Company s primary credit risk occurs in the loan portfolio and to a lesser extent in the corporate and municipal portions of the investment portfolio. The Company uses its credit policy and disciplined approach to evaluating the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses to control and manage credit risk. The Company s investment policy and hedging policy strictly limit the amount of credit risk that may be assumed in the investment portfolio and through hedging activities. For information regarding the market risk of the Company s financial instruments, see Management s Discussion and Analysis of Consolidated Financial Condition and Results of Operations Interest Rate Sensitivity. The Company s principal market risk exposure is to interest rates.

Intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated in preparing the Consolidated Financial Statements. The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (generally accepted accounting principles, or GAAP) requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the Consolidated Financial Statements and accompanying notes. Actual results may differ from these estimates and the differences may be material to the Consolidated Financial Statements. The Company s most significant estimates relate to the allowance for loan losses, intangible assets, income taxes, investment securities, pension, and the fair value of financial instruments.

 par value. The stock does not have a readily determinable fair value and as such is classified as restricted stock, carried at cost and evaluated for impairment by management. The stock s value is determined by the ultimate recoverability of the par value rather than by recognizing temporary declines. The determination of whether the par value will ultimately be recovered is influenced by criteria such as the following: (1) the significance of the decline in net assets of the FHLB as compared to the capital stock amount and the length of time any such situation has persisted; (2) commitments by the FHLB to make payments required by law or regulation and the level of such payments in relation to the operating performance; (3) the impact of legislative and regulatory changes on the customer base of FHLB; and (4) the liquidity position of the FHLB. Management evaluated the stock and concluded that the stock was not impaired for the periods presented herein. days past due in either principal or interest. In addition, if circumstances warrant, the accrual of interest may be discontinued prior to 90 days. Payments received on non-accrual loans are credited to principal until full recovery of principal has been recognized; or the loan has been returned to accrual status. The only exception to this policy is for residential mortgage loans wherein interest income is recognized on a cash basis as payments are received. A non-accrual commercial loan is placed on accrual status after becoming current and remaining current for twelve consecutive payments. Residential mortgage loans are placed on accrual status upon becoming current.

All required specific reserve allocations are based on careful analysis of the loan s performance, the related collateral value, cash flow considerations and the financial capability of any guarantor. For impaired loans the measurement of impairment may be based upon (1) the present value of expected future cash flows discounted at the loan s effective interest rate; (2) the observable market price of the impaired loan; or (3) the fair value of the collateral of a collateral dependent loan.

In March 2022, the FASB issued ASU 2022-02, Financial Instruments Credit Losses (ASC 326): Troubled Debt Restructurings (TDRs) and Vintage Disclosures . The guidance amends ASC 326 to eliminate the accounting guidance for TDRs by creditors, while enhancing disclosure requirements for certain loan refinancing and restructuring activities by creditors when a borrower is experiencing financial difficulty. Specifically, rather than applying TDR recognition and measurement guidance, creditors will determine whether a modification results in a new loan or continuation of an existing loan. These amendments are intended to enhance existing disclosure requirements and introduce new requirements related to certain modifications of receivables made to borrowers experiencing financial difficulty. Additionally, the amendments of ASC 326 require that an entity disclose current-period gross writeoffs by year of origination within the vintage disclosures, which requires that an entity disclose the amortized cost basis of financing receivables by credit quality indicator and class of financing receivable by year of origination. The guidance is only for entities that have adopted the amendments of ASU 2016-13 for fiscal years, and interim periods within those fiscal years, beginning after December 15, 2022. The Company is currently evaluating the impact the adoption of the standard will have on the Company s financial position or results of operations which will be adopted with ASU 2016-13 effective January 1, 2023.

 of the total revenue of the Company. Non-interest income within the scope of Topic 606 are as follows: Wealth management fees Wealth management fee income is primarily comprised of fees earned from the management and administration of trusts and customer investment portfolios. The Company s performance obligation is generally satisfied over a period of time and the resulting fees are billed monthly or quarterly, based upon the month end market value of the assets under management. Payment is generally received after month end through a direct charge to customers accounts. Due to this delay in payment, a receivable of has been established as of December 31, 2022 and is included in other assets on the Consolidated Balance Sheets in order to properly recognize the revenue earned but not yet received. Other performance obligations (such as delivery of account statements to customers) are generally considered immaterial to the overall transactions price. Commissions on transactions are recognized on a trade-date basis as the performance obligation is satisfied at the point in time in which the trade is processed. Also included within wealth management fees are commissions from the sale of mutual funds, annuities, and life insurance products. Commissions on the sale of mutual funds, annuities, and life insurance products are recognized when sold, which is when the Company has satisfied its performance obligation. Service charges on deposit accounts The Company has contracts with its deposit account customers where fees are charged for certain items or services. Service charges include account analysis fees, monthly service fees, overdraft fees, and other deposit account related fees. Revenue related to account analysis fees and service fees is recognized on a monthly basis as the Company has an unconditional right to the fee consideration. Fees attributable to specific performance obligations of the Company (i.e. overdraft fees, etc.) are recognized at a defined point in time based on completion of the requested service or transaction. Other non-interest income Other non-interest income consists of other recurring revenue streams such as safe deposit box rental fees, gain (loss) on sale of other real estate owned, ATM and VISA debit card fees, and other miscellaneous revenue streams. Safe deposit box rental fees are charged to the customer on an annual basis and recognized when billed. However, if the safe deposit box rental fee is prepaid (i.e. paid prior to issuance of annual bill), the revenue is recognized upon receipt of payment. The Company has determined that since rentals and renewals occur consistently over time, revenue is recognized on a basis consistent with the duration of the performance obligation. Gains and losses on the sale of other real estate owned are recognized at the completion of the property sale when the buyer obtains control of the real estate and all the performance obligations of the Company have been satisfied. The Company offers ATM and VISA debit cards to deposit account holders which allows our customers to access their account electronically at ATMs and POS terminals. Fees related to ATM and VISA debit card transactions are recognized when the transactions are completed and the Company has satisfied it performance obligation.

In general, as market yields rise, the value of securities will decrease; as market yields fall, the fair value of securities will increase. There are positions that are considered temporarily impaired at December 31, 2022. Management generally views changes in fair value caused by changes in interest rates as temporary; therefore, these securities have not been classified as other-than-temporarily impaired. Management has also concluded that based on current information we expect to continue to receive scheduled interest payments as well as the entire principal balance. Furthermore, management does not intend to sell these securities and does not believe it will be required to sell these securities before they recover in value or mature. The interest rate environment and market yields can also have a significant impact on the yield earned on mortgage-backed securities (MBS). Prepayment speed assumptions are an important factor to consider when evaluating the returns on an MBS. Generally, as interest rates decline, borrowers have more incentive to refinance into a lower rate, so prepayments will rise. Conversely, as interest rates increase, prepayments will decline. When an MBS is purchased at a premium, the yield will decrease as prepayments increase and the yield will increase as prepayments decrease. As of December 31, 2022, the Company had low premium risk as the book value of our mortgage-backed securities purchased at a premium was only of the par value. As of December 31, 2022, 2021, and 2020, the Company reported , , and , respectively, of equity securities within other assets on the Consolidated Balance Sheets.

 ) ) Commercial loans secured by non-owner occupied real estate Real estate residential mortgage ) Consumer ) Allocation for general risk Total ) The allowance for loan losses credit recorded during the year ended December 31, 2022 within the commercial portfolio was due to a lower level of criticized assets and, to a lesser extent, portfolio contraction. A allowance for loan losses provision was recorded for the non-owner occupied commercial real estate portfolio as a result of the partial charge-down and transfer of one loan relationship into non-accrual status during the third quarter of the year while the borrower pursues the sale of the property. Additionally, the non-owner occupied commercial real estate portfolio was impacted by the risk rating downgrade of another loan relationship as well as portfolio growth. It is further noted that the allocation for general risk eased due to improvement in the qualitative adjustment as the economy demonstrated improvement coming out of the pandemic during 2022. The allowance for loan losses credit recorded during the year ended December 31, 2021 within the commercial portfolio was attributable to lower criticized commercial and industrial loans outstanding resulting from upgrades of certain credits originally impacted by the pandemic, as well as lower historical loss rates. While a allowance for loan losses provision was recorded for the non-owner occupied commercial real estate portfolio which stemmed from overall portfolio growth as well as elevated classified commercial real estate balances. For the year ended December 31, 2020, a allowance for loan losses credit was recognized for the commercial portfolio due to portfolio contraction, reduced classified asset levels, and lower historical loss factors. In addition, a million allowance for loan losses provision was recorded for the non-owner occupied commercial real estate portfolio which resulted from overall portfolio growth coupled with escalated criticized asset levels driven primarily by pandemic related downgrades.

AT DECEMBER 31, 2021 COMMERCIAL LOANS ALLOCATION SECURED BY NON- REAL ESTATE FOR Allowance OWNER OCCUPIED RESIDENTIAL GENERAL for loan losses: COMMERCIAL REAL ESTATE MORTGAGE CONSUMER RISK TOTAL (IN THOUSANDS) Specific reserve allocation General reserve allocation Total allowance for loan losses Management evaluates for possible impairment any individual loan in the commercial or commercial real estate segment that is in non-accrual status or classified as a Troubled Debt Restructure (TDR). In addition, consumer and residential mortgage loans with a balance of or more are evaluated for impairment. Loans are considered to be impaired when, based on current information and events, it is probable that the Company will be unable to collect the scheduled payments of principal or interest when due according to the contractual terms of the loan agreement. Factors considered by management in evaluating impairment include payment status, collateral value, and the probability of collecting scheduled principal and interest payments when due. Management determines the significance of payment delays and payment shortfalls on a case-by-case basis, taking into consideration all of the circumstances surrounding the loan and the borrower, including the length of the delay, the reasons for the delay, the borrower s prior payment record, and the amount of the shortfall in relation to the principal and interest owed. Once the determination has been made that a loan is impaired, the determination of whether a specific allocation of the allowance is necessary is measured by comparing the recorded investment in the loan to the fair value of the loan using one of three methods: (a) the present value of expected future cash flows discounted at the loan s effective interest rate; (b) the loan s observable market price; or (c) the fair value of the collateral less selling costs for collateral dependent loans. The method is selected on a loan-by-loan basis, with management primarily utilizing either the discounted cash flows or the fair value of collateral method. The evaluation of the need and amount of a specific allocation of the allowance and whether a loan can be removed from impairment status is made on a quarterly basis. The Company s policy for recognizing interest income on impaired loans does not differ from its overall policy for interest recognition. The need for an updated appraisal on collateral dependent loans is determined on a case-by-case basis. The useful life of an appraisal or evaluation will vary depending upon the circumstances of the property and the economic conditions in the marketplace. A new appraisal is not required if there is an existing appraisal which, along with other information, is sufficient to determine a reasonable value for the property and to support an appropriate and adequate allowance for loan losses. At a minimum, annual documented reevaluation of the property is completed by the Bank s internal Collections and Assigned Risk Department to support the value of the property. When reviewing an appraisal associated with an existing real estate collateral dependent transaction, the Bank s internal Collections and Assigned Risk Department must determine if there have been material changes to the underlying assumptions in the appraisal which affect the original estimate of value. Some of the factors that could cause material changes to reported values include: the passage of time; the volatility of the local market;

The first six categories are considered not criticized. The first five Pass categories are aggregated, while the Pass-6, Special Mention, Substandard and Doubtful categories are disaggregated to separate pools. The criticized rating categories utilized by management generally follow bank regulatory definitions. The Special Mention category includes assets that are currently protected but are potentially weak, resulting in an undue and unwarranted credit risk, but not to the point of justifying a Substandard classification. Loans in the Substandard category have well-defined weaknesses that jeopardize the liquidation of the debt, and have a distinct possibility that some loss will be sustained if the weaknesses are not corrected. All loans greater than 90 days past due, or for which any portion of the loan represents a specific allocation of the allowance for loan losses are placed in Substandard or Doubtful. To help ensure that risk ratings are accurate and reflect the present and future capacity of borrowers to repay a loan as agreed, the Company has a structured loan rating process, which dictates that, at a minimum, credit reviews are mandatory for all commercial and commercial mortgage loan relationships with aggregate balances in excess of within a 12-month period. Generally, consumer and residential mortgage loans are included in the Pass categories unless a specific action, such as bankruptcy, delinquency, or death occurs to raise awareness of a possible credit event. The Company s commercial relationship managers are responsible for the timely and accurate risk rating of the loans in their portfolios at origination and on an ongoing basis. Risk ratings are assigned by the account officer, but require independent review and rating concurrence from the Company s internal Loan Review Department. The Loan Review Department is an experienced, independent function which reports directly to the Board s Audit Committee. The scope of commercial portfolio coverage by the Loan Review Department is defined and presented to the Audit Committee for approval on an annual basis. The approved scope of coverage for 2022 required review of approximately of the commercial loan portfolio. In addition to loan monitoring by the account officer and Loan Review Department, the Company also requires presentation of all credits rated Pass-6 with aggregate balances greater than , all credits rated Special Mention or Substandard with aggregate balances greater than , and all credits rated Doubtful with aggregate balances greater than on an individual basis to the Company s Loan Loss Reserve Committee on a quarterly basis. Additionally, the Asset Quality Task Force, which is a group comprised of senior level personnel, meets monthly to monitor the status of problem loans.

The ALL is based on management s continuing evaluation of the risk characteristics and credit quality of the loan portfolio, assessment of current economic conditions, diversification and size of the portfolio, adequacy of collateral, past and anticipated loss experience, and the amount of non-performing loans. Loans that are collectively evaluated for impairment are analyzed with general allowances being made as appropriate. For general allowances, historical loss trends are used in the estimation of losses in the current portfolio. These historical loss amounts are complemented by consideration of other qualitative factors. Management tracks the historical net charge-off activity at each risk rating grade level for the entire commercial portfolio and at the aggregate level for the consumer, residential mortgage and small business portfolios. A historical charge-off factor is calculated utilizing a rolling 12 consecutive historical quarters for the commercial portfolios. This historical charge-off factor for the consumer, residential mortgage and small business portfolios are based on a three-year historical average of actual loss experience. The Company uses a comprehensive methodology and procedural discipline to maintain an ALL to absorb inherent losses in the loan portfolio.

Consistent with accounting and regulatory guidance, the Bank recognizes a TDR when the Bank, for economic or legal reasons related to a borrower s financial difficulties, grants a concession to the borrower that would not normally be considered. Regardless of the form of concession granted, the Bank s objective in offering a TDR is to increase the probability of repayment of the borrower s loan. 
 68 

Table of Contents AMERISERV FINANCIAL, INC. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 
 . A restructuring that results in an insignificant delay in payment, i.e. 120 days or less, is not necessarily a TDR. Insignificant payment delays occur when the amount of the restructured payments subject to the delay is insignificant relative to the unpaid principal or collateral value, and will result in an insignificant shortfall in the originally scheduled contractual amount due, and/or the delay in timing of the restructured payment period is insignificant relative to the frequency of payments, the original maturity or the original amortization. 
 The determination of whether a restructured loan is a TDR requires consideration of all of the facts and circumstances surrounding the modification. No single factor is determinative of whether a restructuring is a TDR. An overall general decline in the economy or some deterioration in a borrower s financial condition does not automatically mean that the borrower is experiencing financial difficulty. Accordingly, determination of whether a modification is a TDR involves a large degree of judgment. Any loan modification where the loan currently maintains a criticized or classified risk rating, i.e. Special Mention, Substandard or Doubtful, or where the loan will be assigned a criticized or classified rating after the modification is evaluated to determine the need for TDR classification. The specific ALL reserve for loans modified as TDR s was and as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively.

Loans in non-accrual status # of Loans Current Balance Concession Granted Commercial and industrial In all instances where loans have been modified in troubled debt restructurings the pre- and post-modified balances are the same. Once a loan is classified as a TDR, this classification will remain until documented improvement in the financial position of the borrower supports confidence that all principal and interest will be paid according to terms. Additionally, the customer must have re-established a track record of timely payments according to the restructured contract terms for a minimum of six consecutive months prior to consideration for removing the loan from non-accrual TDR status. However, a loan will continue to be on non-accrual status until, consistent with our policy, the borrower has made a minimum of six consecutive payments in accordance with the terms of the loan. There were loans that were modified as TDRs in the previous 12 months and defaulted during the reporting periods ending December 31, 2022, 2021 or 2020, respectively All TDRs are individually evaluated for impairment and a related allowance is recorded, as needed.

The Company utilizes a recognition threshold and a measurement attribute for the financial statement recognition and measurement of a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return. Benefits from tax positions should be recognized in the financial statements only when it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained upon examination by the appropriate taxing authority that would have full knowledge of all relevant information. A tax position that meets the more-likely-than-not recognition threshold is measured at the largest amount of benefit that is greater than fifty percent likely of being realized upon ultimate settlement. Tax positions that previously failed to meet the more-likely-than-not recognition threshold should be recognized in the first subsequent financial reporting period in which that threshold is met. Previously recognized tax positions that no longer meet the more-likely-than-not recognition threshold should be derecognized in the first subsequent financial reporting period in which that threshold is no longer met. The Company has no tax liability for uncertain tax positions.

A settlement charge must be recognized when the total dollar amount of lump sum distributions paid from the pension plan to retired employees exceeds a threshold of expected annual service and interest costs in the current year. The value of the lump sums continued to be elevated this year due to the lower interest rate levels late in 2021 when the lump sums were calculated. It is important to note that since the retired employees have chosen to take the lump sum payments, these individuals are no longer included in the pension plan. Therefore, we anticipate that the Company s normal annual pension expense should be lower in the future. This was evident in 2022 as the basic amount of pension expense required to be recognized, excluding the impact of settlement charges, was , or , lower for the full year of 2022 compared to basic pension expense for the full year of 2021. Note that pension settlement charges are dependent upon the level of national interest rates from the previous year and the impact that interest rates have on lump sum distributions to those employees eligible to retire. Pension settlement charges are also dependent upon the choice of retiring employees to either take a lump sum distribution or receive future monthly annuity payments. The accrued pension liability, which had a positive (debit) balance of million and million, was reclassified to other assets on the Consolidated Balance Sheets as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively.

Other sources of gain/loss such as plan experience, updated census data, and minor adjustments to actuarial assumptions, including updates to the retirement rates, form of payment election, salary scale, lump sum interest rates, and lump sum mortality tables, generated a combined gain of about of expected year end obligations. Expected return on plan assets Rate of compensation increase The Company has assumed a long-term expected return on plan assets. This assumption was based upon the plan s historical investment performance over a longer-term period of combined with the plan s investment objective of balanced growth and income.

Domestic equities may include common or preferred stocks, covered options, rights or warrants, or American Depository Receipts which are traded on any U.S. equity market. Mutual funds/ETFs may include any equity, fixed income, balanced, international, or global mutual fund or exchange traded fund including any propriety fund managed by the Trust Company. Agencies may include any U.S. government agency security or asset-backed security. Collective investment funds may include equity, fixed income, or balanced collective investment funds managed by West Chester Capital Advisors. Corporate bonds may include any corporate bond or note. The investment strategy objective for the pension plan is a balance of growth and income. This objective seeks to develop a portfolio for acceptable levels of current income together with the opportunity for capital appreciation. The balanced growth and income objective reflects an equal balance between equity and fixed income investments such as debt securities. The allocation between equity and fixed income assets may vary by a moderate degree during normal market cycles. The pension plan s allocation to equities is to while the allocation to fixed income can fall within the range of to of the plan assets. In addition, cash equivalents can range from to of the plan assets. The plan is also able to invest in ASRV common stock up to a maximum level of of the market value of the plan assets (at December 31, 2022, of the plan assets were invested in ASRV common stock). This asset mix is intended to ensure that there is a steady stream of cash from maturing investments to fund benefit payments. The plan s investment manager temporarily shifted the majority of plan assets to cash in 2022 to protect the plan s assets due to declines in both equities and bonds as a result of the higher interest rate environment. CASH FLOWS: The Company presently expects that the contribution to be made to the plan in 2023 will approximate million. Funding requirements for subsequent years are uncertain and will significantly depend on whether the plan s actuary changes any assumptions used to calculate plan funding levels, the actual return on plan assets, changes in the employee groups covered by the plan, and any legislative or regulatory changes affecting plan funding requirements. For tax planning, financial planning, cash flow management or cost reduction purposes the Company may increase, accelerate, decrease or delay contributions to the plan to the extent permitted by law.

 investment in a debt security with Signature Bank which was closed by the banking regulators on March 12, 2023. In a press release issued by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC), it was disclosed that unsecured debt holders of the institution will not be protected, therefore, the Company expects to recognize a substantial loss on this investment in the first quarter of 2023. Management has reviewed the December 31, 2022 Form 10-K filed by Signature and determined that no circumstances existed to indicate that the debt security held by the Company was impaired as of year-end. Specifically, as of December 31, 2022, Signature had total assets of billion, net income of billion for the year ended, and demonstrated strong regulatory capital ratios. On March 17, 2023, AmeriServ Financial Bank agreed to sell all shares of the Class B common stock of Visa Inc. that the bank owned for a purchase price of million. The shares had carrying value on the Bank s balance sheet and, as the Bank had no historical cost basis in the shares, the entire purchase will be realized as a pre-tax gain. The Company believes that this was an appropriate time to capture the gain on these shares due to the current volatility and future uncertainty in the financial markets. The transaction will have a positive impact on the Company s first quarter 2023 earnings.

 REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM To the Shareholders and the Board of Directors of AmeriServ Financial, Inc. Opinion on the Financial Statements We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of AmeriServ Financial Inc. and subsidiaries (the Company as of December 31, 2022 and 2021; the related consolidated statements of operations, comprehensive (loss) income, changes in shareholders equity, and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2022; and the related notes to the consolidated financial statements (collectively, the financial statements). In our opinion, the financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2022, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. Basis for Opinion These financial statements are the responsibility of the Company s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company s financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB) and are required to be independent, with respect to the Company, in accordance with U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. The Company is not required to have, nor were we engaged to perform, an audit of its internal control over financial reporting. As part of our audits, we are required to obtain an understanding of internal control over financial reporting but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Company s internal control over financial reporting. Accordingly, we express no such opinion. Our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion. Critical Audit Matters The critical audit matters communicated below are matters arising from the current period audit of the financial statements that were communicated or required to be communicated to the Audit Committee and that: (1) relate to accounts or disclosures that are material to the financial statements; and (2) involve our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of critical audit matters does not alter, in any way, our opinion on the financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matters below, providing separate opinions on the critical audit matters or on the accounts or disclosures to which they relate. Allowance for Loan Losses (ALL) Qualitative Factors Description of the Matter The Company s loan portfolio totaled 990.8 million as of December 31, 2022, and the associated ALL was 10.7 million. As discussed in Notes 1, 6 and 7 to the consolidated financial statements, determining the amount of the ALL requires significant judgment about the collectability of loans, which includes an assessment of quantitative factors such as historical loss experience within each risk category of loans and testing of certain commercial loans for impairment. Management applies additional qualitative adjustments to reflect the inherent losses that exist in the loan portfolio at the balance sheet date that are not reflected in the historical loss experience. Qualitative adjustments are made based upon changes in lending policies and practices, economic conditions, changes in the loan portfolio mix and volumes, trends in loan delinquencies and classified loans, collateral values, and concentrations of credit risk for the commercial loan portfolios. 
 98 

Table of Contents 
 We identified these qualitative adjustments within the ALL as critical audit matters because they involve a high degree of subjectivity. In turn, auditing management s judgments regarding the qualitative factors applied in the ALL calculation involved a high degree of subjectivity. How We Addressed the Matter in Our Audit We gained an understanding of the Company s process for establishing the ALL, including the qualitative adjustments made to the ALL. We evaluated the design and tested the operating effectiveness of controls over the Company s ALL process, which included, among others, management s review and approval controls designed to assess the need and level of qualitative adjustments to the ALL, as well as the reliability of the data utilized to support management s assessment. To test the qualitative adjustments, we evaluated the appropriateness of management s methodology and assessed whether all relevant risks were reflected in the ALL. Regarding the measurement of the qualitative adjustments, we evaluated the completeness, accuracy, and relevance of the data and inputs utilized in management s estimate. For example, we compared the inputs and data to the Company s historical loan performance data, third-party macroeconomic data, and considered the existence of new and contrary information. We also compared the ALL to the base range of historical losses to evaluate the level of reserves, including the reasonableness of qualitative adjustments. Furthermore, we analyzed the changes in the components of the qualitative reserves relative to changes in external market factors, the Company s loan portfolio, various internal risk metrics, and asset quality trends. We also utilized internal credit review specialists with knowledge to evaluate the appropriateness of management s risk-rating processes, to ensure that the risk ratings applied to the commercial loan portfolio were reasonable. We have served as the Company s auditor since 2007. /s/ March 27, 2023

 REPORT ON MANAGEMENT S ASSESSMENT OF INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING We, as management of AmeriServ Financial, Inc., are responsible for establishing and maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting that is designed to produce reliable financial statements in conformity with United States generally accepted accounting principles. The system of internal control over financial reporting as it relates to the financial statements is evaluated for effectiveness by management and tested for reliability through a program of internal audits. Actions are taken to correct potential deficiencies as they are identified. Any system of internal control, no matter how well designed, has inherent limitations, including the possibility that a control can be circumvented or overridden and misstatements due to error or fraud may occur and not be detected. Also, because of changes in conditions, internal control effectiveness may vary over time. Accordingly, even an effective system of internal control will provide only reasonable assurance with respect to financial statement preparation. Management assessed the Company s system of internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2022, in relation to criteria for effective internal control over financial reporting as described in 2013 Internal Control Integrated Framework, issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. Based on this assessment, management concludes that, as of December 31, 2022, its system of internal control over financial reporting is effective and meets the criteria of the 2013 Internal Control Integrated Framework . Management is responsible for compliance with the federal and state laws and regulations concerning dividend restrictions and federal laws and regulations concerning loans to insiders designated by the Federal Reserve as safety and soundness laws and regulations. Management has assessed compliance by the Company with the designated laws and regulations relating to safety and soundness. Based on the assessment, management believes that the Company complied, in all significant respects, with the designated laws and regulations related to safety and soundness for the year ended December 31, 2022. /s/ JEFFREY A.

The following summarizes the provisions of the Common Stock under the articles of incorporation and bylaws of the Corporation and under the provisions of the Pennsylvania Business Corporation Law of 1988, as amended (the PBCL ).

Dividends and Distributions Holders of Common Stock are entitled to receive dividends ratably if, as and when dividends are declared from time to time by the Board of Directors out of funds legally available for that purpose, after payment of dividends required to be paid on outstanding preferred stock, if any.

Stock Exchange Listing The Common Stock is listed on the Nasdaq Global Market under the symbol, ASRV. Fully Paid and Nonassessable Outstanding shares of Common Stock are validly issued, fully-paid and nonassessable. Preferred Stock 

The Corporation s articles of incorporation authorize the Board of Directors to fix by resolution the voting rights, designations and preferences, priorities, qualifications, privileges, limitations, restrictions, options, conversion rights, dividend features, retirement features, liquidation features, redemption features and other special or relative rights of the preferred stock and any series thereof. The Board of Directors has full authority to issue authorized preferred stock from time to time in one or more series, without further shareholder approval. Anti-Takeover Provisions Certain provisions of the Corporation s articles of incorporation, bylaws and the PBCL may have the effect of delaying, deferring, or preventing a change in control of the Corporation: Pennsylvania Anti-Takeover Provisions Certain anti-takeover provisions of the PBCL apply to Pennsylvania registered corporations (e.g., publicly traded companies) including those relating to (1) control share acquisitions, (2) disgorgement of profits by certain controlling persons, (3) business combination transactions with interested shareholders, and (4) the rights of shareholders to demand fair value for their stock following a control transaction. Pennsylvania law allows corporations to opt-out of these anti-takeover sections under certain circumstances, but the Corporation has not opted out of any of these anti-takeover provisions. A general summary of these applicable anti-takeover provisions is set forth below. Control Share Acquisitions . Pennsylvania law regarding control share acquisitions relates to the act of acquiring for the first time voting power over voting shares (other than (i) shares owned continuously by the same natural person since January 1, 1988, (ii) shares beneficially owned by any natural person or trust, estate, foundation or similar entity to the extent such shares were acquired solely by gift, inheritance, bequest, device or other testamentary distribution, directly or indirectly, from a natural person who beneficially owned the shares prior to January 1, 1988 or (iii) shares acquired pursuant to a stock split, stock dividend or similar distribution with respect to shares that have been beneficially owned continuously since their issuance by the Corporation by the shareholder that acquired them from the Corporation or that were acquired from such shareholder pursuant to (ii) above) equal to: (a) at least 20 but less than 33 1/3 ; (b) at least 33 1/3 but less than 50 ; or (c) 50 or more of the voting power of the corporation. Once a control share acquisition has occurred, then all shares in excess of the triggering threshold, plus shares purchased at any time with the intention of acquiring such voting power or shares purchased within 180 days of the date the triggering threshold was exceeded, are considered control shares. Control shares cannot vote either until their voting rights have been restored by two separate votes of the shareholders, as described below, or until they have been transferred to a person who is not an affiliate of the transferor and does not thereby also become the holder of control shares. The holder of control shares may wait until the next annual or special meeting after the acquisition took place to submit the question of the restoration of voting rights to the shareholders, or the acquiring person may accelerate the process by agreeing to underwrite the cost of a special meeting of shareholders for that purpose. In either case, the acquiring person is required to furnish for distribution to the shareholders an information statement containing a detailed disclosure concerning the acquiring person, its intentions with respect to ownership of securities of the corporation and other matters. As an alternative, a person submitting a bona fide written offer to make a control share acquisition may request prospective approval by the shareholders of the exercise of the voting rights of the shares proposed to be acquired, provided that the control share acquisition is consummated within 90 days after shareholder approval is obtained. Two shareholder votes are required to approve the restoration of voting rights. First, the approval of a majority of all voting power must be obtained. Second, the approval of a majority of all disinterested shareholders must be obtained. For a period of 24 months after the later of (a) a control share acquisition by an acquiring person who does not properly request consideration of voting rights, or (b) the denial of such a request or lapse of voting rights, the corporation may redeem all the control shares at the average of the high and low public market sales price of the shares on the date notice of the call for redemption is given by the corporation. Disgorgement of Profits by Certain Controlling Persons . Pennsylvania law regarding disgorgement of profits by certain controlling persons applies in the event that (a) any person or group directly or indirectly publicly discloses or causes to be disclosed that the person or group may seek to acquire control of the corporation, or (b) a person or group 

acquires, offers to acquire or directly or indirectly publicly discloses or causes to be disclosed an intent to acquire) 20 or more of the voting power of the corporation and, in either case, sells shares within 18 months thereafter. Any profits from sales of equity securities of the corporation received by the person or group during such 18-month period will belong to the corporation if the securities that were sold were acquired during the 18-month period after or within 24 months prior to becoming a controlling person. Business Combination Transactions with Interested Shareholders . Pennsylvania law regarding business combination transactions with interested shareholders provides that a person who acquires the direct or indirect beneficial ownership of shares entitled to cast at least 20 of the votes entitled to be cast for the election of directors or an affiliate or associate of the corporation who at any time within the prior five years was the beneficial owner, directly or indirectly, of 20 of the voting shares of the corporation is an interested shareholder. A corporation subject to this provision may not effect mergers or certain other business combinations with the interested shareholder for a period of five years, unless: the business combination or the acquisition of stock by means of which the interested shareholder became an interested shareholder is approved by the Board of Directors prior to such stock acquisition; the business combination is approved by the affirmative vote of the holders of all the outstanding common shares of the corporation; or the business combination is approved by the affirmative vote of the holders of a majority of all shares entitled to vote, excluding votes of shares held by the interested shareholders or their affiliates, and at the time of such vote, the interested shareholder is the beneficial owner of at least 80 of the voting shares of the corporation. This exception applies only if the value of the consideration to be paid by the interested shareholder in connection with the business combination satisfies certain fair price requirements. 
 After the five-year restricted period, an interested shareholder of the corporation may engage in a business combination with the corporation if (a) the business combination is approved by the affirmative vote of a majority of the shares other than those beneficially owned by the interested shareholder and its affiliates, or (b) the merger is approved at a shareholders meeting and certain fair price requirements are met. Rights of Shareholders to Demand Full Value for their Stock Following Control Transaction. Under Pennsylvania law, a control transaction is an acquisition by a person or group of the voting power over at least 20 of the voting shares of the corporation. Subject to exceptions, if a Pennsylvania registered corporation is subject to a control transaction, the controlling person or group must provide prompt notice of the transaction to the court and each shareholder of record holding voting shares. Any holder of voting shares may make a written demand on the controlling person or group for payment in cash of the fair value of each voting share at the date on which the control transaction occurs. The minimum value that a shareholder can receive is the highest price paid per share by the controlling person or group within the 90-day period ending on and including the date of the control transaction. If any shareholder believes the fair value of her shares is higher than the price offered by the controlling person or group, the shareholder may file a petition with the court seeking appraisal of the shares. Blank Check Preferred Stock The articles of incorporation provide for the issuance of preferred stock having terms established by the Board of Directors without shareholder approval. Staggered Board of Directors The articles of incorporation provide for the classification of the Board of Directors into three classes with each class serving a staggered three-year term. As a result of this classification, only one third of the entire Board of Directors stands for election in any one year and a minimum of two annual meetings would be required to elect a majority of the Board of Directors. 

Calling of Special Meetings of Shareholders Pursuant to the bylaws, special meetings of shareholders may only be called by the Non-Executive Chairperson of the Board of Directors, by the Non-Executive Vice Chairperson of the Board of Directors, by a majority of the Board of Directors, by the Chief Executive Officer of the Corporation, or by the President of the Corporation. Advance Notice Requirements for Shareholder Proposals and Director Nominations The bylaws provide that notice of any proposal by a shareholder which the shareholder desires to submit to a vote at an annual meeting, including any director nominations, must be made by notice in writing, delivered or mailed by first class United States mail, postage prepaid, to the Secretary of the Corporation not less than ninety (90) days nor more than one hundred twenty (120) days prior to any annual meeting of shareholders. The bylaws also specify requirements as to the contents of the shareholder s notice or nomination. If notice is not provided in accordance with these provisions, a shareholder s proposal will not appear on the meeting agenda. Removal of Directors Under the articles of incorporation, any director can be removed from office by a shareholder vote at any time, without assigning any cause, but only if the holders of not less than two-thirds of the voting power of the then outstanding shares of capital stock of the Corporation entitled to vote at an annual election of directors voting together as a single class, shall vote in favor of such removal. Amendments to Articles of Incorporation Under the PBCL, an amendment to the articles of incorporation requires, except in limited cases where a greater vote may be required, the affirmative vote of a majority of the votes cast by all shareholders entitled to vote on the matter and the affirmative vote of a majority of the votes cast by all shareholders within each class or series of shares if such class or series is entitled to vote on the matter as a class. The PBCL also provides that our shareholders are not entitled by statute to propose amendments to the articles of incorporation. Amendments to Bylaws The bylaws provide that our bylaws may be amended or repealed, in whole or in part, by the affirmative vote of a majority of the Board of Directors at any regular or special meeting of the Board of Directors. The PBCL provides that the ability of the Board of Directors to adopt, amend or repeal the bylaws is subject to the power of shareholders to change such action. The PBCL also provides that the Board of Directors does not have the authority to adopt or change a bylaw on specified subjects, including, but not limited to, authorized capital, the personal liability of directors, various matters relating to the Board of Directors, and matters relating to the voting rights of shareholders.
