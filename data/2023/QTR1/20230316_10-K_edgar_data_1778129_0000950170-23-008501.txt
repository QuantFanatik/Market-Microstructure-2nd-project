Certain of the forward-looking statements contained herein concerning the cannabis industry and the general expectations of TerrAscend concerning the cannabis industry are based on estimates prepared by TerrAscend using data from publicly available governmental sources as well as from market research and industry analysis and on assumptions based on data and knowledge of the cannabis industry.

 With respect to the forward-looking statements contained in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, TerrAscend has made assumptions regarding, among other things: (i) its ability to generate cash flows from operations and obtain necessary financing on acceptable terms; (ii) general economic, financial market, regulatory and political conditions in which TerrAscend operates; (iii) the output from TerrAscend s operations; (iv) consumer interest in TerrAscend s products; (v) competition; (vi) anticipated and unanticipated costs; (vii) government regulation of TerrAscend s activities and products and in the areas of taxation and environmental protection; (viii) the timely receipt of any required regulatory approvals; (ix) TerrAscend s ability to obtain qualified staff, equipment and services in a timely and cost efficient manner; (x) TerrAscend s ability to conduct operations in a safe, efficient and effective manner; and (xi) the Company s construction plans and timeframe for completion of such plans. 
 Readers are cautioned that the above list of cautionary statements is not exhaustive. Known and unknown risks, many of which are beyond the control of TerrAscend, could cause actual results to differ materially from the forward-looking statements in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Such risks and uncertainties include, but are not limited to, current and future market conditions; risks related to federal, state, provincial, territorial, local and foreign government laws, rules and regulations, including federal and state laws in the United States U.S. relating to cannabis operations in the U.S.; and those discussed under Item 1A Risk Factors in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.

You should not place undue reliance on forward-looking statements contained in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. TerrAscend can give no assurance that such expectations will prove to have been correct. Forward-looking statements contained herein are made as of the date of this Annual Report on Form 10-K and are based on the beliefs, estimates, expectations and opinions of management on the date such forward-looking statements are made. TerrAscend undertakes no obligation to update or revise any forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, estimates or opinions, future events or results or otherwise or to explain any material difference between subsequent actual events and such forward-looking statements, except as required by applicable law.

Risk Factor Summary 
 Investing in TerrAscend s common shares Common Shares involves risks. You should carefully consider the risks described in Item 1A Risk Factors beginning on page 25 before deciding to invest in TerrAscend s Common Shares. If any of these risks actually occur, TerrAscend s business, financial condition and results of operations would likely be materially adversely affected. In such case, the trading price of TerrAscend s Common Shares would likely decline, and you may lose all or part of your investment. Set forth below is a summary of some of the principal risks TerrAscend faces: 
 There is a substantial risk of regulatory or political change with respect to cannabis, which could have a material adverse effect on TerrAscend s business. 

Compliance with regulations regarding cannabis is difficult, because the regulation of cannabis is uncertain and frequently changes. TerrAscend s failure to comply with applicable laws regarding cannabis may materially adversely affect TerrAscend s business. 

TerrAscend s business relies heavily on its ability to obtain and maintain required licenses, and failure to do so may adversely affect TerrAscend s business. 

As a cannabis business, TerrAscend is subject to unfavorable tax treatment under the U.S. federal income tax law. 

If TerrAscend is or becomes a passive foreign investment company , its U.S investors may suffer adverse tax consequences. 

If TerrAscend (or any of its non-U.S. subsidiaries) is a controlled foreign corporation , certain of its U.S. investors may suffer adverse tax consequences. 

TerrAscend's ability to use its U.S. net operating loss carryforwards to offset its future U.S. taxable income may be subject to limitations. 

Tax and accounting requirements may change or be interpreted in ways that are unforeseen to TerrAscend, and TerrAscend may face difficulty or be unable to implement and/or comply with any such changes or interpretations. 

Cannabis remains illegal under U.S. federal law, and enforcement of cannabis laws could change. TerrAscend may be subject to action by the U.S. federal government due to its involvement with cannabis, and such action could materially adversely affect the TerrAscend s business. 

TerrAscend s business is subject to applicable anti-money laundering laws and regulations and have restricted access to capital markets, banking and other financial services, which may adversely affect TerrAscend s business. 

TerrAscend operates in a highly regulated sector and may not always succeed in complying fully with applicable regulatory requirements in all jurisdictions where TerrAscend carries on business, which could negatively affect TerrAscend s business. 

Regulatory restrictions on ownership outside of the control of TerrAscend may have a material adverse impact on TerrAscend's operations in certain markets. 

Failure to comply with privacy or medical practice laws and regulations may result in impacts to operations, monetary fines or litigation. 

TerrAscend s products may be subject to product recalls or returns, which may result in expense, legal proceedings, regulatory action, loss of sales and reputation, and management attention. 

TerrAscend faces an inherent risk of product liability claims and other consumer protection claims as a manufacturer, processor and producer of products that are meant to be ingested by people, and dealing with such claims could cause TerrAscend to incur substantial expenses and have a material adverse effect on TerrAscend s business. 

TerrAscend may be subject to constraints on and differences in marketing its products under varying regulatory restrictions. 

3 

TerrAscend may be subject to heightened scrutiny by Canadian regulatory authorities, which could negatively affect its business. 

TerrAscend s investors and directors, officers and employees who are not U.S. citizens may be denied entry into the United States, which may negatively affect TerrAscend s business. 

Because TerrAscend s contracts involve cannabis and related activities, which are not legal under U.S. federal law, TerrAscend may face difficulties in enforcing its contracts. 

TerrAscend may encounter increasingly strict environmental health and safety regulations in connection with its operations, which may harm TerrAscend s business. 

Transition to becoming a U.S. reporting company poses added risks as a result of required compliance changes. 

TerrAscend s indebtedness may adversely affect TerrAscend s business, results of operations and financial condition. TerrAscend s failure to comply with applicable covenants could trigger events that may materially adversely affect TerrAscend s business, results of operations and financial condition. 

TerrAscend may require substantial additional financing to operate its business and it may face difficulties acquiring additional financing on terms acceptable to TerrAscend, or at all. 

Raising additional funds by issuing equity securities will cause dilution to existing stockholders. Raising additional funds through debt financings may involve restrictive covenants and raising funds through lending and licensing arrangements may restrict our operations or require us to relinquish proprietary rights. We may not be able to secure additional debt or equity financing on favorable terms or at all. 

An adverse change in market conditions, including a sustained decline in TerrAscend s share price, negative changes to TerrAscend s position in the market, or lack of growth in demand for its products and services could be considered to be an impairment triggering event. Such changes could impact valuation assumptions relating to the recoverability of assets and have resulted in, and may in the future result in, impairment charges to TerrAscend s goodwill or long-lived asset balances, which would negatively impact TerrAscend s operating results and harm its business. 

TerrAscend faces intense competition as a relatively new entrant in the cannabis industry, and its business could be adversely affected by other businesses in a better competitive position. 

Consolidation in the cannabis industry and other changes to the competitive environment can impact TerrAscend's margins and profitability. 

TerrAscend may be required to write down intangible assets, including goodwill, due to impairment, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations or financial position. 

The cannabis industry and market are relatively new, and this industry and market may not continue to exist or grow as expected. 

TerrAscend's profitability may be impacted by declining wholesale or retail cannabis prices in certain markets and shifting market conditions. 

TerrAscend has historically had negative cash flow from operating activities, and continued losses could have a material negative effect on TerrAscend's business and prospects and impact TerrAscend's ability to continue as a going concern. 

TerrAscend may be affected by currency fluctuations. 

Demand for TerrAscend s products is difficult to forecast due to limited and unreliable market data. 

TerrAscend s inability to attract and retain key personnel could materially adversely affect its business. 

TerrAscend may face unfavorable publicity or consumer perception of the safety, efficacy and quality of its cannabis products. 

TerrAscend faces reputational risks, which may negatively impact its business. 

4 

TerrAscend is dependent on suppliers and key inputs for the cultivation, extraction and production of cannabis products. 

TerrAscend s business is subject to the risks inherent in agricultural operations. 

TerrAscend may be adversely impacted by rising or volatile energy costs. 

TerrAscend s intellectual property may be difficult to protect, and failure to do so may negatively impact its business. 

TerrAscend and investors may have difficulty enforcing their legal rights. 

TerrAscend (and the third parties upon which it relies) faces physical security risks, as well as risks related to its information technology systems, potential cyber-attacks, and security breaches. 

TerrAscend is or may become subject to stringent and evolving U.S. and foreign laws, regulations, rules, contractual obligations, policies and other obligations related to data privacy and security. Its actual or perceived failure to comply with such obligations could lead to regulatory investigations or actions; litigation; fines and penalties; disruptions of our business operations; reputational harm; loss of revenue or profits; and other adverse business consequences. 

TerrAscend faces exposure to fraudulent or illegal activities by employees, contractors and consultants, which may subject TerrAscend to investigations or other actions. 

Directors and officers of TerrAscend have faced, and may in the future face, conflicts of interests regarding the business strategy of TerrAscend. 

TerrAscend s internal controls over financial reporting may not be effective, and TerrAscend s independent auditors may not be able to certify as to their effectiveness, which could have a significant and adverse effect on TerrAscend s business. 

TerrAscend s business could be adversely affected by economic downturns, inflation, increases in interest rates, natural disasters, public health crises such as the COVID-19 pandemic, political crises, geopolitical events, such as the crisis in Ukraine, or other macroeconomic conditions, which have in the past and may in the future negatively impact TerrAscend s business and financial performance. 

The development of TerrAscend s products is complex and requires significant investment. Failure to develop new technologies and products could adversely affect TerrAscend s business. 

TerrAscend needs to attract and retain customers and patients in order to succeed, and failure to do so may have a material adverse effect on TerrAscend s business. 

TerrAscend has a limited operating history, which makes it difficult to evaluate its prospects and predict future operating results. 

TerrAscend may be subject to growth-related risks, which could negatively affect its business. 

The success of TerrAscend s business depends, in part, on its ability to successfully integrate recently acquired businesses and to retain key employees of acquired businesses. If TerrAscend is unsuccessful in doing so, it may negatively affect TerrAscend s business. 

There can be no assurance that TerrAscend s current and future strategic alliances will have a beneficial impact on TerrAscend s business, financial condition and results of operations. 

TerrAscend s use of joint ventures may expose TerrAscend to risks associated with jointly owned investments. 

TerrAscend s voting control is concentrated. 

TerrAscend s Preferred Shares have a liquidation preference over the Common Shares, which could limit TerrAscend s ability to make distributions to the holders of Common Shares. 

An investor may face liquidity risks with an investment in the Common Shares. 

The price of TerrAscend s Common Shares may be volatile, and may be adversely affected by the price of cannabis. 

5 

Additional issuances of TerrAscend s securities may result in dilution. 

Sales of substantial amounts of Common Shares may have an adverse effect on the market price of the Common Shares. 

TerrAscend s management will continue to have broad discretion over the use of the proceeds TerrAscend receives in its public offerings, private placements, warrant exercises and loans, as applicable, and might not apply the proceeds in ways that increase the value of your investment. 

Risks related to potential disqualification of equity holders by regulatory authorities. 

TerrAscend does not intend to pay dividends on its Common Shares for the foreseeable future and, consequently, your ability to achieve a return on your investment will depend on appreciation in the price of TerrAscend s Common Shares. 

Penny stock rules may make buying or selling TerrAscend s securities difficult which may make its securities less liquid and make it harder for investors to buy and sell such securities. 

TerrAscend may not be able to obtain necessary permits and authorizations. 

Due to the uncertainty regarding the implementation and impact of the CARES Act and other legislation related to COVID-19, and their application to businesses substantially similar to TerrAscend there is a risk that failure to comply with the legislation may negatively impact TerrAscend and businesses substantially similar to TerrAscend. 

TerrAscend may be subject to litigation, which could divert the attention of management and cause TerrAscend to expend significant resources. 

TerrAscend faces risks and hazards that may not be covered by insurance. 

TerrAscend has incurred and will continue to incur substantial costs as a result of operating as a public company in Canada and the United States, and its management will continue to devote substantial time to new compliance initiatives. 

TerrAscend is currently an emerging growth company within the meaning of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the Securities Act ), and to the extent TerrAscend has taken advantage of certain exemptions from disclosure requirements available to emerging growth companies, this could make its securities less attractive to investors and may make it more difficult to compare the company s performance with other public companies.

 Reorganization 
 Entry into the U.S. Cannabis Market and Capital Reorganization

At the time TerrAscend had limited operations in the U.S. and did not engage in the business of, or derive any revenue from, the cultivation, distribution or possession of cannabis in the United States. On October 9, 2018, TerrAscend announced its intention to pursue growth opportunities in the U.S. cannabis market, including potential acquisitions of operators in states that have legalized cannabis for medical or recreational use. In connection therewith, TerrAscend began exploring potential acquisition targets with significant market share and strong brand recognition. To support this strategy, TerrAscend entered into an agreement with Canopy Growth Corporation Canopy Growth ), RIV Capital Inc. (formerly Canopy Rivers Inc.) RIV Capital ), and entities controlled by Jason Wild, chairman of TerrAscend (JW Opportunities Master Fund, Ltd., JW Partners, LP, and Pharmaceutical Opportunities Fund, LP) to reorganize the capital of TerrAscend (the TerrAscend Reorganization and obtain waivers of certain contractual covenants that at the time, restricted TerrAscend from operating in the U.S. The TerrAscend Reorganization was implemented by way of a statutory plan of arrangement on the terms set out in the Arrangement Agreement and was subject to court approval, the approval of TerrAscend s shareholders, and other customary conditions. The TerrAscend Reorganization was completed on November 30, 2018.

 12 

Distribution Methods 
 TerrAscend distributes its branded products across dispensaries in Pennsylvania, New Jersey, Maryland, Michigan and California. In Canada, TerrAscend sells its products to consumers in Ontario. TerrAscend s Arise business also sells whole-plant hemp extract products in retail locations across the United States where legally permitted. 
 Sources and Availability of Materials 
 TerrAscend grows or procures the primary component of its finished products, namely cannabis. TerrAscend s cultivation operations are dependent on a number of key inputs and their related costs including raw materials and supplies related to its growing operations, as well as electricity, water and other utilities. 
 Specialized Knowledge and Skills 
 TerrAscend s business requires specialized skills and knowledge. TerrAscend believes its team has developed and sourced business systems to effectively and efficiently operate its wholesale operations and retail cannabis operations in the states and provinces in which it operates in the U.S. states and Canadian provinces in which it operates. The brand building, retail marketing and product development knowledge and skills of TerrAscend s management team and employees will be essential to TerrAscend becoming a well-respected household name within the retail cannabis industry. Please see Item 1A Risk Factors Risks Related to TerrAscend s Business, Operations and Industry TerrAscend is dependent on suppliers and key inputs for the cultivation, extraction and production of cannabis products . 
 Competitive Conditions 
 TerrAscend faces, and will continue to face, competition from new and existing licensed cannabis operators, competitors with existing retail operations, government owned retailers and the illicit market and other applicable participants in the cannabis wholesale and manufacturing industry. Some of the competitors of TerrAscend may have greater financial resources, market access and manufacturing and marketing experience than TerrAscend. Due to challenging market conditions in certain states, some operators have exited the industry and in doing so have heavily discounted their products, creating pressure on pricing. 
 Increased competition by numerous independent cannabis retail outlets, wholesalers and larger and better financed competitors (including new entrants), and heavily discounted products by exiting players could have a material adverse effect on TerrAscend. 
 TerrAscend s competition can be grouped into the following categories: 
 (a) Vertically Integrated Competitors: This class of competitors (which may include licensed producers of cannabis that are able to produce cannabis and cannabis products sold at retail stores of their affiliates) includes well-financed competitors with an established operating history in North America. 

(b) Existing Retailers: This class of competitors includes early-stage and semi-developed retail cannabis businesses, as well as established retail cannabis businesses, which may be well capitalized, and which may also have an established and longer retail operating history in North America. 

(c) Government Competition: This class of competitors includes government wholesalers that sell directly to consumers in the Provinces of British Columbia, Alberta and Ontario. 

(d) Illicit Market: This class of competitors includes individuals and businesses operating in the illicit market within various jurisdictions across North America. These competitors may divert sizeable commercial opportunities from TerrAscend. 

(e) Existing Wholesalers: This class of competitors includes early-stage and semi-developed wholesalers, as well as established wholesalers, which may be well capitalized, and which may also have an established and longer retail operating history in North America. 

(f) Exiting Competitors: This class of competitors may be vertically integrated or may only operate at retail or wholesale, and due to financial distress are exiting the cannabis market. These competitors may heavily discount their products during the process of winding down their operations.

Protection of Intellectual Property 
 The ownership and protection of TerrAscend s intellectual property rights is a significant aspect of TerrAscend s future success. Currently the Company relies on trade secrets, technical know-how and proprietary information. The Company protects its intellectual property by seeking and obtaining registered protection where possible, developing and implementing standard operating procedures to protect trade secrets, technical know-how and proprietary information and entering into restrictive agreements with parties that have access to the Company s inventions, trade secrets, technical know-how and proprietary information, such as TerrAscend s partners, collaborators, employees and consultants, to protect confidentiality and ownership. The Company also seeks to preserve the integrity and confidentiality of its inventions, trade secrets, trademarks, technical know-how and proprietary information by maintaining physical security of the Company s premises and physical and electronic security of its information technology systems. 
 In addition, the Company has sought and will continue to seek trademark protection in the United States and Canada. TerrAscend s ability to obtain registered trademark protection for cannabis-related goods and services, in particular for cannabis itself, may be limited in certain countries outside of Canada, including the United States, where registered federal trademark protection is currently unavailable for trademarks covering marijuana-related products and services that are illegal under the CSA. Accordingly, TerrAscend s ability to obtain intellectual property rights or enforce intellectual property rights against third party uses of similar trademarks may be limited in certain countries. The U.S. Patent and Trademark Office released a policy on May 2, 2019 that clarifies that applications for trademarks for products that meet the definition of hemp could be accepted for registration, with certain exceptions. 
 Human Capital 
 As of December 31, 2022, TerrAscend employed 1,125 employees, none of whom were subject to a collective bargaining agreement. Of these employees, approximately 972 were full-time. TerrAscend believes it has a good relationship with its employees. 
 TerrAscend believes in building a diverse team, and it strives to make TerrAscend a welcoming space where everyone can make an impact on TerrAscend s success. TerrAscend encourages talented people from all backgrounds to join TerrAscend and strives to make it a place of inclusion. 
 TerrAscend is committed to providing a safe and secure work environment in accordance with applicable labor, safety, health, anti-discrimination and other workplace laws. TerrAscend strives for all TerrAscend s employees to feel safe and empowered at work. To that end, TerrAscend maintains a hotline that employees can call, with the option of remaining anonymous, to voice concerns. 
 Licenses and Regulatory Framework in United States 
 TerrAscend and its subsidiaries, as applicable, currently hold all necessary state licenses and permits to carry on the activities it conducts. 
 Summary of U.S. Cannabis Regulatory Regime 
 The cannabis industry is subject to various state and local laws, regulations and guidelines relating to the cultivation, manufacture, distribution, sale, storage and disposal of medical and recreational cannabis, as well as laws and regulations relating to health and safety, the conduct of operations and the protection of the environment. The U.S. regulatory scheme varies in its terminology and definitions, using cannabis , marijuana and hemp as distinct terms. The regulatory environment governing the medical and recreational marijuana industries in the United States, where state law permits such activities, are, and will continue to be, subject to evolving regulation by governmental authorities. Accordingly, there are a number of risks associated with investing in businesses in an evolving regulatory environment, including, without limitation, increased industry competition, rapid consolidation of industry participants and potential insolvency of industry participants. 
 38 states plus the District of Columbia, the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands, Puerto Rico, U.S. Virgin Islands and Guam that have authorized medical marijuana and approximately 21 states plus the District of Columbia, Guam, and the Commonwealth of Northern Marina Islands who have authorized adult-use marijuana. Notwithstanding the permissive regulatory environment of medical, and in some cases also recreational marijuana at the state level, marijuana remains a Schedule I drug under the CSA, making it illegal under U.S. federal law to cultivate, manufacture, distribute, sell or possess marijuana in the United States. Furthermore, financial transactions involving proceeds generated by, or intended to promote, cannabis-related business activities in the United States may form the basis for prosecution under applicable U.S/ federal money laundering legislation. 
 14 

The U.S. federal government s approach to enforcement of marijuana laws has trended toward deference to state laws where a robust state regulatory framework exists. On August 29, 2013, the U.S. Department of Justice (the DOJ issued a memorandum known as the Cole Memorandum to all U.S. Attorneys offices. The Cole Memorandum generally directed U.S. Attorneys not to prioritize the enforcement of federal marijuana laws against individuals and businesses that comply with state medical marijuana programs. The Cole Memorandum, while not legally binding and only a policy statement, assisted in managing the tension between state and federal laws concerning all medical and adult-use state-regulated marijuana businesses. 
 On January 4, 2018, the Cole Memorandum was rescinded by former Attorney General Sessions. While this did not create a change in federal law, the revocation added to the uncertainty of U.S. federal enforcement of the CSA in states where marijuana use is regulated. Former Attorney General Sessions also issued a one-page memorandum known as the Sessions Memorandum which confirmed the rescission of the Cole Memorandum and explained that the Cole Memorandum was unnecessary due to existing general enforcement guidance as set forth in the U.S. Attorney s Manual. While the Sessions Memorandum does emphasize that marijuana is a Schedule I controlled substance, and states the statutory view that it is a dangerous drug and that marijuana activity is a serious crime, it does not otherwise indicate that the prosecution of marijuana-related offenses is a heightened DOJ priority. Furthermore, the Sessions Memorandum explicitly describes itself as a guide to prosecutorial discretion. Such prosecutorial discretion remains in the hands of U.S. Attorneys when deciding whether or not to prosecute marijuana-related offenses. 
 On November 7, 2018, U.S. Attorney General Jeff Sessions resigned as U.S. Attorney General. On February 14, 2019, William Barr was confirmed by the U.S. Senate as the next Attorney General. During one of his Senate confirmation hearings, Mr. Barr stated that he did not support cannabis legalization but would not prosecute cannabis businesses that comply with state laws. Mr. Barr stated further that he would not upset settled expectations that have arisen as a result of the Cole Memorandum. 
 On March 11, 2021, Merrick Garland was appointed U.S. Attorney General. Mr. Garland indicated he would generally act in accordance with the Cole Memorandum, when, at his confirmation hearing, he said, It does not seem to me a useful use of limited resources that we have, to be pursuing prosecutions in states that have legalized and that are regulating the use of marijuana, either medically or otherwise. He has not, however, reissued the Cole Memorandum or issued substitute guidance. While enforcement of federal laws against regulated state entities does not appear to be a U.S. DOJ priority, the U.S. DOJ may change its enforcement policies at any time, with or without advance notice. 
 For the reasons set forth herein, TerrAscend s existing investments in the United States, and any future investments, may become the subject of heightened scrutiny by regulators, stock exchanges and other authorities in Canada. As a result, TerrAscend may be subject to significant direct and indirect interaction with public officials. There can be no assurance that this heightened scrutiny will not lead to the imposition of certain restrictions on TerrAscend s ability to invest in the United States or any other jurisdiction. Government policy changes or public opinion may also result in a significant influence over the regulation of the marijuana industry in the United States or elsewhere. A negative shift in the public s perception of marijuana in the United States or any other applicable jurisdiction could affect future legislation or regulation. Among other things, such a shift could cause state and local jurisdictions to abandon initiatives or proposals to legalize medical or recreational marijuana, thereby limiting the number of new state jurisdictions into which TerrAscend could expand. Any inability to fully implement TerrAscend s expansion strategy may have a material adverse effect on TerrAscend s business, financial condition and results of operations. 
 Additionally, under United States federal law, it may be a violation of federal money laundering statutes for financial institutions to take any proceeds from the sale of marijuana or any other Schedule I controlled substance. Banks and other financial institutions, particularly those that are federally chartered in the United States, could be prosecuted and possibly convicted of money laundering for providing services to marijuana businesses. It may also be a violation of federal money laundering statutes for federal health care law violations, which include violations of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act FDCA ). 
 Violations of any U.S. federal laws and regulations could result in significant fines, penalties, administrative sanctions, convictions or settlements arising from civil proceedings conducted by either the federal government or private citizens, or criminal charges, including, but not limited to, disgorgement of profits, cessation of business activities, civil forfeiture or divestiture. This could have a material adverse effect on TerrAscend, including its reputation and ability to conduct business, its marijuana licenses in the United States, the listing of its securities on various stock exchanges, its financial position, operating results, profitability or liquidity or the market price of its publicly traded shares. In addition, it is difficult for TerrAscend to estimate the time or resources that would be needed for the investigation of any such matters or its final resolution because, in part, the time and resources that may be needed are dependent on the nature and extent of any information requested by the applicable authorities involved, and such time or resources could be substantial. For the reasons set forth above, TerrAscend s investments and operations in the United States may become the subject of heightened scrutiny by regulators, stock exchanges and other authorities in Canada. 
 15 

TerrAscend may also be subject to a variety of laws and regulations domestically and in the United States that relate to money laundering, financial recordkeeping and proceeds of crime, including the Currency and Foreign Transactions Reporting Act of 1970 (commonly known as the Bank Secrecy Act), as amended by Title III of the Uniting and Strengthening America by Providing Appropriate Tools Required to Intercept and Obstruct Terrorism Act of 2001 (USA PATRIOT Act), the Proceeds of Crime (Money Laundering) and Terrorist Financing Act (Canada), as amended and the rules and regulations thereunder, the Criminal Code (Canada) and any related or similar rules, regulations or guidelines, issued, administered or enforced by governmental authorities in the United States and Canada. Further, under U.S. federal law, banks or other financial institutions that provide a marijuana business with a checking account, debit or credit card, small business loan, or any other service could be found guilty of money laundering, aiding and abetting, or conspiracy. 
 In February 2014, the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network of the Treasury Department issued a memorandum (the FinCEN Memorandum providing instructions to banks seeking to provide services to marijuana-related businesses. The FinCEN Memorandum clarifies how financial institutions can provide services to marijuana-related businesses consistent with their Bank Secrecy Act obligations. It refers to supplementary guidance that Deputy Attorney General Cole issued to federal prosecutors relating to the prosecution of money laundering offenses predicated on marijuana-related violations of the CSA and independently lists the federal government s enforcement priorities as related to marijuana. Although the original FinCEN Memorandum is still in place, this supplementary Department of Justice guidance that accompanied the FinCEN Memorandum was rescinded when former Attorney General Sessions rescinded the Cole Memorandum. It is unclear whether the current administration will follow the guidelines of the FinCEN Memorandum, although immediately after the Sessions Memorandum, then-U.S. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin stated that the Treasury Department had no intention to rescind the FinCEN Memorandum but, instead, wanted to improve the availability of banking services in the state-regulated marijuana space. The position of current Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen is relatively unknown. In the foreseeable future, TerrAscend expects any amounts payable by TerrAscend from its subsidiaries to remain in the United States to fund the further development of its businesses. TerrAscend may also consider future debt or equity financings. 
 H.R. 1595, the SAFE Banking Act of 2019, which would expand financial services in the United States to marijuana-related legitimate businesses and service providers, was introduced in the U.S. House of Representatives (the House on March 7, 2019 with bipartisan support. On April 11, 2019, S. 1200, the U.S. Senate (the Senate version of the SAFE Banking Act, was filed. This bill also has bipartisan support and more than a fifth of the total Senate, 27 members, co-sponsored it. On September 25, 2019, H.R. 1595 passed in the House by a vote of 321 to 103, but it stalled in the U.S. Senate. The SAFE Banking Act passed the House again on May 15, 2020, when it was included in the COVID-19 stimulus bill, the Health and Economic Recovery Omnibus Emergency Solutions Act. However, that measure also stalled in the Senate. The SAFE Banking Act passed the House again on April 19, 2021 as H.R. 1996, by a vote of 321 101. The bill was received by the Senate and referred to the Committee on Banking, Housing and Urban Affairs, where it remained. On September 23, 2021, the House approved the National Defense Authorization Act NDAA that contained the provisions of the SAFE Banking Act. The SAFE Banking Act was subsequently removed from the NDAA by the House-Senate conference committee on December 7, 2021, and was not included in the final version of the NDAA. On February 4, 2022, the House passed the America COMPETES Act of 2022, which included the provisions of the SAFE Banking Act. The legislation has yet to be affirmed by the Senate. 
 Other legislation that has been introduced in the United States that would make cannabis transactions easier and more predictable, include the Marijuana Opportunity Reinvestment and Expungement Act (the MORE Act and the Cannabis Administration and Opportunities Act (the CAOA ). The MORE Act was first introduced in July 2019 by Representative Jerrold Nadler in the House, and in the Senate by then-U.S. Senator Kamala Harris. If it were to become law, the MORE Act would remove cannabis as a Schedule I controlled substance under the CSA and make available U.S. Small Business Administration funding for regulated cannabis operators. The MORE Act was reintroduced in the current U.S. Congress Congress by Representative Nadler on May 28, 2021, with no corresponding bill introduced in the Senate. The CAOA was released as a discussion draft by U.S. Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, U.S. Senator Ron Wyden, and U.S. Senator Cory Booker in July 2021. If it were to become law it would, among other things, remove cannabis from the definition of a controlled substance under the CSA, allow states to set their own regulations for cannabis, and block states from prohibiting interstate commerce of regulated cannabis across their borders. Recently introduced into Congress is another bill, the States Reform Act SRA ), introduced by Rep. Nancy Mace (R-SC), which would repeal the federal prohibition of cannabis. 
 Despite the rescission of the Cole Memorandum, one legislative safeguard for the medical marijuana industry remains in place. Congress has used a rider known as the Rohrabacher-Blumenauer Amendment in the fiscal year 2015, 2016 and 2017 Consolidated Appropriations Acts (the RBA to prevent the federal government from using congressionally appropriated funds to enforce federal marijuana laws against regulated medical marijuana actors operating in compliance with state and local law. However, this measure does not protect adult-use marijuana businesses. As part of the 1.3 trillion federal spending bill enacted on March 23, 2018, Congress renewed the RBA through September 2018, and subsequently extended it further. The RBA is an appropriations rider that prohibits the DOJ from using federal funds to prevent states from implementing marijuana laws. The U.S. Ninth Circuit in United States v. McIntosh held that the prohibition under the RBA also prevents the DOJ from 
 16 

spending federal funds to prosecute individuals who are engaged in conduct that is permitted by, and in compliance with, state medical marijuana laws. 
 State-Level Overview 
 The following section presents an overview of market and regulatory conditions for the marijuana industry in U.S. states in which TerrAscend has or is intending to have an operating presence and is presented as of the date of filing, unless otherwise indicated. 
 California 
 In 1996, California voters passed Proposition 215, also known as the Compassionate Use Act, allowing physicians to recommend cannabis for an inclusive set of qualifying medical conditions including chronic pain. The law established a not-for-profit patient/caregiver system but there was no state licensing authority to oversee the businesses that emerged as a result of the system. In September of 2015, the California legislature passed three bills, collectively known as the Medical Marijuana Regulation and Safety Act. In 2016, California voters passed The Adult Use of Marijuana Act, which legalized recreational use cannabis for adults 21 years of age and older and created a licensing system for commercial cannabis businesses. Note, California defines cannabis to mean marijuana. On June 27, 2017, then-Governor Jerry Brown signed Senate Bill 94 into law, which combined California s medicinal and recreational use cannabis frameworks into one licensing structure under the Medicinal and Adult-Use of Cannabis Regulation and Safety Act MAUCRSA ). 
 Pursuant to MAUCRSA: (i) CalCannabis, a division of the California Department of Food and Agriculture, was designated to issue licenses to cannabis cultivators: (ii) the Manufactured Cannabis Safety Branch (the MCSB ), a division of the California Department of Public Health, was designated to issue licenses to cannabis manufacturers; and (iii) the California Department of Consumer Affairs, via its agency the Bureau of Cannabis Control (the BCC ), was designated to issue licenses to cannabis distributors, testing laboratories, retailers, and micro-businesses. These agencies were also charged with overseeing various aspects of implementing and maintaining California s cannabis landscape, including the statewide track and trace system. All three agencies released their initial emergency rulemakings at the end of 2017 and updated them with minor revisions in June 2018. The three agencies adopted their permanent rulemakings on January 16, 2019. All three agencies began issuing temporary licenses in January 2018 and stopped doing so on December 31, 2018, pursuant to MAUCRSA. 
 Local authorization is a prerequisite to obtaining a state license, and local governments are permitted to prohibit or otherwise regulate the types and number of cannabis businesses allowed in their locality. All three state regulatory agencies require confirmation from the applicable locality that the operator is operating in compliance with local requirements and was granted authorization to continue or commence commercial cannabis operations within the locality s jurisdiction. Applicants are required to comply with all local zoning and land use requirements and provide written authorization from the property owner where the commercial cannabis operations are proposed to take place, which must dictate that the applicant has the property owner s authorization to engage in the specific state-sanctioned commercial cannabis activities proposed to occur on the premises. The State has not set a limit on the number of state licenses an entity may hold, unlike other states that have restricted how many cannabis licenses an entity may hold in total or for various types of cannabis activity. Although vertical integration across multiple license types is allowed under MAUCRSA, testing laboratory licensees may not hold any other licenses aside from a laboratory license. There are also no residency requirements for ownership of a state license under MAUCRSA. 
 California state licenses, and some local licenses, are renewed annually. Each year, licensees are required to submit a state renewal application to the relevant regulatory authority, and all applicable local renewal applications to the applicable local regulatory body (for local licenses) such as the Department of Cannabis Regulation in the City of Los Angeles. 
 On July 12, 2021, Governor Gavin Newsom signed AB-141 into law, triggering the consolidation of CalCannabis, the MCSB, and the BCC into the newly created Department of Cannabis Control (the DCC ). The DCC was created in an effort to centralize regulatory authority and facilitate a more easily navigable regulatory regime. All licenses obtained under the previous regulatory authorities automatically transferred to the DCC, which will be responsible for issuing and renewing all cannabis licenses moving forward. In September 2021 the DCC issued emergency regulations, which were approved and went into effect the same month. The emergency regulations, among other things, include revised definitions clarifying who are considered to be owners or holders of a financial stake in cannabis businesses, and provisions allowing for the sale of branded products between businesses. 
 California s robust regulatory system is designed to ensure, monitor, and enforce compliance with all aspects of a cannabis operator s licensed operations. California s state license application process additionally requires comprehensive criminal, regulatory, financial and personal disclosures, coupled with stringent monitoring and continuous reporting requirements designed to ensure only good actors are granted licenses and that licensees continue to operate in compliance with the state 
 17 

regulatory program. Applicants must submit standard operating procedures describing how the operator will, among other requirements, secure the facility, manage inventory, comply with the state s seed-to-sale tracking requirements, dispense cannabis, and handle waste, as applicable to the license sought. Once licensed, an operator must continue to abide by the processes described in its application and seek regulatory approval before any changes to such procedures can be made. Licensees are additionally required to train their employees on compliant operations and are only permitted to transact with other legal and licensed businesses. 
 As a condition of state licensure, operators must consent to random and unannounced inspections of their commercial cannabis facility as well as all of the facility s books and records, so as to monitor and enforce compliance with state law. Many localities have also enacted similar standards for inspections, and the state has already commenced site-visits and compliance inspections for operators who have received state temporary or annual licensure. 
 New Jersey 
 On January 18, 2010, the Compassionate Use Medical Marijuana Act (the CUMMA came into force allowing patients with a limited number of qualifying medial conditions to access the state s medical marijuana program. The New Jersey Department of Health (the NJDOH issued regulations shortly thereafter authorizing the NJDOH to accept applications for a minimum of six alternative treatment centers (the ATCs ), with two each to operate in the north, central and south regions of New Jersey. 
 CUMMA permits each ATC to operate as both a cultivator and dispensary under one permit. These activities can take place at up to two locations, as long as both locations are within the same region. The application process involves two stages. Those seeking an ATC permit must first submit an application seeking authority to apply for a permit to operate. Upon the granting of the application, the prospective ATC must then complete the application for actual permitting. Applications for authority to apply for a permit may only be submitted following solicitation from NJDOH for such applications. The first six permits for ATCs were awarded to nonprofit entities, with subsequent permits to be available to both nonprofit and for-profit entities. In 2013, CUMMA was amended to allow ATCs to cultivate an unlimited number of strains of marijuana and sell additional marijuana-infused products, and to restrict the same of marijuana-infused edible products to qualifying patients under the age of 18. With additional authorizations, ATCs may also house manufacturing facilities for marijuana-infused products such as syrups and lozenges. All marijuana is subject to a tetrahydrocannabinol THC limit of 10 , though NJDOH is proposing to repeal the regulation that establishes this limit. 
 Upon taking office on January 16, 2018, Governor Murphy expanded the medical program by issuing Executive Order No. 6, which ordered a 60-day review of all aspects of New Jersey s current program, with a focus on ways to expand access to marijuana for medical purposes. In response to Executive Order No. 6, NJDOH released its EO 6 Report on March 23, 2018, which proposed significant changes to the existing medicinal program. In an effort to create greater patient access, the state immediately put into effect some of the recommended changes, including cutting registration and renewal fees, and expanding qualifying conditions. 
 On July 16, 2018, the Murphy Administration announced that the licensing application process would be opened for up to six additional vertically integrated medicinal marijuana ATCs. The NJDOH released a Notice of Request for Applications outlining the reason for issuing the licenses, eligibility rules and information required for the applications. The application period opened on August 1, 2018 and closed on August 31, 2018. Winning applicants were supposed to be selected on or before November 1, 2018 but this deadline was subsequently pushed to December due to administrative constraints. On December 17, 2018, NJDOH revealed the additional six medical marijuana ATCs it picked to add to the program. New Jersey will now have 12 vertically-integrated ATCs across the state, if these additional six applicant ATCs become operational. These six applicant ATCs now must pass background checks, provide evidence of cultivation and dispensary locations with municipal approval for each location, and comply with all regulations promulgated by the NJDOH, including safety and security requirements. 
 On March 25, 2019, a planned vote on legislative package including medical expansion and adult-use legalization was pulled due to a lack of votes necessary to pass the legislation through the state Senate. This setback came after significant momentum had helped to pass the bill through the appropriations and judiciary committees earlier in the month. After the package of cannabis reforms stalled, Governor Murphy announced he would be expanding the medical program through administrative action. This announcement has proved contentious as the Senate President claims any regulatory changes for medical cannabis would make securing the votes necessary to pass adult-use legalization more difficult. On May 14, 2019, the Senate President announced he would no longer work to advance adult-use legalization through the legislature and instead would pivot to put the issue before voters for the 2020 general election. While legalization stalled, bills to expand the state s medical program and reform criminal penalties continued to move forward. On December 18, 2020, Governor Murphy signed A. 5981/S. 4154 into law, which facilitates the expungement of low-level marijuana crimes and other offenses. And, on November 3, 2020, New Jersey voters passed a ballot measure amending the New Jersey Constitution to permit the use of marijuana for adults over 21 years of age. The ballot measure will also allow New Jersey to regulate the growth, distribution, and sale of adult-use marijuana. 
 18 

On November 4, 2020, New Jersey Attorney General Gurbir S. Grewal issued a statement reminding New Jersey residents that the state s criminal laws related to marijuana still apply until the state legislature enacts a framework for adult-use cannabis. 
 On February 22, 2021, Governor Murphy signed the New Jersey Cannabis Regulatory, Enforcement Assistance, and Marketplace Modernization Act CREAMMA into law, legalizing the use of marijuana by adults 21 years of age and older in New Jersey. On August 19, 2021, New Jersey s Cannabis Regulatory Commission CRC published its first set of rules associated with adult-use cannabis in the state. These rules outline the details of licensing, the authority of municipalities, the operations of cannabis businesses, and the CRC s authority over adult-use cannabis. Adult-use sales in New Jersey commenced on April 21, 2022. 
 Pennsylvania 
 The Pennsylvania medical marijuana program was signed into law on April 17, 2016 under Act 16 and provided access to state residents with one or more of 17 qualifying conditions, including: epilepsy, chronic pain and PTSD. The state originally awarded only 12 licenses to cultivate/process and 27 licenses to operate retail dispensaries (which entitled holders to up to three medical dispensary locations per retail license). 
 On March 22, 2018, it was announced that the final phase of the Pennsylvania medical marijuana program would initiate its rollout, which included 13 additional cultivation/processing licenses and 23 additional dispensary licenses. Additionally, the list of qualifying conditions was expanded from 17 to 21. On July 20, 2019, two more qualifying medical conditions were added, bringing the total to 23. 
 There are two principal license categories in Pennsylvania: (1) cultivation/processing and (2) dispensary. All cultivation/processing establishments and dispensaries must register with Pennsylvania Department of Health. Registration certificates are valid for a period of one year and are subject to annual renewals after required fees are paid and the business remains in good standing. The Pennsylvania Department of Health must renew a permit unless it determines the applicant is unlikely to maintain effective control against diversion of medical cannabis and the applicant is unlikely to comply with all laws as prescribed under the Pennsylvania medical marijuana program. 
 Under applicable laws, the licenses permit the license holder to cultivate, manufacture, process, package, sell and purchase medical marijuana pursuant to the terms of the licenses, which are issued by the Pennsylvania Department of Health under the provisions of Medical Marijuana Act and Pennsylvania regulations. The medical cultivation/processing licenses permit the licensee to acquire, possess, cultivate, manufacture/process into medical marijuana products and/or medical marijuana-infused products, deliver, transfer, have tested, transport, supply or sell marijuana and related supplies to medical marijuana dispensaries. 
 The retail dispensary licenses permit TerrAscend to purchase marijuana and marijuana products from cultivation/processing facilities, as well as allow the sale of marijuana and marijuana products. 
 Maryland 
 The Maryland medical cannabis program was signed into law on May 2, 2013. In 2016, the Maryland Medical Cannabis Commission issued preliminary licenses to 102 dispensaries, 15 cultivators, and 15 processors; the first dispensaries opened to patients in December 2017. 
 Maryland has three classes of cannabis licenses: dispensaries, cultivators, and processors. Wholesaling occurs between cultivators and processors, cultivators and dispensaries, and processors and dispensaries. Originally, no one Company could directly control multiple licenses of the same class, but this restriction was changed in May 2019 when Governor Hogan signed a bill that permitted a single company to own or control, including the power to manage or operate, up to four dispensaries. Dispensary locations are tied to the Senate District in which they were awarded, with the exception of dispensary licenses that were awarded to applicants who also were awarded a cultivation license. These dispensaries can be located at the discretion of the license holder. Permitted products include oil-based formulations, flower, and edibles. 
 In April 2018, the Maryland House and Senate approved a bill, which was later signed by Governor Hogan, that expanded the license pool, allowing for a maximum of seven additional cultivation licenses, for a total of 22, and 13 additional processing licenses, for a total of 28. As of March 1, 2022, there were approximately 95 licensed dispensaries, 18 licensed cultivators, and 19 licensed processors. In November 2022, the voters in Maryland approved adult-use cannabis as a ballot question. Beginning on July 1, 2023, adults 21 or older may possess and consume up to 1.5 ounces of cannabis flower, 12 grams of concentrated cannabis, or a total amount of cannabis products that does not exceed 750 mg THC. This amount is known as the personal use amount. Adult-use sales are expected to begin around the same time. 
 19 

Michigan 
 In November 2008, Michigan residents approved the Michigan Compassionate Care Initiative to provide a legal framework for individuals with certain debilitating medical conditions to lawfully use marijuana for medicinal purposes. In September 2016, the Michigan Legislature passed, and Governor Snyder signed into law, the Medical Marihuana Facilities Licensing Act (the MMFLA and the Marihuana Tracking Act (the MTA to provide a comprehensive licensing and tracking scheme, respectively, for state s medical marijuana program. 
 In 2018, Michigan voters approved Proposal 1, to make marijuana legal under state and local law for adults 21 years of age or older and to control the commercial production and distribution of marijuana under a system that licenses, regulates, and taxes the businesses involved. The proposal is known as the Michigan Regulation and Taxation of Marihuana Act (the MRTMA and together with the Michigan Medical Marihuana Act (the MMMA ), the MMFLA, and the MTA, the Michigan Cannabis Laws ). 
 Additionally, the Michigan Department of Licensing and Regulatory Affairs LARA and the MRA have supplemented the Michigan Cannabis Laws with administrative rules and bulletins to further clarify the regulatory landscape surrounding the state s medical and adult use marijuana programs. The MRA is the main regulatory authority for the licensing and regulation of medical and adult use marijuana businesses, and is an agency within LARA. 
 Under the MMFLA, the MRA administrates five types of state operating licenses for medical marijuana businesses: (a) a grower license, including three different classes of licenses: (i) a Class A license that allows the licensee to cultivate up to 500 plants; (ii) a Class B license that allows the licensee to cultivate up to 1,000 plants; and (iii) a Class C license that allows the licensee to cultivate up to 1,500 plants, (b) a processor license, (c) a secure transporter license, (d) a provisioning center license and (e) a safety compliance facility license. Likewise, under the MRTMA, the MRA administers six types of state licenses for adult use marijuana business: (a) a marihuana grower license, including three different classes of licenses: (i) a Class A license that allows the licensee to cultivate up to 100 plants; (ii) a Class B license that allows the licensee to cultivate up to 500 plants; and (iii) a Class C license that allows the licensee to cultivate up to 2,000 plants, (b) a marihuana processor license, (c) a secure transporter license, (d) a marihuana retailer license, (e) a marihuana safety compliance facility license, and (f) a marihuana microbusiness license. However, MRTMA also allows the MRA to create additional license types through the administrative rulemaking process. To date, the MRA has created four additional license types: (a) a designated consumption establishment license, (b) an excess marihuana grower license, (c) a marihuana event organizer license, and (d) a temporary marihuana event license. Importantly, each excess marihuana grower license allows an entity that holds five adult use Class C grower licenses issued under MRTMA and at least two medical Class C grower licenses issued under the MMFLA to grow an additional 2,000 plants. 
 Under both MRTMA and the MMFLA, there are no stated limits on the number of licenses that can be made available on a state level; however, the MRA has discretion over the approval of applications and municipalities can pass additional restrictions, including limiting the number and type of licenses that can be issued within their jurisdiction. Additionally, a person or entity cannot possess or own both a grower/process/provisioning center and a secure transporter license or a safety compliance lab. 
 On February 11, 2022, Governor Whitmer signed an Executive Reorganization Order (ERO) 2022-1 which modified the Marijuana Regulatory Agency (MRA) to be called the Cannabis Regulatory Agency (CRA). This allowed for the CRA to have authority over Michigan's hemp processors and handlers under the Industrial Hemp Research and Development Act also shifting to the new CRA. 
 U.S. Hemp Regime 
 The Agriculture Improvement Act of 2018 (commonly known as the 2018 Farm Bill was signed into law on December 20, 2018. The 2018 Farm Bill, among other things, removed hemp (including any part of the cannabis plant containing 0.3 THC or less), its extracts, derivatives, and cannabinoids from the CSA definition of marihuana , and allows for federally-sanctioned hemp production under the purview of the U.S. Department of Agriculture (the USDA ), in coordination with state departments of agriculture that elect to have primary regulatory authority. States and Tribal governments can adopt their own regulatory plans, even if more restrictive than federal regulations, so long as the plans meet minimum federal standards and are approved by the USDA. Hemp production in jurisdictions that do not choose to submit their own plans (and that do not otherwise prohibit hemp production) will be governed by USDA regulation. Hemp as defined in the 2018 Farm Bill, means the plant Cannabis sativa L., and any part of that plant, including the seeds thereof and all derivatives, extracts, cannabinoids, isomers, acids, salts, and salts of isomers, whether growing or not with a THC concentration of not more than 0.3 on a dry weight basis. 
 20 

While the 2018 Farm Bill removes hemp and hemp-derived products from the controlled substances list under the CSA, it does not legalize cannabidiol CBD in every circumstance. While not independently scheduled under the CSA, CBD, depending on the source from which it was derived and its THC concentration, can still be classified as a Schedule I substance under the CSA s definition of marihuana. Further, although the 2018 Farm Bill creates a limited exception to this prohibition, this exception only applies if the CBD is derived from hemp as defined in federal law. Federal law also requires that: (i) the hemp is produced by a Licensed Producer; and (ii) in a manner consistent with the applicable federal and state regulations. CBD and other cannabinoids produced from marihuana as defined by the CSA remain an illegal Schedule I substance under federal law. In addition, many state laws include all CBD within definitions of marijuana and some states have policies or laws that otherwise prohibit or restrict CBD sales. 
 Notwithstanding the foregoing, the 2018 Farm Bill expressly preserves the U.S. Food and Drug Administration s authority to regulate certain products under the FDCA and Section 351 of the Public Health Service Act. The FDA takes the position that because CBD was the subject of substantial clinical investigations that have been made public and is the active ingredient in an FDA-approved drug (Epidiolex), it is therefore illegal to add to food and CBD products are excluded from the dietary supplement definition. While there is an exception for articles that were marketed as a conventional food or dietary supplement before the new drug investigations were authorized (or the new drug was approved), the FDA has asserted that, based on available evidence, the exception does not apply to CBD. As previously mentioned, the FDA takes the position that it is unlawful under the FDCA to introduce food containing added CBD into interstate commerce, or to market CBD products as, or in, dietary supplements, regardless of whether the substances are hemp-derived. Despite FDA s stated position, the agency has not, to date, been active in its CBD-related enforcement absent CBD products bearing aggressive therapeutic claims (e.g., claims of treatment of COVID-19, neuropathy, AIDS, diabetes, cancer, etc.). FDA could change its enforcement priorities at any time. The FDA has indicated that it will work towards providing ways for companies to seek approval from the FDA to market CBD products. In addition, options remain available for the FDA to consider whether there are circumstances in which certain cannabis-derived compounds might be permitted in a food or dietary supplement. Importantly, notwithstanding the FDA s stated position prohibiting sales of CBD containing-foods and dietary supplements, the FDA has authority to issue a regulation allowing the use of a pharmaceutical ingredient, such as CBD, in a food or dietary supplement, even if such pharmaceutical ingredient was not previously marketed as a food or dietary ingredient prior to the initiation of clinical drug trials. Timing regarding if or when FDA might issue such a regulation is unclear. 
 States have also taken various approaches to the production and sale of hemp-derived food products. Many states have adopted the Uniform State Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, which was created in 1984 by the Association of Food and Drug Officials (the AFDO ), the primary organization for state food and drug officials. The AFDO s model Uniform Act includes a provision to automatically incorporate changes to the FDCA into state law. However, there is some variation between state Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Acts both because not all states have adopted this provision, and because not all states have adopted the Uniform Act. States that have adopted the Uniform Act generally prohibit the use of CBD in food and dietary supplements due to the FDA s lack of approval for such uses of the substance, discussed above. For example, Michigan (among other states) prohibits the use of CBD in retail food and beverage products because of the FDA s stated position. Like FDA, some states, despite having stated positions of the impermissibility of CBD foods and supplements, or any CBD products at all, enforcement is inconsistent, with some state regulators more active than others. Again, these enforcement priorities could change at any time. 
 Although hemp-derived CBD cannot be added or marketed in foods or dietary supplements, certain hemp derived substances, such as hemp seed oil, may be permissible in food, dietary supplements, cosmetics, and other products depending on whether the ingredients and finished products comply with the other requirements of the FDCA. For example, a substance that will be added to food is subject to premarket approval by the FDA unless it is generally recognized, among qualified experts, to be safe under the conditions of its intended use GRAS ). Pursuant to the FDCA, a food ingredient may be marketed in the United States under any of the following three alternative criteria: (i) if it was approved by the FDA or USDA between 1938 and 1958 for the intended use (commonly referred to as a prior sanction ); (ii) if it is GRAS for its intended use; or (iii) pursuant to a food additive regulation promulgated by the FDA. On December 20, 2018, the FDA issued GRAS approvals for three ingredients that are derived from parts of the cannabis plant that do not contain THC or CBD hulled hemp seeds, hemp seed protein, and hemp seed oil. These three types of products can be legally marketed in human foods without food additive approval, provided they comply with all other requirements and do not make unlawful drug claims. It is worth noting that none of these GRAS products contain CBD. 
 The 2018 Farm Bill also contemplates a significant state presence in the regulation of hemp production, as the 2018 Farm Bill empowers states, U.S. territories and Native American tribes to regulate the production and sale of hemp within their respective borders. To regulate commercial hemp production, states, U.S. territories and Native American tribes must submit plans to the USDA setting out the processes associated with how the state, territory or tribe will regulate hemp production, including how it will gather information, test, inspect and dispose of hemp and its related byproducts. The Secretary of the USDA must approve or reject these plans within sixty days of receipt. If a state, territory or tribe chooses not to submit a plan to the USDA, potential producers will be able to apply directly to the USDA for licensing approval. States, territories and tribes may also 
 21 

enact stricter laws than those enacted at the federal level and may ban hemp production and sale within their respective jurisdiction. 
 Once implemented, in jurisdictions with USDA-approved state programs, it will be a violation of state law to cultivate hemp without a registration in compliance with state law, or in the case of a state or territory without a USDA-approved program, it will be a violation of federal law to cultivate hemp without a federally issued license. 
 The 2018 Farm Bill was signed into law on December 20, 2018. Importantly, however, the Industrial Hemp cultivation and research provisions contained in the Section 7606 of the Agricultural Act of 2014 (the 2014 Farm Bill will remain in effect pending the USDA s rulemaking process and certain provisions of the law may not yet be effective. The federal rulemaking process may take more than one year to finalize, and the 2014 Farm Bill will be repealed one year after the USDA establishes regulations governing hemp production in states lacking their own USDA-approved plans. The scope of the 2014 Farm Bill is limited to cultivation that is: (i) for research purposes (inclusive of market research, which multiple federal agencies have confirmed includes commercial sales with a research purpose); (ii) part of an agricultural pilot program or other agricultural or academic research; and (iii) permitted by state law. Further, the 2014 Farm Bill defines Industrial Hemp as the plant Cannabis sativa L., and any part of such plant, whether growing or not, with a delta-9 THC concentration of not more than 0.3 on a dry weight basis. The USDA published its final rule on January 19, 2021. The USDA s final rule establishes a federal licensing plan for regulating U.S. hemp producers in states that do not have their own USDA-approved plans. In the absence of a state plan, U.S. hemp producers will be subject to regulation directly by the USDA unless the state prohibits U.S. hemp production. Additionally, the final rule includes requirements for maintaining information on the land where US hemp is produced, testing U.S. hemp for THC levels, disposing of plants with more than 0.3 percent THC on a dry-weight basis and licensing for U.S. hemp producers. The USDA s final rule requires hemp producers to use a laboratory that is registered with the DEA, although the USDA is delaying enforcement of this requirement until December 31, 2022. The final rule also includes provisions for producers to dispose or remediate violative hemp plants without the use of a DEA-registered reverse distributor or law enforcement. 
 State-Level Overview 
 The following section presents an overview of market and regulatory conditions for the hemp industry in Florida, where the Company has an operating presence as of the date of this filing. 
 Florida 
 Florida continues to classify all cannabis as a Schedule I controlled substance, except medical marijuana grown and sold under the state s medical marijuana program and, as of July 1, 2019, both hemp and industrial hemp. Florida defines cannabis in its criminal code to include, all parts of any plant of the genus cannabis, whether growing or not; the seeds thereof; the resin extracted from any part of the plant; and every compound, manufacture, salt derivative, mixture, or preparation of the plant or its seeds or resin. The term does not include marijuana, if manufactured, possessed, sold, purchased, delivered, distributed, or dispensed, in conformance with 381.986 Florida s Medical Marijuana Program statutes. This term also does not include hemp defined in 581.217 or industrial hemp as defined in 1004.4473. 
 On May 3, 2019, the Florida legislature passed SB1020, creating Florida s hemp farming program governed by the Florida Department of Agriculture, legalizing cannabidiol and the sale and distribution of hemp extracts, and removing hemp and industrial hemp from the definition of cannabis under state law so that hemp is no longer a controlled substance in the state of Florida. On June 25, 2019, the bill was signed by the governor and went into on effect July 1, 2019. On April 16, 2020, Florida s Hemp Plan was approved by USDA. Hemp cultivators may now apply for licensure online with the Florida Department of Agriculture. As part of the application, hemp cultivators must undergo a background check and must submit a Hemp Containment and Transportation Plan, among other requirements. 
 Regulatory Framework in Canada 
 Licenses and Regulatory Framework in Canada 
 The TerrAscend Canada Licensed Producer License 
 TerrAscend Canada held a standard cultivation license, standard processing license and license for sale for medical purposes under the Cannabis Act until February 9, 2023 when it opted to return its license. Under the Licensed Producer License, and subject to further requirements set out in the Cannabis Act, TerrAscend Canada was able to possess, obtain produce and sell cannabis, including sales of cannabis extracts, topicals and edibles, and oils, in accordance with the applicable Cannabis Regulations, subject to certain terms and conditions. 
 22 

The Cookies Canada License 
 TerrAscend's minority-owned business, Cookies Canada, has an interest in a retail operator's license under the Cannabis License Act (Ontario). The retail operator's license permits, subject to further requirements set out in the legislation, to possess and sell cannabis, including sales of cannabis extracts, topicals and edibles, and oils, in accordance with the applicable legislation and regulation, subject to certain terms and conditions, subject to certain restrictions on age and time of sale. 
 Summary of Canadian Regulatory Framework 
 On October 17, 2018, the Cannabis Act and Cannabis Regulations came into force as law with the effect of legalizing the recreational adult-use of cannabis and regulating the production, distribution and sale of cannabis and cannabis derived products (both medical and adult-use) within Canada. The Cannabis Act replaced the Access to Cannabis for Medical Purposes Regulations ACMPR and the Old International Health Regulations IHR ), both of which came into force under the CDSA, which previously permitted access to cannabis for medical purposes for only those Canadians who had been authorized to use cannabis by their health care practitioner. 
 The Cannabis Act provides a licensing and permitting scheme for activities related to cannabis, implemented by regulations made under the Cannabis Act. The Cannabis Act maintains separate medical access to cannabis, including providing that import and export licenses and permits will only be issued in respect of cannabis for medical or scientific purposes or in respect of industrial hemp. Transitional provisions of the Cannabis Act provide that licenses and permits issued under the former ACMPR and the Narcotics Control Regulations NCR that were in force immediately before the day on which the Cannabis Act came into force are deemed to continue under the Cannabis Act. 
 The Cannabis Regulations (the Regulations ), among other things, outline the rules for the legal cultivation, processing, research, testing, distribution, sale, importation and exportation of cannabis and hemp in Canada, including the various classes of licenses that can be granted, and set standards for cannabis and hemp products. The Regulations include strict specifications for the plain packaging and labelling and analytical testing of all cannabis products as well as stringent physical and personnel security requirements for all federally licensed production and processing sites. 
 The Cannabis Act and Regulations were amended on October 17, 2019 to provide for new classes of cannabis, namely edible cannabis, cannabis extracts and cannabis topicals, that are permitted to be sold in the medical and adult-use markets as well as to establish new regulatory controls to address the public health and safety risks associated with these new classes of cannabis. These controls include restrictions on product composition and ingredients, THC limits, and new requirements pertaining to promotion, packaging and labelling, good production practices and record keeping. 
 Pursuant to the Cannabis Act, subject to provincial regulations, individuals over the age of 18 are able to purchase fresh cannabis, dried cannabis, cannabis oil, cannabis extracts, cannabis topicals, edible cannabis and cannabis plants or seeds and are able to legally possess up to 30 grams of dried cannabis or equivalent. In addition, the Cannabis Act provides provincial, territorial and municipal governments the authority to prescribe regulations regarding retailing and distribution, as well as the ability to alter some of the existing baseline requirements of the Cannabis Act such as increasing the minimum age for purchase and consumption, and limiting the ability of households to grow cannabis plants. 
 The Cannabis Regulations establish requirements relating to licenses; security, including clearances; cannabis products; packaging, labelling and promotion, health products and cosmetics containing cannabis and cannabis for medical purposes. 
 Cannabis Products 
 Initially, the Cannabis Act and the Cannabis Regulations set out certain requirements for the sale of cannabis products at the retail level and initially permitted the sale of dried cannabis, cannabis oil, fresh cannabis, cannabis plants, and cannabis seeds, including in pre-rolled and capsule form, by authorized license holders. 
 On October 17, 2019, the Federal Government legalized new classes of products; specifically, edible cannabis, cannabis extracts, and cannabis topical products pursuant to certain amendments to the Cannabis Act and Cannabis Regulations. The previous class, cannabis oil, was subject to a one year transition period to allow for existing cannabis license holders to transition their current products in order to comply with the amended Cannabis Regulations. Consequently, the Cannabis Act was amended with effect on October 17, 2020 to remove cannabis oil as a separate cannabis category from Schedule 4 of the Cannabis Act. Edible cannabis, cannabis extracts, and cannabis topical products, which are now available for sale, are subject to additional regulatory requirements that include supplemental marketing and advertising rules, further restrictions on labelling and packaging, rules relating to ingredients of edible cannabis and cannabis extracts, limits on THC content, and additional 
 23 

manufacturing and good production practice requirements. In addition, the Cannabis Regulations require processing license holders to notify Health Canada at least sixty days prior to the intended release of a new product to the market. 
 Advertising and Promotions 
 The Cannabis Act, and the accompanying Cannabis Regulations, the Cannabis Licence Act (Ontario) and its accompanying regulations, contain strict restrictions on the promotion of cannabis products and generally prohibit the promotion of cannabis, cannabis accessories and services related to cannabis, unless the promotional activity is specifically authorized under the legislation and regulations. These prohibitions are intended to protect public health and safety, including protecting the health of young persons by restricting their access to cannabis and preventing the inducement of the use of cannabis, while allowing consumers to have access to information with which they can make informed decisions about the consumption of cannabis. Thus, the promotion, packaging and labelling, display and sale and distribution of cannabis and cannabis accessories takes place in a highly regulated environment which restricts the ability of operators to brand and market their store or products in a manner consistent with other industries which are not subject to such controls. 
 Provincial and Territorial Developments 
 While the Cannabis Act provides for the regulation by the Federal Government of, among other things, the commercial cultivation and processing of cannabis and the sale of medical cannabis, it also provides that the provinces and territories of Canada have authority to regulate certain aspects of adult-use cannabis, such as distribution and sale, minimum age requirements, places where cannabis can be consumed, and a range of other matters. 
 The governments of every Canadian province and territory have implemented their regulatory regimes for the distribution and sale of cannabis for adult-use purposes. Most provinces and territories have announced a minimum age of 19 years old, except for Alberta, where the minimum age is 18, and Qu bec, where the minimum age is 21. A summary of the legislative framework in each province and territory is set out below. 
 Ontario 
 The distribution and sale of recreational cannabis in Ontario is primarily governed by the Cannabis Control Act, 2017, the Cannabis Licence Act, 2018 and the related regulations. The Ontario Cannabis Retail Corporation is the wholesale distributor of cannabis and conducts all online sales in the province. 
 Compliance 
 In the United States, TerrAscend is in compliance with all state laws and the related cannabis licensing framework of Maryland, Pennsylvania, New Jersey, California, and Michigan. In Canada, at the time of license return at the request of TerrAscend, TerrAscend was in compliance with all applicable federal, provincial and territorial laws and regulations, including the Cannabis Act and the Cannabis Regulations. There are no current incidences of noncompliance, citations or notices of violations outstanding which may have an impact on TerrAscend s licenses, business activities or operations in these states. Notwithstanding the foregoing, like all businesses, TerrAscend may from time-to-time experience incidences of noncompliance with applicable rules and regulations in the states in which TerrAscend operates, and such non-compliance may have an impact on TerrAscend s licenses, business activities or operations in the applicable states. However, TerrAscend takes steps to minimize, disclose and remedy all incidences of non-compliance which may have an impact on TerrAscend s licenses, business activities or operations in all states in which TerrAscend operates.

ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS 
 The following risks should be carefully considered when deciding whether to make an investment in TerrAscend. Some of the following factors are interrelated and, consequently, investors and readers should treat such risk factors as a whole. These risks and uncertainties are not the only ones that could affect TerrAscend, and additional risks and uncertainties not currently known to TerrAscend, or that it currently considers not to be material, may also impair the business, financial condition and results of operations of TerrAscend and/or the value of its securities. If any of the following risks or other risks occur, they could have a material adverse effect on TerrAscend business, financial condition and results of operations and/or the value of TerrAscend s securities. There is no assurance that any risk management steps taken by TerrAscend will avoid future loss due to the occurrence of the risks described below, or other unforeseen risks. 
 Regulatory and Legal Risks to TerrAscend s Business and the Cannabis Industry 
 There is a substantial risk of regulatory or political change with respect to cannabis, which could have a material adverse effect on TerrAscend s business. 
 In the United States, the operations of TerrAscend and its subsidiaries are subject to a variety of laws, including, among other things, state and local regulations and guidelines relating to the cultivation, manufacture, management, transportation, distribution, sale, storage and disposal of cannabis. Changes to such laws, regulations and guidelines due to matters beyond the control of TerrAscend may cause adverse effects to TerrAscend s business, financial condition and result of operations. Local, state and federal laws and regulations governing cannabis for medicinal and recreational purposes are broad in control and are subject to evolving interpretations, which could require TerrAscend to incur substantial costs associated with bringing TerrAscend s operations into compliance. In addition, violations of these laws, or allegations of such violations, could disrupt TerrAscend s operations and result in a material adverse effect on its financial performance. It is beyond TerrAscend s scope to predict the nature of any future change to the existing laws, regulations, policies, interpretations or applications, nor can TerrAscend determine what effect such changes, when and if promulgated, could have on TerrAscend s business. 
 The Cannabis Act came into force in Canada on October 17, 2018 along with various related regulations. The cultivation, processing, distribution and sale of cannabis, among other things, remains subject to extensive regulatory oversight under the Cannabis Act. It is possible that these statutory requirements, including any new regulations that are subsequently issued, could significantly and adversely affect the business, financial condition and results of operations of TerrAscend. 
 While the foregoing activities in respect of cannabis are under the regulatory oversight of the Government of Canada, the distribution of recreational use cannabis is the responsibility of the respective provincial and territorial governments. These jurisdictions have chosen varying retail frameworks with private, public and hybrid models being implemented. There is no guarantee that provincial and territorial legislation regulating the distribution and sale of cannabis for recreational purposes will be continued according to their current terms, that they will not be materially amended or that such regimes will create the growth opportunities that TerrAscend currently anticipates. 
 In addition, government policy changes or public opinion may also result in a significant influence over the regulation of the cannabis industry in Canada, the United States or elsewhere. A negative shift in the public s perception of medical or recreational cannabis in Canada, the United States or any other applicable jurisdiction could affect future legislation or regulation. Among other things, a shift could cause state and local jurisdictions to abandon initiatives or proposals to legalize medical or recreational cannabis, thereby limiting the number of new state jurisdictions into which TerrAscend could expand. Any inability to fully implement TerrAscend s expansion strategy may have a material adverse effect on TerrAscend s business, financial condition and results of operations. 
 Compliance with regulations regarding cannabis is difficult, because the regulation of cannabis is uncertain and frequently changes. TerrAscend's failure to comply with applicable laws regarding cannabis may adversely affect TerrAscend's business. 
 Achievement of TerrAscend s business objectives is contingent, in part, upon compliance with regulatory requirements enacted by governmental authorities and obtaining all regulatory approvals, where necessary, for the sale of its products. TerrAscend cannot predict the impact of the compliance regime that the applicable regulatory bodies in the United States and Canada are implementing that effect the business of TerrAscend. Similarly, TerrAscend cannot predict the time required to secure all appropriate regulatory approvals for its products, or the extent of testing and documentation that may be required by governmental authorities. The impact of governmental compliance regimes, any delays in obtaining, or failure to obtain regulatory approvals may significantly delay or impact the development of markets, products and sales initiatives and could have a material adverse effect on the business, results of operations and financial condition of TerrAscend. 
 25 

TerrAscend will incur ongoing costs and obligations related to regulatory compliance. Failure to comply with regulations may result in additional costs for corrective measures, penalties or restrictions on TerrAscend s operations. In addition, changes in regulations, more vigorous enforcement thereof or other unanticipated events could require extensive changes to TerrAscend s operations, result in increased compliance costs or give rise to material liabilities, which could have a material adverse effect on the business, results of operations and financial condition of TerrAscend. 
 The cannabis industry is subject to extensive controls and regulations, which may significantly affect the financial condition of market participants. The marketability of any product may be affected by numerous factors that are beyond the control of TerrAscend and which cannot be predicted, such as changes to government regulations, including those relating to taxes and other government levies which may be imposed. Changes in government levies, including taxes, could reduce TerrAscend s earnings and could make future capital investments or TerrAscend s operations uneconomic. The industry is also subject to numerous legal challenges, which may significantly affect the financial condition of market participants and which cannot be reliably predicted. 
 TerrAscend s business relies heavily on its ability to obtain and maintain required licenses, and failure to do so may adversely affect TerrAscend s business. 
 TerrAscend s ability to grow, store and sell medical and adult-use cannabis in certain U.S. states and Canada is dependent on TerrAscend maintaining licenses with applicable regulators for the production and sale of cannabis. Failure to comply with the requirements of its licenses or any failure to maintain its licenses would have a material adverse impact on the business, financial condition and operating results of TerrAscend. 
 TerrAscend and its subsidiaries, as applicable, will apply for, as the need arises, all necessary licenses and permits to carry on the activities it expects to conduct in the future. However, the ability of TerrAscend or its subsidiaries to obtain, maintain or renew any such licenses and permits on acceptable terms is subject to changes in regulations and policies and to the discretion of the applicable authorities or other governmental agencies in each respective jurisdictions. 
 In certain states, the cannabis laws and regulations limit, not only the number of cannabis licenses issued, but also the number of cannabis licenses that one person may own. TerrAscend believes that, where such restrictions apply, it may still capture significant share of revenue in the market through wholesale sales, exclusive marketing relations, provision of management or support services, franchising and similar arrangement with other operators. Nevertheless, such limitations on the acquisition of ownership of additional licenses within certain states or enforcement by regulators in certain states against such services arrangements may limit TerrAscend s ability to grow organically or to increase its market share in such states. 
 As a cannabis business, TerrAscend is subject to unfavorable tax treatment under the U.S. federal income tax law. 
 Tax risk is the risk of changes in the tax environment that would have a material adverse effect on TerrAscend s business, results of operations, and financial condition. Currently, U.S. state licensed marijuana businesses are assessed a comparatively high effective U.S. federal income tax rate due to Section 280E of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the Code ), which prohibits businesses from deducting certain expenses associated with trafficking in controlled substances (within the meaning of Schedule I and II of the CSA). The Internal Revenue Service IRS has invoked Section 280E of the Code in tax audits against various cannabis businesses in the United States that are permitted under applicable U.S. state laws. Although the IRS issued a clarification allowing the deduction of certain expenses, the scope of such items is interpreted very narrowly, and the bulk of operating costs and general administrative costs are not permitted to be deducted. While there are currently several pending cases before various U.S. administrative and federal courts challenging these restrictions, there is no guarantee that these courts will issue an interpretation of Section 280E of the Code favorable to cannabis businesses. Given these facts, the impact of any such challenges cannot be reliably estimated; however, it may be significant to the financial condition and/or the overall operations of TerrAscend. 
 If TerrAscend s tax positions were to be challenged by U.S. federal, state, or local or non-U.S. tax jurisdictions, TerrAscend' may not be wholly successful in defending its tax filing positions. TerrAscend records reserves for unrecognized tax benefits based on its assessment of the probability of successfully sustaining tax filing positions. Management exercises significant judgment when assessing the probability of successfully sustaining TerrAscend s tax filing positions, and in determining whether a contingent tax liability should be recorded and, if so, estimating the amount. If TerrAscend s tax filing positions are successfully challenged, payments could be required that are in excess of reserved amounts, or TerrAscend may be required to reduce the carrying amount of its net deferred tax asset, either of which could be significant to TerrAscend s financial condition or results of operations. 
 If TerrAscend is or becomes a passive foreign investment company, its U.S. investors may suffer adverse tax consequences. 
 26 

Generally, for any taxable year, if at least 75 of TerrAscend s gross income is passive income, or at least 50 of the value of TerrAscend s assets (generally determined based on a weighted quarterly average) is attributable to assets that produce, or are held for the production of, passive income, TerrAscend will be a passive foreign investment company PFIC for U.S. federal income tax purposes. For purposes of these tests, passive income generally includes dividends, interest, certain gains from the sale of investment property, and certain rents and royalties, and passive assets generally include cash. Additionally, TerrAscend generally will be treated as directly holding and receiving its proportionate share of the assets and income, respectively, of any corporation in which it owns, directly or indirectly, 25 of its stock by value. If TerrAscend is a PFIC for any taxable year, certain U.S. investors may suffer adverse tax consequences, including ineligibility for preferential tax rates on capital gains or dividends, interest charges on certain taxes treated as deferred, and additional tax reporting requirements. 
 TerrAscend s PFIC status generally will depend on the nature and composition of TerrAscend s income and assets and the value of TerrAscend s assets (which generally will be determined based on the fair market value of each asset, with the value of goodwill determined in large part by reference to the market value of TerrAscend s stock from time to time, which may be volatile). If TerrAscend s market capitalization declines while it holds a substantial amount of cash for any taxable year, TerrAscend may be a PFIC for such taxable year. The manner and timeframe in which TerrAscend spends the cash it raises in any offering, the transactions it enters into, and how TerrAscend s corporate structure may change in the future will affect the nature and composition of TerrAscend s income and assets. Based on the nature and composition of TerrAscend s income and assets and the value of TerrAscend s assets, including goodwill, TerrAscend believes that it was not a PFIC for its taxable year ended December 31, 2022. Because PFIC determination is a factual determination made annually after the end of each taxable year by applying principles and methodologies that in some circumstances are unclear and subject to varying interpretation, there can be no assurance that TerrAscend will not be a PFIC for any taxable year, and TerrAscend s U.S. counsel expresses no opinion with respect to TerrAscend s PFIC status for any taxable year. U.S. investors should consult their own tax advisors regarding the PFIC rules impact in their particular circumstances. 
 If TerrAscend is a PFIC for any taxable year, the tax consequences that would apply if U.S. investors were able to make a valid qualified electing fund QEF election. At this time, TerrAscend does not expect to provide U.S. investors with the information necessary for them to make a QEF election if TerrAscend is a PFIC for any taxable year. U.S. investors should assume that a QEF election will not be available with respect to TerrAscend s stock. 
 If TerrAscend (or any of its non-U.S. subsidiaries) is a controlled foreign corporation, certain of its U.S. investors may suffer adverse tax consequences. 
 If a United States person for U.S. federal income tax purposes is treated as owning (directly, indirectly, or constructively) at least 10 of the total value or total combined voting power of TerrAscend s stock, such person may be treated as a United States shareholder with respect to each controlled foreign corporation CFC in TerrAscend s group (if any). A non-U.S. corporation will be a CFC if United States shareholders own (directly, indirectly, or constructively) more than 50 of the total value or total combined voting power of the stock of the non-U.S. corporation. Because TerrAscend s group includes one or more U.S. corporate subsidiaries, certain of its current or future non-U.S. corporate subsidiaries may be treated as CFCs (regardless of whether TerrAscend is treated as a CFC). A United States shareholder of a CFC may be required to annually report and include in its U.S. taxable income its pro rata share of the CFC s Subpart F income, global intangible low-taxed income, and investments of earnings in U.S. property (regardless of whether the CFC makes any distributions to its shareholders). Additionally, an individual United States shareholder with respect to a CFC generally will not be allowed certain tax deductions or foreign tax credits that would be allowed to a corporate United States shareholder. A failure to comply with CFC reporting obligations may subject a United States shareholder to significant monetary penalties and prevent the statute of limitations from running with respect to the United States shareholder s U.S. federal income tax return for the taxable year in which reporting was due. There can be no assurance that TerrAscend will assist its U.S. investors in determining whether it (or any of its current or future non-U.S. subsidiaries) is treated as a CFC or whether such U.S. investors are treated as United States shareholders with respect to any such CFC, or that TerrAscend will furnish to any such United States shareholders information that may be necessary to comply with their CFC reporting and tax paying obligations. U.S. investors should consult their own tax advisors regarding the CFC rules impact in their particular circumstances. 
 TerrAscend s ability to use its U.S. net operating loss carryforwards to offset its future U.S. taxable income may be subject to limitations. 
 TerrAscend s U.S. federal net operating loss carryforwards NOLs generated in taxable years beginning before January 1, 2018 may be carried forward for 20 years. TerrAscend s U.S. federal NOLs generated in taxable years beginning after December 31, 2017 may be carried forward indefinitely, but the utilization of such NOLs is limited. In addition, under Section 382 of the Code, a corporation that undergoes an ownership change (generally defined as a greater than 50 change (by value) in its stock ownership over a three-year period) is subject to limitations on its ability to utilize its pre-change U.S. federal NOLs to offset its future U.S. taxable income. If TerrAscend has undergone an ownership change in the past, or if future 
 27 

changes in its stock ownership, some of which are outside its control, results in an ownership change, its ability to utilize its U.S. federal NOLs may be limited by Section 382 of the Code. It is uncertain if and to what extent U.S. states will conform to U.S. federal income tax law with respect to the treatment of NOLs. As a result, TerrAscend s ability to use its U.S. NOLs to offset its future U.S. taxable income may be subject to limitations, which could increase its tax liability and decrease its cash flow. 
 Tax and accounting requirements may change or be interpreted in ways that are unforeseen to TerrAscend, and TerrAscend may face difficulty or be unable to implement and/or comply with any such changes or interpretations. 
 TerrAscend is subject to numerous tax and accounting requirements, and changes in existing rules or practices, varying interpretations of current rules or practices, or enactments of new rules or practices could have a significant adverse effect on TerrAscend s financial results, the manner in which TerrAscend conducts its business, or the marketability of any of TerrAscend s products. For instance, the recently enacted Inflation Reduction Act imposes, among other rules, a 15 minimum tax on the book income of certain large corporations and a 1 excise tax on certain corporate stock repurchases. In many countries, including the U.S., TerrAscend is subject to transfer pricing and other tax regulations designed to ensure that appropriate levels of income are reported as earned and are taxed accordingly. Although TerrAscend believes that it is in substantial compliance with all applicable regulations and restrictions, it is subject to the risk that governmental authorities could audit its transfer pricing and related practices and assert that additional taxes are owed or that various jurisdictions could assert that TerrAscend should file tax returns in jurisdictions where it does not file and subject it to additional tax. In the future, the geographic scope of TerrAscend s business may expand, and such expansion will require TerrAscend to comply with the tax laws and regulations of additional jurisdictions. Requirements as to taxation vary substantially among jurisdictions. Complying with the tax laws and regulations of these jurisdictions can be time-consuming and expensive and could potentially subject TerrAscend to penalties and fees in the future if it failed to comply. In the event that TerrAscend failed to comply with applicable tax laws and regulations, this could have a material adverse effect on its business, financial condition, and results of operations. 
 Cannabis remains illegal under U.S. federal law, and enforcement of cannabis laws could change. TerrAscend may be subject to action by the U.S. federal government due to its involvement with cannabis, and such action could materially adversely affect TerrAscend s business. 
 While some states in the United States have authorized the use and sale of cannabis in some form, it remains illegal under US federal law. On January 4, 2018, then-U.S. Attorney General Jeff Sessions issued a memorandum to U.S. Attorneys which rescinded previous guidance from the U.S. Department of Justice specific to cannabis enforcement in the United States, including the Cole Memorandum, which stated that the U.S. Department of Justice would not prioritize the prosecution of cannabis-related violations of U.S. federal law in jurisdictions that had enacted laws legalizing medical cannabis in some form and had implemented strong and effective regulatory and enforcement systems. With the Cole Memorandum rescinded, U.S. federal prosecutors have greater discretion in determining whether to prosecute medical cannabis-related violations of U.S. federal law; there was never such a policy statement in relation to U.S. state and territories with adult use cannabis programs. Because TerrAscend engages in cannabis-related activities in the United States, an increase in federal enforcement efforts with respect to current U.S. federal laws applicable to cannabis could cause financial damage to TerrAscend. In addition, TerrAscend is at risk of being prosecuted under U.S. federal law and having its assets seized.

Violations of any U.S. federal laws and regulations could result in significant fines, penalties, administrative sanctions, convictions or settlements arising from civil proceedings conducted by either the U.S. federal government or private citizens, or criminal charges, including, but not limited to, disgorgement of profits, cessation of business activities, civil forfeiture or 
 28 

divestiture. This could have a material adverse effect on TerrAscend, including its reputation and ability to conduct business, the listing of its securities on various stock exchanges, its financial position, operating results, profitability or liquidity or the market price of its publicly traded shares. In addition, it is difficult for TerrAscend to estimate the time or resources that would be needed for the investigation of any such matters or its final resolution because, in part, the time and resources that may be needed are dependent on the nature and extent of any information requested by the applicable authorities involved, and such time or resources could be substantial. 
 Unlike in Canada which has federal legislation uniformly governing the cultivation, distribution, sale and possession of cannabis under the Cannabis Act, investors are cautioned that in the United States, cannabis is largely regulated at the state level. Notwithstanding the permissive regulatory environment of cannabis at the state level, cannabis continues to be categorized as a controlled substance under the CSA in the United States and as such, is in violation of federal law in the United States. Further, there can be no assurance that state laws legalizing and regulating the sale and use of cannabis will not be repealed or overturned, or that local governmental authorities will not limit the applicability of state laws within their respective jurisdictions. It is also important to note that local and city ordinances may strictly limit and/or restrict the distribution of cannabis in a manner that will make it extremely difficult or impossible to transact business in the cannabis industry. 
 As stated above, Congress has passed appropriations bills each of the last several years, since 2014, to prevent the federal government from using congressionally appropriated funds to enforce federal marijuana laws against regulated medical marijuana actors operating in compliance with state and local law. Most recently, on September 30, 2021 and December 3, 2021, President Biden signed short-term continuing resolutions to extend current appropriations, most recently through February 18, 2022. The continuing resolution contains, among other things, the RBA, which prevents the federal government from using congressionally appropriated funds to enforce federal marijuana laws against regulated medical marijuana actors operating in compliance with state medical cannabis laws. 
 The U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit has construed these appropriations bills to prevent the federal government from prosecuting individuals when those individuals comply with state medical cannabis laws, and has vacated numerous convictions and sent the cases back to the trial courts for further determination. However, because this conduct continues to violate federal law, American courts have observed that should Congress at any time choose to appropriate funds to fully prosecute the CSA, any individual or business even those that have fully complied with state law could be prosecuted for violations of federal law. If Congress restores funding, for example by declining to include the RBA in a budget resolution, or by failing to pass necessary budget legislation and causing another government shutdown, the government will have the authority to prosecute individuals for violations of the law before it lacked funding under the five-year statute of limitations applicable to non-capital CSA violations. Additionally, it is important to note that the appropriations protections only apply to medical cannabis operations and provide no protection against businesses operating in compliance with a state s recreational cannabis laws. 
 The Department of Justice or a federal prosecutor could allege that TerrAscend and TerrAscend s Board of Directors (the Board of Directors or the Board and, potentially its shareholders, aided and abetted violations of federal law by providing finances and services to its operating subsidiaries. Under these circumstances, it is possible that a federal prosecutor would seek to seize the assets of TerrAscend and to recover the illicit profits previously distributed to shareholders resulting from any of the foregoing financing or services. In these circumstances, TerrAscend s operations could cease, TerrAscend securityholders may lose their entire investment and directors, officers and/or TerrAscend shareholders may be left to defend any criminal charges against them at their own expense and, if convicted, be sent to federal prison. Violations of any federal laws could result in significant fines, penalties, administrative sanctions, convictions or settlements arising from civil proceedings conducted by either the federal government or private citizens, or criminal charges, including, but not limited to, disgorgement of profits, cessation of business activities or divestiture. This could have a material adverse effect on TerrAscend, including its reputation and ability to conduct business, its holding (directly or indirectly) of cannabis licenses in the United States, the listing of its securities on any securities exchanges, its financial position, operating results, profitability or liquidity or the market price of its listed securities. An investor s contribution to and involvement in TerrAscend s activities may result in federal civil and/or criminal prosecution, including forfeiture of his, her or its entire investment. 
 Although the 2018 Farm Bill, among other things, generally removes hemp from the controlled substances list under the CSA, it does not legalize CBD generally. In particular, the 2018 Farm Bill preserves the FDA s authority to regulate products containing cannabis or cannabis-derived compounds. Pursuant to a statement released December 20, 2018, Frequently Asked Questions on the FDA s website, and numerous public statements, the FDA has taken the position that all CBD is a drug ingredient and therefore illegal to add to food or health products without its approval or further action by the FDA. The FDA considers products containing CBD or other cannabis-derived compounds the same as any other FDA-regulated products and takes the position that they are subject to the same authorities and requirements as similarly regulated products, including but not limited to required approvals for food ingredients and dietary supplements based on safety standards. Importantly, the FDA has taken the position that it is unlawful under the FDCA to introduce food containing added CBD into interstate commerce, 
 29 

or to market CBD products as, or in, food or dietary supplements, regardless of whether the substances are hemp derived. The FDA has however indicated that it will work towards providing ways for companies to seek approval from the FDA to market CBD products. Further, many state criminal laws and food and drug laws prohibit or restrict the production and/or sale of hemp-derived CBD products. TerrAscend s U.S. hemp operations will be subject to FDA oversight. There is no guarantee that TerrAscend will be able to obtain necessary approval from regulatory authorities for its products in the United States. 
 TerrAscend s activities and operations in the United States are, and will continue to be, subject to evolving regulation by governmental authorities. The approach to the enforcement of cannabis laws may be subject to change or may not proceed as previously outlined. The USDA will promulgate additional rules governing the production of hemp in the United States, with many states in the process of amending state laws to regulate hemp production and the sale of hemp-derived products within their borders. In addition, the FDA is expected to make determinations as to how CBD products will be regulated and is expected to issue a substantial change in its regulation of dietary supplements generally. Accordingly, there are significant changes in both federal and state law that may materially impact TerrAscend s operations. 
 TerrAscend s business is subject to applicable anti-money laundering laws and regulations and have restricted access to capital markets, banking and other financial services, which may adversely affect TerrAscend s business. 
 Since the use of cannabis is currently illegal under U.S. federal law, and in light of considerations related to money laundering and other cannabis related criminality in the U.S. banking industry, U.S. banks have been reluctant to accept or deposit funds from businesses involved with the cannabis industry. Consequently, businesses involved in the cannabis industry often have difficulty finding banks willing to accept its business. Likewise, cannabis businesses have limited access, if any, to credit card processing services. As a result, cannabis businesses in the United States are largely cash-based. This complicates the implementation of financial controls and increases security issues. 
 While TerrAscend is not able to obtain financing in the United States from traditional banks or other U.S. federally regulated entities, TerrAscend has been able to access equity financing through private markets in both the United States and Canada. Commercial banks, private equity firms, and venture capital firms have approached the cannabis industry cautiously to date. However, there are increasing numbers of high-net-worth individuals and family offices that have made meaningful investments in companies and businesses similar to TerrAscend. There is neither a broad nor deep pool of institutional capital that is available to cannabis license holders and license applicants. There can be no assurance that additional financing, if raised privately, will be available to TerrAscend when needed or on terms which are acceptable to TerrAscend. TerrAscend s inability to raise financing to fund its operations, capital expenditures or acquisitions could limit its growth and may have a material adverse effect upon future profitability. 
 Under the federal money laundering statutes, unlicensed money transmitter statute and the Bank Secrecy Act, financial transactions in the United States involving proceeds generated by cannabis-related conduct can form the basis for prosecution. The FinCEN division of the U.S. Department of Treasury has provided guidance for how financial institutions can provide services to the cannabis-related businesses consistent with the obligations under the Bank Secrecy Act. 
 Previously, DOJ directed its federal prosecutors to consider the federal enforcement priorities enumerated in the Cole Memorandum when determining whether to charge institutions or individuals with any of the financial crimes described above based upon cannabis-related activity. In January 2018, the DOJ revoked the Cole Memorandum and related memorandum. While the impact remains unclear, the revocation has created uncertainty. For instance, federal prosecutors may increase enforcement activities against institutions or individuals who are engaged in financial transactions related to cannabis activities, or there may be a negative impact to the continuation of financial services in the United States with regard to cannabis-related activities. Consequently, businesses involved in the regulated cannabis industry may experience difficulties establishing banking relationships, and such difficulties may increase over time. If TerrAscend were to experience any inability to access financial services in the United States, including its current bank accounts, this would have a direct impact on the ability for TerrAscend to operate its businesses. This impact would increase TerrAscend s operating costs, and pose additional operational, logistical, and security challenges that could impede its inability to implement its business plans. 
 The U.S. federal prohibitions on the sale of cannabis may result in TerrAscend and its partners being restricted from accessing the U.S. banking system and they may be unable to deposit funds in federally insured and licensed banking institutions. Banking restrictions could be imposed due to TerrAscend s banking institutions not accepting payments and deposits. TerrAscend is at risk that any bank accounts it has could be closed at any time. Such risks increase costs to TerrAscend. TerrAscend s activities in the United States, and any proceeds thereof, may be considered proceeds of crime due to the fact that cannabis remains federally illegal in the United States. This may restrict the ability of TerrAscend to declare or pay dividends, effect other distributions or subsequently repatriate such funds back to Canada. Furthermore, while TerrAscend has no current intention to declare or pay dividends on its Common Shares in the foreseeable future, TerrAscend may decide or be required to suspend declaring or paying dividends without advance notice and for an indefinite period of time. The guidance provided in the FinCEN 
 30 

Memorandum as described above may change depended on the position of the U.S. government administration at any given time and is subject to revision or retraction in the future, which may restrict TerrAscend s access to banking services. 
 TerrAscend operates in a highly regulated sector and may not always succeed in complying fully with applicable regulatory requirements in all jurisdictions where TerrAscend carries on business, which could negatively affect TerrAscend s business. 
 Given the complexity of the U.S. regulation of the cannabis industry, certain requirements may prove to be excessively onerous or otherwise impractical for TerrAscend to comply with. This may result in the exclusion of certain business opportunities from the list of possible transactions that TerrAscend would otherwise consider. Further, U.S. laws and regulations at the local, state, and federal levels which apply to the cannabis industry are continually changing, and it is difficult to determine if future changes could detrimentally affect the operations of TerrAscend. Given the broad scope of cannabis laws and regulations, these are subject to evolving interpretations. This continued evolution could require TerrAscend to incur substantial costs associated with compliance or alter its business plan. In addition, violations of these laws, or allegations of such violations, could disrupt TerrAscend s businesses and result in a material adverse effect on its operations. 
 TerrAscend s continued compliance with regulatory requirements enacted by government authorities and obtaining all regulatory approvals, where necessary, for the sale of its products, including maintain and renewing all applicable licenses, is crucial to the successful execution of TerrAscend s strategies. The commercial cannabis industry is an emerging industry in the United States, and TerrAscend cannot forecast the impact of the compliance regime to which they will be subject. Similarly, TerrAscend cannot predict its ability to secure all appropriate regulatory approvals for any of its products, or the extent of testing or related documentation that may be required by governmental authorities. Delays in obtaining, or failure to obtain, regulatory approvals may significantly delay or impact the development of markets, products and sales initiatives and could have adverse effect on the business, financial condition, and operating results of TerrAscend. Without limiting the foregoing, TerrAscend s failure to comply with the requirements of any underlying licenses or any failure to maintain any underlying licenses would have a material adverse impact on its business, financial condition, and operating results. It is uncertain whether any required licenses for the operation of TerrAscend s business will be extended or renewed in a timely manner, if at all, or that if they are extended or renewed, that the licenses will be extended or renewed on the same or similar terms. 
 Furthermore, Internet websites are visible by people everywhere, not just in jurisdiction where the activities described therein are considered legal. As a result, to the extent that TerrAscend sells services or products via web-based links targeting only jurisdictions in which such sales or services are compliant with state law, TerrAscend may face legal action in other jurisdictions which are not the intended object of any of TerrAscend's marketing efforts for engaging in any web-based activity that results in sales into such jurisdictions deemed illegal under applicable laws. 
 Regulatory restrictions on ownership outside of the control of TerrAscend may have a material adverse impact on TerrAscend's operations in certain markets 
 TerrAscend's business is subject to oversight by regulators in each market that TerrAscend operates in. Regulators may limit the type or number of licenses that a single company may own. As a result, TerrAscend may be restricted from participating in certain cannabis businesses in specific markets as a result of ownership or control of other cannabis licenses. As an example, certain markets may limit the size of a company's cultivation space, limit the number of dispensaries a single-company may own, or may obligate a company to offer certain products, like medical cannabis, to consumers. 
 TerrAscend faces further risk associated with restrictions on licenses as a result of TerrAscend's inability to control public company shareholder ownership, and therefore TerrAscend may inadvertently have certain restrictions placed on its ability to operate as a result of third-party ownership. Restrictions placed on TerrAscend's ability to own specific licenses or assets in specific markets, or complexities arising from third-party ownership thresholds may materially adversely impact TerrAscend's ability to compete in a specific market or may cause other regulatory delays in receiving regulatory approval for certain activities. 
 Failure to comply with privacy or medical practice laws and regulations may result in impacts to operations, monetary fines or litigation 
 TerrAscend maintains an array of sensitive information, including confidential business and personal information in connection with our operations, and are subject to laws and regulations governing the privacy and security of such information. The global data protection landscape is rapidly evolving, and we may be affected by or subject to new, amended or existing laws and regulations in the future, including as our operations continue to expand and we operate in additional markets. Each market 
 31 

may be subject to differing laws or legal interpretations, which adds to the complexity of collecting, using, disclosing and processing personal data, and emerging cannabis markets may make changes to their legal frameworks. 
 In the United States, there are numerous federal and state privacy and data security laws and regulations governing the collection, use, disclosure and protection of personal information, including federal and state health information privacy laws, federal and state security breach notification laws and federal and state consumer protection laws. Each of these laws is subject to varying interpretations and constantly evolving. While the United States lacks a nationwide privacy law of general applicability, certain state laws govern the privacy and security of personal information, many of which differ from each other in significant ways and may not have the same effect, thus complicating compliance efforts. 
 Additionally, in the United States, the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act HIPAA imposes privacy and security requirements and breach reporting obligations with respect to individually identifiable health information upon covered entities (health plans, health care clearinghouses and certain health care providers), and their respective business associates, individuals or entities that create, received, maintain or transmit protected health information in connection with providing a service for or on behalf of a covered entity. HIPAA mandates the reporting of certain breaches of health information to the US Department of Health and Human Services HHS ), affected individuals and if the breach is large enough, the media. Entities that are found to be in violation of HIPAA as the result of a breach of unsecured protected health information, a complaint about privacy practices or an audit by HHS, may be subject to significant civil, criminal and administrative fines and penalties and/or additional reporting and oversight obligations if required to enter into a resolution agreement and corrective action plan with HHS to settle allegations of HIPAA non-compliance. In addition, provisions of the Americans with Disabilities Act require confidential treatment of employee medical records. 
 In Canada, the Personal Information Protection and Electronics Documents Act (Canada) PIPEDA and comparable legislation at the provincial level, governs the treatment of private information held by a corporation. Office of the Privacy Commissioner of Canada has stated that it considers the personal information of cannabis users is to be considered sensitive. Canadian privacy jurisprudence regarding the obligations that private sector organizations have to individual data subjects is constantly evolving. Privacy laws in Canada are also changing at the legislative level. On November 17, 2020, the Canadian Federal Government introduced Bill C-11, An Act to enact the Consumer Privacy Protection Act and the Personal Information and Data Protection Tribunal and to make consequential amendments to other Acts, for consideration in the House of Commons. Should Bill C-11 come into force, all private organizations that collect, use, and disclose personal information will become subject to new obligations and restrictions, including, without limitation, in connection with obtaining consent, access and control over personal information, deletion of personal information, data portability, de-identification of personal information, and transparency requirements. The penalties and enforcement measures available to Canadian regulators for non-compliance that are contemplated under Bill C-11 and Bill-64 are more significant than those that are available under current privacy and data protection legislation in Canada. 
 In addition, with respect to consumer health information, there are a number of federal, state and provincial laws protecting the confidentiality of certain patient health information, including patient records, and restricting the use and disclosure of that protected information. For example, the privacy rules under PIPEDA and other applicable privacy laws protect medical records and other personal health information by limiting their use and disclosure of health information to the minimum level reasonably necessary to accomplish the intended purpose and may apply to our operations globally. In Canada, we may also be required to retain certain customer personal information for prescribed periods of time pursuant to the Cannabis Act. 
 Overall, failure to maintain adequate compliance or safeguards regarding stakeholder privacy could materially adversely impact TerrAscend s business and result in fines, litigation or certain government mandated actions, and could be detrimental to TerrAscend s ability to operate its business. 
 TerrAscend s products may be subject to product recalls or returns, which may result in expense, legal proceedings, regulatory action, loss of sales and reputation, and management attention. 
 TerrAscend s products may be subject to recall or return for a variety of reasons, including product defects such as contamination, unintended harmful side effects or interactions with other substances, packaging safety and inadequate or inaccurate labeling disclosure. If any of TerrAscend s products are recalled due to an alleged product defect or for any other reason, TerrAscend could be required to incur the unexpected expense of the recall and any legal proceedings that might arise in connection therewith. TerrAscend may lose a significant amount of sales and may not be able to replace those sales at an acceptable margin or at all. In addition, a product recall may require significant management attention. Although TerrAscend has detailed procedures in place for testing its products, there can be no assurance that any quality, potency or contamination problems will be detected in time to avoid unforeseen product recalls, regulatory action or lawsuits. Additionally, if one of the products produced by TerrAscend were subject to recall, the image of that product and TerrAscend could be harmed. A recall for any of the foregoing reasons could lead to decreased demand for TerrAscend s products and could have a material adverse 
 32 

effect on the results of operations and financial condition of TerrAscend. Additionally, product recalls may lead to increased scrutiny of TerrAscend s operations by regulatory agencies, requiring further management attention and potential legal fees and other expenses. 
 TerrAscend faces an inherent risk of product liability claims and other consumer protection claims as a manufacturer, processor and producer of products that are meant to be ingested by people, and dealing with such claims could cause TerrAscend to incur substantial expenses and have a material adverse effect on TerrAscend s business. 
 As a manufacturer of products designed to be ingested by humans, TerrAscend faces an inherent risk of exposure to product liability claims, regulatory action and litigation if its products are alleged to have caused loss or injury. In addition, the manufacturing and sale of cannabis and other products involve the risk of injury to consumers due to tampering by unauthorized third parties, product contamination, or unauthorized sale of counterfeit products. Previously unknown adverse reactions resulting from human consumption of cannabis products alone or in combination with other medications or substances could occur. TerrAscend may be subject to various product liability claims, including, among others, that the products produced by TerrAscend caused injury or illness, include inadequate instructions for use or include inadequate warnings concerning possible side effects or interactions with other substances. A product liability claim or regulatory action against TerrAscend could result in increased costs, could adversely affect TerrAscend s reputation with its clients and consumers generally, and could have a material adverse effect on the results of operations and financial condition of TerrAscend. 
 TerrAscend s products may be considered misbranded or adulterated, or otherwise unlawful under federal and state food and drug laws and could subject TerrAscend to local, federal, or state enforcement or private litigation. Some states permit advertising, labeling laws, false and deceptive trade practices, and other consumer-protection laws to be enforced by state attorney generals, who may seek relief for consumers, class action certifications, class wide damages and product recalls of products sold by TerrAscend. Private litigation may also seek relief for consumers, class action certifications, class wide damages and product recalls of products sold by TerrAscend in any of the markets in which it operates. Any actions against TerrAscend by governmental authorities or private litigants could have a material adverse effect on TerrAscend s business, financial condition and results of operations. 
 TerrAscend may be subject to constraints on and differences in marketing its products under varying regulatory restrictions. 
 The development of TerrAscend s business and results of operations may be hindered by applicable regulatory restrictions on sales and marketing activities. For example, the regulatory environment in Canada limits TerrAscend s ability to compete for market share in a manner similar to other industries. If TerrAscend is unable to effectively market its products and compete for market share, or if the costs of compliance with government legislation and regulation cannot be absorbed through increased selling prices for TerrAscend s products, TerrAscend s sales and results of operations could be adversely affected. 
 TerrAscend may be subject to heightened scrutiny by Canadian regulatory authorities, which could negatively affect its business. 
 TerrAscend s future investments, joint ventures and operations in the United States may become the subject of heightened scrutiny by regulators, stock exchanges and other authorities in Canada. As a result, TerrAscend may be subject to significant direct and indirect interaction with public officials. There can be no assurance that this heightened scrutiny will not in turn lead to the imposition of certain restrictions on TerrAscend s ability to invest in the United States or any other jurisdiction, in addition to those described herein. 
 Although a memorandum of understanding signed by the Canadian Depository for Securities CDS and the Canadian recognized exchanges (Aequitas NEO Exchange Inc., the CSE, the Toronto Stock Exchange and the TSX Venture Exchange) dated February 8, 2018, confirms that CDS relies on the exchanges to review the conduct of listed issuers, and therefore there is currently no CDS ban on the clearing of securities of issuers with cannabis-related activities in the United States, there can be no guarantee that this approach to regulation will continue in the future. If such a ban were to be implemented, it would have a material adverse effect on the ability of holders of Common Shares to make and settle trades. In particular, Common Shares would become highly illiquid as and until an alternative was implemented, investors would have no ability to affect a trade of Common Shares through the facilities of a stock exchange. 
 TerrAscend s investors and directors, officers and employees who are not U.S. citizens may be denied entry into the United States, which may negatively affect TerrAscend s business. 
 Because cannabis remains illegal under U.S. federal law, those employed at or investing in legal and licensed Canadian cannabis companies could face detention, denial of entry or lifetime bans from the United States for their business associations with U.S. cannabis businesses. Entry happens at the sole discretion of the US Customs and Border Protection officers on duty, and these 
 33 

officers have wide latitude to ask questions to determine the admissibility of a foreign national. The Government of Canada has started warning travelers on its website that previous use of cannabis, or any substance prohibited by U.S. federal laws, could mean denial of entry to the United States. Business or financial involvement in the legal cannabis industry in Canada or in the United States could also be reason enough for U.S. border guards to deny entry . 
 Because TerrAscend s contracts involve cannabis and related activities, which are not legal under U.S. federal law, TerrAscend may face difficulties in enforcing its contracts. 
 It is a fundamental principle of law that a contract will not be enforced if it involves a violation of law or public policy. Because cannabis remains illegal at a federal level, judges may refuse to enforce contracts in connection with activities that violate U.S. federal law, even if there is no violation of state law. There remains doubt and uncertainty that TerrAscend will be able to legally enforce contracts it enters into if necessary. TerrAscend cannot be assured that it will have a remedy for breach of contract, the lack of which may have a material adverse effect on TerrAscend s business, revenues, operating results, financial condition or prospects. 
 TerrAscend may encounter increasingly strict environmental health and safety regulations in connection with its operations, which may harm TerrAscend s business. 
 TerrAscend s operations are subject to environmental and safety laws and regulations concerning, among other things, emissions and discharges to water, air and land, the handling and disposal of hazardous and non-hazardous materials and wastes, and employee health and safety. Changes in environmental, employee health and safety or other laws, more vigorous enforcement thereof or other unanticipated events could require extensive changes to TerrAscend s operations or give rise to material liabilities, which could have a material adverse effect on the business, results of operations and financial condition of TerrAscend. 
 Transition to becoming a U.S. reporting company poses added risks as a result of required compliance changes. 
 TerrAscend has determined that it no longer meets the definition of a foreign private issuer FPI as at the applicable reference date. As a public issuer, TerrAscend is currently subject to the reporting requirements and rules and regulations under the Exchange Act, and the regulations promulgated thereunder, in addition to Canadian securities laws, where applicable, and rules of any stock exchange on which TerrAscend s securities may be listed from time to time. Additional or new regulatory requirements may be adopted in the future. The loss of FPI status and subsequent transition to becoming a US filer may have adverse consequences on TerrAscend s ability to issue its securities to acquire companies and its ability to raise capital in private placements or prospectus offerings. In addition, the requirements of existing and potential future rules and regulations will increase TerrAscend s legal, audit, accounting and financial compliance costs, make some activities more difficult, time consuming or costly and may also place undue strain on the Company s personnel, systems and resources. TerrAscend's transition of financial reporting from IFRS to U.S. GAAP could adversely affect TerrAscend s business, financial condition, and results of operations. 
 Risks Related to TerrAscend s Business, Operations and Industry 
 TerrAscend s indebtedness may adversely affect TerrAscend s business, results of operations and financial condition. TerrAscend s failure to comply with applicable covenants could trigger events that may materially adversely affect TerrAscend s business, results of operations and financial condition. 
 TerrAscend s indebtedness may adversely affect TerrAscend s business, results of operations and financial condition. As of December 31, 2022, TerrAscend had approximately 205 million of total debt principal amounts outstanding. See the section titled Item 7, Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Liquidity and Capital Resources of this Annual Report for more information regarding TerrAscend's indebtedness. As a result of its indebtedness, a portion of TerrAscend's cash flow will be required to pay interest and principal on its outstanding loans. TerrAscend's indebtedness could have important consequences. For example, it could 
 make it more difficult for TerrAscend to satisfy its obligations with respect to any other debt it may incur in the future; 

increase TerrAscend's vulnerability to general adverse economic and industry conditions; 

require TerrAscend to dedicate a substantial portion of its cash flow from operations to payments on its indebtedness and related interest, thereby reducing the availability of its cash flow to fund working capital, capital expenditures and other general corporate purposes; 

34 

limit TerrAscend's flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in its business and the industry in which it operates; 

increase TerrAscend's cost of borrowing; 

place TerrAscend at a competitive disadvantage compared to its competitors that may have less debt; and 

limit TerrAscend's ability to obtain additional financing for working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions, debt service requirements or general corporate purposes. 

TerrAscend expects to use cash flow from operations and outside financings to meet its current and future financial obligations, including funding its operations, debt service and capital expenditures. TerrAscend s ability to make these payments depends on its future performance, which will be affected by financial, business, economic and other factors, many of which TerrAscend cannot control. TerrAscend s business may not generate sufficient cash flow from operations in the future, which could result in TerrAscend being unable to repay indebtedness, or to fund other liquidity needs. If TerrAscend does not generate sufficient cash from operations, it may be forced to reduce or delay its business activities and capital expenditures, sell assets, obtain additional debt or equity capital or restructure or refinance all or a portion of its debt on or before maturity. TerrAscend cannot make any assurances that it will be able to accomplish any of these alternatives on terms acceptable to it, or at all. In addition, the terms of existing or future indebtedness may limit TerrAscend s ability to pursue any of these alternatives. 
 Furthermore, the instruments governing TerrAscend s indebtedness include obligations and covenants that limit TerrAscend s discretion with respect to certain business matters and require TerrAscend to satisfy certain financial requirements. TerrAscend can make no assurances that it will be able to comply with such obligations and covenants and any failure to comply could result in a default, which, if not amended, cured or waived, could permit acceleration of the relevant indebtedness and the exercise of other remedies available to the lenders. In such event, there can be no assurance that TerrAscend would be able to obtain any amendment, cure, waiver or other relief on terms acceptable to TerrAscend. If TerrAscend is unable to obtain relief from an event of the relevant indebtedness may be accelerated and the related collateral may be foreclosed upon, in addition such circumstances may result in the cross-default or cross-acceleration of other debt, any of which would materially adversely affect TerrAscend's business, results of operations, and financial condition. 
 TerrAscend may require substantial additional financing to operate its business and it may face difficulties acquiring additional financing on terms acceptable to TerrAscend, or at all. 
 The building and operation of TerrAscend s business, including its facilities, are capital intensive. In order to execute the anticipated growth strategy, TerrAscend may require additional equity and/or debt financing to support on-going operations, to undertake capital expenditures or to undertake acquisitions or other business combination transactions. There can be no assurance that additional financing will be available to TerrAscend when needed or on terms which are acceptable. TerrAscend s inability to raise financing to support on-going operations or to fund capital expenditures or acquisitions could limit TerrAscend s growth and may have a material adverse effect upon future profitability. TerrAscend may require additional financing to fund its operations to the point where it is generating positive cash flows. Any debt financing secured in the future could involve restrictive covenants relating to capital raising activities and other financial and operational matters, which may make it more difficult for TerrAscend to obtain additional capital and to pursue business opportunities, including potential acquisitions. 
 Raising additional funds by issuing equity securities will cause dilution to existing stockholders. Raising additional funds through debt financings may involve restrictive covenants and raising funds through lending and licensing arrangements may restrict our operations or require us to relinquish proprietary rights. We may not be able to secure additional debt or equity financing on favorable terms or at all. 
 TerrAscend expects that significant additional capital will be needed in the future to continue its planned operations. TerrAscend expects to finance its cash needs through revenue from ongoing operations and a combination of equity offerings, debt financings and other strategies. TerrAscend cannot guarantee that future financing will be available in sufficient amounts or on terms acceptable to TerrAscend, if at all. If TerrAscend raises additional equity financing, its shareholders may experience significant dilution of their ownership interests, the terms of these securities may include liquidation or other preferences that could adversely affect the rights of a common shareholder, and the per-share value of TerrAscend s common shares could decline. If TerrAscend engages in debt financing, it may be required to accept terms that restrict or limit TerrAscend s ability to take specific actions, such as incurring additional indebtedness, making capital expenditures or declaring dividends, and other restrictive covenants that could adversely impact TerrAscend s ability to conduct its business. In addition, weakness and volatility in the capital markets and the economy in general could limit our access to the capital markets and increase our cost of borrowing. 
 35 

An adverse change in market conditions, including a sustained decline in TerrAscend s share price, negative changes to TerrAscend s position in the market, or lack of growth in demand for its products and services could be considered to be an impairment triggering event. Such changes could impact valuation assumptions relating to the recoverability of assets and have resulted in, and may in the future result in, impairment charges to TerrAscend s goodwill or long-lived asset balances, which would negatively impact TerrAscend s operating results and harm its business. 
 There are inherent uncertainties in management s estimates, judgments and assumptions used in assessing recoverability of goodwill, intangible, and other long-lived assets. Any material changes in key assumptions, including failure to meet business plans, a deterioration in the U.S., Canadian and global financial markets, an increase in interest rate or an increase in the cost of equity financing by market participants within the industry or other unanticipated events and circumstances, may decrease the projected cash flows and could potentially result in an impairment charge. From time to time, TerrAscend may be required to record a significant charge to earnings in its consolidated financial statements during the period in which any impairment of TerrAscend s goodwill or intangible and other long-lived assets is determined, which might have a materially adverse impact on TerrAscend s business operations and its financial position or results of operations. 
 For example, during the year ended December 31, 2022, it was determined that it was more likely than not that the Michigan reporting unit's fair value was less than its carrying value, and a one-step goodwill quantitative impairment test was performed. As a result of the quantitative test, TerrAscend recorded impairment of goodwill of 170,357 at its Michigan reporting unit. In addition, during the year ended December 31, 2022, TerrAscend performed an impairment analysis over its indefinite lived and definite lived intangible assets acquired through the Gage Acquisition as the changes in the market expectations of cash flows in Michigan, as well as increased competition and supply in the state, were determined to be indicators of impairment. TerrAscend determined that it was more likely than not that the carrying value of its definite lived retail and cultivation and processing licenses was greater than its fair value, and therefore, recorded impairment of 79,462 and 42,065 for the retail license and the cultivation and processing licenses, respectively. 
 TerrAscend faces intense competition as a relatively new entrant in the cannabis industry, and its business could be adversely affected by other businesses in a better competitive position. 
 The introduction of an adult-use model for cannabis production and distribution may impact the growth in the existing medical cannabis market. The impact of this potential development may be negative for TerrAscend and could result in increased levels of competition in its existing medical market and/or the entry of new competitors in the overall cannabis market in which TerrAscend operates. There is potential that TerrAscend will face intense competition from other companies, particularly larger multi-state operators, some of which can be expected to have longer operating histories and more financial resources and manufacturing and marketing experience than TerrAscend. Increased competition by larger and better financed competitors could materially and adversely affect the business, financial condition and results of operations of TerrAscend and result in lower than anticipated growth in both the existing medical cannabis market and the adult-use market. 
 If the number of users of medical cannabis in North America increases, the demand for products will increase and TerrAscend expects that competition will become more intense, as current and future competitors begin to offer an increasing number of diversified products. To remain competitive, TerrAscend will require a continued high level of investment in research and development, marketing, sales and client support. TerrAscend may not have sufficient resources to maintain research and development, marketing, sales and client support efforts on a competitive basis, which could materially and adversely affect the business, financial condition and results of operations of TerrAscend. 
 Consolidation in the cannabis industry and other changes to the competitive environment can impact TerrAscend's margins and profitability. 
 The markets for cannabis in the US and Canada are becoming increasingly competitive and are evolving rapidly. TerrAscend may face intense and increasing competition from existing operators and new entrants in each of the markets that TerrAscend operates in. Some of these competitors may have longer operating histories or offer competitive products. There is also the potential that the cannabis industry will undergo further consolidation that may pose a risk to TerrAscend s ability to compete. 
 As a result of this competition, we may be unable to maintain our operations or develop them as currently intended. Increased competition by larger, better-financed competitors with geographic advantages could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. If we are unable to achieve our business objectives, such failure could materially adversely affect our business. 
 As the emerging cannabis industry continues to rapidly evolve, we may not be able to create and maintain a competitive advantage in the marketplace. Our success will depend on our ability to respond to, among other things, changes in consumer preferences, regulatory conditions, and general competitive pressures. Should TerrAscend be unable to adequately respond to 
 36 

such changes, it could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, operating results, liquidity, cash flow and operational performance. 
 In each market we operate in, the number of licenses granted, and the number of license holders ultimately authorized by the regulator, or previously authorized licenses becoming more commercially active, could have an impact on our business. If the number of users of medical and/or recreational cannabis increases, the demand for products will increase and we expect that competition will become more intense, as current and future competitors begin to offer an increasing number of diversified products. To remain competitive, we will require a continued high level of investment in R D, sales and customer support. We may not have sufficient resources to maintain R D, sales and customer support efforts on a competitive basis which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. 
 
 TerrAscend may be required to write down intangible assets, including goodwill, due to impairment, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations or financial position. 
 TerrAscend may be required to write down intangible assets, including goodwill, due to impairment, which would reduce earnings. TerrAscend periodically calculates the fair value of our reporting units and intangible assets to test for impairment. This calculation may be affected by several factors, including general economic conditions, regulatory developments, market and economic conditions, impact on operations due to changing consumer preferences, successful execution of product launches and overall competitive activity within the market. Certain events can also trigger an immediate review of goodwill and intangible assets. If the carrying value of our reporting unit and other intangible assets exceed their fair value and the loss in value is other than temporary, the goodwill and other intangible assets are considered impaired, which would result in impairment losses and could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial position or results of operations. We may be required to perform a quantitative goodwill impairment assessment in future periods for TerrAscend, to the extent TerrAscend experiences declines in the price of its common shares. 
 The cannabis industry and market are relatively new, and this industry and market may not continue to exist or grow as expected. 
 TerrAscend is operating its business in a relatively new industry and market. Competitive conditions, consumer preferences, patient requirements and spending patterns in this new industry and market are relatively unknown and may have unique circumstances that differ from existing industries and markets. Accordingly, there are no assurances that this industry and market will continue to exist or grow as currently estimated or anticipated, or function and evolve in a manner consistent with management s expectations and assumptions. Any event or circumstance that affects the medical cannabis industry and market could have a material adverse effect on TerrAscend s business, financial condition and results of operations. 
 TerrAscend s success in North America is dependent on the market building out direct to consumer channels including but not limited to retail outlets. There are many factors which could impact TerrAscend s ability to gain market share and distribute its products, including but not limited to the continued growth and expansion of retail outlets in the North American market which may have a material adverse effect on TerrAscend s business, operating results and financial condition. TerrAscend s ability to continue to grow, process, store and sell medical cannabis and participate in the adult-use cannabis markets is dependent on the maintenance and validity of TerrAscend s licenses from regulatory authorities. 
 The cannabis industry and markets are relatively new in North America and in other jurisdictions, and this industry and market may not continue to exist or grow as anticipated or TerrAscend may ultimately be unable to succeed in this industry and market. 
 TerrAscend's profitability may be impacted by declining wholesale or retail cannabis prices in certain markets and shifting market conditions. 
 TerrAscend s gross profits may decline as a result of reduction in wholesale or retail cannabis prices. TerrAscend s profitability is sensitive to fluctuations in wholesale and retail prices caused by crop seasonality, disruptions to supply chains, increased competition, government taxes or levies, and other market conditions, all of which are factors beyond TerrAscend s control. There is currently not an established market price for cannabis and the price of may change rapidly. Any price decline may have a material adverse effect on TerrAscend. 
 If a significant number of new licenses are granted by a regulator in a market in which TerrAscend operates, TerrAscend may experience increased competition for market share and may experience downward price pressure on our products as new entrants increase production. We may also face competition from illegal cannabis dispensaries that are selling cannabis to individuals despite not having a valid license. The continued declining wholesale and retail price will impact the Company s overall business.

TerrAscend has historically had negative cash flow from operating activities, and continued losses could have a material negative effect on TerrAscend's business and prospects and impact TerrAscend's ability to continue as a going concern. 
 TerrAscend started sales in April 2018 and historically has had negative cash flow from operating activities. As of December 31, 2022, TerrAscend has an accumulated deficit of approximately 618 million. TerrAscend incurred losses in fiscal year 2020 and fiscal year 2022. TerrAscend may not be able to achieve or maintain profitability and may continue to incur significant losses in the future. TerrAscend's cash flow and net losses for the year ended December 31, 2022 are indicators that raise substantial doubt about TerrAscend's ability to continue as a going concern for at least one year from the issuance of these financial statements. In addition, debt service requirements will have an adverse impact on liquidity. Because the cannabis industry and market are relatively new and rapidly evolving, it is difficult for TerrAscend to predict its future operating results. As a result, it may incur future losses that may be larger than anticipated. In addition, TerrAscend expects to continue to increase operating expenses as it implements initiatives to continue to grow its business. TerrAscend's ability to execute on its growth strategy requires significant additional financing. TerrAscend will need to raise additional funds in order to operate its business and meet obligations as they become due. However, financing may not be available to TerrAscend in the necessary time frame, in amounts that TerrAscend requires, on terms that are acceptable to TerrAscend, or at all. If TerrAscend is unable to raise the necessary funds when needed, it may materially and adversely impact TerrAscend's ability to execute on its operating plans. If TerrAscend becomes unable to continue as a going concern, TerrAscend may have to dispose of assets and might realize significantly less than the values at which are carried on its consolidated financial statements. These actions may cause TerrAscend's stockholders to lose all or part of their investment in TerrAscend's common stock. If TerrAscend s sales do not increase to offset these expected increases in costs and operating expenses, TerrAscend will not be profitable. Furthermore, if TerrAscend's future growth and operating performance fail to meet investor or analyst expectations, or if it has future negative cash flow or losses resulting from its investment in product development or marketing, its financial condition and share price could be materially adversely affected. 
 TerrAscend may be affected by currency fluctuations. 
 TerrAscend may face exposure to currency fluctuations because of its present operations in the U.S. Recent events in the global financial markets have been coupled with increased volatility in the currency markets. All or substantially all of TerrAscend s revenue is earned in U.S. dollars, but its shares, employee options and some of its warrants issued to holders of TerrAscend s notes are denominated in Canadian dollars which can provide variability for results of operations. TerrAscend does not have currency hedging arrangements in place and there is no expectation that it will put any currency hedging arrangements in place in the future. Fluctuations in the exchange rate between the U.S. dollar and the Canadian dollar may have a material adverse effect on TerrAscend s business, financial position or results of operations. 
 Demand for TerrAscend s products is difficult to forecast due to limited and unreliable market data. 
 As a result of recent and ongoing regulatory and policy changes in the medical and adult-use cannabis industry, the market data available is limited and unreliable. Federal and state laws prevent widespread participation and hinder market research. Therefore, TerrAscend must rely largely on its own market research to forecast sales as detailed forecasts are not generally obtainable from other sources at this early stage of the industry. Market research and projections by TerrAscend of estimated total retail sales, demographics, demand, and similar consumer research are based on assumptions from limited and unreliable market data, and generally represent the personal opinions of TerrAscend s management team as of the date of this Form 10-K. A failure in the demand for its products to materialize as a result of competition, technological change or other factors could have a material adverse effect on the business, results of operations, financial condition or prospects of TerrAscend. 
 TerrAscend s inability to attract and retain key personnel could materially adversely affect its business. 
 The success of TerrAscend is dependent upon the ability, expertise, judgment, discretion and good faith of its senior management, which are key personnel. Moreover, TerrAscend s future success depends on its continuing ability to attract, develop, motivate and retain highly qualified and skilled employees. Qualified individuals are in high demand, and TerrAscend may incur significant costs to attract and retain them. TerrAscend does not maintain key man insurance policies on the lives of its key personnel, or the lives of any of its other employees. In order to induce valuable employees to continue their employment with the company, TerrAscend has provided stock options and restricted stock units that vest over time. The value to employees of such equity grants that vest over time is significantly affected by movements in TerrAscend's share price that are beyond TerrAscend's control, and may at any time be insufficient to counteract more lucrative offers from other companies. In addition, if TerrAscend's share-based compensation otherwise ceases to be viewed as a valuable benefit, TerrAscend's ability to attract, retain and motivate personnel could be weakened, which could harm its business. The loss of the services of key personnel, or an inability to attract other suitably qualified persons when needed, could have a material adverse effect on TerrAscend s ability to execute on its business plan and strategy, and TerrAscend may be unable to find adequate replacements 
 38 

on a timely basis, or at all. While employment agreements are customarily used as a primary method of retaining the services of such key personnel these agreements cannot assure the continued services of such employees. 
 There is no assurance that any of TerrAscend s existing personnel who presently or may in the future require a security clearance will be able to obtain or renew such clearances or that new personnel who require a security clearance will be able to obtain one. A failure by such key personnel to maintain or renew their security clearance would result in a material adverse effect on TerrAscend s business, financial condition and results of operations. In addition, if any key personnel leave TerrAscend, and TerrAscend is unable to find a suitable replacement that has a security clearance in a timely manner, or at all, it could have a material adverse effect on TerrAscend s business, financial condition and results of operations. 
 
 TerrAscend may not be able to attract or retain qualified management and other key employees in the future due to the intense competition for a limited number of qualified personnel in its industry. Many of the other cannabis companies that it competes against for qualified personnel have greater financial and other resources, different risk profiles and a longer history in the industry than TerrAscend does. They also may provide more diverse opportunities and better chances for career advancement. Some of these characteristics may be more appealing to high quality candidates than what TerrAscend has to offer. If TerrAscend is unable to continue to attract and retain high quality personnel, the rate and success at which it can develop and market its products will be limited. 
 TerrAscend may face unfavorable publicity or consumer perception of the safety, efficacy and quality of its cannabis products. 
 TerrAscend believes the cannabis industry is highly dependent upon consumer perception regarding the safety, efficacy and quality of the cannabis distributed to such consumers. Consumer perception of TerrAscend s products can be significantly influenced by scientific research or findings, regulatory investigations, litigation, media attention and other publicity regarding the consumption of medical cannabis products. There can be no assurance that future scientific research, findings, regulatory proceedings, litigation, media attention or other research findings or publicity will be favorable to the medical cannabis market or any particular product, or consistent with earlier publicity. 
 Future research reports, findings, regulatory proceedings, litigation, media attention or other publicity that are perceived as less favorable than, or that question, earlier research reports, findings or publicity could have a material adverse effect on the demand for TerrAscend s products and the business, results of operations, financial condition of TerrAscend. In particular, adverse publicity reports or other media attention regarding the safety, efficacy and quality of medical cannabis in general, or TerrAscend s products specifically, or associating the consumption of medical cannabis with illness or other negative effects or events, could have such a material adverse effect. Such adverse publicity reports or other media attention could arise even if the adverse effects associated with such products resulted from consumers failure to consume such products appropriately or as directed. For instance, the vape crisis that began in the summer of 2019 was ultimately linked to cutting agents almost exclusively found in the illicit market. Regardless, several states moved to ban the sale of vape products in legal markets, severely impacting entire revenue streams. 
 Although TerrAscend believes that it takes care in protecting its image and reputation, TerrAscend does not ultimately have direct control over how it is perceived by others. Reputation loss may result in decreased investor confidence, increased challenges in developing and maintaining community relations and an impediment to TerrAscend s overall ability to advance its business, thereby having a material adverse impact on the financial condition and results of operations of TerrAscend. 
 TerrAscend faces reputational risks, which may negatively impact its business. 
 Damage to TerrAscend s reputation can be the result of the actual or perceived occurrence of any number of events, and could include any negative publicity, whether true or not. The increased usage of social media and other web-based tools used to generate, publish, and discuss user-generated content and to connect with other users has made it increasingly easier for individuals and groups to communicate and share opinions and views in regards to TerrAscend and its activities, whether true or not. Although TerrAscend believes that it operates in a manner that is respectful to all shareholders and that it takes care in protecting its image and reputation, TerrAscend does not ultimately have direct control over how it is perceived by others. Reputation loss may result in decreased investor confidence, increased challenges in developing and maintaining community relations, and an impediment to TerrAscend s overall ability to advance its projects, thereby having a material adverse impact on financial performance, financial condition, cash flows, and growth prospects. Further, the parties with which TerrAscend does business may perceive that they are exposed to reputational risk as a result of TerrAscend s cannabis business activities. Failure to establish or maintain business relationships could have a material adverse effect on TerrAscend. 
 TerrAscend is dependent on suppliers and key inputs for the cultivation, extraction and production of cannabis products. 
 39 

The ability of TerrAscend to compete and grow will be dependent on it having access, at a reasonable cost and in a timely manner, to equipment, parts and components. No assurances can be given that TerrAscend will be successful in maintaining its required supply of equipment, parts and components. Global supply challenges have added further uncertainties around availability and price of equipment, parts and components. It is also possible that the final costs of the major equipment contemplated by TerrAscend s capital expenditure plans may be significantly greater than anticipated by TerrAscend s management and may be greater than funds available to TerrAscend, in which circumstance TerrAscend may curtail, or extend the timeframes for completing, its capital expenditure plans. This could have an adverse effect on the business, financial condition, results of operations or prospects of TerrAscend. 
 The cannabis business is dependent on a number of key inputs and their related costs including raw materials and supplies related to growing operations, as well as electricity, water and other local utilities. Any significant interruption or negative change in the availability or economics of the supply chain for key inputs could materially impact the business, financial condition, results of operations or prospects of TerrAscend. In addition, any restrictions on the ability to secure required supplies or utility services or to do so on commercially acceptable terms could have a materially adverse impact on the business, financial condition and operating results. Some of these inputs may only be available from a single supplier or a limited group of suppliers. If a sole source supplier was to go out of business, TerrAscend might be unable to find a replacement for such source in a timely manner or at all. If a sole source supplier were to be acquired by a competitor, that competitor may elect not to sell to TerrAscend in the future. Any inability to secure required supplies and services or to do so on appropriate terms and/or agreeable terms could have a materially adverse impact on the business, financial condition, results of operations or prospects of TerrAscend. 
 TerrAscend s business is subject to the risks inherent in agricultural operations. 
 TerrAscend s business involves the cultivation of the cannabis plant. The cultivation of this plant is subject to agricultural risks related to insects, plant diseases, unstable growing conditions, water and electricity availability and cost, and force majeure events. Although TerrAscend cultivates its cannabis plants in indoor or greenhouse, climate controlled rooms staffed by trained personnel, there can be no assurance that agricultural risks will not have a material adverse effect on the cultivation of its cannabis. TerrAscend may in the future cultivate cannabis plants outdoors, which would also subject it to related agricultural risks. 
 TerrAscend may be adversely impacted by rising or volatile energy costs. 
 TerrAscend s cannabis growing and manufacturing operations consume considerable energy, which make TerrAscend vulnerable to rising energy costs. Accordingly, rising or volatile energy costs have adversely impacted the business of TerrAscend and its profitability. 
 TerrAscend s intellectual property may be difficult to protect, and failure to do so may negatively impact its business. 
 The ownership and protection of trademarks, patents, trade secrets and intellectual property rights are significant aspects of TerrAscend s future success. TerrAscend has no patented technology or trademarked business methods at this time, nor has it registered any patents. TerrAscend has filed trademark applications in the United States and Canada. TerrAscend will continue to seek trademark protection in the United States and Canada. 
 TerrAscend s ability to obtain registered trademark protection for cannabis-related goods and services, in particular for cannabis itself, may be limited in certain countries outside of Canada, including the United States, where registered federal trademark protection is currently unavailable for trademarks covering marijuana-related products and services that are illegal under the CSA. Accordingly, TerrAscend s ability to obtain intellectual property rights or enforce intellectual property rights against third party uses of similar trademarks may be limited in certain countries. The U.S. Patent and Trademark Office released a policy on May 2, 2019 that clarifies that applications for trademarks for products that meet the definition of hemp could be accepted for registration, with certain exceptions. 
 Even if TerrAscend moves to protect its technology with trademarks, patents, copyrights or by other means, TerrAscend is not assured that competitors will not develop similar technology, business methods or that TerrAscend will be able to exercise its legal rights. Other countries may not protect intellectual property rights to the same standards as does the United States or Canada. Actions taken to protect or preserve intellectual property rights may require significant financial and other resources which may have a significant impact on TerrAscend s ability to successfully grow the business. 
 In addition, other parties may claim that TerrAscend s products infringe on their proprietary and perhaps patent protected rights. Such claims, whether or not meritorious, may result in TerrAscend s expenditure of significant financial and managerial resources, legal fees, result in injunctions, temporary restraining orders and/or require the payment of damages. 
 40 

TerrAscend and investors may have difficulty enforcing their legal rights. 
 In the event of a dispute arising from TerrAscend s U.S. operations, TerrAscend may be subject to the exclusive jurisdiction of foreign courts or may not be successful in subjecting foreign persons to the jurisdictions of courts in Canada. Similarly, to the extent that TerrAscend s assets are located outside of Canada, investors may have difficulty collecting from TerrAscend any judgments obtained in the Canadian courts and predicated on the civil liability provisions of securities provisions. TerrAscend may also be hindered or prevented from enforcing its rights with respect to a governmental entity or instrumentality because of the doctrine of sovereign immunity. 
 TerrAscend (and the third parties upon which it relies) faces physical security risks, as well as risks related to its information technology systems, potential cyber-attacks, and security breaches. 
 In the ordinary course of its business, TerrAscend collects, receives, stores, processes, generates, uses, transfers, discloses, makes accessible, protects, secures, disposes of, transmits, and shares (collectively, processes) personal data about its patients, adult-use customers and guests and other sensitive information, including proprietary and confidential business data, trade secrets, intellectual property, sensitive third-party data, business plans, transactions, and financial information (collectively, sensitive data). TerrAscend is responsible for protecting sensitive data from security breaches. 
 If there was a breach in security systems and TerrAscend became victim to a robbery or theft or if there was a failure of information technology systems or a component of information technology systems, or if TerrAscend's sensitive data were compromised, it could, depending on the nature of any such breach, failure or compromise, adversely impact TerrAscend s reputation, business continuity and results of operations. Any such security breach, failure or compromise could expose TerrAscend to additional liability and to potentially costly litigation, government enforcement actions, additional reporting requirements and/or oversight, indemnification obligations, negative publicity, increase expenses relating to the resolution and future prevention of these breaches and may deter potential customers from choosing TerrAscend s products. Given the nature of TerrAscend s products and its lack of legal availability outside of channels approved by the government of the US, as well as the concentration of inventory in its facilities, there remains a risk of shrinkage as well as theft. 
 A security breach may occur through procedural or process failure, information technology malfunction, or deliberate unauthorized intrusions. Cyber-attacks, malicious internet-based activity, online and offline fraud, and other similar activities threaten the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of TerrAscend s sensitive data and information technology systems, and those of the third parties upon which it relies. Such threats are prevalent and continue to rise, are increasingly difficult to detect, and come from a variety of sources, including traditional computer hackers, threat actors, hacktivists, organized criminal threat actors, personnel (such as through theft or misuse), sophisticated nation states, and nation-state-supported actors. 
 Some actors now engage and are expected to continue to engage in cyber-attacks, including without limitation nation-state actors for geopolitical reasons and in conjunction with military conflicts and defense activities. During times of war and other major conflicts, TerrAscend and the third parties upon which it relies may be vulnerable to a heightened risk of these attacks, including retaliatory cyber-attacks, that could materially disrupt its systems and operations, supply chain, and ability to produce, sell and distribute its services. 
 TerrAscend and the third parties upon which it relies are subject to a variety of evolving threats, including but not limited to social-engineering attacks (including through phishing attacks), malicious code (such as viruses and worms), malware (including as a result of advanced persistent threat intrusions), denial-of-service attacks (such as credential stuffing), credential harvesting, personnel misconduct or error, ransomware attacks, supply-chain attacks, software bugs, server malfunctions, software or hardware failures, loss of data or other information technology assets, adware, telecommunications failures, earthquakes, fires, floods, cable cuts, damage to physical plants, power loss, vandalism, theft, and other similar threats. 
 In particular, severe ransomware attacks are becoming increasingly prevalent and can lead to significant interruptions in TerrAscend s operations, loss of sensitive data and income, reputational harm, and diversion of funds. Extortion payments may alleviate the negative impact of a ransomware attack, but TerrAscend may be unwilling or unable to make such payments due to, for example, applicable laws or regulations prohibiting such payments. 
 Remote work has become more common and has increased risks to TerrAscend s information technology systems and data, as more of its employees utilize network connections, computers, and devices outside its premises or network, including working at home, while in transit and in public locations. Additionally, future or past business transactions (such as acquisitions or integrations) could expose TerrAscend to additional cybersecurity risks and vulnerabilities, as its systems could be negatively affected by vulnerabilities present in acquired or integrated entities systems and technologies. Furthermore, TerrAscend may discover security issues that were not found during due diligence of such acquired or integrated entities, and it may be difficult to integrate companies into TerrAscend s information technology environment and security program 
 41 

In addition, TerrAscend's reliance on third-party service providers could introduce new cybersecurity risks and vulnerabilities, including supply-chain attacks, and other threats to its business operations. TerrAscend has entered into agreements with third parties for hardware, software, telecommunications and other information technology (or IT services in connection with its operations. TerrAscend s ability to monitor these third parties information security practices is limited, and these third parties may not have adequate information security measures in place. If its third-party service providers experience a security incident or other interruption, TerrAscend could experience adverse consequences. While TerrAscend may be entitled to damages if its third-party service providers fail to satisfy their privacy or security-related obligations to TerrAscend, any award may be insufficient to cover TerrAscend s damages, or TerrAscend may be unable to recover such award. In addition, supply-chain attacks have increased in frequency and severity, and TerrAscend cannot guarantee that third parties infrastructure in its supply chain or its third-party partners supply chains have not been compromised. 
 TerrAscend s operations depend, in part, on how well it and its suppliers protect networks, equipment, IT systems and software against damage from of the aforementioned or similar threats. TerrAscend s operations also depend on the timely maintenance, upgrade and replacement of networks, equipment, IT systems and software, as well as pre-emptive expenses to mitigate the risks of failures. Any of these and other events could TerrAscend s ability to monitor these third parties information security practices is limited, and these third parties may not have adequate information security measures in place. If its third-party service providers experience a security incident or other interruption, TerrAscend could experience adverse consequences. While TerrAscend may be entitled to damages if its third-party service providers fail to satisfy their privacy or security-related obligations to TerrAscend, any award may be insufficient to cover TerrAscend s damages, or TerrAscend may be unable to recover such award. In addition, supply-chain attacks have increased in frequency and severity, and TerrAscend cannot guarantee that third parties infrastructure in its supply chain or its third-party partners supply chains have not been compromised. 
 TerrAscend may expend significant resources or modify its business activities to try to protect against security breaches. Additionally, certain data privacy and security obligations may require TerrAscend to implement and maintain specific security measures or industry-standard or reasonable security measures to protect its information technology systems and sensitive data. 
 While TerrAscend has implemented security measures designed to protect against security breaches, there can be no assurance that these measures will be effective. TerrAscend takes steps to detect and remediate vulnerabilities, but it may not be able to detect and remediate all vulnerabilities because the threats and techniques used to exploit the vulnerability change frequently and are often sophisticated in nature. Therefore, such vulnerabilities could be exploited but may not be detected until after a security incident has occurred. These vulnerabilities pose material risks to TerrAscend s business. Further, TerrAscend may experience delays in developing and deploying remedial measures designed to address any such identified vulnerabilities. 
 Applicable data privacy and security obligations may require TerrAscend to notify relevant stakeholders of security breaches. Such disclosures are costly, and the disclosure or the failure to comply with such requirements could lead to adverse consequences. 
 TerrAscend s contracts may not contain limitations of liability, and even where they do, there can be no assurance that limitations of liability in its contracts are sufficient to protect it from liabilities, damages, or claims related to its data privacy and security obligations. TerrAscend cannot be sure that its insurance coverage will be adequate or sufficient to protect it from or to mitigate liabilities arising out of its privacy and security practices, that such coverage will continue to be available on commercially reasonable terms or at all, or that such coverage will pay future claims. 
 In addition to experiencing a security breach, third parties may gather, collect, or infer sensitive data about it from public sources, data brokers, or other means that reveals competitively sensitive details about TerrAscend and could be used to undermine its competitive advantage or market position. 
 TerrAscend is or may become subject to stringent and evolving U.S. and foreign laws, regulations, rules, contractual obligations, policies and other obligations related to data privacy and security. Its actual or perceived failure to comply with such obligations could lead to regulatory investigations or actions; litigation; fines and penalties; disruptions of our business operations; reputational harm; loss of revenue or profits; and other adverse business consequences. 
 TerrAscend s data processing activities may subject it to numerous data privacy and security obligations, such as various laws, regulations, guidance, industry standards, external and internal privacy and security policies, contractual requirements, and other obligations relating to data privacy and security. 
 In the United States, federal, state, and local governments have enacted numerous data privacy and security laws, including data breach notification laws, personal data privacy laws, consumer protection laws (e.g., Section 5 of the Federal Trade 
 42 

Commission Act), and other similar laws (e.g., wiretapping laws). For example, there are a number of federal, state, and local laws protecting the confidentiality of certain health-related information of TerrAscend s patients and customers, including their health-related records, and restricting the use and disclosure of that information. As another example, the California Consumer Privacy Act of 2018, as amended by the California Privacy Rights Act of 2020 CPRA (collectively, CCPA applies to personal data of consumers, business representatives, and employees who are California residents, and requires businesses to provide specific disclosures in privacy notices and honor requests of such individuals to exercise certain privacy rights. The CCPA provides for administrative fines of up to 7,500 per violation and allows private litigants affected by certain data breaches to recover significant statutory damages. In addition, the CPRA expanded the CCPA s requirements, including by adding a new right for individuals to correct their personal data and establishing a new regulatory agency to implement and enforce the law. Other states, such as Virginia and Colorado, have also passed comprehensive privacy laws, and similar laws are being considered in several other states, as well as at the federal and local levels. These developments may further complicate compliance efforts, and increase legal risk and compliance costs for TerrAscend and the third parties upon whom it relies. 
 Outside the United States, an increasing number of laws, regulations, and industry standards may govern data privacy and security. For example, Canada s Personal Information Protection and Electronic Documents Act (PIPEDA) imposes strict requirements for processing personal data. 
 In addition to data privacy and security laws, TerrAscend is bound by other contractual obligations related to data privacy and security, and its efforts to comply with such obligations may not be successful. TerrAscend publishes privacy policies, marketing materials, and other statement. If found to be deficient, lacking in transparency, deceptive, unfair, or misrepresentative of its practices, TerrAscend may be subject to investigation, enforcement actions by regulators, or other adverse consequences. 
 Obligations related to data privacy and security are quickly changing, becoming increasingly stringent, and creating regulatory uncertainty. Additionally, these obligations may be subject to differing applications and interpretations, which may be inconsistent or conflict among jurisdictions. Preparing for and complying with these obligations requires TerrAscend to devote significant resources and may necessitate changes to its services, information technologies, systems, and practices and to those of any third parties that process personal data on its behalf. 
 TerrAscend may at times fail (or be perceived to have failed) in its efforts to comply with its data privacy and security obligations. Moreover, despite its efforts, TerrAscend s personnel or third parties on whom it relies may fail to comply with such obligations, which could negatively impact its business operations. If TerrAscend or the third parties on which it relies fail, or are perceived to have failed, to address or comply with applicable data privacy and security obligations, it could face significant consequences, including but not limited to: government enforcement actions (e.g., investigations, fines, penalties, audits, inspections, and similar); litigation (including class-action claims); additional reporting requirements and/or oversight; bans on processing personal data; and orders to destroy or not use personal data. Any of these events could have a material adverse effect on TerrAscend s reputation, business, or financial condition, including but not limited to: loss of customers; inability to process personal data or to operate in certain jurisdictions; limited ability to develop or commercialize its products; expenditure of time and resources to defend any claim or inquiry; adverse publicity; or substantial changes to its business model or operations. 
 TerrAscend faces exposure to fraudulent or illegal activity by employees, contractors and consultants, which may subject TerrAscend to investigations or other actions. 
 TerrAscend is exposed to the risk that its employees, independent contractors and consultants may engage in fraudulent or other illegal activity. Misconduct by these parties could include intentional, reckless and/or negligent conduct or disclosure of unauthorized activities to TerrAscend that violates: (i) government regulations; (ii) manufacturing standards; (iii) federal, state and provincial healthcare fraud and abuse laws and regulations; or (iv) laws that require the true, complete and accurate reporting of financial information or data. It may not always be possible for TerrAscend to identify and deter misconduct by its employees and other third parties, and the precautions taken by TerrAscend to detect and prevent this activity may not be effective in controlling unknown or unmanaged risks or losses or in protecting TerrAscend from governmental investigations or other actions or lawsuits stemming from a failure to be in compliance with such laws or regulations. If any such actions are instituted against TerrAscend, and it is not successful in defending itself or asserting its rights, those actions could have a significant impact on TerrAscend s business, including the imposition of civil, criminal and administrative penalties, damages, monetary fines, contractual damages, reputational harm, diminished profits and future earnings, and curtailment of TerrAscend s operations, any of which could have a material adverse effect on TerrAscend s business, financial condition, results of operations or prospects. 
 43 

Directors and officers of TerrAscend have faced, and may in the future face, conflicts of interests regarding the business strategy of TerrAscend. 
 Certain of the directors and officers of TerrAscend are also directors and officers of other companies or are engaged and will continue to be engaged in activities that may put them in conflict with the business strategy of TerrAscend. Consequently, there exists the possibility for such directors and officers to be in a position of conflict. 
 In particular, TerrAscend may also become involved in other transactions which conflict with the interests of its directors and officers, who may from time to time deal with persons, firms, institutions or companies with which TerrAscend may be dealing, or which may be seeking investments similar to those desired by it. All decisions to be made by directors and officers of TerrAscend are required to be made in accordance with their duties and obligations to act honestly and in good faith with a view to the best interests of TerrAscend. In addition, the directors and officers are required to declare their interests in, and such directors are required to refrain from voting on, any matter in which they may have a material conflict of interest. 
 TerrAscend s internal controls over financial reporting may not be effective, and the TerrAscend s independent auditors may not be able to certify as to their effectiveness, which could have a significant and adverse effect on TerrAscend s business. 
 TerrAscend is subject to the reporting requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the Exchange Act and the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, as amended (the Sarbanes-Oxley Act ). Pursuant to Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, TerrAscend is required to perform system and process evaluation and testing of its internal control over financial reporting to allow Company management to report on the effectiveness of its internal control over financial reporting. Furthermore, if at such time, TerrAscend no longer qualifies as a emerging growth company, its independent registered public accounting firm will be required to issue an annual report that attests the effectiveness of TerrAscend's internal control over financial reporting. 
 TerrAscend incurs expenses and, to a lesser extent, diversion of Company management s time in its efforts to comply with Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act regarding internal controls over financial reporting. Effective internal controls over financial reporting are necessary for TerrAscend to provide reliable financial reports and, together with adequate disclosure controls and procedures, are designed to prevent fraud. Any failure to implement required new or improved controls, or difficulties encountered in their implementation could cause TerrAscend to fail to meet its reporting obligations. In addition, any testing by TerrAscend conducted in connection with Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, or the subsequent testing by TerrAscend s independent registered public accounting firm when required, may reveal deficiencies in TerrAscend s internal controls over financial reporting that are deemed to be material weaknesses or that may require prospective or retrospective changes to TerrAscend s consolidated financial statements or identify other areas for further attention or improvement. Moreover, TerrAscend's internal controls over financial reporting will not prevent or detect all errors and all fraud. A control system, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the control system's objective will be met. Because of the inherent limitations in all control systems, no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that misstatements due to error or fraud will not occur or that all control issues and instances of fraud will be detected. If TerrAscend is unable to assert that its internal control over financial reporting is effective, investors could lose confidence in TerrAscend's reported financial information, the trading price of TerrAscend's Common Shares could decline and TerrAscend could be subject to sanctions or investigations by the United States Securities and Exchange Commission or other regulatory authorities. 
 TerrAscend s business could be adversely affected by economic downturns, inflation, increases in interest rates, natural disasters, public health crises such as the COVID-19 pandemic, political crises, geopolitical events, such as the crisis in Ukraine, or other macroeconomic conditions, which have in the past and may in the future negatively impact TerrAscend s business and financial performance. 
 The global economy, including credit and financial markets, has experienced extreme volatility and disruptions, including, among other things, severely diminished liquidity and credit availability, declines in consumer confidence, declines in economic growth, supply chain shortages, increases in inflation rates, higher interest rates and uncertainty about economic stability. For example, the COVID-19 pandemic resulted in widespread unemployment, economic slowdown and extreme volatility in the capital markets. The U.S. Federal Reserve recently raised interest rates multiple times in response to concerns about inflation and it may raise them again. Higher interest rates, coupled with reduced government spending and volatility in financial markets may increase economic uncertainty and affect consumer spending. If the equity and credit markets deteriorate, including as a result of political unrest or war, such as the crisis in Ukraine, it may make any necessary debt or equity financing more difficult to obtain in a timely manner or on favorable terms, more costly or more dilutive. Increased inflation rates can adversely affect TerrAscend by increasing TerrAscend s costs, including labor and employee benefit costs.

The development of TerrAscend s products is complex and requires significant investment. Failure to develop new technologies and products could adversely affect TerrAscend s business. 
 The introduction of new products embodying new technologies, including new manufacturing processes, and the emergence of new industry standards may render TerrAscend s products obsolete, less competitive or less marketable. The process of developing TerrAscend s products is complex and requires significant continuing costs, development efforts and third-party commitments. TerrAscend s failure to develop new technologies and products and the obsolescence of existing technologies could adversely affect the business, financial condition and operating results of TerrAscend. TerrAscend may be unable to anticipate changes in its potential customer requirements that could make TerrAscend s existing technology obsolete. 
 The development of TerrAscend s proprietary technology entails significant technical and business risks. TerrAscend may not be successful in using its new technologies or exploiting its niche markets effectively or adapting its businesses to evolving customer or medical requirements or preferences or emerging industry standards. 
 TerrAscend needs to attract and retain customers and patients in order to succeed, and failure to do so may have a material adverse effect on TerrAscend s business. 
 TerrAscend s success depends on its ability to attract and retain customers and patients. There are many factors which could impact TerrAscend s ability to attract and retain customers and patients, including but not limited to TerrAscend s ability to continually produce desirable and effective products and, the successful implementation of a customer and patient-acquisition plan. TerrAscend s failure to acquire and retain customers and patients would have a material adverse effect on TerrAscend s business, operating results and financial condition. 
 TerrAscend has a limited operating history, which makes it difficult to evaluate its prospects and predict future operating results. 
 TerrAscend has a limited operating history and, accordingly, potential investors will have a limited basis on which to evaluate its ability to achieve its business objectives. The future success of TerrAscend is dependent on management s ability to implement its strategy, there is no certainty that anticipated outcomes and sustainable revenue streams will be achieved and there is no certainty that TerrAscend will successfully produce commercial medical cannabis, establish a market for and sell its product, maintain its licenses or obtain other necessary licenses and/or approvals. 
 TerrAscend faces risks frequently encountered by early-stage companies. In particular, its future growth and prospects will depend on its ability to expand its operation and gain additional revenue streams while at the same time maintaining effective cost controls. Any failure to expand is likely to have a material adverse effect on TerrAscend s business, financial condition and results. As such, there is no assurance that TerrAscend will be successful in achieving a return on TerrAscend shareholders investment and the likelihood of success must be considered in light of the early stage of operations. 
 TerrAscend may be subject to growth-related risks, which could negatively affect its business. 
 TerrAscend may be subject to growth-related risks including capacity constraints and pressure on its internal systems and controls. The ability of TerrAscend to manage growth effectively will require it to continue to implement and improve its operational and financial systems and to expand, train and manage its employee base. The inability of TerrAscend to deal with this growth may have a material adverse effect on TerrAscend s business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects. 
 Risks Related to TerrAscend s Investment and Acquisition Business Strategies 
 The success of TerrAscend s business depends, in part, on its ability to successfully integrate recently acquired businesses and to retain key employees of acquired businesses. If TerrAscend is unsuccessful in doing so, it may negatively affect TerrAscend s business. 
 TerrAscend may not be able to successfully integrate and combine the operations, personnel and technology infrastructure of any such acquired company with its existing operations. If integration is not managed successfully by TerrAscend s management, TerrAscend may experience interruptions to its business activities, deterioration in its employee and customer relationships, increased costs of integration and harm to its reputation, all of which could have a material adverse effect on TerrAscend s business, financial condition and results of operations. TerrAscend may experience difficulties in combining corporate cultures, maintaining employee morale and retaining key employees. The integration of any such acquired companies may also impose substantial demands on management. There is no assurance that these acquisitions will be successfully integrated in a timely manner. 
 45 

There can be no assurance that TerrAscend s current and future strategic alliances will have a beneficial impact on TerrAscend s business, financial condition and results of operations. 
 TerrAscend currently has, and may in the future, enter into strategic alliances with third parties that it believes will complement or augment its existing business. TerrAscend s ability to complete strategic alliances is dependent upon, and may be limited by, the availability of suitable candidates and capital. In addition, strategic alliances could present unforeseen integration obstacles or costs, may not enhance TerrAscend s business, and may involve risks that could adversely affect TerrAscend, including significant amounts of management time that may be diverted from operations in order to pursue and complete such transactions or maintain such strategic alliances. Future strategic alliances could result in the incurrence of additional debt, costs and contingent liabilities, and there can be no assurance that future strategic alliances will achieve, or that TerrAscend s existing strategic alliances will continue to achieve, the expected benefits to TerrAscend s business or that TerrAscend will be able to consummate future strategic alliances on satisfactory terms, or at all. Any of the foregoing could have a material adverse effect on TerrAscend s business, financial condition and results of operations. 
 TerrAscend s use of joint ventures may expose TerrAscend to risks associated with jointly owned investments. 
 TerrAscend currently operates parts of its business through joint ventures with other companies, and it may enter into additional joint ventures in the future. Joint venture investments and partnerships may involve risks not otherwise present for investments made solely by TerrAscend, including: (i) TerrAscend may not control the joint ventures; (ii) TerrAscend s joint venture partners may not agree to distributions that it believe are appropriate; (iii) where TerrAscend does not have substantial decision-making authority, it may experience impasses or disputes with TerrAscend s joint venture partners on certain decisions, which could require it to expend additional resources to resolve such impasses or disputes, including litigation or arbitration; (iv) TerrAscend s joint venture partners may become insolvent or bankrupt, fail to fund their share of required capital contributions or fail to fulfil their obligations as a joint venture partner; (v) the arrangements governing TerrAscend s joint ventures may contain certain conditions or milestone events that may never be satisfied or achieved; (vi) TerrAscend s joint venture partners may have business or economic interests that are inconsistent with TerrAscend s and may take actions contrary to TerrAscend s interests; (vii) TerrAscend may suffer losses as a result of actions taken by TerrAscend s joint venture partners with respect to TerrAscend s joint venture investments; and (viii) it may be difficult for TerrAscend to exit a joint venture if an impasse arises or if TerrAscend desires to sell its interest for any reason. Any of the foregoing risks could have a material adverse effect on TerrAscend s business, financial condition and results of operations. In addition, TerrAscend may, in certain circumstances, be liable for the actions of its joint venture partners. 
 TerrAscend may not realize the benefits of its growth strategy, which could have an adverse effect on TerrAscend's business. 
 In March 2022, TerrAscend acquired all of the issued and outstanding equity interests in Gage, a cultivator and processor in Michigan (such transaction, the Gage Acquisition ). TerrAscend believes that the completion of the Gage Acquisition will allow it to accelerate its strategic efforts to capitalize on significant growth opportunities by gaining exposure to the Michigan market. As part of its growth strategy, TerrAscend will continue in its existing efforts and initiate new efforts to expand its footprint, and brand and marketing capabilities. Such expansion is dependent on availability of capital funding, achieving satisfactory returns on the acquisition of Gage, continuing to enter into successful business arrangements and certain assumptions about being able to achieve Gage s projected growth strategy. The failure to successfully implement either its own strategic initiatives, or those with respect to Gage, could have a material adverse effect on TerrAscend s business and results of operations. 
 Risks Related to TerrAscend s Common Shares 
 TerrAscend s voting control is concentrated. 
 Mr. Jason Wild, TerrAscend s Executive Chairman and Chairman of TerrAscend s Board, beneficially owns, directly or indirectly, or exercises control or direction over shares representing approximately 28.52 of the voting capital stock of TerrAscend as of March 14, 2023. As a result, he exerts significant control over matters that may be put forth for the consideration of all TerrAscend shareholders, including for example, the approval of a potential business combination or consolidation, a liquidation or sale of all or substantially all of TerrAscend s assets, electing members to TerrAscend s Board, and adopting amendments to TerrAscend s constating documents, including its articles of incorporation, as amended (the Articles and by-laws. 
 TerrAscend s Preferred Shares have a liquidation preference over the Common Shares, which could limit TerrAscend s ability to make distributions to the holders of Common Shares. 
 46 

In the event of liquidation, dissolution or winding up of TerrAscend, whether voluntary or involuntary, or upon any other return of capital or distribution of the assets of TerrAscend among its shareholders, in each case for the purposes of winding up its affairs, TerrAscend s preferred shares (the Preferred Shares are entitled to receive any distribution available to be paid out of the assets of TerrAscend before the Proportionate Voting Shares, Common Shares and exchangeable shares of TerrAscend (the Exchangeable Shares ). Accordingly, should TerrAscend be liquidated, dissolved or wound-up, TerrAscend may be unable to make any distribution to the holders of the Common Shares. 
 An investor may face liquidity risks with an investment in the Common Shares. 
 TerrAscend s Common Shares are listed on the CSE and also trade over the counter in the United States on the OTCQX Best Market, however, there can be no assurance that an active and/or liquid market for Common Shares will develop or be maintained and an investor may find it difficult to resell any securities of TerrAscend. For example, given the heightened risk profile associated with cannabis in the United States, capital markets participants may be unwilling to assist with the settlement of trades for U.S. resident securityholders of companies with operations in the U.S. cannabis industry, which may prohibit or significantly impair the ability of securityholders in the United States to trade TerrAscend's securities. In the event residents of the United States are unable to settle trades of TerrAscend's securities, this may affect the pricing of such securities in the secondary market, the transparency and availability of trading prices and the liquidity of these securities. 
 The price of TerrAscend s Common Shares may be volatile, and may be adversely affected by the price of cannabis. 
 The market price of Common Shares may be subject to wide price fluctuations, and the price of TerrAscend s shares and its financial results may be significantly and adversely affected by a decline in the price of cannabis. There is currently no established market price for cannabis and the price of cannabis is affected by several factors beyond TerrAscend s control. For example, price fluctuations may be in response to many factors, including variations in the operating results of TerrAscend and its subsidiaries, divergence in financial results from analysts expectations, changes in earnings estimates by stock market analysts, changes in the business prospects for TerrAscend and its subsidiaries, general economic conditions, legislative changes, community support for the cannabis industry and other events and factors outside of TerrAscend s control. In addition, stock markets have from time to time experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations, which, as well as general economic and political conditions, could adversely affect the market price for TerrAscend s Common Shares. 
 Additional issuances of TerrAscend s securities may result in dilution. 
 TerrAscend may issue additional securities in the future, which may dilute a TerrAscend shareholder s holdings in TerrAscend. TerrAscend s Articles permit the issuance of an unlimited number of Proportionate Voting Shares, Exchangeable Shares, Preferred Shares and Common Shares, and TerrAscend shareholders will have no pre-emptive rights in connection with such further issuance. For example, in connection with the recently completed Transaction with Gage, TerrAscend issued approximately 51.3 million Common Shares to Gage shareholders and reserved approximately an additional 25.8 million Common Shares pursuant to the convertible securities of Gage which will be exchanged for convertible securities of TerrAscend. The directors of TerrAscend have discretion to determine the price and the terms of issue of further issuances, and such terms could include rights, preferences and privileges superior to those existing holders. Moreover, additional Common Shares will be issued by TerrAscend on the exercise of options under TerrAscend s stock option plan and upon the exercise of outstanding warrants and upon the conversion of Proportionate Voting Shares, Exchangeable Shares and Preferred Shares. To the extent holders of TerrAscend s stock options or other convertible securities convert or exercise their securities and sell Common Shares they receive, the trading price of the Common Shares may decrease due to the additional amount of Common Shares available in the market. TerrAscend cannot predict the size or nature of future issuances or the effect that future issuances and sales of Common Shares will have on the market price of the Common Shares. Issuances of a substantial number of additional Common Shares, or the perception that such issuances could occur, may adversely affect prevailing market prices for the Common Shares. With any additional issuance of Common Shares, investors will suffer dilution to their voting power and economic interest in TerrAscend. 
 Sales of substantial amounts of Common Shares may have an adverse effect on the market price of the Common Shares. 
 Sales of a substantial number of Common Shares in the public market could occur at any time. These sales, or the market perception that the holders of a large number of Common Shares intend to sell Common Shares, could reduce the market price of Common Shares. 
 47 

TerrAscend s management will continue to have broad discretion over the use of the proceeds TerrAscend receives in its public offerings, private placements, warrant exercises and loans, as applicable, and might not apply the proceeds in ways that increase the value of your investment. 
 TerrAscend s management will continue to have broad discretion to use the net proceeds from its public offerings, private placements warrant exercises and loans, as applicable, and you will be relying on the judgment of TerrAscend s management regarding the application of these proceeds. TerrAscend s management might not apply TerrAscend s net proceeds in ways that ultimately increase the value of your investment. Because of the number and variability of factors that will determine its use of the remaining net proceeds from TerrAscend s public offerings and other financing transactions, their ultimate use may vary substantially from their currently intended use. If TerrAscend does not invest or apply the net proceeds from its public offerings, private placements, warrant exercises and loans in ways that enhance shareholder value, it may fail to achieve the expected financial results, which could cause its share price to decline. 
 Risks related to potential disqualification of equity holders by regulatory authorities. 
 An individual with an ownership interest in TerrAscend could become disqualified from having such ownership interest in TerrAscend under a U.S. state cannabis agency s interpretation of the relevant state laws and regulations if such owner is convicted of a certain type of felony or fails to meet the residency requirements, if any, for owning equity in a company like TerrAscend. The loss of such equity holder could potentially have a material adverse effect on TerrAscend. 
 TerrAscend does not intend to pay dividends on its Common Shares for the foreseeable future and, consequently, your ability to achieve a return on your investment will depend on appreciation in the price of TerrAscend s Common Shares. 
 TerrAscend s policy is to retain earnings to finance the development and enhancement of its products and to otherwise reinvest in TerrAscend s businesses. Therefore, TerrAscend does not anticipate paying cash dividends on Common Shares in the foreseeable future. Any decision to declare and pay dividends in the future will be made at the discretion of TerrAscend s Board and will depend on, among other things, financial results, cash requirements, contractual restrictions and other factors that TerrAscend s Board may deem relevant. As a result, investors may not receive any return on investment in Common Shares unless they sell them for a share price that is greater than that at which such investors purchased them. 
 
 Penny stock rules may make buying or selling TerrAscend s securities difficult which may make its securities less liquid and make it harder for investors to buy and sell such securities. 
 Trading in TerrAscend s securities is subject to the SEC s penny stock rules and it is anticipated that trading in TerrAscend s securities will continue to be subject to the penny stock rules for the foreseeable future. The SEC has adopted regulations that generally define a penny stock to be any equity security that has a market price of less than 5.00 per share, subject to certain exceptions. These rules require that any broker-dealer who recommends TerrAscend s securities to persons other than prior customers and accredited investors must, prior to the sale, make a special written suitability determination for the purchaser and receive the purchaser s written agreement to execute the transaction. Unless an exception is available, the regulations require the delivery, prior to any transaction involving a penny stock, of a disclosure schedule explaining the penny stock market and the risks associated with trading in the penny stock market. In addition, broker-dealers must disclose commissions payable to both the broker-dealer and the registered representative and current quotations for the securities they offer. The additional burdens imposed upon broker-dealers by these requirements may discourage broker-dealers from recommending transactions in TerrAscend s securities, which could severely limit the liquidity of such securities and consequently adversely affect the market price for such securities. 
 General Risk Factors 
 TerrAscend may not be able to obtain necessary permits and authorizations. 
 TerrAscend may be required to obtain and maintain certain permits, licenses and approvals in the jurisdictions where its products are manufactured and/or sold. There can be no assurance that TerrAscend will be able to obtain or maintain any necessary licenses, permits or approvals. Any material delay or inability to receive these items is likely to delay and/or inhibit TerrAscend s ability to conduct its business, and would have an adverse effect on its business, financial condition and results of operations. 
 48 

Due to the uncertainty regarding the implementation and impact of the CARES Act and other legislation related to COVID-19, and their application to businesses substantially similar to TerrAscend there is a risk that failure to comply with the legislation may negatively impact TerrAscend and businesses substantially similar to TerrAscend. 
 On March 27, 2020, the Coronavirus Aid, Relief and Economic Securities Act CARES Act was signed into law, aimed at providing emergency assistance and health care for individuals, families, and businesses affected by the COVID-19 pandemic and generally supporting the U.S. economy. The CARES Act, among other things, includes provisions relating to refundable payroll tax credits, deferment of employer social security payments, net operating loss carryback periods, alternative minimum tax credit refunds, and modifications to the net interest deduction limitations. In December 2022, TerrAscend filed for an Employee Retention Tax Credit ERC distribution in the amount of approximately 14,903. ERC distributions are refundable tax credits for 50 of qualified wages paid to employees during the pandemic. A company is eligible for the ERC if it has not received a Paycheck Protection Program loan under the Cares Act and (1) its operations have been fully or partially suspended because of COVID-19 or (2) its gross receipts in a calendar quarter in 2020 declined by more than 50 from the same period in 2019. No formal determination regarding the claim for the ERC has been received. Due to the potential uncertainty regarding the implementation of the CARES Act and other stimulus legislation, and due to the nature of our business, there is a risk that failure to comply with the legislation may negatively impact TerrAscend and businesses substantially similar to TerrAscend. 
 TerrAscend may be subject to litigation, which could divert the attention of management and cause TerrAscend to expend significant resources. 
 TerrAscend may become party to litigation from time to time in the ordinary course of business which could adversely affect its business. Should any litigation in which TerrAscend becomes involved be determined against TerrAscend, such a decision could adversely affect TerrAscend s ability to continue operating and the market price for Common Shares. Even if TerrAscend is involved in litigation and wins, litigation can redirect significant resources. 
 TerrAscend faces risks and hazards that may not be covered by insurance. 
 TerrAscend s business is subject to a number of risks and hazards generally, including adverse environmental conditions, accidents, disputes and changes in the regulatory environment. Such occurrences could result in damage to assets, personal injury or death, environmental damage, delays in operations, monetary losses and possible legal liability. 
 Although TerrAscend maintains insurance to protect against certain risks in such amounts as it considers to be reasonable, its insurance does not cover all the potential risks associated with its operations. TerrAscend may also be unable to maintain insurance to cover these risks at economically feasible premiums. Insurance coverage may not continue to be available or may not be adequate to cover any resulting liability. Moreover, insurance against risks such as environmental pollution or other hazards encountered in the operations of TerrAscend is not generally available on acceptable terms. Losses from these events may cause TerrAscend to incur significant costs that could have a material adverse effect upon its financial performance and results of operations. 
 TerrAscend has incurred and will continue to incur substantial costs as a result of operating as a public company in Canada and the United States, and its management will continue to devote substantial time to new compliance initiatives. 
 TerrAscend s Common Shares are listed on the CSE under the trading symbol TER. The Common Shares also trade over the counter in the United States on OTCQX under the trading symbol TRSSF. As a public company, TerrAscend incurs substantial legal, accounting, and other expenses that it did not incur as a private company. For example, TerrAscend is subject to the reporting requirements of the Exchange Act, the applicable requirements of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act and the rules and regulations of the SEC. The Exchange Act and Securities Act (Ontario) require, among other things, that TerrAscend file annual, quarterly, and current reports with respect to its business, financial condition and results of operations. Compliance with these rules and regulations increase TerrAscend s legal and financial compliance costs and increase demand on its systems, particularly after TerrAscend is no longer an emerging growth company. In addition, as a public company, TerrAscend may be subject to shareholder activism, which can lead to additional substantial costs, distract management and impact the manner in which TerrAscend operates its business in ways it cannot currently anticipate. As a result of disclosure of information in filings required of a public company, TerrAscend s business and financial condition are more visible, which may result in threatened or actual litigation, including by competitors. 
 TerrAscend is currently an emerging growth company within the meaning of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the Securities Act ), and to the extent TerrAscend has taken advantage of certain exemptions from disclosure requirements 
 49 

available to emerging growth companies, this could make its securities less attractive to investors and may make it more difficult to compare the company s performance with other public companies. 
 TerrAscend is an emerging growth company within the meaning of the Securities Act, as modified by the JOBS Act, and TerrAscend may take advantage of certain exemptions from various reporting requirements that are applicable to other public companies that are not emerging growth companies including, but not limited to, not being required to comply with the auditor attestation requirements of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, reduced disclosure obligations regarding executive compensation in TerrAscend s periodic reports and proxy statements, and exemptions from the requirements of holding a nonbinding advisory vote on executive compensation and shareholder approval of any golden parachute payments not previously approved. As a result, TerrAscend s shareholders may not have access to certain information they may deem important. TerrAscend could be an emerging growth company for up to five years, although circumstances could cause TerrAscend to lose that status earlier, including if the market value of its Common Shares held by non-affiliates exceeds 700 million as of June 30, in which case TerrAscend would no longer be an emerging growth company as of the following fiscal year. TerrAscend cannot predict whether investors will find its securities less attractive because it will rely on these exemptions. If some investors find TerrAscend s securities less attractive as a result of its reliance on these exemptions, the trading prices of its securities may be lower than they otherwise would be, there may be a less active trading market for the securities and the trading prices of its securities may be more volatile. 
 Further, Section 102(b)(1) of the JOBS Act exempts emerging growth companies from being required to comply with new or revised financial accounting standards until private companies (that is, those that have not had a Securities Act registration statement declared effective or do not have a class of securities registered under the Exchange Act) are required to comply with the new or revised financial accounting standards. The JOBS Act provides that a company can elect to opt out of the extended transition period and comply with the requirements that apply to non-emerging growth companies but any such an election to opt out is irrevocable. TerrAscend has elected not to opt out of such extended transition period which means that when a standard is issued or revised and it has different application dates for public or private companies, TerrAscend, as an emerging growth company, can adopt the new or revised standard at the time private companies adopt the new or revised standard. This may make comparison of TerrAscend s financial statements with another public company which is neither an emerging growth company nor an emerging growth company which has opted out of using the extended transition period difficult or impossible because of the potential differences in accounting standards used.

 Properties Subject to an Encumbrance

Components of Results of Operations 
 The following discussion sets forth certain components of our Consolidated Statements of Comprehensive Loss as well as factors that impact those items. 
 Revenue 
 TerrAscend generates revenue from the sale of cannabis products, brands, and services to the United States and Canadian markets. Revenues consist of wholesale and retail sales in the medical and legal adult use market across Canada and in several U.S. states where cannabis has been legalized for medical or adult use. 
 Cost of sales 
 Cost of sales primarily consists of expenses related to providing cannabis products and services to TerrAscend's customers, including personnel-related expenses, the depreciation of property and equipment, amortization of acquired intangible assets, and other overhead costs. 
 General and administrative 
 General and administrative G A consists primarily of personnel costs related to finance, human resources, legal, and other administrative functions. Additionally G A expense includes professional fees to third parties, as well as marketing expenses. 
 60 

In addition, G A expense includes share-based compensation on options, restricted stock units and warrants. TerrAscend expects that G A expense will increase in absolute dollars as the business grows. 
 Amortization and depreciation 
 Amortization and depreciation includes the amortization of intangible assets. Amortization is calculated on a straight line basis over the following terms: 

Brand intangibles- indefinite lives 
 Indefinite useful lives or 3 years 

Brand intangibles- definite lives 
 3 years 

Software 
 5 years 

Licenses 
 5-30 years 

Customer relationships 
 5 years 

Non-compete agreements 
 3 years 

Depreciation of property and equipment is calculated on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful life of the asset using the following terms: 

Buildings and improvements 
 Lesser of useful life or 30 years 

Land 
 Not depreciated 

Machinery equipment 
 5-15 years 

Office furniture production equipment 
 3-5 years 

Right of use assets 
 Lease term 

Assets in process 
 Not depreciated 

Impairment of intangible assets and goodwill 
 Goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets are reviewed for impairment annually and whenever there are events or changes in circumstances that indicate that the carrying amount has been impaired. TerrAscend first performs a qualitative assessment. If based on the results of a qualitative assessment it has been determined that it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit exceeds its carrying value, additional quantitative impairment test is performed which compares the carrying value of the reporting unit to its estimated fair value. If the carrying value exceeds the estimated fair value, an impairment is recorded. 
 Definite lived intangible assets are tested for impairment when there are indications that an asset may be impaired. When indicators of impairment exist, TerrAscend performs a quantitative impairment test which compares the carrying value of the assets for intangible assets to their estimated fair values. If the carrying value exceeds the estimated fair value, an impairment is recorded. 
 (Gain) loss from revaluation of contingent consideration 
 As a result of some of its acquisitions, TerrAscend recognizes a contingent consideration payable, which is an obligation to transfer additional assets to the seller if future events occur. The liability is revalued at the end of each reporting period to determine its fair value. A gain or loss is recognized as a result of the revaluation. 
 (Gain) loss on fair value of warrants and purchase option derivative asset 
 During the year ended December 31, 2020, TerrAscend closed a non-brokered private placement by issuing 18,679 convertible preferred stock units, each unit consisting of one non-voting, non-participating preferred share and one preferred share warrant 
 61 

Preferred Warrant ). The Preferred Warrants were recorded as a warrant liability and are remeasured to fair value at the end of each reporting unit using the Black Scholes model. A gain or loss is recognized as a result of the revaluation. 
 Finance and other expenses 
 Finance and other expenses consists primarily of interest expense on TerrAscend's outstanding debt obligations. 
 Transaction and restructuring costs 
 Transaction costs include costs incurred in connection with TerrAscend's acquisitions, such as expenses related to professional fees, consulting, legal and accounting. Restructuring costs are those costs associated with severance and restructuring of business units. 
 Impairment of property and equipment 
 TerrAscend evaluates the recoverability of property and equipment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of the asset, or asset group, may not be recoverable. When TerrAscend determines that the carrying value of the long-lived asset may not be recoverable based upon the existence of one or more indicators, the assets are assessed for impairment based on the estimate of future undiscounted cash flows expected to result from the use of the asset and its eventual disposition. If the carrying value of an asset exceeds its estimated future undiscounted cash flows, an impairment loss is recorded for the excess of the asset s carrying value over its fair value. 
 Unrealized and realized foreign exchange loss 
 Unrealized and realized foreign exchange loss represents the loss recognized on the remeasurement of USD denominated cash and other assets recorded in the Canadian dollars functional currency at TerrAscend's Canadian operations. 
 Unrealized and realized gain on investments 
 TerrAscend accounts for its investment in equity securities without readily determinable fair values using a valuation technique which maximizes the use of relevant observable inputs, with subsequent holding changes in fair value recognized in unrealized gain or loss on investments in the consolidated statement of loss. 
 Provision for income taxes 
 Provision for income taxes consists of U.S. federal and state income taxes in certain jurisdictions in which TerrAscend conducts business.

The increase in net revenue for the year ended December 31, 2022 as compared to December 31, 2021 was due to an increase of 96,900 in retail sales from 87,119 at December 31, 2021 to 184,019 at December 31, 2022. The increase in revenue was mainly due to adult use sales in New Jersey, which commenced during 2022, as well as the Gage Acquisition and the Pinnacle Acquisition. Retail dispensaries increased from thirteen at December 31, 2021 to thirty-one at December 31, 2022. The increase was partially offset by the decrease of 43,281 in wholesale revenue from 107,091 at December 31, 2021 to 63,810 at December 31, 2022, which was mainly related to challenging market dynamics in Pennsylvania. 
 62 

The increase in net revenue for the year ended December 31, 2021 as compared to December 31, 2020 was due to an increase of 42,410 in retail sales from 44,709 at December 31, 2020 to 87,119 at December 31, 2021, and an increase of 19,648 in wholesale sales from 87,443 at December 31, 2020 to 107,091 at December 31, 2021. The increase in retail sales was primarily a result of the increase in retail dispensaries across Pennsylvania, California, and New Jersey, which increased from nine at December 31, 2020 to thirteen at December 31, 2021. The increase in wholesale sales was primarily a result of the initial ramp up in New Jersey, expansion in Pennsylvania, as well as the acquisition of HMS.

The increase in cost of sales for the twelve months ended December 31, 2022 as compared to December 31, 2021 was driven mainly by the Gage Acquisition, as well as an increase in New Jersey due to the increase in adult use sales which commenced during 2022. The increase in cost of sales as a percentage of revenue was due to lower volumes in Pennsylvania leading to under-absorption, primarily related to lower wholesale flower sales, operational challenges at TerrAscend's cultivation facility in Frederick, Maryland as TerrAscend transitioned to its Hagerstown location, and higher costs of sales as a percentage of revenue as a result of the acquisition of Gage in Michigan. 
 In addition, during the year ended December 31, 2022, TerrAscend wrote down its inventory by 9,082 mainly due to write downs of inventory to lower of cost or market which was related to TerrAscend's operational reconfiguration of its cultivation facility in Pennsylvania and write downs of inventory related to the vape recall in Pennsylvania. During the year ended December 31, 2021, TerrAscend recorded impairment of 2,243 mainly related to inventory at its Pennsylvania operations that did not meet quality standards. 
 The increase in cost of sales for the twelve months ended December 31, 2021 as compared to December 31, 2020 was a result of the increased volume of sales.

The increase in G A expenses for the years ended December 31, 2022 as compared to December 31, 2021 was primarily due to increased office and general expense of 15,909, increased salary and wages of 14,558, and increased sales and marketing of 8,460 mainly as a result of the Gage Acquisition and the Pinnacle Acquisition. 
 The increase in G A expenses for the years ended December 31, 2021 as compared to December 31, 2020 was primarily a result of increased salaries and wages of 11,464, mainly as a result of the increase in U.S. operations. Additionally, TerrAscend recognized an increase in share-based compensation expense of 4,867, primarily due to the greater number of options granted to new employees during the latter half of 2020, resulting in higher expenses during the twelve months ended December 31, 2021 as compared to the twelve months ended December 31, 2020, as well as expense related to the acceleration of options related to severance. In addition, TerrAscend paid 1,590 in one-time legal settlements during the twelve months ended December 31, 2021. The increase in G A expenses for the twelve months ended December 31, 2021 was partially reduced by a decrease in professional fees from the twelve months ended December 31, 2020 as a result of payments due of 7,500 related to amounts payable to an entity controlled by the minority shareholders of TerrAscend NJ pursuant to services surrounding the 
 63 

granting of certain licenses. Excluding this payment, professional fees increased 5,928 primarily due to legal fees and fees for U.S. filer preparation.

The increase in amortization and depreciation expense for the year ended December 31, 2022 as compared to December 31, 2021 was primarily due to the Gage and Pinnacle Acquisitions. TerrAscend acquired cultivation and processing, as well as retail licenses which are amortized over a 15-year period. 
 The increase in amortization and depreciation expense for the twelve months ended December 31, 2021 as compared to December 31, 2020 is primarily related to additions of property and equipment due to TerrAscend s cultivation expansions and increase in dispensaries in Pennsylvania, New Jersey and California.

During the year ended December 31, 2022, TerrAscend performed an impairment analysis over its indefinite lived and definite lived intangible assets acquired through the Gage Acquisition as the changes in the market expectations of cash flows in Michigan, as well as increased competition and supply in the state, were determined to be indicators of impairment. TerrAscend determined that it was more likely than not that the carrying value of its definite lived retail and cultivation and processing licenses was greater than its fair value, and therefore recorded impairment of 79,462 and 42,065 for the retail license and the cultivation and processing licenses, respectively, reducing both the carrying values to nil at December 31, 2022. Additionally, TerrAscend recorded impairment of its indefinite lived brand intangible assets acquired through the Gage Acquisition of 19,200, reducing the carrying value of the brand intangibles to 57,985 at December 31, 2022. 
 The impairment recorded during the year ended December 31, 2021 relates to the write-off of intellectual property at TerrAscend s Arise business. 
 During the year ended December 31, 2020, TerrAscend recorded impairment of 343 related to its customer relationships at Arise as a result of its termination of an agreement with one of its wholesale distributors.

TerrAscend recognized a gain on revaluation of contingent consideration of 1,061 for the year ended December 31, 2022 as compared to a loss of 3,584 during the year ended December 31, 2021. During the year ended December 31, 2022, the fair value of the contingent consideration related to the KCR Acquisition was reduced to nil, as it was determined that it was more likely than not that the earnout criteria would not be met. 
 The decrease in the revaluation of contingent consideration for the year ended December 31, 2021 as compared to December 31, 2020 is a result of a reduction in the liability as compared to December 31, 2020 due to payments for the earnout of Ilera of 29,668 made subsequent to December 31, 2020, reducing the amount outstanding. This decrease is partially offset by the accretion of contingent consideration payable, which was recorded at the present value of future payments upon initial recognition.

The decrease in tax expense for the year ended December 31, 2022 as compared to December 31, 2021 is primarily related to the pre-tax book loss due to the impairment of goodwill taken during the year ended December 31, 2022. The Company's effective tax rate was 3.5 for the year ended December 31, 2022, as compared to 64.8 for the year ended December 31, 2021. The Company's effective tax rate for the year ended December 31, 2022 was lower than the federal statutory tax rate of 21 primarily driven by the impairment of goodwill and the increase in the valuation allowance. 
 TerrAscend's effective tax rate can vary each reporting period depending on, among other factors, the geographic and business mix of TerrAscend's earnings, changes to the valuation allowance, and permanently non-deductible expenses. Certain of these 
 67 

and other factors, including TerrAscend's history and projections of pre-tax earnings, are considered in assessing TerrAscend's ability to realize any deferred tax assets including net operating losses. 
 The increase in income tax expense for the year ended December 31, 2021 as compared to December 31, 2020 is related to operational scale up.

 Since its inception, TerrAscend's primary sources of capital have been through the issuance of equity securities or debt facilities, and TerrAscend has received aggregate net proceeds from such transactions totaling 608,315 as of December 31, 2022. 
 TerrAscend expects to fund any additional future requirements through the following sources of capital: 
 cash from ongoing operations. 

market offerings. 

additional debt from additional creditors. 

sale of real property. 

sale leaseback transactions. 

exercise of options and warrants.

The contingent consideration is revalued at the end of each reporting period. 
 During the year ended December 31, 2020, TerrAscend expensed 7,500 related to amounts payable to an entity controlled by the minority shareholders of TerrAscend NJ pursuant to services surrounding the granting of certain licenses. The final payment of 3,750 is due on or before March 31, 2023. 
 At December 31, 2022, the Company had accounts payable and accrued liabilities of 44,286 and corporate income taxes payable of 23,077. 
 TerrAscend does not have any off-balance sheet arrangements that have, or are reasonably likely to have, a current or future effect on TerrAscend's results of operations or financial condition, including and without limitation, such consideration as liquidity and capital resources. 
 TerrAscend intends to meet its capital commitments through any or all of the sources of capital noted above. TerrAscend's objective with respect to its capital management is to ensure it has sufficient cash resources to maintain its ongoing operations and finance future obligations.

 On March 15, 2023, WDB Holding PA, in exchange for a fee in the amount of 1 of the then outstanding principal loan balance, agreed to an amendment among other things, to (i) extend the obligation date to prepay TerrAscend's debt from March 15, 2023 to June 30, 2023 in which WDB Holding PA must use commercially reasonable efforts to add additional collateral to the Ilera Term Loan, (ii) increase the amount of debt to be reduced by up to 37,000, subject to certain reductions in amount based on meeting certain time based milestones, at a prepayment price of 103.22 to par, and (iii) extend the next test date in respect of the interest coverage ratio until June 30, 2023. 
 HMS loan 
 The acquisition of HMS included a 2,500 note payable which bears a 5.0 annual interest, due October 2022. The note was recorded at its fair value at inception of 2,089 and subsequently carried at amortized cost. TerrAscend made payments of principal and interest of 2,351, reducing the balance to nil at December 31, 2022 and the note is no longer outstanding. 
 KCR Loan 
 The acquisition of KCR included a 6,750 note payable which bears interest at 10.00 per annum and matures on April 30, 2022. The note was recorded at its fair value at inception and subsequently carried at amortized cost. TerrAscend made payments of principal and interest of 2,324 and 4,878 for the years ended December 31, 2022 and December 31, 2021, respectively. At December 31, 2022, the note is no longer outstanding. 
 Gage Loans 
 The Gage Acquisition included a senior secured term loan (the Original Gage Term Loan with an acquisition date fair value of 53,857. The credit agreement bears interest at a rate equal to the greater of (i) the Prime Rate plus 7 or (ii) 10.25 . The term loan is payable monthly and matures on November 30, 2022. The term loan is secured by a first lien on all Gage assets. 
 On August 10, 2022, the Original Gage Term Loan was amended as a result of the corporate restructure in conjunction with the Gage Acquisition. The amendment to the Original Gage Term Loan includes the addition of a borrower and guarantor under 
 71 

the term loan and a right of first offer in favor of the administrative agent for a refinancing of the term loan. This amendment was not considered extinguishments of debt under ASC 470 Debt . 
 On November 29, 2022, TerrAscend repaid 30,000 outstanding principal amount on the Original Gage Term Loan. On November 30, 2022, the remaining loan principal amount of 25,000 on the Original Gage Term Loan was amended (the Amended Gage Term Loan ). The Amended Gage Term Loan bears interest on 25,000 at a per annum rate equal to the greater of (i) the U.S. prime rate plus 6.00 , and (ii) 13.0 and matures on November 1, 2024. Commencing on May 31, 2023, TerrAscend will make monthly principal repayments of 0.40 of the aggregate principal amount outstanding. Additionally, the unpaid principal amount of the loan shall bear paid in kind interest at a rate of 1.50 per annum. No prepayment fees are owed if TerrAscend voluntarily prepays the loan after 18 months. If such prepayment occurs prior to 18 months, a prepayment fee equal to all of the interest on the loans that would be due after the date of such prepayment, is owed. Under the Amended Gage Term Loan, TerrAscend has the ability to borrow incremental term loans of 30,000 at the option of TerrAscend and subject to consents from the required lenders. The additional 30,000 incremental term loans available under the amendment have not been drawn as of December 31, 2022. This loan represents a loan syndication, and therefore TerrAscend assessed each of the lenders separately under ASC 470 Debt to determine if this represents a modification, or an extinguishment of debt. For three of the four remaining lenders, it was determined that this was a modification. For the remaining lender, it was determined that this represented an extinguishment of debt and therefore the fees paid to the lenders on modification were expensed. As a result of this transaction, TerrAscend expensed 1,907 of fees paid to the lenders and third parties as they did not meet the criteria for capitalization under ASC 470 Debt . 
 Additionally, the Gage Acquisition included a loan payable to a former owner of a licensed entity with an acquisition date fair value of 2,683, and a promissory note with an acquisition date fair value of 4,065. The loan payable to the former owner bears interest at a rate of 0.2 . The promissory note bears interest at a rate of 6 . There is 5,152 of principal amounts outstanding at December 31, 2022 on the loan payable and promissory note. 
 Pinnacle Loans 
 The Pinnacle Acquisition purchase price included two promissory notes in an aggregate amount of 10,000 to pay down all Pinnacle liabilities and encumbrances. The promissory note matures on June 30, 2023 and bears interest rates of 6 . There is 9,333 of principal amounts outstanding at December 31, 2022 on the two promissory notes. 
 Pelorus Term Loan 
 On October 11, 2022, subsidiaries of TerrAscend, among others, entered into a loan agreement with Pelorus Fund REIT, LLC Pelorus for a single-draw senior secured term loan Pelorus Term Loan in an aggregate principal amount of 45,478. The Pelorus Term Loan bears interest at a variable rate tied to the one month secured overnight financing rate (SOFR), subject to a base rate, plus 9.5 , with interest-only payments for the first 36 months. The base rate is defined as, on any day, the greatest of (i) 2.5 , (b) the effective federal funds rate in effect on such day plus 0.5 , and (c) one month SOFR in effect on such day. The obligations of the borrowers under the Pelorus Term Loan are guaranteed by TerrAscend, TerrAscend USA Inc. and certain other subsidiaries of TerrAscend and secured by substantially all of the assets of TerrAscend's Maryland and New Jersey businesses, including certain real estate in Maryland and New Jersey. The Pelorus Term Loan matures on October 11, 2027. There is 45,478 of principal amounts outstanding at December 31, 2022.

(31,815) 

(36,971) 

The decrease in cash used in operating activities for the year ended December 31, 2022 as compared to December 31, 2021 is primarily due to a decrease in income taxes paid from 37,060 during the year ended December 31, 2021 to 9,917 for the year ended December 31, 2022, as well as a decrease in contingent consideration payments made related to TerrAscend's acquisitions in excess of the fair value of the liability recognized at the date of acquisition from 11,394 during the year ended December 31, 2021 to 410 during the year ended December 31, 2022. Excluding these amounts, TerrAscend had net cash 
 72 

used in operating activities of 15,795 for the year ended December 31, 2022 as compared to net cash provided by operating activities of 16,639 for the year ended December 31, 2021. Additionally the increase in net cash used in operating activities for the year ended December 31, 2022 as compared to December 31, 2021 is due to an increase in loss from operations, excluding non-cash impairment on intangible assets and goodwill, of 56,381 from a profit of 31,550 in the prior year period to a loss of 24,831 in the current year. The decrease in cash used in operating activities is offset by an increase in interest payments made on loans from 21,171 for the year ended December 31, 2021 to 26,840 for the year ended December 31, 2022, primarily due to the loans acquired through the Gage Acquisition and the Pinnacle Acquisition. 
 The decrease in cash used in operating activities for the year ended December 31, 2021 as compared to December 31, 2020, is primarily due to payments made in excess of the amount of fair value of the contingent consideration payable at the date of the Ilera acquisition on September 16, 2019 of 11,394 for the year ended December 31, 2021 as compared to payments of 56,527 during the year ended December 31, 2020. Excluding these amounts, TerrAscend had net cash used in operating activities of 20,421 and cash provided by operating activities of 19,556 for the years ended December 31, 2021 and December 31, 2020, respectively. The increase in cash used in operating activities during the year ended December 31, 2021 is mainly the result of income tax payments of 37,060 during the year ended December 31, 2021, as compared to 11,204 during the year ended December 31, 2020, and interest payments of 21,171 during the year ended December 31, 2021, as compared to 1,955 during the year ended December 31, 2020. The increase in interest payments is primarily due to the Ilera term loan in which TerrAscend received proceeds during December 2020. Excluding these payments, TerrAscend saw an increase in cash provided by operating activities during the year ended December 31, 2021, which is primarily due to increased sales.

3,719 

182,201 

133,251 

Net cash provided by financing activities for the year ended December 31, 2022 was primarily due to loan proceeds in the amount of 43,419 and proceeds from exercises of Common Share warrants and stock options of 24,342. The cash provided by financing activities was offset by principal payments on loans and loan modification fees of 42,221 and 4,977, respectively, payments made to non-controlling interests of 7,550, and payments of contingent consideration related to the acquisition of State Flower of 6,630. 
 Net cash provided by financing activities for the twelve months ended December 31, 2021, was mainly a result of the private placement on January 28, 2021, in which TerrAscend issued 18,115,656 Common Shares at a price of 9.64 (C 12.35) per 
 73 

Common Share for total proceeds of 173,477, net of share issuance costs of 1,643. Additionally, during the twelve months ended December 31, 2021, 8,755,339 Common Share warrants were exercised for total proceeds of 21,735 and 1,376,496 stock options were exercised at 0.67- 6.93 (C 0.85- 8.52) per unit for total gross proceeds of 5,462. In addition, 1,968 Preferred Share warrants were exercised at 3,000 per unit for total gross proceeds of 3,588. The cash provided by financing activities was offset by payments of contingent consideration related to the acquisition of Ilera of 18,274 and by payments of loan principal of 4,500 related to the KCR loan. 
 Net cash provided by financing activities during the year ended December 31, 2020, was primarily due to loan proceeds in the amount of 196,348 and proceeds from private placements net of share issuance costs of 71,023. Additionally, 829,050 Common Share warrants were exercised for total gross proceeds of 2,075 and 1,816,496 stock options were exercised at 0.43- 6.52 per unit for total gross proceeds of 4,462. In addition, 625 Preferred Share warrants were exercised at 3,000 per unit for total gross proceeds of 750. The cash provided by financing activities was partially offset by payments of contingent consideration of 90,657 to the sellers of Ilera, as well as payments of principal on TerrAscend s outstanding loans of 48,893 to pay off the remaining balance of the JW Asset Management credit facility, a financing loan in Canada, and the loans from management of Ilera. 
 Reconciliation of Non-GAAP Measures 
 In addition to reporting the financial results in accordance with GAAP, TerrAscend reports certain financial results that differ from what is reported under GAAP. Non-GAAP measures used by management do not have any standardized meaning prescribed by GAAP and may not be comparable to similar measures presented by other companies. TerrAscend believes that certain investors and analysts use these measures to measure a company s ability to meet other payment obligations or as a common measurement to value companies in the cannabis industry, and TerrAscend calculates (i) Adjusted gross profit as gross profit adjusted for certain material non-cash items, and (ii) Adjusted EBITDA as EBITDA adjusted for certain material non-cash items and certain other adjustments which management believes are not reflective of the ongoing operations and performance. Such information is intended to provide additional information and should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for measures of performance prepared in accordance with GAAP. 
 TerrAscend believes Adjusted EBITDA from continuing operations is a useful performance measure to assess the performance of TerrAscend as it provides more meaningful ongoing operating results by excluding the effects of expenses that are not reflective of TerrAscend s underlying business performance and other one-time or non-recurring expenses. The table below reconciles net loss to EBITDA from continuing operations and Adjusted EBITDA from continuing operations for the years ended December 31, 2022, December 31, 2021 and December 31, 2020:

76 

The decrease in Adjusted EBITDA from continuing operations for the year ended December 31, 2022 as compared to December 31, 2021 was primarily due to lower volume and resulting gross margin compression mainly related to challenging market dynamics in Pennsylvania. 
 The increase in Adjusted EBITDA from continuing operations for year ended December 31, 2021 as compared to December 31, 2020 was primarily due to operational scale up, as well as TerrAscend s acquisitions of KCR and HMS. TerrAscend continued to expand in the United States organically through an increase in production and wholesale capacity in Pennsylvania, store expansions in Pennsylvania, New Jersey, and California, and operations in New Jersey and Maryland. 
 Changes in or Adoption of Accounting Principles 
 New standards, amendments and interpretations adopted: 
 TerrAscend adopted certain accounting and reporting standards during the year ended December 31, 2022. Information regarding TerrAscend s adoption of new accounting and reporting standards is discussed in Note 2 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements included in Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. 
 Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates 
 The preparation of TerrAscend s consolidated financial statements requires management to make judgments, estimates and assumptions about the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. The estimates and assumptions are based on historical experience and other factors that are considered relevant. Actual results may differ from these estimates. 
 While TerrAscend s significant accounting policies are described in more detail in Note 2 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements included in Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data in this Annual Report on the Form 10-K, the accounting estimates and assumptions discussed in this section are those that TerrAscend considers to be the most critical in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements. An accounting estimate or assumption is considered critical if both (a) the nature of the estimate or assumption is material due to the levels of subjectivity and judgement involved, and (b) the impact within a reasonable range of outcomes of the estimate and assumption is material to the financial condition. 
 A quantitative sensitivity analysis is provided where information is available to reasonably estimate the impact and provides material information to investors. 
 Inventory 
 The net realizable value of inventory represents the estimated selling price in the ordinary course of business less the reasonably predictable costs of completion, disposal and transportation. TerrAscend estimates the net realizable value of inventories, taking into account the most reliable evidence available at each reporting date. The determination of net realizable value requires significant judgment, including consideration of factors such as shrinkage, the aging of and future demand for inventory, expected future selling price TerrAscend expects to realize by selling the inventory, and the contractual arrangements with customers. Reserves for excess and obsolete inventory are based upon quantities on hand, projected volumes from demand forecasts and net realizable value. The future realization of these inventories may be affected by market-driven changes that may reduce future selling prices. A change to these assumptions could impact TerrAscend s inventory valuation and gross profit. 
 Revenue recognition 
 Revenues consist of wholesale and retail sales, which are recognized when control of the goods has transferred to the purchaser and the collectability is reasonably assured. 
 From time to time, TerrAscend partakes in sales agreements with suppliers in which it also purchases inventory. As part of the five-step revenue model, TerrAscend assesses whether instances of bulk sales made to suppliers of goods have commercial substance and should be recognized as revenue under ASC 606 Revenue Recognition , or whether the transaction should be assessed under ASC 845 Nonmonetary Transactions. The determination of whether the sale has commercial substance requires management s judgment. 
 77 

Share-based compensation 
 In calculating share-based compensation, key estimates are used such as, the rate of forfeiture of options granted, the expected life of the option, the volatility of TerrAscend s stock price, the vesting period of the option and the risk-free interest rate. The fair value of each option grant is estimated using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model. While assumptions used to calculate and account for share-based compensation awards represent management s best estimates, these estimates involve inherent uncertainties and the application of management s judgment. As a result, if revisions are made to the underlying assumptions and estimates, share based compensation expense could vary significantly from period to period. TerrAscend recognized share-based compensation expense of 12,162, 14,942, and 10,475 for the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021, and 2020, respectively. 
 Warrant Liability 
 TerrAscend uses the Black-Scholes model to calculate the fair value of the warrants issued, which includes various unobservable inputs such as the volatility of TerrAscend s stock price and the risk-free interest rate. TerrAscend uses judgment to select methods used and in performing the fair value calculations at the initial measurement at issuance, as well as for subsequent measurement on a recurring basis. The assumptions could have a material impact on the valuation of the warrant liability. The warrant liability was remeasured to fair value at 711 and 54,986 at December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. An increase of 50 basis points to the discount rate and volatility would not have a material impact. 
 Income taxes 
 The extent to which deferred tax assets can be recognized is based on an assessment of the probability of TerrAscend generating future taxable income against which the deferred tax assets can be utilized. In addition, significant judgment is required in classifying transactions and assessing probable outcomes of tax positions taken, and in assessing the impact of any legal or economic limits or uncertainties in various tax jurisdictions. 
 Provisions for taxes are made using the best estimate of the amount expected to be paid based on a qualitative assessment of all relevant factors. TerrAscend reviews the adequacy of these provisions at the end of the reporting period. It is possible, however, that at some future date, an additional liability could result from audits by taxing authorities. If the final outcome of these tax-related matters is different from the amounts that were initially recorded, such differences will affect the tax provisions in the period in which such determination is made. 
 Impairment of long-lived assets 
 TerrAscend evaluates the recoverability of long-lived assets, including property and equipment, right of use ROU assets, and definite lived intangible assets, whether events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of the asset, or asset group, may not be recoverable. 
 When TerrAscend determines that the carrying value of the long-lived asset may not be recoverable based upon the existence of one or more of the indicators, the assets are assessed for impairment based on the estimate of future undiscounted cash flows expected to result from the use of the asset and its eventual disposition. If the carrying value of an asset exceeds its estimated future undiscounted cash flows, an impairment loss is recorded for the excess of the asset s carrying value over its fair value. Management judgement is required in the determination of indicators of impairment, as well as the estimation of future undiscounted cash flows, and as necessary, the fair value of those assets or asset groups in which indicators of impairment have been identified. 
 During the year ended December 31, 2022, TerrAscend determined that changes in market expectations of cash flows in its Michigan business, as well as increased competition and supply in the state, were indicators that an impairment test was appropriate for the Michigan reporting unit. TerrAscend determines the fair value of the asset group and allocates the impairment to the assets, being the (i) cultivation and processing licenses, and (ii) retail licenses, acquired through the Gage Acquisition. TerrAscend compared the carrying value of the assets to its fair value and determined that the carrying value exceeded the fair value for both the retail and the cultivation and processing licenses. As such, TerrAscend recorded impairment charges of 79,462 and 42,065 for the cultivation and processing licenses and retail licenses, respectively, reducing both the carrying values to nil. 
 TerrAscend recorded impairment of 423 of intellectual property in Canada during the year ended December 31, 2020 related to packaging designs that were written down to its recoverable value. Additionally, during the year ended December 31, 2020, TerrAscend recorded impairment of 342 related to its customer relationships at Arise as a result of its termination of an agreement with one of its wholesale distributors. 
 78 

TerrAscend recorded impairment of property and equipment of 1,089, 312, and 6 for the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021, and 2020, respectively. 
 Impairment of goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets 
 Goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets are reviewed for impairment annually and whenever there are events or changes in circumstances that indicate the carrying amount has been impaired. Definite lived intangible assets are tested for impairment when there are indications that an asset may be impaired. If it is determined that it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit exceeds its carrying value, additional quantitative impairment testing is performed which compares the carrying value of the reporting unit to its estimated fair value. 
 TerrAscend uses an income-based approach as necessary to assess the fair values of intangible assets and its reporting units for goodwill testing purposes. Under the income approach, fair value is based on the present value of estimated cash flows. An impaired asset is written down to its estimated fair value based on the most recent information available. 
 Fair value is determined as the amount that would be obtained from the sale of the asset in an arm s length transaction between knowledgeable and willing parties. Determining the value in use requires TerrAscend to estimate expected future cash flows associated with the assets and a suitable discount rate in order to calculate present value. A number of factors, including historical results, business plans, forecasts, and market data are used to determine the fair value of the reporting unit and intangible assets. 
 TerrAscend s impairment loss calculation contains uncertainties because it requires management to make assumptions and apply judgement to qualitative factors as well as estimate future cash flows and asset fair values, including forecasting projected financial information and selecting the discount rate that reflects the risk inherent in future cash flows. If actual results are not consistent with TerrAscend s estimates and assumptions, TerrAscend may be exposed to non-cash impairment losses that could be material. 
 2022 
 During the year ended December 31, 2022, TerrAscend determined that the existence of impairment on certain long-lived assets, together with changes in market expectations of cash flows in Michigan, as well as increased competition and supply in the state since TerrAscend acquired the indefinite lived assets, indicate that the fair value of the Gage brand intangible assets are more likely than not lower than the carrying value. As such, TerrAscend performed an impairment analysis and determined the fair value of its brand intangible assets using the relief of royalty method. As a result of the quantitative analysis performed, TerrAscend recognized impairment of 19,200, reducing the carrying value of the brand intangibles to 57,985. 
 Based on the indicators of impairment noted previously, TerrAscend determined that there were indicators that the fair value of its reporting units are more likely than not lower than its carrying value. As such, a quantitative impairment test was performed over its Michigan reporting unit, which includes goodwill acquired through the Gage Acquisition and the Pinnacle Acquisition, its Pennsylvania reporting unit, and its California wholesale reporting unit. As a result of the impairment analysis performed over its Michigan reporting unit, TerrAscend recorded impairment of goodwill of 170,357 during the year ended December 31, 2022, reducing the carrying value of the goodwill acquired through the Gage Acquisition and Pinnacle Acquisition to nil. 
 
 TerrAscend determined that the challenging market dynamics in Pennsylvania, including increased competition, were indicators of impairment for the Pennsylvania reporting unit and therefore TerrAscend performed a quantitative impairment analysis. As a result of the impairment analysis performed over the Pennsylvania reporting unit, TerrAscend determined that the fair value of the Pennsylvania reporting unit exceeded its carrying value, resulting in no impairment. The carrying value of the goodwill attributable to the Pennsylvania reporting unit was 76,761 at December 31, 2022. 

TerrAscend determined that increased competition and a reduction in forecasted sales, were indicators of impairment for the California wholesale reporting unit and therefore TerrAscend performed a quantitative impairment analysis. As a result of the impairment analysis performed over TerrAscend's California wholesale reporting unit, it was determined that the fair value of the California reporting unit exceeded its carrying value, resulting in no impairment. The carrying value of the goodwill attributable to the California wholesale reporting unit was 4,689 at December 31, 2022. 
 
 2021 
 During the year ended December 31, 2021, TerrAscend made a decision to undertake a strategic review process to explore, review, and evaluate potential alternatives for its Arise business. TerrAscend also determined that the estimated future cash 
 79 

flows for the business did not support the carrying value of the intangible assets and goodwill, and therefore, the intangible assets and goodwill were written down to nil. TerrAscend recorded impairment of intangible assets of 3,633 and impairment of goodwill of 5,007. 
 During the fourth quarter of 2021, TerrAscend performed qualitative analyses over its goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets for each of its reporting units. TerrAscend determined that it was more likely than not that the fair value of its California and Maryland reporting units exceeded their carrying values, and therefore, no quantitative impairment analysis was performed. TerrAscend performed a quantitative analysis over its Pennsylvania reporting unit and determined that the fair value exceeded its carrying value, resulting in no impairment. An increase of the discount rate of 100 basis points would not cause an impairment. There is no goodwill or indefinite lived intangible assets at TerrAscend s Canada reporting unit. 
 2020 
 During the year ended December 31, 2020, TerrAscend performed qualitative analyses over its goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets for each of its reporting units and determined that it was more likely than not that the fair value of its California and Pennsylvania reporting units exceeded their carrying values, and therefore, no quantitative analyses was performed. TerrAscend performed a quantitative analysis over its Florida reporting unit and determined that the fair value exceeded its carrying value, resulting in no impairment. An increase in the discount rate of 100 basis points would not cause an impairment. 
 Business combinations 
 Classification of an acquisition as a business combination or an asset acquisition depends on whether the asset acquire constitutes a business, which can be a complex judgement. TerrAscend has determined that its acquisitions in Note 4 are business combinations under ASC 805 Business Combinations . 
 In a business combination, substantially all identifiable assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities acquired are recorded at the date of acquisition at their respective fair values. One of the most significant areas of judgment and estimation relates to the determination of the fair value of these assets and liabilities, including the fair value of contingent consideration, if applicable. If any intangible assets are identified, depending on the type of intangible asset and the complexity of determining its fair value, TerrAscend may utilize an independent external valuation expert to develop the fair value, using appropriate valuation techniques, which are generally based on a forecast of the total expected future net cash flows. These valuations are linked closely to the assumptions made by management regarding the future performance of the assets concerned and any changes in the discount rate applied. 
 The estimates are based upon assumptions that TerrAscend believes are reasonable, but which are inherently uncertain and unpredictable. These valuations require the use of management s assumptions, which do not reflect unanticipated events and circumstances that may occur. 
 Contingent Consideration 
 Contingent consideration payable as the result of a business combination is recorded at the date of acquisition at fair value. The fair value of contingent consideration is subject to significant judgement and estimates, such as projected future revenue. Subsequent changes to the fair value of contingent consideration are measured at each reporting date, with changes recognized through profit or loss. Refer to Note 21 included in Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for the sensitivity analysis performed over the contingent consideration liability. 
 ERC 
 The CARES Act provides for an employee retention credit ERC which is a refundable tax credit for businesses that continued to pay employees while shut down due to the COVID-19 pandemic, or had significant declines in gross receipts from March 13, 2020 to December 31, 2021. Eligible employers can claim the ERC on an original or adjusted employment tax return for a period within those dates. TerrAscend has elected to account for the credit as a government grant. There is limited grant accounting guidance within U.S. GAAP that is applicable to for-profit entities, therefore, TerrAscend has elected to follow the grant accounting model in International Accounting Standard IAS 20, Accounting for Government Grants and Disclosure of Government Assistance. Accordingly, TerrAscend recognizes government grants for which there is a reasonable assurance of compliance with grant conditions and receipt of credits and has therefore recognized a receivable for the total credit amount on the consolidated balance sheets as of December 31, 2022. The determination of the collectability of the ERC requires significant judgement, including assessment of TerrAscend's eligibility based on the facts and circumstances. While TerrAscend believes that collection of the ERC is probable, there is some uncertainty around collection due to the nature of TerrAscend's industry. 
 80 

During the year ended December 31, 2022, TerrAscend has an ERC for qualified wages of 14,903 which was included in accounts receivable, net in the consolidated balance sheets at December 31, 2022. TerrAscend recognized other income of 9,440 as a result of this transaction which was recorded as other income and included in finance and other expenses on the consolidated statements of operations. Additionally, TerrAscend recorded accounts receivable in its opening balance sheet related to the acquisition of Gage of 5,463 related to ERC. 
 Incremental borrowing rates 
 Lease payments are discounted using the rate implicit in the lease if that rate is readily available. If that rate cannot be easily determined, the lessee is required to use its incremental borrowing rate. The incremental borrowing rate is the rate of interest that TerrAscend estimates it would have to pay on a collateralized basis to borrow an amount equal to the lease payments under similar terms. TerrAscend calculates its incremental borrowing rate as the interest rate TerrAscend would pay to borrow funds necessary to obtain an asset of similar value over similar terms taking into consideration the economic factors and the credit risk rating at the commencement date of the lease. 
 In addition, TerrAscend utilizes a discount rate to determine the appropriate fair value of convertible debentures and loans issued with warrants attached. The discount rate applied reflects the interest rate that TerrAscend would have to pay to borrow a similar amount at a similar term and with a similar security. 
 Control, joint control or level of influence 
 When determining the appropriate basis of accounting for TerrAscend s interests in affiliates, TerrAscend makes judgments about the degree of influence that it exerts directly or through an arrangement over the investees relevant activities. 
 Emerging Growth Company Status 
 TerrAscend is an emerging growth company, as defined in the Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act of 2012 (the JOBS Act ). Under the JOBS Act, emerging growth companies can delay adopting new or revised accounting standards issued subsequent to the enactment of the JOBS Act until such time as those standards apply to private companies. TerrAscend has elected to use this extended transition period for complying with new or revised accounting standards that have different effective dates for public and private companies until the earlier of the date that TerrAscend (i) is no longer an emerging growth company or (ii) affirmatively and irrevocably opts out of the extended transition period provided in the JOBS Act. As a result, TerrAscend s consolidated financial statements may not be comparable to companies that comply with the new or revised accounting pronouncements as of public company effective dates. 
 TerrAscend will remain an emerging growth company until the earlier to occur of: (i) (a) December 31, 2027, (b) the last day of the fiscal year in which TerrAscend has total annual gross revenue of 1.235 billion or more, or (c) the last day of the fiscal year in which TerrAscend is deemed to be a large accelerated filer, which means the market value of TerrAscend s voting and non-voting common equity that is held by non-affiliates exceeds 700.0 million as of the prior June 30th; and (ii) the date on which TerrAscend has issued more than 1.0 billion in non-convertible debt during the prior three-year period. 
 Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitati ve Disclosures About Market Risk 
 Market risk represents the risk of loss that may impact TerrAscend s financial position due to adverse changes in financial market prices and rates. TerrAscend s market risk exposure is primarily a result of exposure due to potential changes in inflation and interest rates. TerrAscend does not hold financial instruments for trading purposes. 
 Financial Instruments and Risk Management 
 Financial instruments recorded at fair value are estimated by applying a fair value hierarchy, which prioritizes the inputs used to measure fair value into three levels and bases the categorization within the hierarchy upon the lowest level of input that is available and significant to the fair value measurement. The hierarchy is summarized as follows: 
 Level 1- quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets and liabilities 
 Level 2- inputs other than quoted prices that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly (prices) or indirectly (derived from prices) from observable market data 
 Level 3- inputs for assets and liabilities not based upon observable market data 
 Risk Management 
 81 

TerrAscend s risk exposure and the impact on TerrAscend s financial instruments are summarized below: 
 (a) Credit risk 
 Credit risk is the risk of financial loss to TerrAscend if a customer or counterparty to a financial instrument fails to meet its contractual obligations. Financial instruments that potentially subject TerrAscend to significant concentrations of credit risk consist principally of cash and cash equivalents, accounts receivable, net and notes receivable. TerrAscend assesses the credit risk of trade receivables by evaluating the aging of trade receivables based on the invoice date. The carrying amounts of trade receivables is reduced through the use of an allowance account and the amount of the loss is recognized in the consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive loss. When a trade receivable balance is considered uncollectible, it is written off against the allowance for expected credit losses. 
 Subsequent recoveries of amounts previously written off are credited against operating expenses in the consolidated statements of operations. TerrAscend regularly monitors credit risk exposure and takes steps to mitigate the likelihood of these exposures resulting in actual loss. TerrAscend has no customers whose balance is greater than 10 of total trade receivables as of December 31, 2022. 
 (b) Liquidity risk 
 TerrAscend is exposed to liquidity risk, or the risk that TerrAscend will not be able to meet its financial obligations as they become due. TerrAscend manages liquidity risk through ongoing review of its capital requirements. TerrAscend s objective with respect to its capital management is to ensure it has sufficient cash resources to maintain its ongoing operations. 
 (c) Market Risk 
 The significant market risk exposures to which TerrAscend is exposed are foreign currency risk and interest rate risk. 
 i)	Foreign currency risk: 
 Foreign currency risk is the risk that a variation in exchange rates between the Canadian dollar and U.S. dollar and other foreign currencies will affect TerrAscend s operations and financial results. 
 TerrAscend and its subsidiaries hold cash and cash equivalents and other assets and liabilities in currencies other than their functional currency. TerrAscend does not currently engage in currency hedging activities to limit the risks of currency fluctuations. Consequently, fluctuations in foreign currencies could have a negative impact on the profitability of TerrAscend's operations. A 10 change in the value of the U.S. dollar compared to the Canadian dollar would result in a change of 2,389 to the unrealized foreign exchange loss (gain). 
 ii)	Interest rate risk: 
 Interest rate risk is the risk that future cash flows will fluctuate as a result of changes in market interest rates. In respect of financial assets, TerrAscend s policy is to invest excess cash at floating rates of interest in cash equivalents, in order to maintain liquidity, while achieving a satisfactory return. Fluctuations in interest rates impact the value of cash equivalents. TerrAscend s investments in guaranteed investment certificates bear a fixed rate and are cashable at any time prior to maturity date. 
 TerrAscend does not have significant cash equivalents at year. The Amended Gage Term Loan and the Pelorus Term Loan have variable interest rates that are tied to the U.S. prime rate and SOFR. At December 31, 2022, a 10 change to each of the interest rates would result in a change to interest expense of 1,295. The remainder of TerrAscend s loans payable have fixed interest rates from 6 to 12.875 per annum. All other financial liabilities are non-interest-bearing instruments.

Item 9A. Controls and Procedures 
 Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures 
 Internal control over financial reporting is defined in Rule 13a-15(f) promulgated under the Exchange Act, as a process designed by, or under the supervision of, TerrAscend s principal executive officer and principal financial officer and effected by TerrAscend s board of directors, management and other personnel, to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. TerrAscend s management, with the participation of its President and Chief Financial Officer, has evaluated the effectiveness of TerrAscend's disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act, as of the end of the period covered by this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Based upon that evaluation, management, including the President and Chief Financial Officer, determined that TerrAscend s disclosure controls and procedures were effective at the reasonable assurance level as of December 31, 2022. 
 Management has excluded Michigan from its assessment of internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2022 because Gage and Pinnacle were acquired by the Company on March 10, 2022 and August 23, 2022, respectively. Michigan's total assets and total revenues represent 15 and 25 , respectively, of the related consolidated financial statement amounts as of and for the year ended December 31, 2022. 
 Limitations on Effectiveness of Controls and Procedures 
 In designing and evaluating TerrAscend s disclosure controls and procedures, management recognizes that any controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving the desired control objectives. In addition, the design of disclosure controls and procedures must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints and that management is required to apply judgment in evaluating the benefits of possible controls and procedures relative to their costs. 
 Management s Annual Report on Internal Controls Over Financial Reporting 
 TerrAscend s management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting, as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) of the Exchange Act. TerrAscend s management, under the supervision and with the participation of its President and Chief Financial Officer, conducted an assessment of the effectiveness of TerrAscend s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2022 based on criteria established in Internal Control-Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO) (2013 framework). This evaluation included review of the documentation of controls, evaluation of the design effectiveness of controls, testing of the operating effectiveness of controls and a conclusion on this evaluation. Based on the results of its assessment, TerrAscend s management concluded that its internal control over financial reporting was effective as of December 31, 2022. 
 This Annual Report does not include an attestation report of TerrAscend s independent registered public accounting firm regarding the effectiveness of its internal control over financial reporting due to its exemption as an emerging growth company. Management s report was not subject to audit by TerrAscend s registered public accounting firm pursuant to rules of the Securities and Exchange Commission that permit TerrAscend to provide only management s report in this Annual Report. 
 Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting 
 There have been no changes to TerrAscend s internal controls over financial reporting (as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d 15(f) under the Exchange Act) that occurred during the year ended December 31, 2022, that materially affected, or were reasonably likely to materially affect, TerrAscend's internal controls over financial reporting.

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM 
 To the Board of Directors and Shareholders of TerrAscend Corp. 
 Opinion on the Consolidated Financial Statements 
 We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of TerrAscend Corp. (the Company) as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, and the related consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive income (loss), changes in shareholders equity (deficit), and cash flows, for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2022, including the related notes (collectively referred to as the consolidated financial statements ). 
 In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years ended December 31, 2022, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. 
 Material Uncertainty Related to Going Concern 
 The accompanying consolidated financial statements have been prepared assuming that the Company will continue as a going concern. As discussed in Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company has suffered losses from operations, reoccurring net cash used in operating activities and has a net capital deficiency that raise substantial doubt about its ability to continue as a going concern. Management's plans in regard to these matters are also described in Note 2. The consolidated financial statements do not include any adjustments that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty. 
 Basis for Opinion 
 These consolidated financial statements are the responsibility of the Company s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company s consolidated financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB) and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. 
 We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. The Company is not required to have, nor were we engaged to perform, an audit of its internal control over financial reporting. As part of our audits, we are required to obtain an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Company s internal control over financial reporting. Accordingly, we express no such opinion. 
 Our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the consolidated financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the consolidated financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.

Assets in process are transferred to the appropriate asset type when available for use and depreciation of the assets commences at that point. The Company classified assets and liabilities (the disposal group as held for sale in the period when all of the relevant criteria to be classified as held for sale are met. Long-lived assets held for sale are recorded at their estimated fair value less costs to sell. Any loss resulting from the measurement is recognized in the period the held for sale criteria is met. The Company discontinues depreciation on these assets. An asset s residual value, useful life and depreciation method are reviewed annually, or when events or circumstances indicate that the current estimate or depreciation method are no longer applicable. Changes are adjusted prospectively if appropriate. Gains and losses on disposal of an asset are determined by comparing the proceeds from disposal with the carrying amount of the items and are recognized in the consolidated statements of operations. If a loss on disposal is expected, such losses are recognized when the assets are reclassified as assets held for sale or when impaired as part of an asset group s impairment. The Company evaluates the recoverability of property and equipment and long-lived assets held for sale, whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of the asset or asset group may not be recoverable. See Impairment of long-lived assets information within this note for detailed information on the Company s impairment assessment of its property and equipment. The Company capitalizes interest and borrowing costs on significant qualifying capital construction projects. Upon the asset becoming available for use, capitalization of borrowing costs ceases, and depreciation commences on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful life of the related asset. 
 to . Additionally, the Company h as finance leases at December 31, 2022 and finance lease at December 31, 2021. The lease periods for finance leases range from months to . The Company s leases include fixed payments, as well as in some cases, scheduled base rent increases over the term of the lease. Certain leases require variable payments of common area maintenance, operating expenses, and real estate taxes applicable to the property. Variable payments are excluded from the measurements of lease liabilities and are expensed as incurred. Any tenant improvement allowances received from the lessor are recorded as a reduction to rent expense over the term of the lease. None of the Company s lease agreements contained residual value guarantees or material restrictive covenants. The Company determines if an arrangement is a lease at the inception of the contract. Lease liabilities are recognized at the commencement date based on the present value of lease payments over the lease term for those arrangements where there is an identified asset and the contract conveys the right to control its use. The right-of-use ROU asset is measured at the initial amount of the lease liability, adjusted for lease payments made at or before the lease commencement date, and initial direct costs. For operating leases, right-of-use assets are reduced over the lease term by the straight-line expense recognized, less the amount of accretion of the lease liability determined using the effective interest rate method. Finance leases are included in property and equipment in the Consolidated Balance Sheets. Operating lease expense is recognized on a straight-line basis over the lease term and is included in cost of sales and general and administrative expense in the Company s Consolidated Statements of Operations and Comprehensive Loss. Finance lease cost includes amortization, which is recognized on a straight-line basis over the expected life of the lease asset, and interest expense, which is recognized following an effective interest rate method and is included in finance and other expenses in the Company s Consolidated Statements of Operations. The Company applies a single discount rate to a portfolio of leases with reasonably similar characteristics. The majority of the Company s leases do not provide an implicit rate that can be easily determined, and therefore uses its incremental borrowing rate and the information available at the commencement date (refer to Note 10). or the lease at the Company s discretion. The Company regularly evaluates lease renewal and termination options and, when they are reasonably certain of exercise, includes the renewal or termination option in the lease term. The Company evaluates its ROU assets for impairment consistent with its impairment of long-lived assets. See Impairment of long-lived assets information within this note for detailed information on the Company s impairment assessment of its right-of-use assets. In some instances, the Company subleases excess office space to third party tenants. The Company, as sublessor, continues to account for the head lease. If the lease cost for the term of the sublease exceeds the Company s anticipated sublease income for the same period, this indicates that the right-of-use asset associated with the head lease should be assessed for impairment under the long-lived asset impairment provisions. Sublease income is included in Finance (expense) income in the Company s Consolidated Statements of Operations. The Company accounts for non-lease and lease components to which they relate as a single lease component. Additionally, the Company recognized lease payments under short-term leases with an initial term of twelve months or less, as well as low value assets, as an expense on a straight-line basis over the lease term without recognizing the lease liability and ROU asset. 
 Goodwill is recorded at the time of acquisition and represents the excess of the aggregate consideration paid for an acquisition over the fair value of the net tangible and intangible assets acquired. Goodwill is not subject to amortization and is tested for impairment on an annual basis or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that they might be impaired. See Impairment of goodwill and intangible assets information within this note for detailed information on the Company s impairment assessment of its goodwill and intangible assets.

 operating segment. For the purposes of testing goodwill, the Company has identified reporting units. The Company analyzed its reporting units by first reviewing the operating statements based on geographic areas in which the Company conducts business (or each market). The Company s reporting units to which goodwill has been assigned include Michigan, Pennsylvania, California- wholesale, California- retail, Florida, Maryland, and Canada. Goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets are reviewed for impairment annually and whenever there are events or changes in circumstances that indicate the carrying amount has been impaired. In performing the qualitative assessment, the Company considers many factors in evaluating whether the carrying value of goodwill may not be recoverable. If, based on the results of the qualitative assessment, it is determined that it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit exceeds its carrying value, additional quantitative impairment testing is performed which compares the carrying value of the reporting unit to its estimated fair value. If the carrying value exceeds the estimated fair value, an impairment is recorded. Definite lived intangible assets are tested for impairment when there are indications that an asset may be impaired. When indicators of impairment exist, the Company performs a quantitative impairment test which compares the carrying value of the assets for intangibles and reporting unit for goodwill to their estimated fair values. If the carrying value exceeds the estimated fair value, an impairment is recorded. 
 future undiscounted cash flows, an impairment loss is recorded for the excess of the asset s carrying value over its estimated fair value. 

Non-controlling interests NCI represents equity interests owned by outside parties. NCI may be initially measured at fair value or at the NCI s proportionate share of the recognized amounts of the acquiree s identifiable net assets. The Company elected to measure acquired NCI at its fair value as of the acquisition date (refer to Note 2x(viii)). 

The Company evaluates and accounts for conversion options embedded in convertible instruments in accordance with ASC 815 Derivatives and Hedging Activities . Companies are required to bifurcate conversion options from their host instrument and account for them as free-standing derivative financial instruments according to certain criteria. The criteria includes circumstances in which (a) the economic characteristics and risks of the embedded derivative instrument are not clearly and closely related to the economic characteristics and risks of the host contract, (b) the hybrid instrument that embodies both the embedded derivative instrument and the host contract is not remeasured at fair value under GAAP with changes in fair value reported in earnings as they occur, and (c) a separate instrument with the same terms as the embedded derivative instrument would be considered a derivative instrument. The Company accounts for convertible instruments (when it has been determined that the embedded conversion options should not be bifurcated from their host instruments) as follows: the Company records, when necessary, discounts to convertible notes for the intrinsic value of conversion options embedded in debt instruments based upon the differences between the fair value of the underlying common stock at the commitment date of the note transaction and the effective conversion price embedded in the note. Debt discounts under these arrangements are amortized over the term of the related debt to their stated date of redemption. The Company issued convertible debentures with detachable share purchase warrants at various times to raise capital to expand its business and support general corporate needs. The convertible instruments also included embedded derivatives in the form of conversion features and put options. Management evaluated the convertible debentures to determine the proper accounting and whether the embedded derivatives required bifurcation from the host instrument and whether the conversion feature was a beneficial conversion feature BCF ). It was concluded that the embedded derivative did not require bifurcation from the host instrument and that the conversion feature was not a BCF. The Company accounted for the convertible debentures and embedded derivatives as a single unit of account and classified them entirely as non-current liabilities in the Company s consolidated balance sheets in accordance with Debt with Conversion and Other Options (Subtopic Accounting Standards Codification ASC 470-20). The Company engaged a third-party to determine the fair value of each of the instruments issued and allocated the proceeds received from the issuance and the transaction costs related to the issuance of the convertible debentures and warrants based on their relative fair values as determined at issuance. 
 preferred share for 1,000 common shares. All series of convertible preferred stock are classified as shareholders equity in the Company s consolidated balance sheets. The fair value of the related preferred stock is based on the closing price of the Company s common stock on the day of issuance of the preferred stock. Included in the issuance were detachable warrants to purchase a convertible preferred share. The detachable purchase warrants were evaluated for equity or liability classification and were determined to meet liability classification. The warrants are legally detachable and separately exercisable from the convertible preferred shares. 
 
 balance sheet date with the change in the fair value recorded as income or expense. In addition, upon the occurrence of an event that requires the derivative liability to be reclassified to equity, the derivative liability is revalued to fair value at that date. 
 potentially dilutive common share equivalents were included in the computation of diluted loss per share because their impact would have been anti-dilutive. During the year ended December 31, 2021, potentially dilutive common share equivalents were included in the computation of diluted earnings per share. 
 
 Management has applied significant estimates and judgements related to the following: i) Inventory 

 The net realizable value of inventory represents the estimated selling price in the ordinary course of business less the reasonably predictable costs of completion, disposal and transportation. The Company estimates the net realizable value of inventories, taking into account the most reliable evidence available at each reporting date. The determination of net realizable value requires significant judgment, including consideration of factors such as shrinkage, the aging of and future demand for inventory, expected future selling price the Company expects to realize by selling the inventory, and the contractual arrangements with customers. Reserves for excess and obsolete inventory are based upon quantities on hand, projected volumes from demand forecasts and net realizable value. The future realization of these inventories may be affected by market-driven changes that may reduce future selling prices. A change to these assumptions could impact the Company s inventory valuation and gross profit. The impact of inventory reserves is reflected in cost of sales. ii) Revenue recognition 

 From time to time, the Company partakes in sales agreements with suppliers in which it also purchases inventory. As part of the five-step revenue model, the Company assesses whether instances of bulk sales made to suppliers of goods have commercial substance and should be recognized as revenue, or whether they should be assessed under ASC 845 Nonmonetary Transactions , which requires management judgment to determine if the transaction has commercial substance . iii) Share based payments 

 In calculating share-based compensation expense, key estimates are used such as, the rate of forfeiture of options granted, the expected life of the option, the volatility of the Company s stock price, and the risk-free interest rate. iv) Warrant Liability 

 In calculating the fair value of warrants issued, the Company includes key estimates such as the volatility of the Company s stock price and the risk-free interest rate. The Company uses judgment to select methods used and in performing the fair value calculations at the initial measurement at issuance, as well as for subsequent measurement on a recurring basis. v) Income taxes 

 The extent to which deferred tax assets can be recognized is based on an assessment of the probability of the Company generating future taxable income against which the deferred tax assets can be utilized. In addition, significant judgment is required in classifying transactions and assessing probable outcomes of tax positions taken, and in assessing the impact of any legal or economic limits or uncertainties in various tax jurisdictions. Provisions for taxes are made using the best estimate of the amount expected to be paid based on a qualitative assessment of all relevant factors. The Company reviews the adequacy of these provisions at the end of the reporting period. It is possible, however, that at some future date, an additional liability could result from audits by taxing authorities. If the final outcome of these tax-related matters is different from the amounts that were initially recorded, such differences will affect the tax provisions in the period in which such determination is made. vi) Impairment of goodwill and intangible assets 

 Goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets are reviewed for impairment annually and whenever there are events or changes in circumstances that indicate the carrying amount has been impaired. Definite lived intangible assets are tested for impairment when there are indications that an asset may be impaired. If it is determined that it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit are less than its carrying value, additional quantitative impairment testing is performed which compares the carrying value of the reporting unit to its estimated fair value. The Company uses an income-based approach as necessary to assess the fair values of intangible assets and its reporting units for goodwill testing purposes. Under the income approach, fair value is based on the present value of estimated cash flows. An impaired asset is written down to its estimated fair value based on the most recent information available. Fair value is determined as the amount that would be obtained from the sale of the asset in an arm s length transaction between knowledgeable and willing parties. Determining the value in use requires the Company to estimate expected future cash flows associated with the assets and a suitable discount rate in order to calculate present value. A number of factors, including historical results, business plans, forecasts, and market data are used to determine the fair value of the reporting unit and intangible assets. vii) Impairment of long-lived assets 

 The Company evaluates the recoverability of long-lived assets, including property and equipment, ROU assets, and definite lived intangible assets, whether events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of the asset, or asset group, may not be recoverable. When the Company determines that the carrying value of the long-lived asset may not be recoverable based upon the existence of one or more of the indicators, the assets are assessed for impairment based on the estimate of future undiscounted cash flows expected to result from the use of the asset and its eventual disposition. If the carrying value of an asset exceeds its estimated future undiscounted cash flows, an impairment loss is recorded for the excess of the asset s carrying value over its fair value. viii) Business combinations 

 Classification of an acquisition as a business combination or an asset acquisition depends on whether the asset acquired constitutes a business, which can be a complex judgement. The Company has determined that its acquisitions in Note 4 are business combinations under ASC 805 Business Combinations . In a business combination, substantially all identifiable assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities acquired are recorded at the date of acquisition at their respective fair values. One of the most significant areas of judgment and estimation relates to the determination of the fair value of these assets and liabilities, including the fair value of contingent consideration, if applicable. If any intangible assets are identified, depending on the type of intangible asset and the complexity of determining its fair value, the Company may utilize an independent external valuation expert to develop the fair value, using appropriate valuation techniques, which are generally based on a forecast of the total expected future net cash flows. These valuations are linked closely to the assumptions made by management regarding the future performance of the assets concerned and any changes in the discount rate applied. The Company elected to measure each NCI at its fair value as of the acquisition date based on an appraisal of the real estate acquired using the market approach, specifically the direct comparison approach of comparable properties. ix) Contingent Consideration 

 Contingent consideration payable as the result of a business combination is recorded at the date of acquisition at fair value. The fair value of contingent consideration is subject to significant judgement and estimates, such as projected future revenue. Subsequent changes to the fair value of contingent consideration are measured at each reporting date, with changes recognized through profit or loss. x) Incremental borrowing rates 

 Lease payments are discounted using the rate implicit in the lease if that rate is readily available. If that rate cannot be easily determined, the lessee is required to use its incremental borrowing rate. The incremental borrowing rate is the rate of interest that the Company estimates it would have to pay on a collateralized basis to borrow an amount equal to the lease payments under similar terms. The Company calculates its incremental borrowing rate as the interest rate the Company would pay to borrow funds necessary to obtain an asset of similar value over similar terms taking into consideration the economic factors and the credit risk rating at the commencement date of the lease. In addition, the Company utilizes a discount rate to determine the appropriate fair value of convertible debentures and loans issued with warrants attached. The discount rate applied reflects the interest rate that the Company would have to pay to borrow a similar amount at a similar term and with a similar security. xi) Control, joint control or level of influence 

 When determining the appropriate basis of accounting for the Company s interests in affiliates, the Company makes judgments about the degree of influence that it exerts directly or through an arrangement over the investees relevant activities. xii) ERC 

 The Coronavirus Aid, Relief and Economic Securities Act CARES Act provides for an employee retention credit ERC which is a refundable tax credit for businesses that continued to pay employees while shut down due to the COVID-19 pandemic, or had significant declines in gross receipts from March 13, 2020 to December 31, 2021. Eligible employers can claim the ERC on an original or adjusted employment tax return for a period within those dates. The Company has elected to account for the credit as a government grant. There is limited grant accounting guidance within U.S. GAAP that is applicable to for-profit entities, therefore, the Company has elected to follow the grant accounting model in International Accounting Standard IAS 20, Accounting for Government Grants and Disclosure of Government Assistance. Accordingly, the Company recognizes government grants for which there is a reasonable assurance of compliance with grant conditions and receipt of credits and has therefore recognized a receivable for the total credit amount on the consolidated balance sheets as of December 31, 2022 (refer to Note 3). The determination of the collectability of the ERC requires significant judgement, including assessment of the Company's eligibility based on the facts and circumstances. While the Company believes that collection of the ERC is probable, there is some uncertainty around collection due to the nature of the Company's industry. 
 this standard . 

 (ii) In October 2021, the FASB issued ASC No. 2021-08, Accounting for Contract Assets and Contract Liabilities from Contracts with Customers (Topic 805). This ASU requires an acquirer to recognize and measure contract assets and contract liabilities acquired in a business combination in accordance with Topic 606. At the acquisition date, an acquirer should account for the related revenue contracts in accordance with Topic 606 as if it had originated the contracts. The ASU is effective for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2022, including interim periods within those fiscal years. Adoption of the ASU should be applied prospectively. The Company this standard and notes that it did t have a material impact on the Company's consolidated financial statements. 

 (iii) In November 2021, the FASB issued ASU 2021-10, Government Assistance (Topic 832), Disclosures by Business Entities about Government Assistance, which provides guidance on disclosure requirements to entities other than not-for-profit entities about transactions with a government that are accounted for by applying a grant or contribution accounting model by analogy. ASU 2021-10 requires an entity to make annual disclosures related to (i) the nature of the transactions and the related accounting policy used to account for the government transactions, (ii) quantification and disclosure of amounts related to the government transactions included in the balance sheets and statements of operations financial statement line items, and (iii) significant terms and conditions of the government transactions, including commitments and contingencies. The Company this standard on . 

 (iv) In June 2022, the Financial Accounting Standards Board FASB issued ASU 2022-03, Fair Value Measurement of Equity Securities Subject to Contractual Sale Restrictions, which is intended to clarify that contractual sales restrictions are not considered in measuring equity securities at fair value. The ASU differentiates between (i) a restriction that is characteristic of a security (for which the effect of the restriction is included in the equity security's fair value because it is a security-specific characteristic) and (2) a contractual sale restriction (for which the effect of the restriction is not included in the equity security's fair value because it is an entity-specific characteristic). The effective date for adoption is for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2023 for public business entities, with early adoption permitted for both interim and annual financial statements. The Company early this beginning in the interim period ending in order to increase the comparability of reported financial information (refer to Note 4).

Asset Specific Impairment The Company evaluates the recoverability of property and equipment and long-lived assets held for sale, whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of the asset or asset group may not be recoverable. See Impairment of long-lived assets information within this note for detailed information on the Company s impairment assessment of its property and equipment. The impairment losses discussed below were included in (loss) income from discontinued operations on the Company's Consolidated Statements of Operations. Certain assets of TerrAscend Canada were determined to be held for sale as of December 31, 2022 as they met the criteria under ASC 360 Property, Plant and Equipment . TerrAscend Canada operated out of a square foot facility located in Mississauga , Ontario. Assets held for sale are reported at the lower of its carrying value or fair value less cost to sell. The Company determined the fair market value of the building based on the listing price and related commission and determined that the fair value was lower than its carrying value and therefore recorded impairment of . The fair value less cost to sell was included in assets held for sale in the Consolidated Balance Sheets at December 31, 2022. Additionally, the Company recorded impairment of related to machinery and equipment at TerrAscend Canada that could not be transferred or sold. During the year ended December 31, 2021, the Company determined that equipment purchased for the purpose of extracting CBD and THC oils to support the medical cannabis business in Canada needed to be assessed for impairment as the equipment was never put into use and the Company has since exited the medical cannabis business in Canada. The Company evaluated the recoverability of the asset to determine whether it would be recoverable, and it was determined that the carrying value of the asset exceeded its estimated future undiscounted cash flows and therefore, recorded an impairment loss of . The Company determined that the assets meet the criteria to be classified as held for sale and the remaining net book value of was included in other current assets on the Company s Consolidated Balance Sheets.

The Company evaluates the recoverability of long-lived assets, including definite lived intangible assets, whether events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of the asset may not be recoverable. During the year ended December 31, 2022, the Company determined that changes in market expectations of cash flows in its Michigan, Pennsylvania and California businesses, as well as increased competition and supply in the states, were indicators that an impairment test was appropriate for each of these reporting units. 
 Long-lived assets The impairment test for long-lived assets is a two-step test, whereby management first determines the recoverable amount by calculating the undiscounted cash flows of each asset group. If the recoverable amount is lower than the carrying value of the asset group, then impairment is indicated. For the Michigan reporting unit, the Company determined the fair value of the asset groups and allocates the impairment to the assets, being the (i) cultivation and processing licenses, and (ii) retail licenses, acquired through the Gage Acquisition. The Company compared the carrying value of the assets to its fair value and determined that the carrying value exceeded the fair value for both the retail and the cultivation and processing licenses. As such, the Company recorded impairment charges of and for the cultivation and processing licenses and retail licenses, respectively, reducing both the carrying values to . The fair value of each asset group was determined using cash flows expected to be generated by market participants, discounted at weighted average cost of capital. The fair value of the specific assets that were impaired was determined using the multi period excess earnings method based on the following key assumptions: Cash flows: estimated cash flows were projected based on actual operating results from internal sources, as well as industry and market trends. The forecasts were extended through the estimated useful lives of the assets; 

 Post-tax discount rate: the post-tax discount rate is reflective of the weighted average cost of capital WACC ). The WACC was estimated based on the risk-free rate, equity risk premium, beta premium, and after-tax cost of debt based on corporate bond yields; and 

 Tax rate: the tax rates used in determining future cash flows were those substantively enacted at the respective valuation date. 

 During the year ended December 31, 2020, the Company recorded impairment of related to its customer relationships at Arise as a result of its termination of an agreement with one of its wholesale distributors. Indefinite lived assets Indefinite lived intangible assets are reviewed for impairment annually and whether there are events or changes in circumstances that indicate that the carrying amount has been impaired. The impairment indicators previously noted for Michigan indicate that the fair value of the Gage brand intangible assets are more likely than not lower than the carrying value. As such, the Company performed an impairment analysis and determined the fair value of its brand intangible assets using the relief of royalty method. As a result of the quantitative analysis performed, the Company recognized impairment of , reducing the carrying value of the brand intangibles to . During the year ended December 31, 2021, the Company made the decision to undertake a strategic review process to explore, review, and evaluate potential alternatives for its Arise business. The Company also determined that the estimated future cash flows for the business did not support the carrying value of the intangible assets, and therefore recorded impairment of intangible assets of for the year ended December 31, 2021, reducing the carrying value to nil. Impairment of Goodwill Goodwill is reviewed for impairment annually and whenever there are events or changes in circumstances that indicate the carrying value has been impaired. During the year ended December 31, 2022, based on the indicators of impairment noted previously, the Company determined that there were indicators that the fair value of its reporting units are more likely than not lower than its carrying value at some of its reporting units. As such, a quantitative impairment test was performed over its Michigan reporting unit, which includes goodwill acquired through the Gage Acquisition and the Pinnacle Acquisition, its Pennsylvania reporting unit, and its California reporting unit. The following significant assumptions were applied in the determination of the fair value of the reporting units using a discounted cash flow model: Cash flows: estimated cash flows were projected based on actual operating results from internal sources, as well as industry and market trends. The forecasts were extended to a total of five years (with a terminal value thereafter); 

 Terminal value growth rate: The terminal growth rate was based on historical and projected consumer price inflation, historical and projected economic indicators and projected industry growth; 

 Post-tax discount rate: the post-tax discount rate is reflective of the WACC. The WACC was estimated based on the risk-free rate, equity risk premium, beta premium, and after-tax cost of debt based on corporate bond yields; and 

 Tax rate: the tax rates used in determining future cash flows were those substantively enacted at the respective valuation date. 

 During the year ended December 31, 2022, the Company recorded impairment of goodwill of at its Michigan reporting unit, reducing the carrying value of the goodwill acquired through the Gage Acquisition and Pinnacle Acquisition to nil. As a result of the impairment analysis performed over the Company's Pennsylvania reporting unit, the Company determined that the fair value of the Pennsylvania reporting unit exceeded its carrying value, resulting in no impairment. The carrying value of the goodwill attributable to the Pennsylvania reporting unit was at December 31, 2022. As a result of the impairment analysis performed over the Company's California wholesale reporting unit, the Company determined that the fair value of the California wholesale reporting unit exceeded its carrying value, resulting in no impairment. The carrying value of the goodwill attributable to the California wholesale reporting unit was at December 31, 2022. During the fourth quarter of 2022, the Company performed a qualitative analysis over its Maryland reporting unit and determined that it was more likely than not that the fair value exceeded its carrying value, and therefore, no quantitative analysis was performed. There is no goodwill at the Company's Canada, New Jersey, California retail and Florida reporting units. As a result of the Company s decision to undertake a strategic review of its Florida business, Company recorded impairment of goodwill of during the year ended December 31, 2021. During the fourth quarter of 2021, the Company performed qualitative analyses over its goodwill for each of its reporting units. The Company determined that it was more likely than not that the fair value of its California wholesale and Maryland reporting units exceeded their carrying values, and therefore, no quantitative analysis was performed. The Company performed a quantitative analysis over its Pennsylvania reporting unit using the significant assumptions discussed previously to determine the fair value, and determined that the fair value of the Company s reporting unit exceeded its carrying value, resulting in no impairment. The carrying value of the goodwill attributable to the Pennsylvania reporting unit was at December 31, 2021. There is no goodwill at the Company s Canada, California retail and New Jersey reporting units. During the fourth quarter of 2020, the Company performed qualitative analyses over its goodwill for each of its reporting units.

The Company assesses available positive and negative evidence to estimate if it is more likely than not to use certain jurisdiction-based deferred tax assets including net operating loss carryovers. On the basis of this assessment, the Company continues to maintain a valuation allowance on certain deferred tax assets for the year ended December 31, 2022. As of December 31, 2022, the Company has of Canadian net operating loss carryovers that expire at different times, the earliest of which is 2034 for . As of December 31, 2022, the Company has of domestic federal net operating loss carryovers with no expiration date. As of December 31, 2022, the Company has various state net operating loss carryovers that expire at different times. The statute of limitations with respect to our federal returns remains open for tax years 2019 and forward. Certain acquired subsidiaries were under IRS audit for tax years ended September 30, 2014 and September 30, 2015. This audit was closed during the tax year ended December 31, 2022 and the indemnification asset of was released during the year. Over the next twelve months, the Company believes it is reasonably possible that various statutes of limitation will expire which would have the effect of reducing the balance of unrecognized tax benefits by . As the Company operates in the cannabis industry, it is subject to the limitations of IRC Section 280E, under which the Company is only allowed to deduct expenses directly related to sales of product. This results in permanent differences between ordinary and necessary business expenses deemed non-deductible under IRC Section 280E. Therefore, the effective tax rate can be highly variable and may not necessarily correlate with pre-tax income or loss.

Contingent Consideration Payable The fair value of contingent consideration was determined using a probability weighted model based on the likelihood of achieving certain revenue and EBITDA scenario outcomes. The contingent consideration for State Flower was calculated based on fiscal year 2021 revenue and the final earnout has been calculated as of December 31, 2022. During the year ended December 31, 2022, the fair value of the contingent consideration related to the KCR was reduced to nil, as it was determined it was more likely than not that the earnout criteria would not be met. The combined revaluations resulted in a gain on revaluation of contingent consideration of for the year ended December 31, 2022. A discount rate of and to for the years ended December 31, 2021 and December 31, 2020, respectively, was utilized to determine the present value of the liabilities. As a result of the revaluation, the Company recognized a loss on revaluation of contingent consideration of and for the years ended December 31, 2021 and December 31, 2020, respectively. Risk Management The Company s risk exposure and the impact on the Company s financial instruments are summarized below: (a)	Credit risk Credit risk is the risk of financial loss to the Company if a customer or counterparty to a financial instrument fails to meet its contractual obligations. Financial instruments that potentially subject the Company to significant concentrations of credit risk consist principally of cash and cash equivalents, accounts receivable, net and notes receivable. The Company assesses the credit risk of trade receivables by evaluating the aging of trade receivables based on the invoice date. The carrying amounts of trade receivables are reduced through the use of an allowance account and the amount of the loss is recognized in the consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive loss. When a trade receivable balance is considered uncollectible, it is written off against the allowance for expected credit losses. Subsequent recoveries of amounts previously written off are credited against operating expenses in the consolidated statements of operations. The Company regularly monitors credit risk exposure and takes steps to mitigate the likelihood of these exposures resulting in actual loss. The Company has customers whose balance is greater than 10 of total trade receivables as of December 31, 2022. (b)	Liquidity risk The Company is exposed to liquidity risk, or the risk that the Company will not be able to meet its financial obligations as they become due. The Company manages liquidity risk through ongoing review of its capital requirements. The Company s objective with respect to its capital management is to ensure it has sufficient cash resources to maintain its ongoing operations. (c)	Market Risk The significant market risk exposures to which the Company is exposed are foreign currency risk and interest rate risk. i) Foreign currency risk: 

 Foreign currency risk is the risk that a variation in exchange rates between the Canadian dollar and U.S. dollar and other foreign currencies will affect the Company s operations and financial results. The Company and its subsidiaries hold cash and cash equivalents and other assets and liabilities in currencies other than their functional currency. TerrAscend does not currently engage in currency hedging activities to limit the risks of currency fluctuations. Consequently, fluctuations in foreign currencies could have a negative impact on the profitability of TerrAscend's operations. A change in the value of the U.S. dollar compared to the Canadian dollar would result in a change of to the unrealized foreign exchange loss (gain). ii) Interest rate risk: 

 Interest rate risk is the risk that future cash flows will fluctuate as a result of changes in market interest rates. In respect of financial assets, the Company's policy is to invest excess cash at floating rates of interest in cash equivalents, in order to maintain liquidity, while achieving a satisfactory return. Fluctuations in interest rates impact the value of cash equivalents. The Company s investments in guaranteed investment certificates bear a fixed rate and are cashable at any time prior to maturity date. TerrAscend does not have significant cash equivalents at year. The Amended Gage Term Loan and the Pelorus Term Loan have variable interest rates that are tied to the U.S. prime rate and SOFR. At December 31, 2022, a change to each of the interest rates would result in a change to interest expense of . The remainder of TerrAscend s loans payable have fixed interest rates from to per annum. All other financial liabilities are non-interest-bearing instruments. 

, pursuant to a financing agreement with a third-party lender. In exchange, the Company assigned to the lender its interests in the ERC claim that was submitted during December 2022 (refer to Note 3). If the Company does not receive the ERC claim, in whole or in part, the Company is required to repay the related portion of the funds received plus interest of 10 accrued from the date of the financing agreement through the repayment date. The Company's obligation under the financing agreement will be satisfied upon receipt of the ERC claim or other full repayment. On January 19, 2023, the Company entered into a multi-year agreement with Wana Brands Wana ), the leading edible manufacturer in North America, to introduce Wana's products at The Apothecarium retail stores and additional third-party retailers in New Jersey. The agreement will also transfer to TerrAscend, the manufacturing and sales of Wana's existing portfolio of products in Maryland. Pursuant to the agreement, the Company will serve as the exclusive sole manufacturer, supplier, and commercial partner for Wana's products in New Jersey. On January 27, 2023, the C ompany closed on its previously announced acquisition of AMMD. Under the terms of the agreement, the Company acquired equity interest in AMMD for total consideration of in cash, in addition to entering into a long-term lease with the option to purchase the real estate. The Company now operates vertically integrated licensed operations in Maryland. On January 30, 2023, the Company appointed Jeroen De Beijer as Chief People and Culture Officer.

On February 13, 2023, the Company launched adult-use cannabis sales at its Cookies Detroit retail location. Effective March 1, 2023, TerrAscend sold substantially all of the assets, including all intellectual property and inventory, at its Arise business to a third party. On March 15, 2023, WDB Holding PA, in exchange for a fee in the amount of of the then outstanding principal loan balance, agreed to an amendment among other things, to (i) extend the obligation date to prepay the Company's debt from March 15, 2023 to June 30, 2023 in which WDB Holding PA must use commercially reasonable efforts to add additional collateral to the Ilera Term Loan, (ii) increase the amount of debt to be reduced by up to , subject to certain reductions in amount based on meeting certain time based milestones, at a prepayment price of to par, and (iii) extend the next test date in respect of the interest coverage ratio until June 30, 2023.

 Foreign Ownership of Common Shares 
 
 282915902 v6 

There is no limitation imposed by TerrAscend Articles or by-laws on the right of non-Canadian residents to hold Common Shares or exercise voting rights on Common Shares. The following provides a brief summary of certain limitations imposed by Canadian laws on the rights of non-Canadian residents to hold Common Shares or exercise voting rights on Common Shares, but should not be deemed to be comprehensive or complete in any part, and any such holder or potential holder of Common Shares should undertake a more thorough review of such applicable laws, or consult the advice or services of a qualified expert or professional. 
 
 Competition Act 
 Limitations on the ability to acquire and hold Common Shares may be imposed by the Competition Act (Canada). The legislation permits the Commissioner of Competition of Canada Commissioner ), to review any acquisition or establishment, directly or indirectly, including through the acquisition of shares, of control over or of a significant interest in the Company. This legislation grants the Commissioner jurisdiction, for up to one year after the acquisition has been substantially completed, to seek a remedial order, including an order to prohibit the acquisition or require divestitures, from the Canadian Competition Tribunal, which order may be granted where the Competition Tribunal finds that the acquisition prevents or lessens, or is likely to prevent or lessen, competition substantially. 
 This legislation also requires any person or persons who intend to acquire more than 20 of Common Shares or, if such person or persons already own more than 20 of Common Shares prior to the acquisition, more than 50 of Common Shares, to file a notification with the Canadian Competition Bureau if certain financial thresholds are exceeded. Where a notification is required, unless an exemption is available, the legislation prohibits completion of the acquisition until the expiration of the applicable statutory waiting period, unless the Commissioner either waives or terminates such waiting period. 
 
 Investment Canada Act 
 Under the Investment Canada Act an acquisition of control of a Canadian business by a non-Canadian (as determined pursuant to the Investment Canada Act) involving the acquisition of control are either (i) subject to review prior to completion (a Reviewable Transaction or (ii) subject to a requirement to submit a notification in prescribed form with the responsible Canadian federal government department or departments not later than 30 days after closing. An investment will be a Reviewable Transaction where the applicable financial threshold is met. Subject to certain exemptions, a Reviewable Transaction may not be implemented until an application for review has been filed and the responsible Minister or Ministers of the federal cabinet has determined that the investment is likely to be of net benefit to Canada taking into account certain factors set out in the Investment Canada Act. 
 The Investment Canada Act contains various rules to determine if there has been an acquisition of control by a non-Canadian. For example, for purposes of determining whether an investor has acquired control of a corporation by acquiring shares, the following general rules apply, subject to certain exceptions: the acquisition of a majority of the undivided ownership interests in the voting shares of the corporation is deemed to be acquisition of control of that corporation; the acquisition of less than a majority, but one third or more, of the voting shares of a corporation or of an equivalent undivided ownership interest in the voting shares of the corporation is presumed to be acquisition of control of that corporation unless it can be established that, on the acquisition, the corporation is not controlled in fact by the acquirer through the ownership of voting shares; and the acquisition of less than one third of the voting shares of a corporation or of an equivalent divided ownership interest in the voting shares of the corporation is deemed not to be acquisition of control of that corporation. 
 
 The Investment Canada Act, also includes a discretionary national security review regime which allows the federal government to review a much broader range of investments by a non-Canadian to acquire, in whole or part, or to establish an entity carrying on all or any part of its operations in Canada where the federal government believes that the investment by a non-Canadian could be injurious to national security. No financial threshold applies to a national security review. The federal government has broad discretion to determine whether an investor is a non-Canadian and therefore subject to national security review. A national security review may occur on a pre- or post-closing basis. 
 
 Exchange Controls 
 There are no government laws, decrees or regulations in Canada which restrict the export or import of capital or which affect the remittance of dividends, interest or other payments to non-resident holders of Common Shares. Any remittances of dividends to United States residents and to other non-residents are, however, subject to withholding tax. 
 
 Certain Canadian Federal Income Taxation 
 
 282915902 v6 

The following general summary describes the principal Canadian federal income tax consequences applicable to a holder of Common Shares who is a resident of the US, who is not, will not be and will not be deemed to be a resident of Canada for purposes of the Income Tax Act (Canada) (the Tax Act and who does not use or hold, and is not deemed to use or hold, his, her or its Common Shares in the capital of the Company in connection with carrying on a business in Canada (a Non-Resident Holder ). 
 This summary is based on the current provisions of the Tax Act and the regulations thereunder, the Canada-United States Tax Convention as amended by the Protocols thereto (the Canada-US Treaty and the Company s understanding of the current publicly available administrative practices and assessing policies of the Canada Revenue Agency (the CRA ). This summary also takes into account all specific proposals to amend the Tax Act and the regulations (the Proposed Amendments announced by or on behalf of the Minister of Finance (Canada) in writing prior to the date hereof and assumes that all Proposed Amendments will be enacted in the form proposed although there can be no assurance that the Proposed Amendments will be enacted in the form proposed or at all. Except for the Proposed Amendments, this summary does not take into account or anticipate any changes in law, whether by legislative, governmental or judicial action or decision, nor does it take into account other federal or any provincial, territorial or foreign income tax considerations, which may differ from the Canadian federal income tax considerations discussed below. There can be no assurance that the CRA will not change its administrative policies or assessing practices. This summary is of a general nature only and is not intended to be, and should not be construed to be, legal, business or tax advice to any particular holder or prospective holder of Common Shares, and no opinion or representation with respect to the tax consequences to any holder or prospective holder of Common Shares is made. Accordingly, holders and prospective holders of Common Shares should consult their own tax advisors with respect to the income tax consequences of purchasing, owning and disposing of Common Shares in their particular circumstances. 
 
 Dividends 
 Dividends paid or credited or deemed to be paid or credited by the Company to a Non-Resident Holder will generally be subject to Canadian withholding tax at the rate of 25 , subject to any reduction in the rate of such withholding to which the Non-Resident Holder is entitled under an applicable income tax treaty between Canada and the country where the Non-Resident Holder is resident. For example, under the Canada-US Treaty, the withholding tax rate in respect of a dividend paid to a Non-Resident Holder who is the beneficial owner of the dividend and is resident in the United States for purposes of, and entitled to full benefits under, the Canada-US Treaty, is generally reduced to 15 (or to 5 for a company that holds at least 10 of the voting stock of the corporation paying the dividend). 
 
 Capital Gains 
 A Non-Resident Holder will not be subject to tax under the Tax Act in respect of any capital gain realized on a disposition of Common Shares of the Company, nor will capital losses arising therefrom be recognized under the Tax Act, unless the Common Shares disposed of constitute taxable Canadian property of the Non-Resident Holder and the Non-Resident Holder is not entitled to relief under the Canada-US Treaty. Provided that, at the time of disposition, the Common Shares are listed on a designated stock exchange , as defined in the Tax Act, the Common Shares generally will not constitute taxable Canadian property of a Non-Resident Holder at that time, unless, at any time in the sixty (60) month period preceding the disposition the following two conditions were met concurrently: (a) 25 or more of the issued shares of any class or series of the capital stock of the Company were owned by any combination of (i) the Non-Resident Holder, (ii) persons with whom the Non-Resident Holder did not deal at arm s length and (iii) partnerships in which persons referred to in (i) or (ii) hold a membership interest (directly or indirectly through one or more partnerships); and (b) more than 50 of the fair market value of the Common Shares was derived, directly or indirectly, from any combination of (i) real or immovable property situated in Canada, (ii) Canadian resource properties (as defined in the Tax Act), (iii) timber resource properties (as defined in the Tax Act), and (iv) options 
 in respect of, or an interest in, or for civil law rights in, the property described in (i) to (iii), whether or not such property exists. Notwithstanding the foregoing, a Common Share may in certain circumstances be deemed to be taxable Canadian property of a Non-Resident Holder for purposes of the Tax Act.

 THIS CERTIFIES that, for value received, ________ (the Holder ), is the registered holder of ______ warrants (collectively, the Warrants each a Warrant ), each Warrant entitling the Holder , subject to the terms and conditions set forth in this Wa1rnnt Certificate (the Certificate ), to purchase from TerrAscend Corp.

(Toronto time) on June 6 , 2023 , at which time the Warrants evidenced by this Certificate shall become wholly void and the unexercised portion of the subscription right represented hereby will expire and terminate (the Time of Expiry ), on payment of a price per Common Share equal to CAD _____ (the Exercise Price ). The number of Common Shares which the Holder is entitled to acquire upon exercise of the Warrants and the Exercise Price are subject to adjustment as hereinafter provided. 
 
 The Holder shall be entitled to the rights evidenced by this Ce1tificate free from all equities and right s of s et- o ff or counterclaim between the Corporation and the original or any interim holder and all persons may act accordingly and the receipt by the Holder of the Common Shares issuable upon exercise hereof shall be a good discharge to the Corporation . 
 
 1. Exercise of Warrants . 

(a) Exercise . The Holder is entitled, from and after _______, 2019 to exercise one half of their Warrants , and after ________ , 2020, exercise the remainder of their Warrants (the Vesting Date , to exercise the Warrants in w hole or in part in tranches, at any time or from time to time on or prior to the Time of Expiry. The Corporation shall, on the next business day after receiving a duly executed Election to Purchase (as defined below) and the Exercise Price for the number of Common Shares specified in the Election to Purchase (the Exercise Date , issue that number of Common Shares specified in the Election to Purchase. 

23393871.2 
 
 (b) Change of Control . Notwithstanding subsection !(a) of this Warrant certificate, in the event that, prior to the applicable Vesting Date, a Change of Control (as defined in subsection l(f)(iv)) occurs, other than a Change of Control in conjunction with an internal reorganization of the Corporation, the Vesting Date shall no longer apply and from the date that the Change of Control occurs, the Holder shall be entitled to exercise the Warrants from time to time until the Time of Expiry. 

(c) Election to Purchase. The rights evidenced by this Certificate may be exercised by the Holder in whole or in part and in accordance with the provisions hereof by delivery of an election to purchase in substantially the form attached hereto as Schedule I (the Election to Purchase ), properly completed and executed, together with payment by wire transfer, certified cheque or bank draft of the Exercise Price for the number of Common Shares specified in the Election to Purchase, at the office of the Corporation at 3610 Mavis Road, Mississauga, Ontario, LSC I W2 or such other address in Canada as may be notified in writing by the Corporation (the Corporation Office ). In the event that the rights evidenced by this Certificate are exercised in part, the Corporation shall, contemporaneously with the issuance of the Common Shares issuable on the exercise of the Warrants so exercised, issue to the Holder a Warrant Certificate on identical terms in respect of that number of Common Shares in respect of which the Holder has not exercised the rights evidenced by this Certificate. 

(d) Certificates and Electronic Deposits. As promptly as practicable after the Exercise Date (but no later than three business days after the Exercise Date), the Corporation shall, as specified by the Holder in the Election to Purchase, either (i) issue and deliver to the Holder, registered in the name of the Holder, a certificate for the number of Common Shares issuable on exercise of the Warrants so exercised and a Certificate representing the balance of any unexercised Warrants, or (ii) in the case of the Common Shares, issue and cause to be deposited electronically with CDS Clearing and Depository Services Inc. CDS through the book-based system administered by CDS using the non-certificated inventory issue process that number of Common Shares issuable on exercise of the Warrants so exercised and, in the case of the Warrants, a Certificate representing the balance of any unexercised Warrants. To the extent permitted by law, such exercise shall be deemed to have been effected as of the close of business on the Exercise Date, and at such time the rights of the Holder with respect to the number of Warrants which have been exercised as such shall cease, and the Common Shares and any unexercised Warrants shall then be issuable upon such exercise as outlined above and the Holder shall be deemed to have become the holder of record of the Common Shares and unexercised Warrants represented thereby. Notwithstanding the above, all Common Shares issued to a United States institutional accredited investor as defined in Rule 50 I (a)(l ), (2), (3), or (7) of Regulation D under the U.S. Securities Act will be evidenced by physical certificates. 

(e) Fractional Common Shares . No fractional Common Shares shall be issued upon exercise of the Warrants represented by this Certificate. 

(f) Adjustments. The subscription rights in effect under the Warrants for Common Shares issuable upon the exercise of the Warrants shall be subject to adjustment from time to time as follows: 

(i) If, at any time from the date hereof until the Time of Expiry (the Adjustment Period ), the Corporation shall: 

(A) subdivide, re-divide or change its outstanding Common Shares into a greater number of Common Shares; 

(B) reduce, combine or consolidate its outstanding Common Shares into a lesser number of Common Shares; or 

23393871.2 
 
 (C) issue Common Shares or securities exchangeable for, or convertible into, Common Shares to all or substantially all of the holders of Common Shares by way of stock dividend or other distribution (other than, if applicable, a dividend paid in the ordinary course or a distribution of Common Shares upon the exercise of Warrants or any options, restricted share units or other exchangeable or convertible securities of the Corporation); 

(any of such events in subsections l(t)(i)(A) , (B) or (C) being called a Common Share Reorganization then , in each such event, the Exercise Price shall be adjusted as of the effective date or record date of such Common Share Reorganization, as the case may be, and shall, in the case of the events referred to in (A) or (C) above, be decreased in proportion to the number of outstanding Common Shares resulting from such subdivision, re-division, change or distribution, or shall, in the case of the events referred to in (B) above, be increased in proportion to the number of outstanding Common Shares resulting from such reduction, combination or consolidation by multiplying the Exercise Price in effect immediately prior to such effective date or record date by a fraction, the numerator of which shall be the number of Common Shares outstanding on such effective date or record date before giving effect to such Common Share Reorganization and the denominator of which shall be the number of Common Shares outstanding as of the e ffective date or record date after giving effect to such Common Share Reorganization (including, in the case where securities exchangeable for or convertible into Common Shares are distributed, the number of Common Shares that would have been outstanding had such securities been exchanged for or converted into Common Shares on such record date or effective date). Such adjustment shall be made successively whenever any event referred to in this subsection I (f)(i)shall occur. Upon any adjustment of the Exercise Price pursuant to subsection I (t)(i), the Exchange Rate (as defined below) shall be contemporaneously adjusted by multiplying the number of Common Shares theretofore obtainable on the exercise thereof by a fraction of which the numerator shall be the Exercise Price in effect immediately prior to such adjustment and the denominator shall be the Exercise Price resulting from such adjustment. Exchange Rate means the number of Common Shares subject to the right of purchase under each Warrant, which, as of the date hereof, is one (I) Common Share for one (I) Warrant. 
 
 (ii) If and whenever at any time during the Adjustment Period, the Corporation shall fix a record date for the issuance of rights, options or warrants to all or substantially all the holders of its outstanding Common Shares entitling them , for a period expiring not more than 45 days after such record date, to subscribe for or purchase Common Shares (or securities convertible or exchangeable into Common Shares) at a price per Common Share (or having a conversion or exchange price per Common Share) less than 95 of the Current Market Price (as defined below) on such record date (a Rights Offering ), the Exercise Price shall be adjusted immediately after such record date so that it shall equal the amount determined by multiplying the Exercise Price in effect on such record date by a fraction, of which the numerator shall be the total number of Common Shares outstanding on such record date plus a number of Common Shares equal to the number arrived at by dividing the aggregate price of the total number of additional Common Shares offered for subscription or purchase (or the aggregate 

23393871.2 
 
 conversion or exchange price of the convertible or exchangeable securities so offered) by the Current Market Price, and of which the denominator shall be the total number of Common Shares outstanding on such record date plus the total number of additional Common Shares offered for subscription or purchase or into which the convertible or exchangeable securities so offered are convertible or exchangeable. Any Common Shares owned by or held for the account of the Corporation shall be deemed not to be outstanding for the purpose of any such computation. Such adjustment shall be made successively whenever such a record date is fixed. To the extent that no such rights or warrants are exercised prior to the expiration thereof, the Exercise Price shall be readjusted to the Exercise Price which would then be in effect if such record date had not been fixed or, if any such rights or warrants are exercised, to the Exercise Price which would then be in effect based upon the number of Common Shares (or securities convertible or exchangeable into Common Shares) actually issued upon the exercise of such rights or warrants, as the case may be. Upon any adjustment of the Exercise Price pursuant to this subsection 1(f)(ii), the Exchange Rate will be adjusted immediately after such record date so that it will equal the rate determined by multiplying the Exchange Rate in effect on such record date by a fraction, of which the numerator shall be the Exercise Price in effect immediately prior to such adjustment and the denominator shall be the Exercise Price resulting from such adjustment. Such adjustment will be made successively whenever such a record date is fixed, provided that if two or more such record dates or record dates referred to in this subsection 1 (f)(ii) are fixed within a period of 25 trading days, such adjustment will be made successively as if each of such record date occurred on the earliest of such record dates. 
 
 (iii) If and whenever at any time during the Adjustment Period the Corporation shall fix a record date for the making of a distribution to all or substantially all the holders of its outstanding Common Shares of (i) securities of any class, whether of the Corporation or any other entity (other than Common Shares), (ii) rights , options or warrants to subscribe for or purchase Common Shares (or other securities convertible into or exchangeable for Common Shares), other than pursuant to a Rights Offering; (iii) evidences of its indebtedness or (iv) any cash , securities or other property or other assets (other than, if applicable, dividends paid in the ordinary course) and if such issue or distribution does not constitute a Common Share Reorganization, a Rights Offering or a distribution of Common Shares upon the exercise of Warrants or any outstanding options, then, in each such case, the Exercise Price shall be adjusted immediately after such record date so that it shall equal the price determined by multiplying the Exercise Price in effect on such record date by a fraction, of which the numerator shall be the total number of Common Shares outstanding on such record date multiplied by the Current Market Price on such record date, less the excess, if any, of the fair market value on such record date, as determined by the directors of the Corporation, acting reasonably (whose determination shall be conclusive, subject to stock exchange approval), of such cash, securities or other property or other assets so issued or distributed over the fair market value of any consideration received therefor by the Corporation from the holders of the Common Shares , and of which the denominator shall be the total number of Common Shares outstanding on such record date multiplied by the Current Market Price. Any Common Shares owned by or held for the account of the Corporation shall be deemed not to be outstanding for the purpose of any such computation. Such 

23393871.2 
 
 adjustment shall be made successively whenever such a record date is fixed . To the extent that such distribution is not so made, the Exercise Price shall be readjusted to the Exercise Price which would then be in effect if such record date had not been fixed . Upon any adjustment of the Exercise Price pursuant to this subsection 1(f)(iii) , the Exchange Rate will be adjusted immediately after such record date so that it will equal the rate determined by multiplying the Exchange Rate in effect on such record date by a fraction, of which the numerator shall be the Exercise Price in effect immediately prior to such adjustment and the denominator shall be the Exercise Price resulting from such adjustment. Such adjustment will be made successively whenever such a record date is fixed, provided that if two or more such record dates or record dates referred to in this subsection 1(f)(iii) are fixed within a period of 25 trading days, such adjustment will be made successively as if each of such record date occurred on the earliest of such record dates . 
 
 (iv) If and whenever at any time during the Adjustment Period, there is a reclassification of the Common Shares or a capital reorganization of the Corporation other than as described in subsection 1(f)(i) or a consolidation, amalgamation, arrangement or merger of the Corporation with or into any other body corporate , trust, partnership or other entity , or a sale or conveyance of the property and assets of the Corporation as an entirety or substantially as an entirety to any other body corporate, trust, partnership or other entity (each, a Change of Control ), any Holder that has not exercised its Warrants prior to the effective date of such Change of Control, upon the exercise of such Warrant thereafter, shall be entitled to receive upon payment of the Exercise Price and shall accept , in lieu of the number of Common Shares that prior to such effective date the Holder would have been entitled to receive, the number of shares or other securities or property of the Corporation or of the body corporate, trust, partnership or other entity resulting from such merger, amalgamation or consolidation, or to which such sale or conveyance may be made, as the case may be , that such Holder would have been entitled to receive on such Change of Control, if, on the effective date thereof, as the case may be, the Holder had been the registered holder of the number of Common Shares to which prior to such effective date it was entitled to acquire upon the exercise of the Warrants. If determined appropriate by the Corporation, relying on advice of legal counsel , to give effect to or to evidence the provisions of this subsection I (f)(iv), the Corporation, its successor, or such purchasing body corporate, partnership , trust or other entity, as the case may be , shall, prior to or contemporaneously with any such Change of Control, enter into an agreement or certificate which shall provide , to the extent possible, for the application of the provisions set forth in this Certificate with respect to the rights and interests thereafter of the Holder to the end that the provisions set forth in this Certificate shall thereafter correspondingly be made applicable, as nearly as may reasonably be, with respect to any shares, other securities or property to which the Holder is entitled on the exercise of its acquisition rights thereafter . Any agreement or certificate entered into between the Corporation, any successor to the Corporation or such purchasing body corporate, partnership, trust or other entity and the Holder shall provide for adjustments which shall be as nearly equivalent as may be practicable to the adjustments provided in this subsection I (f) and which shall apply to successive reclassifications , capital reorganizations, amalgamations, consolidations, mergers , sales or conveyances arrangements. 

23393871.2 
 
 (v) In any case in which this subsection 1(f) shall require that an adjustment shall become effective immediately after a record date for an event referred to herein, the Corporation may defer, until the occurrence of such event, issuing to the Holder of any Warrant exercised after the record date and prior to completion of such event the additional Common Shares issuable by reason of the adjustment required by such event before giving effect to such adjustment; provided, however, that the Corporation shall deliver to the Holder an appropriate instrument evidencing the Holder's right to receive such additional Common Shares upon the occurrence of the event requiring such adjustment and the right to receive any distributions made on such additional Common Shares declared in favour of holders of record of Common Shares on and after the relevant date of exercise or such later date as the Holder would, but for the provisions of this subsection 1(f)(v), have become the holder of record of such additional Common Shares pursuant to this subsection l(f). 

(vi) In any case in which subsection 1(f)(i)(C), subsection 1(f)(ii) or subsection l(f)(iii) require that an adjustment be made to the Exercise Price, no such adjustment shall be made if the Holder of the outstanding Warrants receives , subject to any required stock exchange or regulatory approval, the rights or warrants referred to in subsection 1(f)(i)(C), subsection 1(f)(ii) or the shares , rights, options, warrants, evidences of indebtedness or assets referred to in subsection 1(f)(iii), as the case may be, in such kind and number as they would have received if they had been holders of Common Shares on the applicable record date or effective date, as the case may be, by virtue of their outstanding Warrants having then been exercised into Common Shares at the Exercise Price in effect on the applicable record date or effective date, as the case may be. 

(vii) The adjustments provided for in this subsection 1(f) are cumulative, and shall, in the case of adjustments to the Exercise Price be computed to the nearest whole cent and shall apply to successive subdivisions, re- divisions, reductions , combinations, consolidations, distributions, issues or other events resulting in any adjustment under the provisions of this subsection 1(f), provided that , notwithstanding any other provision of this Section, no adjustment of the Exercise Price shall be required unless such adjustment would require an increase or decrease of at least 1 in the Exercise Price then in effect or the number of Common Shares issuable upon the exercise of a Warrant by at least one one hundredth of a Common Share; provided, however, that any adjustments which by reason of this subsection 1(f)(vii) are not required to be made shall be carried forward and taken into account in any subsequent adjustment. 

(viii) After any adjustment pursuant to this subsection 1(f), the term Common Shares , where used in this Certificate, shall be interpreted to mean securities of any class or classes which, as a result of such adjustment and all prior adjustments pursuant to this subsection 1(f), the Holder is entitled to receive upon the exercise of Warrants, and the number of Common Shares indicated by any exercise made pursuant to a Warrant shall be interpreted to mean the number of Common Shares or other property or securities the Holder is entitled to receive, as a result of such adjustment and all prior adjustments pursuant to this subsection 1(f), upon the full exercise of a Warrant. 

23393871.2 
 
 (ix) All Common Shares or shares of any class or other securities, which the Holder is at the time in question entitled to receive on the exercise of its Warrant, whether or not as a result of adjustments made pursuant to this subsection I (f), shall, for the purposes of the interpretation of this Certificate, be deemed to be Common Shares which such Holder is entitled to acquire pursuant to such Warrant. 

(x) Notwithstanding anything in this subsection I (f) , no adjustment shall be made in the acquisition rights attached to the Warrants if the issue of Common Shares is being made pursuant to this Certificate or in connection with (a) any share incentive plan or restricted share unit plan or share purchase plan in force from time to time for directors, officers, employees, consultants or other service providers of the Corporation; or (b) the satisfaction of existing instruments issued as of the date hereof. 

(xi) As a condition precedent to the taking of any action which would require an adjustment in any of the acquisition rights pursuant to any of the Warrants , including the number of Common Shares which are to be received upon the exercise thereof, the Corporation shall take any action which may, in the opinion of legal counsel, be nece ss ary in order that the Corporation has unissued and reserved in its authorized capital and may validly and legally issue as fully paid and non-assessable all the Common Shares which the holders of such Warrants are entitled to receive on the full exercise thereof in accordance with the provisions hereof. 

(xii) The Corporation shall from time to time immediately after the occurrence of any event which requires an adjustment or readjustment as provided in subsection I (f), deliver a certificate of the Corporation to the Holder specifying the nature of the event requiring the same and the amount of the adjustment or readjustment necessitated thereby and setting forth in reasonable detail the method of calculation and the facts upon which such calculation is based. 

(xiii) The Corporation covenants to and in favour of the Holder that so long as this Warrant remains outstanding , it will give notice to the Holder of the effective date or of its intention to fix a record date for any event referred to in this subsection l(f) whether or not such action would give rise to an adjustment in the Exercise Price or the number and type of securities issuable upon the exercise of the Warrants, and , in each case, such notice shall specify the particulars of such event and the record date and the effective date for such event; provided that the Corporation shall only be required to specify in such notice such particulars of such event as have been fixed and determined on the date on which such notice is given. Such notice shall be given not less than 14 days in each case prior to such applicable record date or effective date. 

(xiv) The Corporation covenants with the Holder that it will not close its transfer books or take any other corporate action which might deprive the Holder of the opportunity to exercise its right of acquisition hereunder during the period of I 0 business days after the giving of the certificate set forth in subsection l(f)(xii). 

(xv) If the Corporation , after the date hereof, shall take any action affecting the Common Shares other than action described in subsection l(f), which in the 

23393871.2 
 
 reasonable opinion of the directors of the Corporation would materially affect the rights of the Holder, the Exercise Price and/or the Exchange Rate, the number of Common Shares which may be acquired upon exercise of the Warrants shall be adjusted in such manner and at such time, by action of the directors, acting reasonably and in good faith, in their sole discretion as they may determine to be equitable to the Holder in the circumstances, provided that no such adjustment will be made unless any requisite prior approval of any stock exchange on which the Common Shares are listed for trading has been obtained. 
 
 (xvi) No adjustments shall be made pursuant to this subsection 1 (f) if the Holder is entitled to participate in any event described in this subsection l(f) on the same terms, mutatis mutandis, as if the Holder had exercised their Warrants prior to, or on the effective date or record date of, such event. 

(xvii) If at any time a question or dispute arises with respect to adjustments provided for in this subsection I (f), such question or dispute will be conclusively determined by the auditor of the Corporation or, if they are unable or unwilling to act, by such other firm of independent chartered accountants as may be selected by action of the directors of the Corporation and any such determination, subject to regulatory approval and absent manifest error, will be binding upon the Corporation and the Holder. The Corporation will provide such auditor or chartered accountant with access to all necessary records of the Corporation. 

(g) Shares to be Reserved. The Corporation will at all times keep available and reserve out of its authorized Common Shares, solely for the purpose of issuing upon the exercise of the Warrants, such number of Common Shares as shall then be issuable upon the exercise of the Warrants. The Corporation covenants and agrees that all such Common Shares which shall be so issuable will, upon issuance and receipt of the Exercise Price therefor, be duly authorized and issued as fully paid and non assessable. The Corporation will take all such actions as may be necessary to ensure that all such Common Shares may be so issued without violation of any applicable requirements of any exchange upon which the Common Shares may be listed or in respect of which the Common Shares are qualified for unlisted trading privileges. The Corporation will take all such actions as are within its power to ensure that all such Common Shares may be so issued without violation of any applicable law. 

(h) Issue Tax . Upon the exercise of Warrants, the issuance of certificates, if any, for the Common Shares and the issuance of Ce1tificates for any unexercised Warrants shall be made without charge to the Holder, including for any issuance tax in respect thereto, provided that the Corporation shall not be required to pay any tax which may be payable in respect of any transfer involved in the issuance and delivery of any such certificate(s) in a name other than that of the Holder. 

(i) Current Market Price. For the purposes of any computation hereunder, the Current Market Price at any date shall be the volume weighted average trading price per Common Share for the 20 consecutive trading days ending five (5) trading days prior to the relevant date on the most senior stock exchange in Canada on which the Common Shares may then be listed and on which there is the greatest volume of trading of the Common Shares for such 20 day period, or, if the Common Shares or any other security in respect of which a detennination of Current Market Price is being made are not listed on any stock exchange, which includes the Canadian Securities Exchange, the Current Market Price shall be determined in good faith by the directors of the Corporation, which determination shall be conclusive, absent fraud or manifest error. The volume weighted average trading price shall be determined by dividing the aggregate sale price of all such Common Shares sold on the said exchange during the said 20 consecutive trading days by the total number of such Common Shares so sold.

 THIS CERTIFIES that, for value received, _________, ________________________________ (the Holder ), is the registered holder of __,____ warrants (collectively, the Warrants each a Warrant ), each Warrant entitling the Holder, subject to the terms and conditions set forth in this Warrant Certificate (the Certificate ), to purchase from TerrAscend Corp. (the Corporation ), one common share in the capital of the Corporation (a Common Share ), at any time commencing upon the Exercise Period Start Date (as defined herein) until 5:00 p.m. (Toronto time) on _________ ____, 2024, at which time the Warrants evidenced by this Certificate shall become wholly void and the unexercised portion of the subscription right represented hereby will expire and terminate (the Time of Expiry ), on payment of a price per Common Share equal to CAD 6.49 (the Exercise Price ). The number of Common Shares which the Holder is entitled to acquire upon exercise of the Warrants and the Exercise Price are subject to adjustment as hereinafter provided. 
 
 The Holder shall be entitled to the rights evidenced by this Certificate free from all equities and rights of set-off or counterclaim between the Corporation and the original or any interim holder and all persons may act accordingly and the receipt by the Holder of the Common Shares issuable upon exercise hereof shall be a good discharge to the Corporation. 
 
 1. Exercise of Warrants. 

(a) Exercise Period Start Date. The rights evidenced by this Certificate may not be exercised until (the Exercise Period Start Date the occurrence of the Triggering Event (as defined below), unless such restriction is waived by the Holder, in its sole and absolute discretion, in writing to the Corporation. Triggering Event is the date that the federal laws in the United States are amended to permit the general cultivation, distribution and possession of marijuana (as defined in 21 U.S.C 802) or to remove the regulation of such activities from the federal laws of the United States, or, if applicable, the stock exchange(s) on which securities of the Holder or its affiliates are listed permit the investment by the Holder in an entity that participates in the cultivation, distribution and possession of marijuana in the United States. 

(b) Election to Purchase . The rights evidenced by this Certificate may be exercised by the Holder in whole or in part and in accordance with the provisions hereof by delivery of an election to purchase in substantially the form attached hereto as Schedule 1 (the Election to Purchase ), properly completed and executed, together with payment by wire transfer, certified cheque or bank draft of the Exercise Price for the number of Common Shares specified in the Election to Purchase, at the office of the Corporation at 3610 Mavis Road, Mississauga, Ontario, L5C 1W2 or such other address in Canada as may be notified in writing by the Corporation (the Corporation Office ). In the event that the rights evidenced by this Certificate are exercised in part, the Corporation shall, contemporaneously with the issuance of the Common Shares issuable on the exercise of the Warrants so exercised, issue to the Holder 

a Warrant Certificate on identical terms in respect of that number of Common Shares in respect of which the Holder has not exercised the rights evidenced by this Certificate. 
 
 (c) Exercise . The Corporation shall, on the next business day after receiving a duly executed Election to Purchase and the Exercise Price for the number of Common Shares specified in the Election to Purchase (the Exercise Date ), issue that number of Common Shares specified in the Election to Purchase. 

(d) Certificates and Electronic Deposits . As promptly as practicable after the Exercise Date (but no later than three business days after the Exercise Date), the Corporation shall, as specified by the Holder in the Election to Purchase, either (i) issue and deliver to the Holder, registered in the name of the Holder, a certificate for the number of Common Shares issuable on exercise of the Warrants so exercised and a Certificate representing the balance of any unexercised Warrants, or (ii) in the case of the Common Shares, issue and cause to be deposited electronically with CDS Clearing and Depository Services Inc. CDS through the book-based system administered by CDS using the non-certificated inventory issue process that number of Common Shares issuable on exercise of the Warrants so exercised and, in the case of the Warrants, a Certificate representing the balance of any unexercised Warrants. To the extent permitted by law, such exercise shall be deemed to have been effected as of the close of business on the Exercise Date, and at such time the rights of the Holder with respect to the number of Warrants which have been exercised as such shall cease, and the Common Shares and any unexercised Warrants shall then be issuable upon such exercise as outlined above and the Holder shall be deemed to have become the holder of record of the Common Shares and unexercised Warrants represented thereby. Notwithstanding the above, all Common Shares issued to a United States accredited investor as defined in Rule 501(a) of Regulation D under the United States Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the U.S. Securities Act ), who is not a qualified institutional buyer (as that term is used in Rule 144A of the U.S. Securities Act), will be evidenced by physical certificates. 

(e) Fractional Common Shares . No fractional Common Shares shall be issued upon exercise of the Warrants represented by this Certificate. 

(f) Adjustments . The subscription rights in effect under the Warrants for Common Shares issuable upon the exercise of the Warrants shall be subject to adjustment from time to time as follows: 

(i) If, at any time from the date hereof until the Time of Expiry (the Adjustment Period ), the Corporation shall: 

(A) subdivide, re-divide or change its outstanding Common Shares and/or its non-voting and non-participating exchangeable shares in the capital of the Corporation (the Exchangeable Shares into a greater number of Common Shares or Exchangeable Shares; 

(B) reduce, combine or consolidate its outstanding Common Shares and/or Exchangeable Shares into a lesser number of Common Shares or Exchangeable Shares; or 

(C) issue Common Shares and/or Exchangeable Shares or securities exchangeable for, or convertible into, Common Shares and/or Exchangeable Shares to all or substantially all of the holders of Common Shares or Exchangeable Shares by way of stock dividend or other distribution (other than, if applicable, a dividend paid in the ordinary 

course or a distribution of Common Shares and/or Exchangeable Shares upon the exercise of warrants, options, restricted share units or other exchangeable or convertible securities of the Corporation); 
 
 (any of such events in subsections 1(f)(i)(A), (B) or (C) being called a Common Share Reorganization then, in each such event, the Exercise Price shall be adjusted as of the effective date or record date of such Common Share Reorganization, as the case may be, and shall, in the case of the events referred to in (A) or (C) above, be decreased in proportion to the increase in the number of outstanding Common Shares and/or Exchangeable Shares resulting from such subdivision, re-division, change or distribution, or shall, in the case of the events referred to in (B) above, be increased in proportion to the decrease in the number of outstanding Common Shares and/or Exchangeable Shares resulting from such reduction, combination or consolidation by multiplying the Exercise Price in effect immediately prior to such effective date or record date by a fraction, the numerator of which shall be the number of Common Shares outstanding on such effective date or record date before giving effect to such Common Share Reorganization and the denominator of which shall be the number of Common Shares outstanding as of the effective date or record date after giving effect to such Common Share Reorganization (including, in the case where securities exchangeable for or convertible into Common Shares are distributed, the number of Common Shares that would have been outstanding had such securities been exchanged for or converted into Common Shares on such record date or effective date). Such adjustment shall be made successively whenever any event referred to in this subsection 1(f)(i) shall occur. Upon any adjustment of the Exercise Price pursuant to subsection 1(f)(i), the Exchange Rate (as defined below) shall be contemporaneously adjusted by multiplying the number of Common Shares theretofore obtainable on the exercise thereof by a fraction of which the numerator shall be the Exercise Price in effect immediately prior to such adjustment and the denominator shall be the Exercise Price resulting from such adjustment. Exchange Rate means the number of Common Shares subject to the right of purchase under each Warrant, which, as of the date hereof, is one (1) Common Share for one (1) Warrant. 
 
 (ii) If and whenever at any time during the Adjustment Period, the Corporation shall fix a record date for the issuance of rights, options or warrants to all or substantially all the holders of its outstanding Common Shares and/or Exchangeable Shares entitling them, for a period expiring not more than 45 days after such record date, to subscribe for or purchase Common Shares and/or Exchangeable Shares (or securities convertible or exchangeable into Common Shares and/or Exchangeable Shares) at a price per Common Share (or having a conversion or exchange price per Common Share) less than 95 of the Current Market Price (as defined below) on such record date (a Rights Offering ), the Exercise Price shall be adjusted immediately after such record date so that it shall equal the amount determined by multiplying the Exercise Price in effect on such record date by a fraction, of which the numerator shall be the total number of Common Shares and/or Exchangeable Shares outstanding on such record date plus a number of Common Shares and/or Exchangeable Shares equal to the number arrived at by dividing the aggregate price of the total number of additional Common Shares and/or Exchangeable Shares offered for subscription or purchase (or the aggregate conversion or exchange price of the convertible or 

exchangeable securities so offered) by the Current Market Price, and of which the denominator shall be the total number of Common Shares and/or Exchangeable Shares outstanding on such record date plus the total number of additional Common Shares and/or Exchangeable Shares offered for subscription or purchase or into which the convertible or exchangeable securities so offered are convertible or exchangeable. Any Common Shares and/or Exchangeable Shares owned by or held for the account of the Corporation shall be deemed not to be outstanding for the purpose of any such computation. Such adjustment shall be made successively whenever such a record date is fixed. To the extent that no such rights or warrants are exercised prior to the expiration thereof, the Exercise Price shall be readjusted to the Exercise Price which would then be in effect if such record date had not been fixed or, if any such rights or warrants are exercised, to the Exercise Price which would then be in effect based upon the number of Common Shares and/or Exchangeable Shares (or securities convertible or exchangeable into Common Shares) actually issued upon the exercise of such rights or warrants, as the case may be. Upon any adjustment of the Exercise Price pursuant to this subsection 1(f)(ii), the Exchange Rate will be adjusted immediately after such record date so that it will equal the rate determined by multiplying the Exchange Rate in effect on such record date by a fraction, of which the numerator shall be the Exercise Price in effect immediately prior to such adjustment and the denominator shall be the Exercise Price resulting from such adjustment. Such adjustment will be made successively whenever such a record date is fixed, provided that if two or more such record dates or record dates referred to in this subsection 1(f)(ii) are fixed within a period of 25 trading days, such adjustment will be made successively as if each of such record date occurred on the earliest of such record dates. 
 
 (iii) If and whenever at any time during the Adjustment Period the Corporation shall fix a record date for the making of a distribution to all or substantially all the holders of its outstanding Common Shares and/or Exchangeable Shares of (i) securities of any class, whether of the Corporation or any other entity (other than Common Shares and/or Exchangeable Shares), (ii) rights, options or warrants to subscribe for or purchase Common Shares and/or Exchangeable Shares (or other securities convertible into or exchangeable for Common Shares and/or Exchangeable Shares), other than pursuant to a Rights Offering; (iii) evidences of its indebtedness or (iv) any cash, securities or other property or other assets (other than, if applicable, dividends paid in the ordinary course) and if such issue or distribution does not constitute a Common Share Reorganization, a Rights Offering or a distribution of Common Shares upon the exercise of Warrants or any outstanding options, then, in each such case, the Exercise Price shall be adjusted immediately after such record date so that it shall equal the price determined by multiplying the Exercise Price in effect on such record date by a fraction, of which the numerator shall be the total number of Common Shares and/or Exchangeable Shares outstanding on such record date multiplied by the Current Market Price on such record date, less the excess, if any, of the fair market value on such record date, as determined by the directors of the Corporation, acting reasonably (whose determination shall be conclusive, subject to stock exchange approval), of such cash, securities or other property or other assets so issued or distributed over the fair market value of any consideration received therefor by the Corporation from the holders of the Common Shares and/or Exchangeable Shares, and of which the denominator shall be the total 

number of Common Shares and/or Exchangeable Shares outstanding on such record date multiplied by the Current Market Price. Any Common Shares and/or Exchangeable Shares owned by or held for the account of the Corporation shall be deemed not to be outstanding for the purpose of any such computation. Such adjustment shall be made successively whenever such a record date is fixed. To the extent that such distribution is not so made, the Exercise Price shall be readjusted to the Exercise Price which would then be in effect if such record date had not been fixed. Upon any adjustment of the Exercise Price pursuant to this subsection 1(f)(iii), the Exchange Rate will be adjusted immediately after such record date so that it will equal the rate determined by multiplying the Exchange Rate in effect on such record date by a fraction, of which the numerator shall be the Exercise Price in effect immediately prior to such adjustment and the denominator shall be the Exercise Price resulting from such adjustment. Such adjustment will be made successively whenever such a record date is fixed, provided that if two or more such record dates or record dates referred to in this subsection 1(f)(iii) are fixed within a period of 25 trading days, such adjustment will be made successively as if each of such record date occurred on the earliest of such record dates. 
 
 (iv) If and whenever at any time during the Adjustment Period, there is a reclassification of the Common Shares and/or Exchangeable Shares or a capital reorganization of the Corporation other than as described in subsection 1(f)(i) or a consolidation, amalgamation, arrangement or merger of the Corporation with or into any other body corporate, trust, partnership or other entity, or a sale or conveyance of the property and assets of the Corporation as an entirety or substantially as an entirety to any other body corporate, trust, partnership or other entity, any Holder that has not exercised its Warrants prior to the effective date of such reclassification, capital reorganization, consolidation, amalgamation, arrangement or merger, sale or conveyance, upon the exercise of such Warrant thereafter, shall be entitled to receive upon payment of the Exercise Price and shall accept, in lieu of the number of Common Shares that prior to such effective date the Holder would have been entitled to receive, assuming the occurrence of a Triggering Event, the number of shares or other securities or property of the Corporation or of the body corporate, trust, partnership or other entity resulting from such merger, amalgamation or consolidation, or to which such sale or conveyance may be made, as the case may be, that such Holder would have been entitled to receive on such reclassification, capital reorganization, consolidation, amalgamation, arrangement or merger, sale or conveyance, if, on the effective date thereof, as the case may be, the Holder had been the registered holder of the number of Common Shares to which prior to such effective date it was entitled to acquire upon the exercise of the Warrants. If determined appropriate by the Corporation, relying on advice of legal counsel, to give effect to or to evidence the provisions of this subsection 1(f)(iv), the Corporation, its successor, or such purchasing body corporate, partnership, trust or other entity, as the case may be, shall, prior to or contemporaneously with any such reclassification, capital reorganization, consolidation, amalgamation, arrangement, merger, sale or conveyance, enter into an agreement or certificate which shall provide, to the extent possible, for the application of the provisions set forth in this Certificate with respect to the rights and interests thereafter of the Holder to the end that the provisions set forth in this Certificate shall thereafter correspondingly be made applicable, as nearly as may reasonably be, with respect to any shares, other 

securities or property to which the Holder is entitled on the exercise of its acquisition rights thereafter. Any agreement or certificate entered into between the Corporation, any successor to the Corporation or such purchasing body corporate, partnership, trust or other entity and the Holder shall provide for adjustments which shall be as nearly equivalent as may be practicable to the adjustments provided in this subsection 1(f) and which shall apply to successive reclassifications, capital reorganizations, amalgamations, consolidations, mergers, sales or conveyances arrangements. 
 
 (v) If and whenever at any time during the Adjustment Period the Corporation or a subsidiary of the Corporation shall make an issuer bid or a tender or exchange offer (other than an odd lot offer or a normal course issuer bid) to all or substantially all of the holders of Common Shares and/or Exchangeable Shares for all or any portion of the Common Shares and/or Exchangeable Shares where the cash and the value of any other consideration included in such payment per Common Share and/or Exchangeable Shares exceeds the Current Market Price on the trading day immediately preceding the commencement of the issuer bid or tender or exchange offer (any such issuer bid or tender or exchange offer being called an Issuer Bid ), the Exercise Price shall be adjusted to a price determined by multiplying the applicable Exercise Price in effect on the date of the completion of such Issuer Bid by a fraction, the numerator of which shall be the product of (A) the number of Common Shares and/or Exchangeable Shares outstanding immediately prior to the completion of the Issuer Bid (without giving effect to any reduction in respect of any tendered or exchanged shares) and (B) the Current Market Price on the trading day immediately preceding the commencement of the Issuer Bid, and the denominator of which shall be the sum of (A) the fair market value (determined by the board of directors of the Corporation, acting reasonably and in good faith) of the aggregate consideration paid by the Corporation or subsidiary to holders of Common Shares and/or Exchangeable Shares upon the completion of such Issuer Bid, and (B) the product of (I) the difference between the number of Common Shares and/or Exchangeable Shares outstanding immediately prior to the completion of the Issuer Bid (without giving effect to any reduction in respect of tendered or exchanged shares) and the number of Common Shares and/or Exchangeable Shares actually purchased by the Corporation or subsidiary pursuant to the Issuer Bid, and (II) the Current Market Price on the trading day immediately preceding the commencement of the Issuer Bid. 

(vi) In any case in which this subsection 1(f) shall require that an adjustment shall become effective immediately after a record date for an event referred to herein, the Corporation may defer, until the occurrence of such event, issuing to the Holder of any Warrant exercised after the record date and prior to completion of such event the additional Common Shares issuable by reason of the adjustment required by such event before giving effect to such adjustment; provided, however, that the Corporation shall deliver to the Holder an appropriate instrument evidencing the Holder s right to receive such additional Common Shares upon the occurrence of the event requiring such adjustment and the right to receive any distributions made on such additional Common Shares and/or Exchangeable Shares declared in favour of holders of record of Common Shares and/or Exchangeable Shares on and after the relevant date of exercise or such later date as the Holder would, but for the provisions of this subsection 1(f)(vi), 

have become the holder of record of such additional Common Shares pursuant to this subsection 1(f). 
 
 (vii) In any case in which subsection 1(f)(i)(C), subsection 1(f)(ii) or subsection 1(f)(iii) require that an adjustment be made to the Exercise Price, no such adjustment shall be made if the Holder of the outstanding Warrants receives, subject to any required stock exchange or regulatory approval, the rights or warrants referred to in subsection 1(f)(i)(C), subsection 1(f)(ii) or the shares, rights, options, warrants, evidences of indebtedness or assets referred to in subsection 1(f)(iii), as the case may be, in such kind and number as they would have received if they had been holders of Common Shares on the applicable record date or effective date, as the case may be, by virtue of their outstanding Warrants having then been exercised into Common Shares at the Exercise Price in effect on the applicable record date or effective date, as the case may be. 

(viii) The adjustments provided for in this subsection 1(f) are cumulative, and shall, in the case of adjustments to the Exercise Price be computed to the nearest whole cent and shall apply to successive subdivisions, re-divisions, reductions, combinations, consolidations, distributions, issues or other events resulting in any adjustment under the provisions of this subsection 1(f), provided that, notwithstanding any other provision of this Section, no adjustment of the Exercise Price shall be required unless such adjustment would require an increase or decrease of at least 1 in the Exercise Price then in effect or the number of Common Shares issuable upon the exercise of a Warrant by at least one one- hundredth of a Common Share; provided, however, that any adjustments which by reason of this subsection 1(f)(viii) are not required to be made shall be carried forward and taken into account in any subsequent adjustment. 

(ix) After any adjustment pursuant to this subsection 1(f), the term Common Shares , where used in this Certificate, shall be interpreted to mean securities of any class or classes which, as a result of such adjustment and all prior adjustments pursuant to this subsection 1(f), the Holder is entitled to receive upon the exercise of Warrants, and the number of Common Shares indicated by any exercise made pursuant to a Warrant shall be interpreted to mean the number of Common Shares or other property or securities the Holder is entitled to receive, as a result of such adjustment and all prior adjustments pursuant to this subsection 1(f), upon the full exercise of a Warrant. 

(x) All Common Shares or shares of any class or other securities, which the Holder is at the time in question entitled to receive on the exercise of its Warrant, whether or not as a result of adjustments made pursuant to this subsection 1(f), shall, for the purposes of the interpretation of this Certificate, be deemed to be Common Shares which such Holder is entitled to acquire pursuant to such Warrant. 

(xi) Notwithstanding anything in this subsection 1(f), no adjustment shall be made in the acquisition rights attached to the Warrants if the issue of Common Shares is being made pursuant to this Certificate or in connection with (a) any share incentive plan or restricted share unit plan or share purchase plan in force from time to time for directors, officers, employees, consultants or other service 

providers of the Corporation; or (b) the satisfaction of existing instruments issued as of the date hereof. 
 
 (xii) As a condition precedent to the taking of any action which would require an adjustment in any of the acquisition rights pursuant to any of the Warrants, including the number of Common Shares which are to be received upon the exercise thereof, the Corporation shall take any action which may, in the opinion of legal counsel, be necessary in order that the Corporation has unissued and reserved in its authorized capital and may validly and legally issue as fully paid and non-assessable all the Common Shares which the holders of such Warrants are entitled to receive on the full exercise thereof in accordance with the provisions hereof. 

(xiii) The Corporation shall from time to time immediately after the occurrence of any event which requires an adjustment or readjustment as provided in subsection 1(f), deliver a certificate of the Corporation to the Holder specifying the nature of the event requiring the same and the amount of the adjustment or readjustment necessitated thereby and setting forth in reasonable detail the method of calculation and the facts upon which such calculation is based. 

(xiv) 	The Corporation covenants to and in favour of the Holder that so long as this Warrant remains outstanding, it will give notice to the Holder of the effective date or of its intention to fix a record date for any event referred to in this subsection 1(f) whether or not such action would give rise to an adjustment in the Exercise Price or the number and type of securities issuable upon the exercise of the Warrants, and, in each case, such notice shall specify the particulars of such event and the record date and the effective date for such event; provided that the Corporation shall only be required to specify in such notice such particulars of such event as have been fixed and determined on the date on which such notice is given. Such notice shall be given not less than 14 days in each case prior to such applicable record date or effective date. 

(xv) The Corporation covenants with the Holder that it will not close its transfer books or take any other corporate action which might deprive the Holder of the opportunity to exercise its right of acquisition hereunder during the period of 10 business days after the giving of the certificate set forth in subsection 1(f)(xiii). 

(xvi) If the Corporation, after the date hereof, shall take any action affecting the Common Shares other than action described in subsection 1(f), which in the reasonable opinion of the directors of the Corporation would materially affect the rights of the Holder, the Exercise Price and/or the Exchange Rate, the number of Common Shares which may be acquired upon exercise of the Warrants shall be adjusted in such manner and at such time, by action of the directors, acting reasonably and in good faith, in their sole discretion as they may determine to be equitable to the Holder in the circumstances, provided that no such adjustment will be made unless any requisite prior approval of any stock exchange on which the Common Shares are listed for trading has been obtained. 

(xvii) No adjustments shall be made pursuant to this subsection 1(f) if the Holder is entitled to participate in any event described in this subsection 1(f) on the same 

terms, mutatis mutandis , as if the Holder had exercised their Warrants prior to, or on the effective date or record date of, such event. 
 
 (xviii) If at any time a question or dispute arises with respect to adjustments provided for in this subsection 1(f), such question or dispute will be conclusively determined by the auditor of the Corporation or, if they are unable or unwilling to act, by such other firm of independent chartered accountants as may be selected by action of the directors of the Corporation and any such determination, subject to regulatory approval and absent manifest error, will be binding upon the Corporation and the Holder. The Corporation will provide such auditor or chartered accountant with access to all necessary records of the Corporation. 

(g) Shares to be Reserved. The Corporation will at all times keep available and reserve out of its authorized Common Shares, solely for the purpose of issuing upon the exercise of the Warrants, such number of Common Shares as shall then be issuable upon the exercise of the Warrants. The Corporation covenants and agrees that all such Common Shares which shall be so issuable will, upon issuance and receipt of the Exercise Price therefor, be duly authorized and issued as fully paid and non- assessable. The Corporation will take all such actions as may be necessary to ensure that all such Common Shares may be so issued without violation of any applicable requirements of any exchange upon which the Common Shares may be listed or in respect of which the Common Shares are qualified for unlisted trading privileges. The Corporation will take all such actions as are within its power to ensure that all such Common Shares may be so issued without violation of any applicable law. 

(h) Issue Tax. Upon the exercise of Warrants, the issuance of certificates, if any, for the Common Shares and the issuance of Certificates for any unexercised Warrants shall be made without charge to the Holder, including for any issuance tax in respect thereto, provided that the Corporation shall not be required to pay any tax which may be payable in respect of any transfer involved in the issuance and delivery of any such certificate(s) in a name other than that of the Holder. 

(i) Listing . The Corporation will, at its expense and as expeditiously as possible, use its reasonable commercial efforts to cause all Common Shares issuable upon the exercise of the Warrants to be duly listed on the Canadian Securities Exchange and/or any other stock exchange upon which the Common Shares may be then listed prior to the issuance of such Common Shares. 

(j) Current Market Price . For the purposes of any computation hereunder, the Current Market Price at any date shall be the volume weighted average trading price per Common Share for the 20 consecutive trading days ending five (5) trading days prior to the relevant date on the most senior stock exchange in Canada on which the Common Shares may then be listed and on which there is the greatest volume of trading of the Common Shares for such 20 day period, or, if the Common Shares or any other security in respect of which a determination of Current Market Price is being made are not listed on any stock exchange, which includes the Canadian Securities Exchange, the Current Market Price shall be determined in good faith by the directors of the Corporation, which determination shall be conclusive, absent fraud or manifest error. The volume weighted average trading price shall be determined by dividing the aggregate sale price of all such Common Shares sold on the said exchange during the said 20 consecutive trading days by the total number of such Common Shares so sold. 

2. Transfer of Warrants. No transfer of the Warrants represented by this Certificate shall be effective unless this Certificate is accompanied by a duly executed transfer form in substantially the form attached hereto as Schedule 2 (the Transfer Form or such other instrument of transfer in such form as the Corporation may from time to time prescribe and delivered to the Corporation.

- 7 - 

(ii) fix a record date for the distribution to, or make a distribution to, the holders of all or substantially all of the outstanding Common Shares payable in Common Shares or securities exchangeable or exercisable for or convertible into Common Shares; 

(iii) subdivide, re-divide or otherwise change the outstanding Common Shares into a greater number of Common Shares; or 

(iv) reduce, combine or consolidate the outstanding Common Shares into a lesser number of Common Shares, 

(any of such events in subclauses 8(2)(a)(i), 8(2)(a)(ii), 8(2)(a)(iii) and 8(2)(a)(iv) above being herein called a Common Share Reorganization ), the Exercise Price shall be adjusted on the earlier of the record date on which holders of Common Shares are determined for the purposes of the Common Share Reorganization and the effective date of the Common Share Reorganization to the amount determined by multiplying the Exercise Price in effect immediately prior to such record date or effective date, as the case may be, by a fraction: 
 
 A. the numerator of which shall be the number of Common Shares outstanding on such record date or effective date, as the case may be, before giving effect to such Common Share Reorganization; and 

B. the denominator of which shall be the number of Common Shares which will be outstanding immediately after giving effect to such Common Share Reorganization (including, in the case of a distribution of securities exchangeable or exercisable for or convertible into Common Shares, the number of Common Shares that would have been outstanding had all such securities been exchanged or exercised for or converted into Common Shares on such effective date or record date). 

To the extent that any adjustment in the Exercise Price occurs pursuant to this clause 8(2)(a) as a result of the fixing by the Corporation of a record date for the distribution of securities exchangeable or exercisable for or convertible into Common Shares, the Exercise Price shall be readjusted immediately after the expiry of any relevant exchange, exercise or conversion right to the Exercise Price which would then be in effect based upon the number of Common Shares actually issued and remaining issuable after such expiry and shall be further readjusted in such manner upon the expiry of any further such right. Any Warrantholder who has not exercised his right to subscribe for and purchase Common Shares on or prior to the record date of such stock dividend or distribution or the effective date of such subdivision or consolidation, as the case may be, upon the exercise of such right thereafter shall be entitled to receive and shall accept in lieu of the number of Common Shares then subscribed for and purchased by such Warrantholder, at the Exercise Price determined in accordance with this clause 8(2)(a), the aggregate number of Common Shares that such Warrantholder would 

CAN_DMS: \143912914\4 

- 8 - 

have been entitled to receive as a result of such Common Share Reorganization, if, on such record date or effective date, as the case may be, such Warrantholder had been the holder of record of the number of Common Shares so subscribed for and purchased. 
 
 (b) If, at any time during the Adjustment Period, the Corporation shall fix a record date for the issue or distribution to the holders of all or substantially all of the outstanding Common Shares of rights, options or warrants pursuant to which such holders are entitled, during a period expiring not more than 90 days after the record date for such issue (such period being the Rights Period ), to subscribe for or purchase Common Shares or securities exchangeable or exercisable for or convertible into Common Shares at a price per share to the holder (or, in the case of securities exchangeable or exercisable for or convertible into Common Shares, at an exchange, exercise or conversion price per share) at the date of issue of such securities of less than 95 of the Current Market Price of the Common Shares on such record date (any of such events being called a Rights Offering ), the Exercise Price shall be adjusted effective immediately after the record date for such Rights Offering to the amount determined by multiplying the Exercise Price in effect on such record date by a fraction: 

(i) the numerator of which shall be the aggregate of 

A. the number of Common Shares outstanding as of the record date for the Rights Offering, and 

B. the quotient determined by dividing 

(1) either (a) where the event giving rise to the application of this section 6(2)(b) was the issue or distribution of rights, options or warrants to the holders of Common Shares under which such holders are entitled to subscribe for or purchase additional Common Shares, the product of the maximum number of Common Shares offered during the Rights Period pursuant to the Rights Offering and the price at which such Common Shares are offered, or (b) where the event giving rise to the application of this Section 6(2)(b) was the issue or distribution of rights, options or warrants to the holders of Common Shares under which such holders are entitled to subscribe for or purchase securities exchangeable or exercisable for or convertible into Common Shares, the product of the exchange, exercise or conversion price of the securities so offered and the maximum number of Common Shares for or into which the securities offered pursuant to the Rights Offering may be exchanged, exercised or converted, as the case may be, by 

CAN_DMS: \143912914\4 

- 9 - 

(2) the Current Market Price of the Common Shares as of the record date for the Rights Offering; and 

(ii) the denominator of which shall be the aggregate of the number of Common Shares outstanding on such record date and the number of Common Shares offered pursuant to the Rights Offering (including, in the case of the issue or distribution of securities exchangeable or exercisable for or convertible into Common Shares, the number of Common Shares for or into which such securities may be exchanged, exercised or converted). 

If, by the terms of the rights, options or warrants referred to in this clause 8(2)(b), there is more than one purchase, exchange, exercise or conversion price per Common Share, the aggregate price of the total number of additional Common Shares offered for subscription or purchase, or the aggregate exchange, exercise or conversion price of the exchangeable, exercisable or convertible securities so offered, shall be calculated for purposes of the adjustment on the basis of the lowest purchase, exchange, exercise or conversion price per Common Share, as the case may be. Any Common Shares owned by or held for the account of the Corporation shall be deemed not to be outstanding for the purpose of any such calculation. To the extent that any adjustment in the Exercise Price occurs pursuant to this clause 8(2)(b) as a result of the fixing by the Corporation of a record date for the issue or distribution of rights, options or warrants referred to in this clause 8(2)(b), the Exercise Price shall be readjusted immediately after the expiry of any relevant exchange, exercise or conversion right to the Exercise Price which would then be in effect based upon the number of Common Shares actually issued and remaining issuable after such expiry and shall be further readjusted in such manner upon the expiry of any further such right. 
 
 (c) If, at any time during the Adjustment Period, the Corporation shall fix a record date for the issue or distribution to the holders of all or substantially all of the outstanding Common Shares of: 

(i) shares of the Corporation of any class other than Common Shares; 

(ii) rights, options or warrants to acquire Common Shares or securities exchangeable or exercisable for or convertible into Common Shares (other than rights, options or warrants pursuant to which holders of Common Shares are entitled, during a period expiring not more than 90 days after the record date for such issue, to subscribe for or purchase Common Shares or securities exchangeable or exercisable for or convertible into Common Shares at a price per share (or, in the case of securities exchangeable or exercisable for or convertible into Common Shares, at an exchange, exercise or conversion price per share) on the record date for the issue of such securities to the holder of at least 95 of the Current Market Price of the Common Shares on such record date); 

(iii) evidences of indebtedness of the Corporation; or 

CAN_DMS: \143912914\4 

- 10 - 

(iv) any property or assets of the Corporation; 

and if such issue or distribution does not constitute a Common Share Reorganization or a Rights Offering (any of such non-excluded events being herein called a Special Distribution ), the Exercise Price shall be adjusted effective immediately after the record date for the Special Distribution to the amount determined by multiplying the Exercise Price in effect on such record date for the Special Distribution by a fraction: 
 
 A. the numerator of which shall be the difference between 

(1) the product of the number of Common Shares outstanding on such record date and the Current Market Price of the Common Shares on such record date, and 

(2) the aggregate fair market value, as determined by action by nationally or internationally recognized and independent firm of chartered accountants as may be selected by action by the directors of the Corporation, and subject to the approval of any stock exchange on which the Shares may then be listed, where required, to the holders of Common Shares of the shares, rights, options, warrants, evidences of indebtedness or property or assets to be issued or distributed in the Special Distribution, and 

B. the denominator of which shall be the product obtained by multiplying the number of Common Shares outstanding on such record date by the Current Market Price of the Common Shares on such record date. 

Any Common Shares owned by or held for the account of the Corporation shall be deemed not to be outstanding for the purpose of such calculation. To the extent that any adjustment in the Exercise Price occurs pursuant to this clause 8(2)(c) as a result of the fixing by the Corporation of a record date for the issue or distribution of rights, options or warrants to acquire Common Shares or securities exchangeable or exercisable for or convertible into Common Shares referred to in this clause 8(2)(c), the Exercise Price shall be readjusted immediately after the expiry of any relevant exchange, exercise or conversion right to the amount which would then be in effect based upon the number of Common Shares issued and remaining issuable after such expiry and shall be further readjusted in such manner upon the expiry of any further such right. To the extent that such Special Distribution is not ultimately so made, the Exercise Price shall then be readjusted to the Exercise Price which would then be in effect if such record date had not been fixed. 
 
 (d) If, at any time during the Adjustment Period, there shall occur:

(ii) a consolidation, amalgamation, arrangement or merger of the Corporation with or into another body corporate which results in a reclassification or redesignation of the Common Shares or a change of the Common Shares into other shares or securities; or 

(iii) the transfer of the undertaking or assets of the Corporation as an entirety or substantially as an entirety to another corporation or entity; 

(any of such events being called a Capital Reorganization ), after the effective date of the Capital Reorganization, the Warrants shall remain outstanding and the Warrantholder shall be entitled to receive, upon exercising any of the Warrants after the effective date of such Capital Reorganization, in lieu of the number of Common Shares to which the Warrantholder was theretofore entitled upon the exercise of the Warrants, the kind and aggregate number of shares and other securities or property resulting from the Capital Reorganization which the Warrantholder would have been entitled to receive as a result of the Capital Reorganization if, on the effective date thereof, the Warrantholder had been the registered holder of the number of Common Shares which the Warrantholder was theretofore entitled to purchase or receive upon the exercise of the Warrants. If necessary, as a result of any such Capital Reorganization, appropriate adjustments shall be made in the application of the provisions of this Warrant Certificate with respect to the rights and interests thereafter of the Warrantholder to the end that the provisions of this Section 6 shall thereafter correspondingly be made applicable as nearly as may reasonably be possible in relation to any shares or other securities or property thereafter deliverable upon the exercise of the Warrants and the Corporation or any successor corporation or entity shall be entitled to deliver a replacement certificate representing the rights and interests of the Warrantholder as a result of such Capital Reorganization. 
 
 (e) If, at any time during the Adjustment Period, any adjustment or readjustment in the Exercise Price shall occur pursuant to the provisions of clause 8(2)(a), 8(2)(b) or 8(2)(c) of this Warrant Certificate, then the number of Common Shares purchasable upon the subsequent exercise of the Warrants shall be simultaneously adjusted or readjusted, as the case may be, by multiplying the number of Common Shares purchasable upon the exercise of the Warrants immediately prior to such adjustment or readjustment by a fraction which shall be the reciprocal of the fraction used in the adjustment or readjustment of the Exercise Price. 

(3) Rules : The following rules and procedures shall be applicable to adjustments made pursuant to subsection 8(2) of this Warrant Certificate: 

CAN_DMS: \143912914\4 

- 12 - 

(a) If any event of the type contemplated by the provisions of this Section 6 but not expressly provided for by such provisions (including, without limitation, the granting of stock appreciation rights, phantom stock rights or other rights with equity features) occurs, then the board of directors of the Corporation shall promptly make an appropriate adjustment in the Exercise Price and the number of Common Shares issuable upon exercise of this Warrant so as to protect the rights of the Warrantholder in a manner consistent with the provisions of this Section 8; provided, that no such adjustment pursuant to this Section 8 shall increase the Exercise Price or decrease the number of Common Shares issuable as otherwise determined pursuant to this Section 8. 

(b) If more than one subsection of Section 8 is applicable to a single event, the subsection shall be applied that produces the largest adjustment and no single event shall cause an adjustment under more than one subsection of Section 8 so as to result in duplication. 

(c) Subject to the following clauses of this subsection 8(3), any adjustment made pursuant to subsection 8(2) hereof shall be made successively whenever an event referred to therein shall occur, and will, in the case of adjustments to the Exercise Price, be computed to the nearest one-tenth of one cent and will be made successively whenever an event referred to therein occurs, subject to the following subsections of this Section 8. 

(d) Notwithstanding any other provision of subsection 8(2) hereof, no adjustment of the Exercise Price shall be made which would result in an increase in the Exercise Price or a decrease in the number of Common Shares issuable upon the exercise of the Warrants (except in respect of the Common Share Reorganization described in subclause 8(2)(a)(iv) hereof or a Capital Reorganization described in subclause 8(2)(d)(ii) hereof). 

(e) No adjustment in the Exercise Price or in the number or kind of securities purchasable upon the exercise of the Warrants shall be made in respect of any event described in section 8 hereof if the Warrantholder is entitled to participate in such event on the same terms mutatis mutandis as if the Warrantholder had exercised the Warrants prior to or on the record date or effective date, as the case may be, of such event. 

(f) No adjustment in the Exercise Price or in the number of Common Shares purchasable upon the exercise of the Warrants shall be made pursuant to subsection 8(2) hereof in respect of the issue from time to time of Common Shares pursuant to this Warrant Certificate or pursuant to any stock option, stock purchase or stock bonus plan in effect from time to time for directors, officers or employees of the Corporation and any such issue, and any grant of options in connection therewith, shall be deemed not to be a Common Share Reorganization, a Rights Offering nor any other event described in subsection 8(2) hereof. 

CAN_DMS: \143912914\4 

- 13 - 

(g) If, at any time during the Adjustment Period, the Corporation shall take any action affecting the Common Shares, other than an action or event described in subsection 8(2) hereof, which, in the opinion of the directors of the Corporation, would have a material adverse effect upon the rights of Warrantholders, either or both the Exercise Price and the number of Common Shares purchasable upon exercise of the Warrants shall be adjusted in such manner and at such time by action by the directors of the Corporation, in their sole discretion, as may be equitable in the circumstances. Failure of the taking of action by the directors of the Corporation so as to provide for an adjustment prior to the effective date of any action by the Corporation affecting the Common Shares shall be deemed to be conclusive evidence that the directors of the Corporation have determined that it is equitable to make no adjustment in the circumstances. 

(h) If the Corporation shall set a record date to determine holders of Common Shares for the purpose of entitling such holders to receive any dividend or distribution or any subscription or purchase rights and shall, thereafter and before the distribution to such holders of any such dividend, distribution or subscription or purchase rights, legally abandon its plan to pay or deliver such dividend, distribution or subscription or purchase rights, then no adjustment in the Exercise Price or the number of Common Shares purchasable upon the exercise of the Warrants shall be required by reason of the setting of such record date. 

(i) In any case in which this Warrant Certificate shall require that an adjustment shall become effective immediately after a record date for an event referred to in subsection 8(2) hereof, the Corporation may defer, until the occurrence of such event: 

(i) issuing to the Warrantholder, to the extent that the Warrants are exercised after such record date and before the occurrence of such event, the additional Common Shares or other securities issuable upon such exercise by reason of the adjustment required by such event; and 

(ii) delivering to the Warrantholder any distribution declared with respect to such additional Common Shares or other securities after such record date and before such event; 

provided, however, that the Corporation shall deliver to the Warrantholder an appropriate instrument evidencing the right of the Warrantholder upon the occurrence of the event requiring the adjustment, to an adjustment in the Exercise Price or the number of Common Shares purchasable upon the exercise of the Warrants and to such distribution declared with respect to any such additional Common Shares issuable upon the exercise of the Warrants. 
 
 (j) In the absence of a resolution of the directors of the Corporation fixing a record date for a Rights Offering, the Corporation shall be deemed to have 

CAN_DMS: \143912914\4 

- 14 - 

fixed as the record date therefor the date of the issue of the rights, options or warrants issued pursuant to the Rights Offering. 
 
 (k) If a dispute shall at any time arise with respect to adjustments of the Exercise Price or the number of Common Shares purchasable upon the exercise of the Warrants, such disputes shall be conclusively determined by the auditors of the Corporation or if they are unable or unwilling to act, by such other firm of independent chartered accountants as may be selected by the directors of the Corporation and any such determination shall be conclusive evidence of the correctness of any adjustment made pursuant to subsection 8(2) hereof and shall be binding upon the Corporation and the Warrantholder. 

(l) As a condition precedent to the taking of any action which would require an adjustment pursuant to subsection 8(2) hereof, including the Exercise Price and the number or class of Common Shares or other securities which are to be received upon the exercise thereof, the Corporation shall take any action which may, in the opinion of counsel to the Corporation, be necessary in order that the Corporation may validly and legally issue as fully paid and non- assessable shares all of the Common Shares or other securities which the Warrantholder is entitled to receive in accordance with the provisions of this Warrant Certificate 

(m) As promptly as reasonably practicable following any adjustment of the Exercise Price, the Corporation shall furnish to the Warrantholder a certificate of an executive officer setting forth in reasonable detail such adjustment and the facts upon which it is based and certifying the calculation thereof. 

(4) Notice : At least 21 days prior to the earlier of the record date or effective date of any event which requires or might require an adjustment in any of the rights of the Warrantholder under this Warrant Certificate, including the Exercise Price or the number of Common Shares which may be purchased under this Warrant Certificate, the Corporation shall deliver to the Warrantholder a certificate of the Corporation specifying the particulars of such event and, if determinable, the required adjustment and the calculation of such adjustment. In case any adjustment for which a notice in this subsection 8(4) has been given is not then determinable, the Corporation shall promptly after such adjustment is determinable deliver to the Warrantholder a certificate providing the calculation of such adjustment. The Corporation hereby covenants and agrees that the register of transfers and share transfer books for the Common Shares will be open, and that the Corporation will not take any action which might deprive the Warrantholder of the opportunity of exercising the rights of subscription contained in this Warrant Certificate, during such 21 day period.

10. No Obligation to Purchase .

 (i) upon the First Vesting Date, that number of Warrants having an aggregate Black- 

Scholes Warrant Value as of such date of US 500,000; plus 
 
 (ii) upon the First Vesting Date, that number of Warrants having an aggregate Black- Scholes Warrant Value as of such date of US 500,000 (the Restricted Warrants plus 

(iii) upon the Second Vesting Date, that number of Warrants having an aggregate Black-Scholes Warrant Value as of such date of US 500,000; plus 

(iv) upon the Third Vesting Date, that number of Warrants having an aggregate Black-Scholes Warrant Value as of such date of US 500,000, 

provided that, notwithstanding the foregoing, if the License Agreement is terminated pursuant to Section 10(b)(i), Section 10(b)(iv) or Section 10(c)(i)-(iii) thereof, then the number of Warrants issued under this Warrant certificate shall equal the number of Warrants vested pursuant hereto as of the date of such termination, less that number of Restricted Warrants if such termination occurs within 12 months of the Issue Date, and no additional Warrants shall be deemed to be vested or issued thereafter. 
 
 2. Warrants. Each Warrant shall entitle the Holder to purchase one subordinate voting share in the capital of the Corporation (a Share as constituted on the applicable Vesting Date at the applicable Exercise Price until the applicable Expiry Time, provided that the Holder shall not be permitted to exercise the Restricted Warrants until after the first anniversary of the Issue Date. 

3. Non-Transferable. The Warrants evidenced hereby (or any portion thereof) may not be assigned or transferred by the Holder, other than to the Holder's Affiliates (subject to compliance with applicable securities law). If this Warrant is to be transferred, in whole or in part, the Holder shall surrender this Warrant certificate to the Company, whereupon the Company will forthwith issue and deliver upon the order of the Holder a new Warrant, registered as the Holder may request, representing the right to purchase the number of Warrants being transferred by the Holder and, if less than the total number of Warrants then underlying this Warrant certificate is being transferred, a new Warrant certificate to the Holder representing the right to purchase the number of Warrant Shares not being transferred. 

4. Warrants Exercise Procedure. 

(a) Generally . The Warrants represented by this Warrant certificate may be exercised in whole or in part at any time prior to the applicable Expiry Time by surrendering the original of this Warrant certificate at the offices of the Corporation set out in subsection 19(i) hereof together with a subscription form in the form attached as Schedule B hereto duly completed and executed (the Exercise Notice ), such additional documents as may be contemplated thereby, and either (x) a certified cheque, bank draft or money order in U.S. Dollars payable to or to the order of the Corporation or 

(y) by wire transfer as directed by the Corporation. 
 
 (b) Cashless Exercise . Notwithstanding anything contained herein to the contrary, the Holder may, in its sole discretion, exercise this Warrant, in whole or in part, at such time by means of a cashless exercise in which the Holder shall be entitled to receive upon such exercise the Net Number of Shares determined according to the following formula (a Cashless Exercise ): 

- 4 - 
 NATDOCS\55984569\V-3 
 
 Net Number = (A x B) - (A x C) 
 B 
 
 For purposes of the foregoing formula: 
 
 A= the total number of Shares with respect to which this Warrant is then being exercised. 
 
 B = the Current Market Price of the Shares on the Trading Day immediately preceding the date of the applicable Exercise Notice. 
 
 C = the applicable Exercise Price then in effect for the applicable Warrants on the date of the applicable Exercise Notice. 
 
 For purposes of Rule 144(d) promulgated under the 1933 Act, the Corporation hereby acknowledges and agrees that the Shares issued in a Cashless Exercise shall be deemed to have been acquired by the Holder, and the holding period for the Shares shall be deemed to have commenced, on the date this Warrant was originally issued. The Company agrees not to take any position contrary to this Section 4(b). 
 
 5. Register of Warrantholders. The Corporation shall cause a register (the Register to be kept in which shall be entered the names and addresses of all holders of the Warrants and the number of Warrants held by each of them. The Corporation may treat the registered holder of any certificate representing Warrants as the absolute owner of the Warrants represented thereby for all purposes, and the Corporation shall not be affected by any notice or knowledge to the contrary except where the Corporation is required to take notice by statute or by order of a court of competent jurisdiction. 

6. Partial Exercise . The Holder may subscribe for and purchase a number of Shares less than the full number of Shares entitled to be subscribed for and purchased hereunder. In the event that the Holder subscribes for and purchases less than the full number of Shares entitled to be subscribed for and purchased under this Warrant certificate prior to the applicable Expiry Time, the Holder shall be entitled to receive and the Corporation shall issue, without charge, a new Warrant certificate to the Holder in substantially the same form as this Warrant certificate with appropriate changes to reflect the unexercised balance of the Warrants. 

7. Delivery of Shares . As soon as practicable and, in any event, within three Business Days of receipt by the Corporation of this Warrant certificate in accordance with, and the documents and payment (if any) noted in Section 4, the Corporation will deliver a certificate(s) or a DRS statement(s) representing the Shares subscribed for and purchased by the Holder hereunder, and a replacement Warrant certificate, if any, or, if applicable upon the Holder's request, the Corporation shall credit such aggregate number of Shares to which the Holder is entitled pursuant to such exercise to the Holder's or its designee's balance account with DTC or CDS, as applicable, through its custodian system. The Corporation shall pay any and all transfer, stamp, issuance and similar taxes, fees, costs, and expenses (including, without limitation, fees and expenses of the Company's transfer agent) that may be payable with respect to the issuance and delivery of Shares upon exercise of this Warrant. The Corporation's obligations to issue and deliver Shares in accordance with the terms and subject to the conditions hereof are absolute and unconditional, irrespective of any action or inaction by the Holder to enforce the same, any waiver or consent with respect to any provision hereof, the recovery of any judgment against any person or any action to enforce the same, or any setoff, counterclaim, recoupment, limitation or termination. 

8. No Rights of Shareholders . Nothing contained in this Warrant certificate shall be construed as conferring upon the Holder any right or interest whatsoever as a holder of Shares of the Corporation or any other right or interest except as herein expressly provided.

 NATDOCS\55984569\V-3 
 
 9. Adjustment of Subscription and Purchase Rights. 

The applicable Exercise Price in effect at any time is subject to adjustment from time to time in the events and in the manner provided as follows: 
 
 (a) If and whenever at any time after the date hereof and prior to the applicable Expiry Time, the Corporation: 

(i) issues Shares or securities exchangeable for or convertible into Shares to all or substantially all the holders of the Shares as a stock dividend; or 

(ii) makes a distribution on its outstanding Shares payable in Shares or securities exchangeable for or convertible into Shares; or 

(iii) subdivides its outstanding Shares into a greater number of shares; or 

(iv) consolidates its outstanding Shares into a smaller number of shares; 

(any of such events being called a Share Reorganization ), then the applicable Exercise Price will be adjusted effective immediately after the effective date or record date for the happening of a Share Reorganization, as the case may be, at which the holders of Shares are determined for the purpose of the Share Reorganization by multiplying the applicable Exercise Price in effect immediately prior to such effective date or record date by a fraction, the numerator of which is the number of Shares outstanding on such effective date or record date before giving effect to such Share Reorganization and the denominator of which is the number of Shares outstanding immediately after giving effect to such Share Reorganization (including, in the case where securities exchangeable for or convertible into Shares are distributed, the number of Shares that would have been outstanding had all such securities been exchanged for or converted into Shares on such effective date or record date). 
 
 (b) If and whenever at any time after the date hereof and prior to the applicable Expiry Time, the Corporation fixes a record date for the issue of rights, options or warrants to the holders of all or substantially all of its outstanding Shares under which such holders are entitled to subscribe for or purchase Shares or securities exchangeable for or convertible into Shares, where: 

(i) the right to subscribe for or purchase Shares, or the right to exchange securities for or convert securities into Shares, expires not more than 45 days after the date of such issue (the period from the record date to the date of expiry being herein in this Section 9 called the Rights Period ), and 

(ii) the cost per Share during the Rights Period (inclusive of any cost of acquisition of securities exchangeable for or convertible into Shares in addition to any direct cost of Shares) (herein in this Section 9 called the Per Share Cost is less than 95 of the Current Market Price of the Shares on the record date, 

(any of such events being called a Rights Offering ), then the applicable Exercise Price will be adjusted effective immediately after the end of the Rights Period to a price determined by multiplying the applicable Exercise Price in effect immediately prior to the end of the Rights Period by a fraction: 
 
 (A) the numerator of which is the aggregate of: 

- 6 - 
 NATDOCS\55984569\V-3 
 
 (1) the number of Shares outstanding as of the record date for the Rights Offering; and 

(2) a number determined by dividing the product of the Per Share Cost and: 

(I) where the event giving rise to the application of this subsection 9(b) was the issue of rights, options or warrants to the holders of Shares under which such holders are entitled to subscribe for or purchase additional Shares, the number of Shares so subscribed for or purchased during the Rights Period, or 

(II) where the event giving rise to the application of this subsection 9(b) was the issue of rights, options or warrants to the holders of Shares under which such holders are entitled to subscribe for or purchase securities exchangeable for or convertible into Shares, the number of Shares for which those securities so subscribed for or purchased during the Rights Period could have been exchanged or into which they could have been converted during the Rights Period, 

by the Current Market Price of the Shares as of the record date for the Rights Offering; and 
 
 (B) the denominator of which is: 

(1) in the case described in subparagraph 9(b)(A)(2)(I), the number of Shares outstanding, or 

(2) in the case described in subparagraph 9(b)(A)(2)(II), the number of Shares that would be outstanding if all the Shares described in subparagraph 9(b)(A)(2)(II) had been issued, 

as at the end of the Rights Period. 
 
 Any Shares owned by or held for the account of the Corporation or any subsidiary or affiliate (as defined in the Securities Act (Ontario)) of the Corporation will be deemed not to be outstanding for the purpose of any such computation. 
 
 If by the terms of the rights, options or warrants referred to in this Section 9, there is more than one purchase, conversion or exchange price per Share, the aggregate price of the total number of additional Shares offered for subscription or purchase, or the aggregate conversion or exchange price of the convertible securities so offered, will be calculated for purposes of the adjustment on the basis of: 
 
 (I) the lowest purchase, conversion or exchange price per Share, as the case may be, if such price is applicable to all Shares which are subject to the rights, options or warrants, and 

(II) the average purchase, conversion or exchange price per Share, as the case may be, if the applicable price is determined by reference to the number of Shares acquired. 

To the extent that any adjustment in the applicable Exercise Price occurs pursuant to this Section 9 as a result of the fixing by the Corporation of a record date for the distribution of rights, options or warrants referred to in this Section 9, the applicable Exercise Price will 

- 7 - 
 NATDOCS\55984569\V-3 
 
 be readjusted immediately after the expiration of any relevant exchange, conversion or exercise right to the applicable Exercise Price which would then be in effect based upon the number of Shares actually issued and remaining issuable after such expiration, and will be further readjusted in such manner upon expiration of any further such right. To the extent that such Rights Offering is not ultimately so made, the applicable Exercise Price shall be readjusted to the applicable Exercise Price which would then be in effect if such record date had not been fixed. 
 
 If the Holder has exercised this Warrant in accordance herewith during the period beginning immediately after the record date for a Rights Offering and ending on the last day of the Rights Period therefor (the Entitlement Period ), the Holder will, in addition to the Shares to which it is otherwise entitled upon such exercise, be entitled to that number of additional Shares equal to the result obtained when (A) the applicable Exercise Price in effect immediately prior to the end of such Rights Offering pursuant to this subsection is multiplied by the number of Shares received upon the exercise of this Warrant during such period, (B) the resulting product is divided by the applicable Exercise Price as adjusted for such Rights Offering pursuant to this subsection, and (C) the number of Shares acquired by the Holder during the Entitlement Period in accordance with the terms hereof is subtracted from the resulting divided product; provided that the provisions of Section 12 will be applicable to any fractional interest in a Share to which such Holder might otherwise be entitled. Such additional Shares will be deemed to have been issued to the Holder immediately following the end of the Rights Period and a certificate for such additional Shares will be delivered to such Holder within 10 Business Days following the end of the Rights Period. 
 
 (c) If and whenever at any time after the date hereof and prior to the applicable Expiry Time, the Corporation fixes a record date for the issue or the distribution to the holders of all or substantially all its Shares of: 

(i) shares of the Corporation of any class other than Shares; 

(ii) rights, options or warrants to acquire shares or securities exchangeable for or convertible into shares or property or other assets of the Corporation; 

(iii) evidence of indebtedness; or 

(iv) any property or other assets, 

and if such issuance or distribution does not constitute (A) a Share Reorganization, (B) a Rights Offering, or (C) the issue of rights, options or warrants to the holders of all or substantially all of its outstanding Shares under which such holders are entitled to subscribe for or purchase Shares or securities exchangeable for or convertible into Shares, where: 
 
 (a) the right to subscribe for or purchase Shares, or the right to exchange securities for or convert securities into Shares, expires not more than 45 days after the date of such issue, and 

(b) the cost per Share during the Rights Period, inclusive of the Per Share Cost, is 95 or more than the Current Market Price of the Shares on the record date, 

(any of such non-excluded events being called a Special Distribution ), the applicable Exercise Price will be adjusted effective immediately after such record date to a price determined by multiplying the applicable Exercise Price in effect on such record date by a 

- 8 - 
 NATDOCS\55984569\V-3 
 
 fraction: 
 
 (A) the numerator of which is: 

(1) the product of the number of Shares outstanding on such record date and the Current Market Price of the Shares on such record date; less 

(2) the aggregate fair market value (as determined by action by the directors of the Corporation, subject, however, to the prior written consent of the Exchange, where required) to the holders of the Shares of such securities or property or other assets so issued or distributed in the Special Distribution; and 

(B) the denominator of which is the number of Shares outstanding on such record date multiplied by the Current Market Price of the Shares on such record date. 

Any Shares owned by or held for the account of the Corporation or any subsidiary or affiliate (as defined in the Securities Act (Ontario)) of the Corporation will be deemed not to be outstanding for the purpose of any such computation. To the extent that such Special Distribution is not ultimately so made, the applicable Exercise Price shall be readjusted to the applicable Exercise Price which would then be in effect if such record date had not been fixed. 
 
 (d) If and whenever at any time after the date hereof and prior to the applicable Expiry Time, there is a Share Reorganization, a Rights Offering, a Special Distribution, a reclassification or redesignation of the Shares outstanding at any time or change of the Shares into other shares or into other securities (other than a Share Reorganization), or a consolidation, amalgamation, plan of arrangement or merger of the Corporation with or into any other corporation or other entity (other than a consolidation, amalgamation or merger which does not result in any reclassification or redesignation of the outstanding Shares or a change of the Shares into other shares), or a transfer of the undertaking or assets of the Corporation as an entirety or substantially as an entirety to another corporation or other entity (any of such events being called a Capital Reorganization ), the Holder, upon exercising this Warrant after the effective date of such Capital Reorganization, will be entitled to receive in lieu of the number of Shares to which such Holder was theretofore entitled upon such exercise, the aggregate number of shares, other securities or other property which such Holder would have been entitled to receive as a result of such Capital Reorganization if, on the effective date thereof, the Holder had been the registered holder of the number of Shares to which such Holder was theretofore entitled upon exercise of this Warrant. If determined appropriate by action of the directors of the Corporation, acting reasonably, appropriate adjustments will be made as a result of any such Capital Reorganization in the application of the provisions set forth in this Section 9 with respect to the rights and interests thereafter of the Holder to the end that the provisions set forth in this Section 9 will thereafter correspondingly be made applicable as nearly as may reasonably be in relation to any shares, other securities or other property thereafter deliverable upon the exercise hereof. Any such adjustment must be made by and set forth in an amendment to this Warrant approved by the directors of the Corporation and will for all purposes be conclusively deemed to be an appropriate adjustment. 

(e) If at any time after the date hereof and prior to the applicable Expiry Time any adjustment in the applicable Exercise Price shall occur as a result of: 

(i) an event referred to in subsection 9(a); 

- 9 - 
 NATDOCS\55984569\V-3 
 
 (ii) the fixing by the Corporation of a record date for an event referred to in subsection 9(b); or 

(iii) the fixing by the Corporation of a record date for an event referred to in subsection 9(c) if such event constitutes the issue or distribution to the holders of all or substantially all of its outstanding Shares of (A) Equity Shares, or (B) securities exchangeable for or convertible into Equity Shares at an exchange or conversion price per Equity Share less than the Current Market Price on such record date or (C) rights, options or warrants to acquire Equity Shares at an exercise, exchange or conversion price per Equity Share less than the Current Market Price on such record date, 

then the number of Shares purchasable upon the subsequent exercise of this Warrant shall be simultaneously adjusted by multiplying the number of Shares purchasable upon the exercise of this Warrant immediately prior to such adjustment by a fraction which shall be the reciprocal of the fraction employed in the adjustment of the applicable Exercise Price. To the extent any adjustment in subscription rights occurs pursuant to (i) this subsection 9(e) as a result of a distribution of exchangeable or convertible securities other than Equity Shares referred to in subsection 9(a) or (ii) as a result of the fixing by the Corporation of a record date for the distribution of rights, options or warrants referred to in subsection 9(b), the number of Shares purchasable upon exercise of this Warrant shall be readjusted immediately after the expiration of any relevant exchange, conversion or exercise right to the number of Shares which would be purchasable based upon the number of Shares actually issued and remaining issuable immediately after such expiration, and shall be further readjusted in such manner upon expiration of any further such right. To the extent that any adjustment in subscription rights occurs pursuant to this subsection 9(e) as a result of the fixing by the Corporation of a record date for the distribution of exchangeable or convertible securities other than Equity Shares or rights, options or warrants referred to in subsection 9(c), the number of Shares purchasable upon exercise of this Warrant shall be readjusted immediately after the expiration of any relevant exchange, conversion or exercise right to the number which would be purchasable pursuant to this subsection 9(e) if the fair market value of such securities or such rights, options or warrants had been determined for purposes of the adjustment pursuant to this subsection 9(e) on the basis of the number of Equity Shares issued and remaining issuable immediately after such expiration, and shall be further readjusted in such manner upon expiration of any further such right. 
 
 10. Rules Regarding Calculation of Adjustment of Exercise Price. 

(a) The adjustments provided for in Section 9 are cumulative and will, in the case of adjustments to the applicable Exercise Price, be computed to the nearest one-hundredth of one cent and will be made successively whenever an event referred to therein occurs, subject to the following subsections of this Section 10. 

(b) No adjustment in the applicable Exercise Price is required to be made unless such adjustment would result in a change of at least 1 in the prevailing applicable Exercise Price; provided, however, that any adjustments which, except for the provisions of this subsection, would otherwise have been required to be made, will be carried forward and taken into account in any subsequent adjustments. 

(c) No adjustment in the applicable Exercise Price will be made in respect of any event described in Section 9, other than the events referred to in clauses 9(a)(iii) and 9(a)(iv), if the Holder is entitled to participate in such event on the same terms, mutatis mutandis , as if the Holder had exercised this Warrant prior to or on the effective date or record date of such event. 

- 10 - 
 NATDOCS\55984569\V-3 
 
 (d) No adjustment in the applicable Exercise Price will be made under Section 9 in respect of the issue from time to time of Shares issuable from time to time as dividends paid in the ordinary course to holders of Shares who exercise an option or election to receive substantially equivalent dividends in Shares in lieu of receiving a cash dividend, and any such issue will be deemed not to be a Share Reorganization. 

(e) If at any time a dispute arises with respect to adjustments provided for in Section 9, such dispute will be conclusively determined by a firm of nationally recognized chartered professional accountants appointed by the Corporation (who may be the auditors of the Corporation) and acceptable to the Holder, and any such determination, where required, absent manifest error, will be binding upon the Corporation, the Holder and shareholders of the Corporation. The Corporation will provide such auditors or accountants with access to all necessary records of the Corporation and fees payable to such accountants or auditors will be paid by the Corporation. 

(f) In case the Corporation after the date of issuance of this Warrant takes any action affecting the Shares, other than action described in Section 9, which in the opinion of the board of directors of the Corporation, acting reasonably, would materially affect the rights of the Holder, the applicable Exercise Price will be adjusted in such manner, if any, and at such time, by action by the directors of the Corporation but subject in all cases to any necessary regulatory approval and the approval of the Holder. Failure of the taking of action by the directors of the Corporation, acting reasonably, so as to provide for an adjustment on or prior to the effective date of any action by the Corporation affecting the Shares will be conclusive evidence that the board of directors of the Corporation has determined that it is equitable to make no adjustment in the circumstances. 

(g) If the Corporation sets a record date to determine the holders of the Shares for the purpose of entitling them to receive any dividend or distribution or sets a record date to take any other action and, thereafter and before the distribution to such shareholders of any such dividend or distribution or the taking of any other action, decides not to implement its plan to pay or deliver such dividend or distribution or take such other action, then no adjustment in the applicable Exercise Price will be required by reason of the setting of such record date. 

(h) In the absence of a resolution of the directors of the Corporation fixing a record date for a Special Distribution or Rights Offering, the Corporation will be deemed to have fixed as the record date therefor the date on which the Special Distribution or Rights Offering is effected. 

(i) As a condition precedent to the taking of any action which would require any adjustment to this Warrant, including the applicable Exercise Price, the Corporation must take any corporate action which may be necessary in order that the Corporation have unissued and reserved in its authorized capital and may validly and legally issue as fully paid and non-assessable all the Shares or other securities which the Holder is entitled to receive on the full exercise thereof in accordance with the provisions hereof. 

(j) The Corporation will from time to time, immediately after the occurrence of any event which requires an adjustment or readjustment as provided in Section 9, forthwith give notice to the Holder specifying the event requiring such adjustment or readjustment and the results thereof, including the resulting applicable Exercise Price, and, if reasonably required by the Holder, such notice and the amount of the adjustment specified therein shall be verified by an opinion of a firm of nationally recognized chartered professional accountants appointed by the Corporation (who may be the auditors of the Corporation) and acceptable to the Holder, acting reasonably. 

- 11 - 
 NATDOCS\55984569\V-3 
 
 (k) The Corporation covenants to and in favour of the Holder that so long as this Warrant remains outstanding, it will give notice to the Holder of its intention to fix a record date for any event referred to in subsections 9(a), (b) or (c) (other than the subdivision or consolidation of the Shares) which may give rise to an adjustment in the applicable Exercise Price, and, in each case, such notice must specify the particulars of such event and the record date or the effective date for such event; provided that the Corporation is only required to specify in such notice such particulars of such event as have been fixed and determined on the date on which such notice is given. Such notice shall be given not less than seven days prior to each such applicable record date or effective date. 

11. Successor Corporation. 

(a) In the case of the Corporation entering into a transaction whereby all or substantially all of its undertaking, property and assets would become the property of any other corporation and/or its securities exchanged for the securities of another corporation (herein called a successor corporation whether by way of reorganization, reconstruction, consolidation, amalgamation, merger, transfer, sale, disposition or otherwise (a Sale Transaction ), the successor corporation shall be bound by all of the provisions hereof including the due and punctual performance of all covenants of the Corporation and forthwith following the occurrence of such event, the successor corporation resulting from such reorganization, reconstruction, consolidation, amalgamation, merger, transfer, sale, disposition or otherwise (if not the Corporation), shall expressly assume the due and punctual performance and observance of this Warrant certificate to be performed and observed by the Corporation and these securities and the terms set forth in this Warrant certificate will be a valid and binding obligation of the successor corporation entitling the Holder, as against the successor corporation, to all the rights of the Holder under this Warrant certificate. Following the completion of the Sale Transaction, this Warrant certificate shall be deemed to be amended by: (i) replacing the references to Gage Growth Corp with the name of the successor corporation; and (ii) replacing the references to subordinate voting shares with the name of the securities in the capital of the successor corporation that are exchanged for the Shares in connection with the Sale Transaction. 

(b) Whenever the conditions of Section 11(a) shall have been duly observed and performed the successor corporation shall possess, and from time to time may exercise, each and every right and power of the Corporation under this Warrant certificate in the name of the Corporation or otherwise and any act or proceeding by any provision hereof required to be done or performed by any director or officer of the Corporation may be done and performed with like force and effect by the like directors or officers of the successor corporation. 

12. No Fractional Shares . Upon the exercise of the Warrants evidenced hereby, the Corporation shall not be required to issue an aggregate number of Shares that results in any fractional Shares being issued and the Holder shall not be entitled to any cash payment or compensation in lieu of a fractional Share. 

13. Legending of Shares. The Warrants have been, and the Shares will be, issued pursuant to an exemption from the registration and prospectus requirements of applicable securities law. To the extent that the Corporation relies on such exemption, the Shares may be subject to restrictions on resale and transferability contained in applicable securities laws. 

The Holder hereby agrees and consents by acceptance hereof that the certificate or certificates representing the Shares shall be impressed with a legend substantially in the following form: 

- 12 - 
 NATDOCS\55984569\V-3 
 
 UNLESS PERMITTED UNDER SECURITIES LEGISLATION, THE HOLDER OF THIS SECURITY MUST NOT TRADE THE SECURITY BEFORE THE DATE THAT IS FOUR MONTHS AND A DAY AFTER THE LATER OF (I) JULY 2, 2021; AND (II) THE DATE THE ISSUER BECAME A REPORTING ISSUER IN ANY PROVINCE OR TERRITORY. 
 
 The Warrants and the Shares issuable upon exercise hereof have not been registered under the United States Securities Act of 1933 , as amended (the 1933 Act ), or the securities laws of any state of the United States. Accordingly, the Warrants and the Shares issuable upon exercise hereof may not be offered or sold, directly or indirectly, in the United States except pursuant to registration under the 1933 Act and the applicable securities laws of all applicable states or available exemption therefrom. The Warrants may not be exercised by or on behalf of a U.S. person or person in the United States unless the Warrants and the Shares issuable upon exercise of the Warrants have been registered under the 1933 Act and the applicable securities legislation of any such state or an exemption from such registration requirements is available. United States and U.S. person are as defined by Regulation S under the 1933 Act. The Holder hereby agrees and consents by acceptance hereof that all certificates representing Shares acquired upon exercise of the Warrants by, or for the account or benefit of, U.S. persons or persons in the United States shall have the following legend:

 (D) IN ANOTHER TRANSACTION THAT DOES NOT REQUIRE REGISTRATION UNDER THE 1933 ACT OR ANY APPLICABLE STATE SECURITIES LAWS, AND, IN THE CASE OF CLAUSE (C)(I) OR (D), THE SELLER FURNISHES TO THE CORPORATION AN OPINION OF COUNSEL, OF RECOGNIZED STANDING, IN FORM AND SUBSTANCE REASONABLY SATISFACTORY TO THE CORPORATION TO SUCH EFFECT. THE PRESENCE OF THIS LEGEND MAY IMPAIR THE ABILITY OF THE HOLDER HEREOF TO EFFECT GOOD DELIVERY OF THE SECURITIES REPRESENTED HEREBY ON A CANADIAN STOCK EXCHANGE. 
 
 provided, that if the Shares are being sold under clause (B) above, the legend set forth above may be removed by providing a declaration to the Corporation and its registrar and transfer agent in the form attached hereto as Schedule C or such other evidence of exemption as the Corporation or its registrar and transfer agent may from time to time prescribe (which may include an opinion satisfactory to the Corporation and its registrar and transfer agent), to the effect that the sale of the Shares is being made in compliance with Rule 904 of Regulation S under the 1933 Act; provided further, that if any of the Shares are being sold pursuant to Rule 144 of the 1933 Act and in compliance with any applicable state securities laws, the legend may be removed by delivery to the Corporation's registrar and transfer agent of an opinion satisfactory to the Corporation and its registrar and transfer agent to the effect that the legend is no longer required under applicable requirements of the 1933 Act or state securities laws.

 15. No Obligation to Purchase. Nothing herein contained or done pursuant hereto shall obligate the Holder to purchase or pay for or the Corporation to issue any Shares except those Shares in respect of which the Holder shall have exercised its right to purchase in the manner provided hereunder.

 Warrant Certificate Number 2022-__-__	 Number of Warrants represented by 
 this certificate: ___,___ 
 
 THIS CERTIFIES that, for value received, ___________, having its head office at ____________________________________________ (the Holder ), is the registered holder of ___,___ warrants (collectively, the Warrants each a Warrant ), each Warrant entitling the Holder, subject to the terms and conditions set forth in this Warrant Certificate (the Certificate ), to purchase from TerrAscend Corp. (the Corporation ), one common share in the capital of the Corporation (a Common Share ), at any time prior to 5:00 p.m. (Toronto time) on December 31, 2032 (the Expiry Date ), at which time the Warrants evidenced by this Certificate shall become wholly void and the unexercised portion of the subscription right represented hereby will expire and terminate (the Time of Expiry ), on payment of a price per Common Share equal to CAD 5.95, subject to adjustment as set forth herein (the Exercise Price ). The number of Common Shares which the Holder is entitled to acquire upon exercise of the Warrants and the Exercise Price are subject to adjustment as hereinafter provided. 
 
 The Holder shall be entitled to the rights evidenced by this Certificate free from all equities and rights of set-off or counterclaim between the Corporation and the original or any interim holder and all persons may act accordingly and the receipt by the Holder of the Common Shares issuable upon exercise hereof shall be a good discharge to the Corporation.

 1. Exercise of Warrants. 

(a) Election to Purchase . The rights evidenced by this Certificate may be exercised by the Holder in whole or in part in accordance with the provisions hereof by delivery of an election to purchase in substantially the form attached hereto as Schedule 1 (the Election to Purchase ), properly completed and executed, together with payment by wire transfer, certified cheque or bank draft of the Exercise Price for the number of Common Shares specified in the Election to Purchase, at the office of the Corporation at 3610 Mavis Road, Mississauga, Ontario, L5C 1W2 or such other address in Canada as may be notified in writing by the Corporation. In the event that the rights evidenced by this Certificate are exercised in part, the Corporation shall, contemporaneously with the issuance of the Common Shares issuable on the exercise of the Warrants so exercised, issue to the Holder a Warrant Certificate on identical terms in respect of that number of Common Shares in respect of which the Holder has not exercised the rights evidenced by this Certificate. 

(b) Exercise. 

The Corporation shall, within two trading days after receiving a duly executed Election to Purchase and the Exercise Price for the number of Common Shares specified in the Election to Purchase (the Exercise Date ), issue that number of Common Shares specified in the Election to Purchase. 
 
 (c) Certificates and Electronic Deposits . As promptly as practicable after the Exercise Date (but no later than three business days after the Exercise Date), the Corporation shall, as specified by the Holder in the Election to Purchase, either 

(i) issue and deliver to the Holder, registered in the name of the Holder, a certificate for the number of Common Shares issuable on exercise of the Warrants so exercised and a Certificate representing the balance of any unexercised Warrants, or (ii) in the case of the Common Shares, issue and cause to be deposited electronically with CDS Clearing and Depository Services Inc. CDS through the book-based system administered by CDS using the non- certificated inventory issue process that number of Common Shares issuable on exercise of the Warrants so exercised and, in the case of the Warrants, a Certificate representing the balance of any unexercised Warrants. To the extent permitted by law, such exercise shall be deemed to have been effected as of the close of business on the Exercise Date, and at such time the rights of the Holder with respect to the number of Warrants which have been exercised as such shall cease, and the Common Shares and any unexercised Warrants shall then be issuable upon such exercise as outlined above and the Holder shall be deemed to have become the holder of record of the Common Shares and unexercised Warrants represented thereby. Notwithstanding the above, all Common Shares issued to a United States accredited investor as defined in Rule 501(a) of Regulation D under the United States Securities Act of 1933 , as amended (the U.S. Securities Act ), who is not a qualified institutional buyer (as that term 

3 
 
 is used in Rule 144A of the U.S. Securities Act), will be evidenced by physical certificates. 
 
 (d) Fractional Common Shares . No fractional Common Shares shall be issued upon exercise of the Warrants represented by this Certificate. 

(e) Adjustments . The subscription rights in effect under the Warrants for Common Shares issuable upon the exercise of the Warrants shall be subject to adjustment from time to time as follows: 

(i) If, at any time from the date hereof until the Time of Expiry (the Adjustment Period ), the Corporation shall: 

(A) subdivide, re-divide or change its outstanding Common Shares and/or its non-voting and non-participating exchangeable shares in the capital of the Corporation (the Exchangeable Shares into a greater number of Common Shares or Exchangeable Shares; 

(B) reduce, combine or consolidate its outstanding Common Shares and/or Exchangeable Shares into a lesser number of Common Shares or Exchangeable Shares; or 

(C) issue Common Shares and/or Exchangeable Shares to all or substantially all of the holders of Common Shares or Exchangeable Shares by way of stock dividend or other distribution (other than, if applicable, a dividend paid in the ordinary course or a distribution of Common Shares and/or Exchangeable Shares upon the exercise of warrants, options, restricted share units or other exchangeable or convertible securities of the Corporation); 

(any of such events in subsections 1(e)(i)(A), 1(e)(i)(B) or 1(e)(i)(C) being called a Common Share Reorganization then, in each such event, the Exercise Price shall be adjusted as of the effective date or record date of such Common Share Reorganization, as the case may be, and shall, in the case of the events referred to in (A) or (C) above, be decreased in proportion to the increase in the number of outstanding Common Shares and/or Exchangeable Shares resulting from such subdivision, re-division, change or distribution, or shall, in the case of the events referred to in (B) above, be increased in proportion to the decrease in the number of outstanding Common Shares and/or Exchangeable Shares resulting from such reduction, combination or consolidation, in each case by multiplying the Exercise Price in effect immediately prior to such effective date or record date by a fraction, the numerator of which shall be the number of Common Shares outstanding on such effective date or record date before giving effect to such Common Share Reorganization and the denominator of which shall be the number of Common Shares outstanding as of the effective date or record date after giving effect to such Common Share Reorganization. Such 

4 
 
 adjustment shall be made successively whenever any event referred to in this subsection 1(e)(i) shall occur. Upon any adjustment of the Exercise Price pursuant to subsection 1(e)(i), the Exchange Rate (as defined below) shall be contemporaneously adjusted by multiplying the number of Common Shares theretofore obtainable on the exercise thereof by a fraction of which the numerator shall be the Exercise Price in effect immediately prior to such adjustment and the denominator shall be the Exercise Price resulting from such adjustment. Exchange Rate means the number of Common Shares subject to the right of purchase under each Warrant, which, as of the date hereof, is one (1) Common Share for one (1) Warrant. 
 
 (ii) If and whenever at any time during the Adjustment Period, the Corporation shall fix a record date for the issuance of rights, options or warrants to all or substantially all the holders of its outstanding Common Shares and/or Exchangeable Shares entitling them, for a period expiring not more than 45 days after such record date, to subscribe for or purchase Common Shares and/or Exchangeable Shares (or securities convertible or exchangeable into Common Shares and/or Exchangeable Shares) at a price per Common Share (or having a conversion or exchange price per Common Share) less than 95 of the Current Market Price (as defined below) on the date of announcement of such issuance (a Rights Offering ), the Exercise Price shall be adjusted immediately after such record date so that it shall equal the amount determined by multiplying the Exercise Price in effect on such record date by a fraction, of which the numerator shall be the total number of Common Shares and/or Exchangeable Shares outstanding on such record date plus a number of Common Shares and/or Exchangeable Shares equal to the number arrived at by dividing the aggregate price of the total number of additional Common Shares and/or Exchangeable Shares offered for subscription or purchase (or the aggregate conversion or exchange price of the convertible or exchangeable securities so offered) by the Current Market Price, and of which the denominator shall be the total number of Common Shares and/or Exchangeable Shares outstanding on such record date plus the total number of additional Common Shares and/or Exchangeable Shares offered for subscription or purchase or into which the convertible or exchangeable securities so offered are convertible or exchangeable. Any Common Shares and/or Exchangeable Shares owned by or held for the account of the Corporation shall be deemed not to be outstanding for the purpose of any such computation. Such adjustment shall be made successively whenever such a record date is fixed. To the extent that no such rights or warrants are exercised prior to the expiration thereof, the Exercise Price shall be readjusted to the Exercise Price which would then be in effect if such record date had not been fixed or, if any such rights or warrants are exercised, to the Exercise Price which would then be in effect based upon the number of Common Shares and/or Exchangeable Shares (or securities convertible or exchangeable into Common Shares) actually issued upon the exercise of such rights or warrants, as the case may be. Upon any adjustment of the Exercise Price pursuant to this subsection 1(e)(ii), the Exchange Rate 

5 
 
 will be adjusted immediately after such record date so that it will equal the rate determined by multiplying the Exchange Rate in effect on such record date by a fraction, of which the numerator shall be the Exercise Price in effect immediately prior to such adjustment and the denominator shall be the Exercise Price resulting from such adjustment. 
 
 (iii) If and whenever at any time during the Adjustment Period the Corporation shall fix a record date for the making of a distribution to all or substantially all the holders of its outstanding Common Shares and/or Exchangeable Shares of (i) securities of any class, whether of the Corporation or any other entity (other than Common Shares and/or Exchangeable Shares), (ii) rights, options or warrants to subscribe for or purchase Common Shares and/or Exchangeable Shares (or other securities convertible into or exchangeable for Common Shares and/or Exchangeable Shares), other than pursuant to a Rights Offering; (iii) evidences of its indebtedness or (iv) any cash, securities or other property or other assets (other than, if applicable, dividends paid in the ordinary course) and if such issue or distribution does not constitute a Common Share Reorganization, a Rights Offering or a distribution of Common Shares upon the exercise of Warrants or any outstanding options, then, in each such case, the Exercise Price shall be adjusted immediately after such record date so that it shall equal the price determined by multiplying the Exercise Price in effect on such record date by a fraction, of which the numerator shall be the total number of Common Shares and/or Exchangeable Shares outstanding on such record date multiplied by the Current Market Price on such record date, less the excess, if any, of the fair market value on such record date, as determined by the directors of the Corporation, acting reasonably (whose determination shall be conclusive, subject to stock exchange approval), of such cash, securities or other property or other assets so issued or distributed over the fair market value of any consideration received therefor by the Corporation from the holders of the Common Shares and/or Exchangeable Shares, and of which the denominator shall be the total number of Common Shares and/or Exchangeable Shares outstanding on such record date multiplied by the Current Market Price. Any Common Shares and/or Exchangeable Shares owned by or held for the account of the Corporation shall be deemed not to be outstanding for the purpose of any such computation. Such adjustment shall be made successively whenever such a record date is fixed. To the extent that such distribution is not so made, the Exercise Price shall be readjusted to the Exercise Price which would then be in effect if such record date had not been fixed. Upon any adjustment of the Exercise Price pursuant to this subsection 1(e)(iii), the Exchange Rate will be adjusted immediately after such record date so that it will equal the rate determined by multiplying the Exchange Rate in effect on such record date by a fraction, of which the numerator shall be the Exercise Price in effect immediately prior to such adjustment and the denominator shall be the Exercise Price resulting from such adjustment. 

6 
 
 (iv) If and whenever at any time during the Adjustment Period, there is a reclassification of the Common Shares and/or Exchangeable Shares or a capital reorganization of the Corporation other than as described in subsection 1(e)(i) or a consolidation, amalgamation, arrangement or merger of the Corporation with or into any other body corporate, trust, partnership or other entity, or a sale or conveyance of the property and assets of the Corporation as an entirety or substantially as an entirety to any other body corporate, trust, partnership or other entity, any Holder that has not exercised its Warrants prior to the effective date of such reclassification, capital reorganization, consolidation, amalgamation, arrangement or merger, sale or conveyance, upon the exercise of such Warrant thereafter, shall be entitled to receive upon payment of the Exercise Price and shall accept, in lieu of the number of Common Shares that prior to such effective date the Holder would have been entitled to receive the number of shares or other securities or property of the Corporation or of the body corporate, trust, partnership or other entity resulting from such merger, amalgamation or consolidation, or to which such sale or conveyance may be made, as the case may be, that such Holder would have been entitled to receive on such reclassification, capital reorganization, consolidation, amalgamation, arrangement or merger, sale or conveyance, if, on the effective date thereof, as the case may be, the Holder had been the registered holder of the number of Common Shares to which prior to such effective date it was entitled to acquire upon the exercise of the Warrants. If determined appropriate by the Corporation, relying on advice of legal counsel, to give effect to or to evidence the provisions of this subsection 1(e)(iv), the Corporation, its successor, or such purchasing body corporate, partnership, trust or other entity, as the case may be, shall, prior to or contemporaneously with any such reclassification, capital reorganization, consolidation, amalgamation, arrangement, merger, sale or conveyance, enter into an agreement or certificate which shall provide, to the extent possible, for the application of the provisions set forth in this Certificate with respect to the rights and interests thereafter of the Holder to the end that the provisions set forth in this Certificate shall thereafter correspondingly be made applicable, as nearly as may reasonably be, with respect to any shares, other securities or property to which the Holder is entitled on the exercise of its acquisition rights thereafter. Any agreement or certificate entered into between the Corporation, any successor to the Corporation or such purchasing body corporate, partnership, trust or other entity and the Holder shall provide for adjustments which shall be as nearly equivalent as may be practicable to the adjustments provided in this subsection 1(e) and which shall apply to successive reclassifications, capital reorganizations, amalgamations, consolidations, mergers, sales or conveyances arrangements. 

(v) If and whenever at any time during the Adjustment Period the Corporation or a subsidiary of the Corporation shall make an issuer bid or a tender or exchange offer (other than an odd lot offer or a normal course issuer bid) to all or substantially all of the holders of Common Shares and/or 

7 
 
 Exchangeable Shares for all or any portion of the Common Shares and/or Exchangeable Shares where the cash and the value of any other consideration included in such payment per Common Share and/or Exchangeable Shares exceeds the Current Market Price on the trading day immediately preceding the commencement of the issuer bid or tender or exchange offer (any such issuer bid or tender or exchange offer being called an Issuer Bid ), the Exercise Price shall be adjusted to a price determined by multiplying the applicable Exercise Price in effect on the date of the completion of such Issuer Bid by a fraction, the numerator of which shall be the product of (A) the number of Common Shares and/or Exchangeable Shares outstanding immediately prior to the completion of the Issuer Bid (without giving effect to any reduction in respect of any tendered or exchanged shares) and (B) the Current Market Price on the trading day immediately preceding the commencement of the Issuer Bid, and the denominator of which shall be the sum of (A) the fair market value (determined by the board of directors of the Corporation, acting reasonably and in good faith) of the aggregate consideration paid by the Corporation or subsidiary to holders of Common Shares and/or Exchangeable Shares upon the completion of such Issuer Bid, and (B) the product of (I) the difference between the number of Common Shares and/or Exchangeable Shares outstanding immediately prior to the completion of the Issuer Bid (without giving effect to any reduction in respect of tendered or exchanged shares) and the number of Common Shares and/or Exchangeable Shares actually purchased by the Corporation or subsidiary pursuant to the Issuer Bid, and 
 (II) the Current Market Price on the trading day immediately preceding the commencement of the Issuer Bid. 
 
 (vi) In any case in which this subsection 1(e) shall require that an adjustment shall become effective immediately after a record date for an event referred to herein, the Corporation may defer, until the occurrence of such event, issuing to the Holder of any Warrant exercised after the record date and prior to completion of such event the additional Common Shares issuable by reason of the adjustment required by such event before giving effect to such adjustment; provided, however, that the Corporation shall deliver to the Holder an appropriate instrument evidencing the Holder's right to receive such additional Common Shares upon the occurrence of the event requiring such adjustment and the right to receive any distributions made on such additional Common Shares and/or Exchangeable Shares declared in favour of holders of record of Common Shares and/or Exchangeable Shares on and after the relevant date of exercise or such later date as the Holder would, but for the provisions of this subsection 1(e)(vi), have become the holder of record of such additional Common Shares pursuant to this subsection 1(e). 

(vii) In any case in which subsection 1(e)(i)(C), subsection 1(e)(ii) or subsection 1(e)(iii) require that an adjustment be made to the Exercise Price, no such adjustment shall be made if the Holder of the outstanding Warrants receives, 

8 
 
 subject to any required stock exchange or regulatory approval, the rights or warrants referred to in subsection 1(e)(i)(C), subsection 1(e)(ii) or the shares, rights, options, warrants, evidences of indebtedness or assets referred to in subsection 1(e)(iii), as the case may be, in such kind and number as they would have received if they had been holders of Common Shares on the applicable record date or effective date, as the case may be, by virtue of their outstanding Warrants having then been exercised into Common Shares at the Exercise Price in effect on the applicable record date or effective date, as the case may be. 
 
 (viii) Each Common Share issued upon exercise of Warrants shall be entitled to receive, in addition to any Common Shares received in connection with such exercise, rights under the shareholder rights plan or equivalent plan, if any, and the certificates (if applicable) representing the Common Shares issued upon such exercise shall bear such legends, if any, in each case as may be provided by the terms of any shareholder rights plan or equivalent plan adopted by the Corporation, as the same may be amended from time to time, and the Exercise Price shall not be adjusted in connection therewith. If prior to any exercise of Warrants, however, such rights have separated from the Common Shares in accordance with the provisions of the applicable shareholder rights agreement, the Exercise Price shall be adjusted at the time of separation as if the Corporation distributed to all holders of Common Shares, rights options or warrants as described in subsection 1(e)(iii), subject to readjustment in the event of the expiration, termination or redemption of such rights. 

(ix) The adjustments provided for in this subsection 1(e) are cumulative, and shall, in the case of adjustments to the Exercise Price be computed to the nearest whole cent and shall apply to successive subdivisions, re-divisions, reductions, combinations, consolidations, distributions, issues or other events resulting in any adjustment under the provisions of this subsection 1(e), provided that, notwithstanding any other provision of this Section, no adjustment of the Exercise Price shall be required unless such adjustment would require an increase or decrease of at least 1 in the Exercise Price then in effect or the number of Common Shares issuable upon the exercise of a Warrant by at least one one-hundredth of a Common Share; provided, however, that any adjustments which by reason of this subsection 1(e)(ix) are not required to be made shall be carried forward and taken into account in any subsequent adjustment. 

(x) After any adjustment pursuant to this subsection 1(e), the term Common Shares , where used in this Certificate, shall be interpreted to mean securities of any class or classes which, as a result of such adjustment and all prior adjustments pursuant to this subsection 1(e), the Holder is entitled to receive upon the exercise of Warrants, and the number of Common Shares indicated by any exercise made pursuant to a Warrant shall be interpreted to mean the number of Common Shares or other property or 

9 
 
 securities the Holder is entitled to receive, as a result of such adjustment and all prior adjustments pursuant to this subsection 1(e), upon the full exercise of a Warrant. 
 
 (xi) All Common Shares or shares of any class or other securities, which the Holder is at the time in question entitled to receive on the exercise of its Warrant, whether or not as a result of adjustments made pursuant to this subsection 1(e), shall, for the purposes of the interpretation of this Certificate, be deemed to be Common Shares which such Holder is entitled to acquire pursuant to such Warrant. 

(xii) Notwithstanding anything in this subsection 1(e), no adjustment shall be made in the acquisition rights attached to the Warrants if the issue of Common Shares is being made pursuant to this Certificate or in connection with (a) any share incentive plan or restricted share unit plan or share purchase plan in force from time to time for directors, officers, employees, consultants or other service providers of the Corporation; or (b) the satisfaction of existing instruments issued as of the date hereof. 

(xiii) As a condition precedent to the taking of any action which would require an adjustment in any of the acquisition rights pursuant to any of the Warrants, including the number of Common Shares which are to be received upon the exercise thereof, the Corporation shall take any action which may, in the opinion of legal counsel, be necessary in order that the Corporation has unissued and reserved in its authorized capital and may validly and legally issue as fully paid and non-assessable all the Common Shares which the holders of such Warrants are entitled to receive on the full exercise thereof in accordance with the provisions hereof. 

(xiv) The Corporation shall from time to time promptly after the occurrence of any event which requires an adjustment or readjustment as provided in subsection 1(e), deliver a certificate of the Corporation to the Holder specifying the nature of the event requiring the same and the amount of the adjustment or readjustment necessitated thereby and setting forth in reasonable detail the method of calculation and the facts upon which such calculation is based. 

(xv) The Corporation covenants to and in favour of the Holder that so long as this Warrant remains outstanding, it will give notice to the Holder of the effective date or of its intention to fix a record date for any event referred to in this subsection 1(e) whether or not such action would give rise to an adjustment in the Exercise Price or the number and type of securities issuable upon the exercise of the Warrants, and, in each case, such notice shall specify the particulars of such event and the record date and the effective date for such event; provided that the Corporation shall only be required to specify in such notice such particulars of such event as have been fixed and determined on the date on which such notice is given. Such 

10 
 
 notice shall be given not less than 14 days in each case prior to such applicable record date or effective date. 
 
 (xvi) The Corporation covenants with the Holder that it will not close its transfer books or take any other corporate action which might deprive the Holder of the opportunity to exercise its right of acquisition hereunder during the period of 10 business days after the giving of the certificate set forth in subsection 1(e)(xiii). 

(xvii) If the Corporation, after the date hereof, shall take any action affecting the Common Shares other than action described in subsection 1(e), which in the reasonable opinion of the directors of the Corporation would materially affect the rights of the Holder, the Exercise Price and/or the Exchange Rate, the number of Common Shares which may be acquired upon exercise of the Warrants shall be adjusted in such manner and at such time, by action of the directors, acting reasonably and in good faith, in their sole discretion as they may determine to be equitable to the Holder in the circumstances, provided that no such adjustment will be made unless any requisite prior approval of any stock exchange on which the Common Shares are listed for trading has been obtained. No adjustments shall be made pursuant to this subsection 1(e) if the Holder is entitled to participate in any event described in this subsection 1(e) on the same terms, mutatis mutandis, as if the Holder had exercised their Warrants prior to, or on the effective date or record date (as applicable) of, such event. 

(xviii) If at any time a question or dispute arises with respect to adjustments provided for in this subsection 1(e), such question or dispute will be conclusively determined by the auditor of the Corporation or, if they are unable or unwilling to act, by such other firm of independent chartered accountants as may be selected by action of the directors of the Corporation and any such determination, subject to regulatory approval and absent manifest error, will be binding upon the Corporation and the Holder. The Corporation will provide such auditor or chartered accountant with access to all necessary records of the Corporation. 

(f) Shares to be Reserved . The Corporation will at all times keep available and reserve out of its authorized Common Shares, solely for the purpose of issuing upon the exercise of the Warrants, such number of Common Shares as shall then be issuable upon the exercise of the Warrants. The Corporation covenants and agrees that all such Common Shares which shall be so issuable will, upon issuance and receipt of the Exercise Price therefore, be duly authorized and issued as fully paid and non-assessable. The Corporation will take all such actions as may be necessary to ensure that all such Common Shares may be so issued without violation of any applicable requirements of any exchange upon which the Common Shares may be listed or in respect of which the Common Shares are qualified for unlisted trading privileges. The Corporation will take all such actions 

11 
 
 as are within its power to ensure that all such Common Shares may be so issued without violation of any applicable law. 
 
 (g) Issue Tax . Upon the exercise of Warrants, the issuance of certificates, if any, for the Common Shares and the issuance of Certificates for any unexercised Warrants shall be made without charge to the Holder, including for any issuance tax in respect thereto, provided that the Corporation shall not be required to pay any tax which may be payable in respect of any transfer involved in the issuance and delivery of any such certificate(s) in a name other than that of the Holder. 

(h) Listing . The Corporation will, at its expense and as expeditiously as possible, use its reasonable commercial efforts to cause all Common Shares issuable upon the exercise of the Warrants to be duly listed on the Canadian Securities Exchange and/or any other stock exchange upon which the Common Shares may be then listed prior to the issuance of such Common Shares. 

(i) Current Market Price . For the purposes of any computation hereunder, the Current Market Price at any date shall be the volume-weighted average price VWAP per Common Share for the 20 consecutive trading days ending five 

(5) trading days prior to the relevant date on the most senior stock exchange in Canada on which the Common Shares may then be listed and on which there is the greatest volume of trading of the Common Shares for such 20 day period, or, if the Common Shares or any other security in respect of which a determination of Current Market Price is being made are not listed on any stock exchange, which includes the Canadian Securities Exchange, the Current Market Price shall be determined in good faith by the directors of the Corporation, which determination shall be conclusive, absent fraud or manifest error. The VWAP shall be determined by dividing the aggregate sale price of all such Common Shares sold on the said exchange during the said 20 consecutive trading days by the total number of such Common Shares so sold. 
 
 2. Transfer of Warrants. Subject to applicable securities laws, the Warrants represented by this Certificate are transferable by the Holder to any person, upon delivery of this Certificate and a duly executed transfer form in substantially the form attached hereto as Schedule 2 (the Transfer Form or such other instrument of transfer in such form as the Corporation may from time to time prescribe and delivered to the Corporation.

12 
 
 transferee or as the transferee may direct and shall take all other necessary actions to effect the transfer as directed.

All payments to be made by the Borrower hereunder and the other Loan Documents shall be made without condition or deduction for any counterclaim, defense, recoupment or setoff. Subject to SECTION 2.14, all payments of interest and principal shall be made by the Borrower to each Lender to the account or at the address of such Lender as specified by the Agent, in Dollars in immediately available funds, without counterclaim or setoff and free and clear of, and without any deduction or withholding for, any Taxes or other payments. The amount payable to each Lender and information regarding the account of each Lender shall be provided by the Agent to the Borrower at least five (5) Business Days prior to the date any such payment is due and payable hereunder. If any payment to be made by the Borrower shall fall due on a day that is not a Business Day, payment shall be made on the next succeeding Business Day and such extension of time shall be reflected in computing interest or fees, as the case may be; provided that, if such next succeeding Business Day would fall after the Maturity Date, payment shall be made on the immediately preceding Business Day. Except as otherwise expressly provided herein, all payments hereunder or under any other Loan Document shall be made in Dollars. 

(b) Application of Insufficient Payments . Subject to Section 7.02, if at any time insufficient funds are received by and available to the Agent to pay fully all amounts of principal, interest, fees and other amounts then due hereunder, such funds shall be applied (i) first , to pay interest, fees and other amounts then due hereunder, ratably among the parties entitled thereto in accordance with the amounts of interest, fees and other amounts then due to such parties, and (ii) second , to pay principal then due hereunder, ratably among the parties entitled thereto in accordance with the amounts of principal then due to such parties. 

(c) Presumptions by Agent . Unless the Agent shall have received notice from the Borrower prior to the date on which any payment is due to the Agent for the account of the Lenders hereunder that the Borrower will not make such payment, the Agent may assume that the Borrower has made such payment on such date in accordance herewith and may, in reliance upon such assumption, distribute to the Lenders the amount due. In such event, if the Borrower has not in fact made such payment, then each of the Lenders severally agrees to repay to the Agent forthwith on demand the amount so distributed to such Lender, with interest thereon, for each day from and including the date such amount is distributed to it to but excluding the date of payment to the Agent, at the greater of the Federal Funds Effective Rate and a rate determined by the Agent in accordance with banking industry rules on interbank compensation. 

38 

(d) Deductions by Agent . If any Lender shall fail to make any payment required to be made by it pursuant to Section 2.04(b), 2.12 or 9.03(c), then the Agent may, in its discretion and notwithstanding any contrary provision hereof, (i) apply any amounts thereafter received by the Agent for the account of such Lender for the benefit of the Agent to satisfy such Lender s obligations to the Agent until all such unsatisfied obligations are fully paid or (ii) hold any such amounts in a segregated account as cash collateral for, and for application to, any future funding obligations of such Lender under any such Section, in the case of each of clauses (i) and (ii) above, in any order as determined by the Agent in its discretion. 

(e) Several Obligations of Lenders . The obligations of the Lenders hereunder to make Loans and to make payments pursuant to Section 9.03(c) are several and not joint. The failure of any Lender to make any Loan or to make any such payment on any date required hereunder shall not relieve any other Lender of its corresponding obligation to do so on such date, and no Lender shall be responsible for the failure of any other Lender to so make its Loan or to make its payment under Section 9.03(c). 

SECTION 2.12 Sharing of Payments . If any Lender shall, by exercising any right of setoff or counterclaim or otherwise, obtain payment in respect of any principal of or interest on any of its Loans or other obligations hereunder resulting in such Lender receiving payment of a proportion of the aggregate amount of its Loans and accrued interest thereon or other such obligations greater than its pro rata share thereof as provided herein, then the Lender receiving such greater proportion shall (a) notify the Agent of such fact, and (b) purchase (for cash at face value) participations in the Loans and such other obligations of the other Lenders, or make such other adjustments as shall be equitable, so that the benefit of all such payments shall be shared by the Lenders ratably in accordance with the aggregate amount of principal of and accrued interest on their respective Loans and other amounts owing them; provided that: 
 
 (i) if any such participations are purchased and all or any portion of the payment giving rise thereto is recovered, such participations shall be rescinded and the purchase price restored to the extent of such recovery, without interest; and 

(ii) the provisions of this subclause shall not be construed to apply to (x) any payment made by the Borrower pursuant to and in accordance with the express terms of this Agreement or (y) any payment obtained by a Lender as consideration for the assignment of or sale of a participation in any of its Loans to any assignee or participant, other than to the Borrower or any Subsidiary thereof (as to which the provisions of this subclause shall apply). 

The Borrower consents to the foregoing and agrees, to the extent it may effectively do so under Applicable Law, that any Lender acquiring a participation pursuant to the foregoing arrangements may exercise against the Borrower rights of setoff and counterclaim with respect to such participation as fully as if such Lender were a direct creditor of the Borrower in the amount of such participation. 

39 

SECTION 2.13 Increased Costs . 
 
 (a) If any Change in Law shall subject any Recipient to any Taxes (other than 

(i) Indemnified Taxes, (ii) Taxes described in clauses (b) through (e) of the definition of Excluded Taxes and (iii) Connection Income Taxes) on its loans, loan principal, letters of credit, commitments, or other obligations, or its deposits, reserves, other liabilities or capital attributable thereto and the result thereof shall be to increase the cost to such Lender or such other Recipient of making, converting to, continuing or maintaining any Loan or of maintaining its obligation to make any such Loan, or to increase the cost to such Lender, or to reduce the amount of any sum received or receivable by such Lender or other Recipient hereunder (whether of principal, interest or any other amount) then, upon request of such Lender or other Recipient, the Borrower will pay to such Lender or other Recipient, as the case may be, such additional amount or amounts as will compensate such Lender or other Recipient, as the case may be, for such additional costs incurred or reduction suffered. 
 (b) Capital Requirements . If any Lender determines that any Change in Law affecting such Lender or any lending office of such Lender or such Lender s holding company, if any, regarding capital or liquidity requirements, has or would have the effect of reducing the rate of return on such Lender s capital or on the capital of such Lender s holding company, if any, as a consequence of this Agreement, the Commitments of such Lender or the Loans made by such Lender to a level below that which such Lender or such Lender s holding company could have achieved but for such Change in Law (taking into consideration such Lender s policies and the policies of such Lender s holding company with respect to capital adequacy), then from time to time the Borrower will pay to such Lender such additional amount or amounts as will compensate such Lender or such Lender s holding company for any such reduction suffered. 

(c) Certificates for Reimbursement . A certificate of a Lender setting forth the amount or amounts necessary to compensate such Lender or its holding company, as the case may be, as specified in clause (a) or (b) of this Section and delivered to the Borrower, shall be conclusive absent manifest error. The Borrower shall pay such Lender the amount shown as due on any such certificate within 10 days after receipt thereof. 

(d) Delay in Requests . Failure or delay on the part of any Lender to demand compensation pursuant to this Section shall not constitute a waiver of such Lender s right to demand such compensation; provided that the Borrower shall not be required to compensate a Lender pursuant to this Section for any increased costs incurred or reductions suffered more than nine months prior to the date that such Lender notifies the Borrower of the Change in Law giving rise to such increased costs or reductions, and of such Lender s intention to claim compensation therefor (except that, if the Change in Law giving rise to such increased costs or reductions is retroactive, then the nine-month period referred to above shall be extended to include the period of retroactive effect thereof). 

SECTION 2.14 Taxes . 
 
 (a) Defined Terms . For purposes of this Section, the term Applicable Law includes FATCA. 

(b) Payments Free of Taxes . Any and all payments by or on account of any obligation of the any Loan Party under any Loan Document shall be made without deduction or withholding for any Taxes, except as required by Applicable Law. If any Applicable Law (as determined in the good faith discretion of an applicable Withholding Agent) requires the deduction or withholding of any Tax from any such payment by a Withholding Agent, then the applicable Withholding Agent shall be entitled to make such deduction or withholding and shall timely pay the full amount deducted or withheld to the relevant Governmental Authority in accordance with Applicable Law and, if such Tax is an 

40 

Indemnified Tax, then the sum payable by the applicable Loan Party shall be increased as necessary so that after such deduction or withholding has been made (including such deductions and withholdings applicable to additional sums payable under this Section) the applicable Recipient receives an amount equal to the sum it would have received had no such deduction or withholding been made. 
 (c) Payment of Other Taxes by Borrower . The Loan Parties shall timely pay to the relevant Governmental Authority in accordance with Applicable Law, any Other Taxes. 

(d) Indemnification by Borrower . The Loan Parties shall indemnify each Recipient, within 10 days after demand therefor, for the full amount of any Indemnified Taxes (including Indemnified Taxes imposed or asserted on or attributable to amounts payable under this Section) payable or paid by such Recipient or required to be withheld or deducted from a payment to such Recipient and any reasonable expenses arising therefrom or with respect thereto, whether or not such Indemnified Taxes were correctly or legally imposed or asserted by the relevant Governmental Authority. A certificate as to the amount of such payment or liability delivered to the Borrower by a Lender (with a copy to the Agent), or by the Agent on its own behalf or on behalf of a Lender, shall be conclusive absent manifest error. 

(e) Indemnification by the Lenders . Each Lender shall severally indemnify the Agent, within 10 days after demand therefor, for (i) any Indemnified Taxes attributable to such Lender (but only to the extent that any Loan Party has not already indemnified the Agent for such Indemnified Taxes and without limiting the obligation of the Loan Parties to do so), (ii) any Taxes attributable to such Lender s failure to comply with the provisions of Section 9.04(d) relating to the maintenance of a Participant Register and (iii) any Excluded Taxes attributable to such Lender, in each case, that are payable or paid by the Agent in connection with any Loan Document, and any reasonable expenses arising therefrom or with respect thereto, whether or not such Taxes were correctly or legally imposed or asserted by the relevant Governmental Authority. A certificate as to the amount of such payment or liability delivered to any Lender by the Agent shall be conclusive absent manifest error. Each Lender hereby authorizes the Agent to set off and apply any and all amounts at any time owing to such Lender under any Loan Document or otherwise payable by the Agent to the Lender from any other source against any amount due to the Agent under this clause (e). 

(f) Evidence of Payments . As soon as practicable after any payment of Taxes by any Loan Party to a Governmental Authority pursuant to this Section, the Loan Party shall deliver to the Agent the original or a certified copy of a receipt issued by such Governmental Authority evidencing such payment, a copy of the return reporting such payment or other evidence of such payment reasonably satisfactory to the Agent. 

(g) Status of Lenders . (i) Any Recipient (including for all purposes of this Section 2.14(g)(i) any Agent) that is entitled to an exemption from or reduction of withholding Tax with respect to payments made under any Loan Document shall deliver to the Borrower and the Agent, at the time or times reasonably requested by the Borrower or the Agent, such properly completed and executed documentation reasonably requested by the Borrower or the Agent as will permit such payments to be made without withholding or at a reduced rate of withholding. In addition, any Recipient, if reasonably requested by the Borrower or the Agent, shall deliver such other documentation prescribed by Applicable Law or reasonably requested by the Borrower or the Agent as will enable the Borrower or the Agent to determine whether or not such Recipient is subject to backup withholding or information reporting requirements. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in the preceding two sentences, the completion, execution and submission of such documentation (other than such documentation set forth in clauses (g)(ii)(A), (ii)(B) and (ii)(D) of this Section) shall not be required if in the Lender s reasonable judgment such completion, execution or submission would subject such Lender to any material 

41 

unreimbursed cost or expense or would materially prejudice the legal or commercial position of such Lender. 
 
 (i) Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, in the event that the Borrower is a U.S. Person, 

(A) any Recipient that is a U.S. Person shall deliver to the Borrower and the Agent on or about the date on which such Lender becomes a Lender under this Agreement (and from time to time thereafter upon the reasonable request of the Borrower or the Agent), executed copies of IRS Form W-9 certifying that such Lender is exempt from U.S. federal backup withholding tax; 

(B) any Foreign Lender shall, to the extent it is legally entitled to do so, deliver to the Borrower and the Agent (in such number of copies as shall be requested by the recipient) on or about the date on which such Foreign Lender becomes a Recipient under this Agreement (and from time to time thereafter upon the reasonable request of the Borrower or the Agent), whichever of the following is applicable: 

(1) in the case of a Foreign Lender claiming the benefits of an income tax treaty to which the United States is a party (x) with respect to payments of interest under any Loan Document, executed copies of IRS Form W-8BEN or IRS Form W-8BEN-E establishing an exemption from, or reduction of, U.S. federal withholding Tax pursuant to the interest article of such tax treaty and (y) with respect to any other applicable payments under any Loan Document, IRS Form W-8BEN or IRS Form W-8BEN-E establishing an exemption from, or reduction of, U.S. federal withholding Tax pursuant to the business profits or other income article of such tax treaty; 

(2) executed copies of IRS Form W-8ECI; 

(3) in the case of a Foreign Lender claiming the benefits of the exemption for portfolio interest under Section 881(c) of the Code, (x) a certificate substantially in the form of Exhibit B-1 to the effect that such Foreign Lender is not a bank within the meaning of Section 881(c)(3)(A) of the Code, a 10 percent shareholder of the Borrower within the meaning of Section 871(h)(3)(B) of the Code, or a controlled foreign corporation related to the Borrower as described in Section 881(c)(3)(C) of the Code (a U.S. Tax Compliance Certificate and (y) executed copies of IRS Form W-8BEN or IRS Form W-8BEN-E; or 

(4) to the extent a Foreign Lender is not the beneficial owner, executed copies of IRS Form W-8IMY, accompanied by IRS Form W-8ECI, IRS Form W-8BEN, IRS Form W-8BEN-E, a U.S. Tax 

Compliance Certificate substantially in the form of Exhibit B-2 or Exhibit B-3, IRS Form W-9, and/or other certification documents from each beneficial owner, as applicable; provided that if the Foreign Lender is a partnership and one or more direct or indirect partners of such Foreign Lender are claiming the portfolio interest exemption, such Foreign Lender may provide a U.S. Tax Compliance Certificate substantially in the form of Exhibit B-4 on behalf of each such direct and indirect partner; 

42 

(C) any Foreign Lender shall, to the extent it is legally entitled to do so, deliver to the Borrower and the Agent (in such number of copies as shall be requested by the recipient) on or about the date on which such Foreign Lender becomes a Lender under this Agreement (and from time to time thereafter upon the reasonable request of the Borrower or the Agent), executed copies of any other form prescribed by Applicable Law as a basis for claiming exemption from or a reduction in U.S. federal withholding Tax, duly completed, together with such supplementary documentation as may be prescribed by Applicable Law to permit the Borrower or the Agent to determine the withholding or deduction required to be made; and 

(D) if a payment made to a Recipient under any Loan Document would be subject to U.S. federal withholding Tax imposed by FATCA if such Lender were to fail to comply with the applicable reporting requirements of FATCA (including those contained in Section 1471(b) or 1472(b) of the Code, as applicable), such Recipient shall deliver to the Borrower and the Agent at the time or times prescribed by law and at such time or times reasonably requested by the Borrower or the Agent such documentation prescribed by Applicable Law (including as prescribed by Section 1471(b)(3)(C)(i) of the Code) and such additional documentation reasonably requested by the Borrower or the Agent as may be necessary for the Borrower and the Agent to comply with their obligations under FATCA and to determine that such Recipient has complied with such Recipient s obligations under FATCA or to determine the amount, if any, to deduct and withhold from such payment. Solely for purposes of this clause (D), FATCA shall include any amendments made to FATCA after the date of this Agreement. 

Each Recipient agrees that if any form or certification it previously delivered expires or becomes obsolete or inaccurate in any respect, it shall update such form or certification or promptly notify the Borrower and the Agent in writing of its legal inability to do so. 
 
 (h) Treatment of Certain Refunds . If any party determines, in its sole discretion exercised in good faith, that it has received a refund of any Taxes as to which it has been indemnified pursuant to this Section (including by the payment of additional amounts pursuant to this Section), it shall pay to the indemnifying party an amount equal to such refund (but only to the extent of indemnity payments made under this Section with respect to the Taxes giving rise to such refund), net of all out-of-pocket expenses (including Taxes) of such indemnified party and without interest (other than any interest paid by the relevant Governmental Authority with respect to such refund). Such indemnifying party, upon the request of such indemnified party, shall repay to such indemnified party the amount paid over pursuant to this clause (h) (plus any penalties, interest or other charges imposed by the relevant Governmental Authority) in the event that such indemnified party is required to repay such refund to such Governmental Authority. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this clause (h), in no event will the indemnified party be required to pay any amount to an indemnifying party pursuant to this clause (h) the payment of which would place the indemnified party in a less favorable net after-Tax position than the indemnified party would have been in if the Tax subject to indemnification and giving rise to such refund had not been deducted, withheld or otherwise imposed and the indemnification payments or additional amounts with respect to such Tax had never been paid. This clause shall not be construed to require any indemnified party to make available its Tax returns (or any other information relating to its Taxes that it deems confidential) to the indemnifying party or any other Person. 

(i) Survival . Each party s obligations under this Section shall survive the resignation or replacement of the Agent or any assignment of rights by, or the replacement of, a Lender, 

43 

the termination of the Commitments and the repayment, satisfaction or discharge of all obligations under any Loan Document. 
 SECTION 2.15 Mitigation Obligations; Replacement of Lenders . 
 
 (a) Designation of a Different Lending Office .

(i) would eliminate or reduce amounts payable pursuant to Section 2.13 or 2.14, as the case may be, in the future, and (ii) would not subject such Lender to any unreimbursed cost or expense and would not otherwise be disadvantageous to such Lender. The Borrower hereby agrees to pay all reasonable costs and expenses incurred by any Lender in connection with any such designation or assignment. 
 (b) Replacement of Lenders . If any Lender requests compensation under Section 2.13, or if the Borrower is required to pay any Indemnified Taxes or additional amounts to any Lender or any Governmental Authority for the account of any Lender pursuant to Section 2.14 and, in each case, such Lender has declined or is unable to designate a different lending office in accordance with clause (a) of this Section, then the Borrower may, at its sole expense and effort, upon notice to such Lender and the Agent, require such Lender to assign and delegate, without recourse (in accordance with and subject to the restrictions contained in, and consents required by, Section 9.04), all of its interests, rights (other than its existing rights to payments pursuant to Section 2.13 or Section 2.14) and obligations under this Agreement and the related Loan Documents to an Eligible Assignee or Preferred Assignee that shall assume such obligations (which assignee may be another Lender, if a Lender accepts such assignment); provided that: 

(i) the Borrower shall have paid to the Agent the assignment fee (if any) specified in Section 9.04; 

(ii) such Lender shall have received payment of an amount equal to the outstanding principal of its Loans, accrued interest thereon, accrued fees and all other amounts payable to it hereunder and under the other Loan Documents from the assignee (to the extent of such outstanding principal and accrued interest and fees) or the Borrower (in the case of all other amounts); 

(iii) in the case of any such assignment resulting from a claim for compensation under Section 2.13 or payments required to be made pursuant to Section 2.14, such assignment will result in a reduction in such compensation or payments thereafter; and 

(iv) such assignment does not conflict with Applicable Law. 

A Lender shall not be required to make any such assignment or delegation if, prior thereto, as a result of a waiver by such Lender or otherwise, the circumstances entitling the Borrower to require such assignment and delegation cease to apply. 
 
 SECTION 2.16 Extension of Maturity Date .

The Borrower agrees that each Participant shall be entitled to the benefits of Sections 2.13 and 2.14 (subject to the requirements and limitations therein, including the requirements under Section 2.14(g) (it being understood that the documentation required under Section 2.14(g) shall be delivered to the participating Lender)) to the same extent as if it were a Lender and had acquired its interest by assignment pursuant to clause (b) of this Section; provided that such Participant (A) agrees to be subject to the provisions of Section 2.15 as if it were an assignee under clause (b) of this Section; and 
 (B) shall not be entitled to receive any greater payment under Section 2.13 or 2.14, with respect to any participation, than its participating Lender would have been entitled to receive, except to the extent such entitlement to receive a greater payment results from a Change in Law that occurs after the Participant acquired the applicable participation.

request and expense, to use reasonable efforts to cooperate with the Borrower to effectuate the provisions of Section 2.15(b) with respect to any Participant. To the extent permitted by law, each Participant also shall be entitled to the benefits of Section 9.08 as though it were a Lender; provided that such Participant agrees to be subject to Section 2.12 as though it were a Lender.

The entries in the Participant Register shall be conclusive absent manifest error, and such Lender shall treat each Person whose name is recorded in the Participant Register as the owner of such participation for all purposes of this Agreement notwithstanding any notice to the contrary. For the avoidance of doubt, the Agent (in its capacity as Agent) shall have no responsibility for maintaining a Participant Register. The Borrower hereby agrees that each Lender acting as its agent solely for the purpose set forth above in this clause (d) shall not subject such Lender to any fiduciary or other implied duties, all of which are hereby waived by the Borrower with respect to such Lender acting as it agent solely for the purpose set forth above in this clause (d).

If any payment to be made by the Borrower shall fall due on a day that is not a Business Day, payment shall be made on the next succeeding Business Day and such extension of time shall be reflected in computing interest or fees, as the case may be; provided that, if such next succeeding Business Day would fall after the Maturity Date, payment shall be made on the immediately preceding Business Day. Except as otherwise expressly provided herein, all payments hereunder or under any other Loan Document shall be made in Dollars. 

(b) Application of Insufficient Payments . Subject to Section 7.02, if at any time insufficient funds are received by and available to the Agent to pay fully all amounts of principal, interest, fees and other amounts then due hereunder, such funds shall be applied (i) first , to pay interest, fees and other amounts then due hereunder, ratably among the parties entitled thereto in accordance with the amounts of interest, fees and other amounts then due to such parties, and (ii) second , to pay principal then due hereunder, ratably among the parties entitled thereto in accordance with the amounts of principal then due to such parties. 

(c) Presumptions by Agent . Unless the Agent shall have received notice from the Borrower prior to the date on which any payment is due to the Agent for the account of the Lenders hereunder that the Borrower will not make such payment, the Agent may assume that the Borrower has made such payment on such date in accordance herewith and may, in reliance upon such assumption, distribute to the Lenders the amount due. In such event, if the Borrower has not in fact made such payment, then each of the Lenders severally agrees to repay to the Agent forthwith on demand the amount so distributed to such Lender, with interest thereon, for each day from and including the date 

34 

such amount is distributed to it to but excluding the date of payment to the Agent, at the greater of the Federal Funds Effective Rate and a rate determined by the Agent in accordance with banking industry rules on interbank compensation.

(e) Several Obligations of Lenders . The obligations of the Lenders hereunder to make Loans and to make payments pursuant to Section 9.03(c) are several and not joint. The failure of any Lender to make any Loan or to make any such payment on any date required hereunder shall not relieve any other Lender of its corresponding obligation to do so on such date, and no Lender shall be responsible for the failure of any other Lender to so make its Loan or to make its payment under Section 9.03(c). 

SECTION 2.12 Sharing of Payments . If any Lender shall, by exercising any right of setoff or counterclaim or otherwise, obtain payment in respect of any principal of or interest on any of its Loans or other obligations hereunder resulting in such Lender receiving payment of a proportion of the aggregate amount of its Loans and accrued interest thereon or other such obligations greater than its pro rata share thereof as provided herein, then the Lender receiving such greater proportion shall (a) notify the Agent of such fact, and (b) purchase (for cash at face value) participations in the Loans and such other obligations of the other Lenders, or make such other adjustments as shall be equitable, so that the benefit of all such payments shall be shared by the Lenders ratably in accordance with the aggregate amount of principal of and accrued interest on their respective Loans and other amounts owing them; provided that: 
 
 (i) if any such participations are purchased and all or any portion of the payment giving rise thereto is recovered, such participations shall be rescinded and the purchase price restored to the extent of such recovery, without interest; and 

(ii) the provisions of this subclause shall not be construed to apply to (x) any payment made by the Borrower pursuant to and in accordance with the express terms of this Agreement or (y) any payment obtained by a Lender as consideration for the assignment of or sale of a participation in any of its Loans to any assignee or participant, other than to the Borrower or any Subsidiary thereof (as to which the provisions of this subclause shall apply). 

The Borrower consents to the foregoing and agrees, to the extent it may effectively do so under Applicable Law, that any Lender acquiring a participation pursuant to the foregoing arrangements may exercise against the Borrower rights of setoff and counterclaim with respect to such participation as fully as if such Lender were a direct creditor of the Borrower in the amount of such participation.

 (b) Capital Requirements . If any Lender determines that any Change in Law affecting such Lender or any lending office of such Lender or such Lender s holding company, if any, regarding capital or liquidity requirements, has or would have the effect of reducing the rate of return on such Lender s capital or on the capital of such Lender s holding company, if any, as a consequence of this Agreement, the Commitments of such Lender or the Loans made by such Lender to a level below that which such Lender or such Lender s holding company could have achieved but for such Change in Law (taking into consideration such Lender s policies and the policies of such Lender s holding company with respect to capital adequacy), then from time to time the Borrower will pay to such Lender such additional amount or amounts as will compensate such Lender or such Lender s holding company for any such reduction suffered. 

(c) Certificates for Reimbursement . A certificate of a Lender setting forth the amount or amounts necessary to compensate such Lender or its holding company, as the case may be, as specified in clause (a) or (b) of this Section and delivered to the Borrower, shall be conclusive absent manifest error. The Borrower shall pay such Lender the amount shown as due on any such certificate within 10 days after receipt thereof. 

(d) Delay in Requests . Failure or delay on the part of any Lender to demand compensation pursuant to this Section shall not constitute a waiver of such Lender s right to demand such compensation; provided that the Borrower shall not be required to compensate a Lender pursuant to this Section for any increased costs incurred or reductions suffered more than nine months prior to the date that such Lender notifies the Borrower of the Change in Law giving rise to such increased costs or reductions, and of such Lender s intention to claim compensation therefor (except that, if the Change in Law giving rise to such increased costs or reductions is retroactive, then the nine-month period referred to above shall be extended to include the period of retroactive effect thereof).

36 

Indemnified Tax, then the sum payable by the applicable Loan Party shall be increased as necessary so that after such deduction or withholding has been made (including such deductions and withholdings applicable to additional sums payable under this Section) the applicable Recipient receives an amount equal to the sum it would have received had no such deduction or withholding been made. 
 (c) Payment of Other Taxes by Borrower . The Loan Parties shall timely pay to the relevant Governmental Authority in accordance with Applicable Law, any Other Taxes. 

(d) Indemnification by Borrower . The Loan Parties shall indemnify each Recipient, within 10 days after demand therefor, for the full amount of any Indemnified Taxes (including Indemnified Taxes imposed or asserted on or attributable to amounts payable under this Section) payable or paid by such Recipient or required to be withheld or deducted from a payment to such Recipient and any reasonable expenses arising therefrom or with respect thereto, whether or not such Indemnified Taxes were correctly or legally imposed or asserted by the relevant Governmental Authority. A certificate as to the amount of such payment or liability delivered to the Borrower by a Lender (with a copy to the Agent), or by the Agent on its own behalf or on behalf of a Lender, shall be conclusive absent manifest error. 

(e) Indemnification by the Lenders . Each Lender shall severally indemnify the Agent, within 10 days after demand therefor, for (i) any Indemnified Taxes attributable to such Lender (but only to the extent that any Loan Party has not already indemnified the Agent for such Indemnified Taxes and without limiting the obligation of the Loan Parties to do so), (ii) any Taxes attributable to such Lender s failure to comply with the provisions of Section 9.04(d) relating to the maintenance of a Participant Register and (iii) any Excluded Taxes attributable to such Lender, in each case, that are payable or paid by the Agent in connection with any Loan Document, and any reasonable expenses arising therefrom or with respect thereto, whether or not such Taxes were correctly or legally imposed or asserted by the relevant Governmental Authority. A certificate as to the amount of such payment or liability delivered to any Lender by the Agent shall be conclusive absent manifest error. Each Lender hereby authorizes the Agent to set off and apply any and all amounts at any time owing to such Lender under any Loan Document or otherwise payable by the Agent to the Lender from any other source against any amount due to the Agent under this clause (e). 

(f) Evidence of Payments . As soon as practicable after any payment of Taxes by any Loan Party to a Governmental Authority pursuant to this Section, the Loan Party shall deliver to the Agent the original or a certified copy of a receipt issued by such Governmental Authority evidencing such payment, a copy of the return reporting such payment or other evidence of such payment reasonably satisfactory to the Agent. 

(g) Status of Lenders . (i) Any Recipient (including for all purposes of this Section 2.14(g)(i) any Agent) that is entitled to an exemption from or reduction of withholding Tax with respect to payments made under any Loan Document shall deliver to the Borrower and the Agent, at the time or times reasonably requested by the Borrower or the Agent, such properly completed and executed documentation reasonably requested by the Borrower or the Agent as will permit such payments to be made without withholding or at a reduced rate of withholding.

The provisions of this Article are solely for the benefit of the Agent and the Lenders, and the Borrower shall not have rights as a third-party beneficiary of any of such provisions. It is understood and agreed that the use of the term agent herein or in any other Loan Documents (or any other similar term) with reference to the Agent is not intended to connote any fiduciary or other implied (or express) obligations arising under agency doctrine of any Applicable Law. Instead such term is used as a matter of market custom, and is intended to create or reflect only an administrative relationship between contracting parties. 
 
 SECTION 8.02 Merger or Consolidation .

(iv) shall not be required to expend or risk its own funds or otherwise incur any financial liability in the performance of any of its duties or in the exercise of any of its rights or powers hereunder; and

The Agent shall be deemed not to have knowledge of any Default unless and until notice describing such Default is given to the Agent in writing by the Borrower or a Lender. In the event that the Agent receives such a notice of the occurrence of a Default, the Agent shall take such action with respect to such Default or Event of Default as shall reasonably be directed by the Required Lenders, provided that, unless and until the Agent shall have received such directions, the Agent may (but shall not be obligated to) take such action, or refrain from taking such action, with respect to such Default as it shall deem advisable in the best interest of the Lenders.

If no such successor shall have been so appointed by the Required Lenders and shall have accepted such appointment within thirty (30) days after the retiring Agent gives notice of its resignation (or such earlier day as shall be agreed by the Required Lenders) (the Resignation Effective Date ), then the retiring Agent may (but shall not be obligated to), on behalf of the Lenders, appoint a successor Agent meeting the qualifications set forth above.

Any agreement or instrument pursuant to which a Lender sells such a participation shall provide that such Lender shall retain the sole right to enforce this Agreement and to approve any amendment, modification or waiver of any provision of this Agreement; provided that such agreement or instrument may provide that such Lender will not, without the consent of the Participant, agree to any amendment, modification or waiver described in Section 9.02(b)(i) through (v) that adversely affects such Participant. The Borrower agrees that each Participant shall be entitled to the benefits of Sections 2.13 and 2.14 (subject to the requirements and limitations therein, including the requirements under Section 2.14(g) (it being understood that the documentation required under Section 2.14(g) shall be delivered to the participating Lender)) to the same extent as if it were a Lender and had acquired its interest by assignment pursuant to clause (b) of this Section; provided that such Participant (A) agrees to be subject to the provisions of Section 2.15 as if it were an assignee under clause (b) of this Section; and 
 (B) shall not be entitled to receive any greater payment under Section 2.13 or 2.14, with respect to any participation, than its participating Lender would have been entitled to receive, except to the extent such entitlement to receive a greater payment results from a Change in Law that occurs after the Participant acquired the applicable participation. Each Lender that sells a participation agrees, at the Borrower's request and expense, to use reasonable efforts to cooperate with the Borrower to effectuate the provisions of Section 2.15(b) with respect to any Participant. To the extent permitted by law, each Participant also shall be entitled to the benefits of Section 9.08 as though it were a Lender; provided that such Participant agrees to be subject to Section 2.12 as though it were a Lender. Each Lender that sells a participation shall, acting solely for this purpose as a non-fiduciary agent of the Borrower (and, to the extent the Borrower is disregarded for U.S. federal income tax purposes, the Borrower s regarded owner for U.S. federal income tax purposes), maintain a register on which it enters the name and address of each Participant and the principal amounts (and stated interest) of each Participant s interest in the Loans or other obligations under the Loan Documents (the Participant Register ); provided that no Lender shall have any obligation to disclose all or any portion of the Participant Register (including the identity of any Participant or any information relating to a Participant's interest in any commitments, loans or its other obligations under any Loan Document) to any Person except to the extent that such disclosure is necessary to establish that such commitment, loan or other obligation is in registered form under Section 5f.103-1(c) of the United States Treasury Regulations. The entries in the Participant Register 

87 

shall be conclusive absent manifest error, and such Lender shall treat each Person whose name is recorded in the Participant Register as the owner of such participation for all purposes of this Agreement notwithstanding any notice to the contrary. For the avoidance of doubt, the Agent (in its capacity as Agent) shall have no responsibility for maintaining a Participant Register. The Borrower hereby agrees that each Lender acting as its agent solely for the purpose set forth above in this clause (d) shall not subject such Lender to any fiduciary or other implied duties, all of which are hereby waived by the Borrower with respect to such Lender acting as it agent solely for the purpose set forth above in this clause (d). 
 (e) Certain Pledges . Any Lender may at any time pledge or assign a security interest in all or any portion of its rights under this Agreement to secure obligations of such Lender, including any pledge or assignment to secure obligations to a Federal Reserve Bank; provided that no such pledge or assignment shall release such Lender from any of its obligations hereunder or substitute any such pledgee or assignee for such Lender as a party hereto.

(e) (d) All computations of interest hereunder shall be made in accordance with 

Section 4.05 . 
 
 SECTION 2.07 Increased Costs, Illegality, Etc .

Without limiting Section 2.07(d) , the failure to give any such notice with respect to a particular event shall not release or diminish any of Borrowers obligations to pay additional amounts pursuant to this Section 2.07(b) for amounts accrued or incurred after the date of such notice with respect to such event. Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, (x) the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act and all rules, regulations, orders, requests, guidelines or directives in connection therewith, and (y) all requests, rules, guidelines or directives promulgated by the Bank for International Settlements, the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision (or any successor or similar authority) or the United States or other foreign regulatory authorities, in each case pursuant to Basel III, in each case, are deemed to have been adopted and to have taken effect after the Closing Date.

 (d) If any Lender shall give notice to Parent that such Lender is entitled to receive and is requesting payments under this Section 2.07 or requires Borrowers to pay additional amounts pursuant to Section 4.04 (any such Lender, an Increased Cost Lender ), then Borrowers may, at their sole expense and effort, permanently replace such Increased Cost Lender with one or more substitute Lenders reasonably acceptable to Administrative Agent (each, a Replacement Lender ), and such Increased Cost Lender shall have no right to refuse to be replaced hereunder. Such notice to replace the Increased Cost Lender shall specify an effective date for such replacement, which date shall not be sooner than five Business Days and not be later than 10 Business Days after the date such notice is given, provided that (i) such Increased Cost Lender shall have received payment of an amount equal to the outstanding Obligations payable to it from the assignee (to the extent of outstanding principal and accrued interests and fees) or Borrowers (in the case of all other amounts) and (ii) such assignment does not conflict with Applicable Law. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, a Lender shall not be 

47 
 21029590V.1 
 
 required to make any such assignment pursuant to this Section 2.07(d) if, prior to the effective date for such replacement, as a result of a waiver by such Lender or otherwise, the circumstances entitling Borrowers to require such assignment pursuant to this Section 2.07(d) cease to apply. 
 
 (e) Prior to the effective date of such replacement pursuant to Section 2.07(d) , the Increased Cost Lender and each Replacement Lender shall execute and deliver an Assignment and Acceptance, subject only to the Increased Cost Lender being repaid all Obligations owed to it through the effective date of the replacement. If the Increased Cost Lender shall refuse or fail to execute and deliver any such Assignment and Acceptance prior to the effective date of such replacement, the Increased Cost Lender shall be deemed to have executed and delivered such Assignment and Acceptance. The replacement of any Increased Cost Lender shall be made in accordance with the terms of Section 12.06 . 

(f) A certificate of a Lender setting forth the amount or amounts necessary to compensate such Lender or its holding company, as the case may be, as specified in Section 2.07(a) or 2.07(b) of this Section and delivered to the Borrower, shall be conclusive absent manifest error. 

SECTION 2.08 Multiple Borrowers . 
 
 (a) It is the intent of the parties to this Agreement that Borrowers shall be jointly and severally obligated hereunder and under the Notes, as co-borrowers under this Agreement and as co-makers of the Notes, in respect of the principal of and interest on, and all other amounts owing in respect of, the Loans and the Notes. Each Borrower hereby (i) jointly and severally and irrevocably and unconditionally accepts, not merely as a surety but also as a co-debtor, joint and several liability with the other Borrowers with respect to the payment and performance of all of the Obligations hereunder, it being the intention of the parties hereto that all such Obligations shall be the joint and several obligations of each Borrower without preferences or distinction among them and that the obligations of each Borrower hereunder shall be unconditional irrespective of any circumstance whatsoever that might otherwise constitute a legal or equitable discharge or defense of a guarantor or surety, and (ii) further agrees that if any such Obligations are not paid in full when due (whether at stated maturity, as mandatory prepayment or cash collateralization, by acceleration or otherwise), Borrowers will, jointly and severally, promptly pay the same, without any demand or notice whatsoever. Each Borrower acknowledges and agrees that the delivery of funds to any Borrower under this Agreement shall constitute valuable consideration and reasonably equivalent value to all Borrowers for the purpose of binding them and their assets on a joint and several basis for the Obligations hereunder.

(c) Notwithstanding anything contained herein to the contrary, the obligations of each Borrower under the Credit Documents at any time shall be limited to the maximum amount as will result in the obligations of such Borrower under the Credit Documents not constituting a fraudulent transfer or conveyance for purposes of any Debtor Relief Laws. 

(d) If any payment shall be required to be made to any Secured Party under any Credit Document, each Borrower hereby unconditionally and irrevocably agrees it will contribute, to the 

48 
 21029590V.1 
 
 maximum extent permitted by law, such amounts to each other Credit Party so as to maximize the aggregate amount paid to the Secured Parties under or in connection with the Credit Documents. 
 
 (e) This Section 2.08 is intended solely to preserve the rights of Agents and the other Secured Parties hereunder and under the other Credit Document to the maximum extent that would not cause the Obligations or the Secured Obligations (as defined in the Security Agreement) of each Borrower to be subject to avoidance or unenforceability under any Debtor Relief Laws, and neither any Borrower nor any other Person shall have any right or claim under this Section 2.06 2.08 as against any Agent or any other Secured Party that would not otherwise be available to such Person under the Bankruptcy Code or such other laws. 

SECTION 2.09 Borrower Representative . Each Borrower, by its execution of this Agreement, irrevocably appoints Parent to act on its behalf as its agent in relation to the Credit Documents and irrevocably authorizes: 
 
 (a) Parent on its behalf to supply all information concerning itself contemplated by this Agreement to Agents and Lenders and to give and receive all notices, instructions and other communications, to sign all certificates, to make such agreements and to effect the relevant amendments, supplements, variations and waivers capable of being given, made or effected by any Borrower, notwithstanding that they may affect such Borrower, without further reference to or the consent of such Borrower; and 

(b) Agents and Lenders to give any notice, demand or other communication to such Borrower pursuant to the Credit Documents to Parent, 

and in each case such Borrower shall be bound as though such Borrower itself had given the notices and instructions or executed or made the agreements or effected the amendments, supplements or variations, or received the relevant notice, demand or other communication. 
 
 Every act, omission, agreement, undertaking, settlement, waiver, amendment, supplement, variation, notice, instruction or other communication given or made by Parent or given to Parent under any Credit Document on behalf of another Borrower (whether or not known to any other Borrower and whether occurring before or after such other Borrower became a Borrower under any Credit Document) shall be binding for all purposes on such Borrower as if such Borrower had expressly agreed, executed, made, given or concurred with it or received the relevant notice, demand or other communication. In the event of any conflict between any notices or other communications of Parent and any other Borrower, those of Parent shall prevail. 
 
 SECTION 2.10 Defaulting Lender . 
 
 (a) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, in the event any Lender is a Defaulting Lender, all rights and obligations hereunder of such Defaulting Lender and of the other parties hereto shall be modified to the extent of the express provisions of this Section 2.10 so long as such Lender is a Defaulting Lender. 

(b) Except as otherwise expressly provided for in this Section 2.10 , Loans shall be made pro rata from the Lenders holding Commitments which are not Defaulting Lenders based on their respective Commitment Percentages, and no Commitment Percentage of any Lender or any pro rata share of any Loans required to be advanced by any Lender shall be increased as a result of any Lender being a Defaulting Lender.

50 
 21029590V.1 
 
 accordance with their Commitment Percentages; provided that Administrative Agent shall not be obligated to transfer to a Defaulting Lender any payments received by Administrative Agent for Defaulting Lender s benefit, nor shall a Defaulting Lender be entitled to the sharing of any payments hereunder (including any principal, interest or fees). Amounts payable to a Defaulting Lender shall instead be paid to or retained by Administrative Agent (it being understood that such retention by Administrative Agent shall not trigger an Event of Default due to such Defaulting Lender not receiving such funds). Administrative Agent may hold and, in its discretion, re-lend to Borrowers the amount of such payments received or retained by it for the account of such Defaulting Lender. 
 
 (c) A Defaulting Lender shall not be entitled to give instructions to Administrative Agent or to approve, disapprove, consent to or vote on any matters relating to this Agreement or the other Credit Documents, and all amendments, waivers and other modifications of this Agreement or the other Credit Documents may be made without regard to a Defaulting Lender and, for purposes of the definition of Required Lenders, a Defaulting Lender shall not be deemed to be a Lender, to have any outstanding Loans or a Commitment Percentage; provided that this Section 2.10(c) shall not apply to the vote of a Defaulting Lender in the case of an amendment, waiver or other modification described in Sections 12.01(a) and 12.01(c) . 

(d) Other than as expressly set forth in this Section 2.10 , the rights and obligations of a Defaulting Lender (including the obligation to indemnify Agents) and the other parties hereto shall remain unchanged. Nothing in this Section 2.10 shall be deemed to release any Defaulting Lender from its obligations under this Agreement or the other Credit Documents, shall alter such obligations, shall operate as a waiver of any default by such Defaulting Lender hereunder, or shall prejudice any rights which any Borrower, any Agent or any Lender may have against any Defaulting Lender as a result of any default by such Defaulting Lender hereunder. 

(e) In the event that Administrative Agent and Borrowers agree in writing that a Defaulting Lender has adequately remedied all matters that caused such Lender to be a Defaulting Lender, then Administrative Agent will so notify the parties hereto. 

(f) If any Lender is a Defaulting Lender, Borrowers may, within 90 days of receipt of such Lender becoming a Defaulting Lender, by notice in writing to Administrative Agent and such Defaulting Lender (i) request the Defaulting Lender to cooperate with Borrowers in obtaining a Replacement Lender; (ii) request the Non-Defaulting Lenders to acquire and assume all of the Defaulting Lender s Loans and its Commitment Percentage as provided herein, but none of such Lenders shall be under any obligation to do so; or (iii) propose a Replacement Lender subject to approval by Administrative Agent in its good faith business judgment. If any satisfactory Replacement Lender shall be obtained, or if any one or more of the Non-Defaulting Lenders shall agree to acquire and assume all of the Defaulting Lender s Loans and its Commitment Percentage, then such Defaulting Lender shall assign, in accordance with Section 12.06 , all of its Loans and its Commitment Percentage and other rights and obligations under this Agreement and the other Credit Documents to such Replacement Lender or Non-Defaulting Lenders, as the case may be, in exchange for payment of the principal amount so assigned and all interest and fees accrued on the amount so assigned, plus all other Obligations then due and payable to the Defaulting Lender. Nothing in this Section 2.10 shall limit any other remedies available at law or in equity to Borrowers against any Defaulting Lender for damages sustained by Borrowers due to such Lender being a Defaulting Lender.

A certificate as to the amount of such payment or liability delivered to Borrowers by a Lender (with a copy to Administrative Agent), or by Administrative Agent on its own behalf or on behalf of a Lender, shall be conclusive absent manifest error. 

(d) Each Lender shall severally indemnify Administrative Agent, within 10 days after demand therefor, for (i) any Indemnified Taxes attributable to such Lender (but only to the extent that any Credit Party has not already indemnified Administrative Agent for such Indemnified Taxes and without limiting the obligation of the Credit Parties to do so), (ii) any Taxes attributable to such Lender s failure to comply with the provisions of Section 12.06(c) relating to the maintenance of a Participant Register and (iii) any Excluded Taxes attributable to such Lender, in each case, that are payable or paid by Administrative Agent in connection with any Credit Document, and any costs and expenses arising therefrom or with respect thereto, whether or not such Taxes were correctly or legally imposed or asserted by the relevant Governmental Authority.

In addition, any Lender, if reasonably requested by Parent or Administrative Agent, shall deliver such other documentation prescribed by Applicable Law or reasonably requested by Parent or Administrative Agent as will enable Borrowers or Administrative Agent to determine whether or not such Lender is subject to backup withholding or information reporting requirements. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in the preceding two sentences, the completion, execution and submission of such documentation (other than such documentation set forth in Sections 4.04(f)(ii)(A) , 4.04(f)(ii)(B) and 4.04(f)(ii)(D) shall not be required if in the Lender s reasonable judgment such completion, execution or submission would subject 

56 
 21029590V.1

57 
 21029590V.1 
 
 documentation as may be prescribed by applicable law to permit Borrowers or Administrative Agent to determine the withholding or deduction required to be made; and 
 
 (D) if a payment made to a Lender under any Credit Document would be subject to U.S. federal withholding Tax imposed by FATCA if such Lender were to fail to comply with the applicable reporting requirements of FATCA (including those contained in Section 1471(b) or 1472(b) of the Code, as applicable), such Lender shall deliver to Parent and Administrative Agent at the time or times prescribed by law and at such time or times reasonably requested by Parent or Administrative Agent such documentation prescribed by applicable law (including as prescribed by Section 1471(b)(3)(C)(i) of the Code) and such additional documentation reasonably requested by Parent or Administrative Agent as may be necessary for Borrowers and Administrative Agent to comply with their obligations under FATCA and to determine that such Lender has complied with such Lender s obligations under FATCA or to determine the amount to deduct and withhold from such payment.

Such indemnifying party, upon the request of such indemnified party, shall repay to such indemnified party the amount paid over pursuant to this Section 4.04(g) (plus any penalties, interest or other charges imposed by the relevant Governmental Authority) in the event that such indemnified party is required to repay such refund to such Governmental Authority. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Section 4.04(g) , in no event will the indemnified party be required to pay any amount to an indemnifying party pursuant to this Section 4.04(g) the payment of which would place the indemnified party in a less favorable net after-Tax position than the indemnified party would have been in if the Tax subject to indemnification and giving rise to such refund had not been deducted, withheld or otherwise imposed and the indemnification payments or additional amounts with respect to such Tax had never been paid. This Section 4.04(g) shall not be construed to require any indemnified party to make available its Tax returns (or any other information relating to its Taxes that it deems confidential) to the indemnifying party or any other Person.

SECTION 4.05 Computations of Interest and Fees . All interest and fees shall be computed on the basis of the actual number of days occurring during the period for which such interest or fee is payable over a year comprised of 360 days , and with respect to the Incremental Loans, all interest and fees shall be computed as set forth in the Incremental Loan Agreement . For the purposes of the Interest Act (Canada) or any successor or similar legislation, whenever any interest or fee under this Agreement is calculated using a rate based on a period other than a calendar year or similar expression, such interest rate, fee or other amount shall be determined pursuant to such calculation, when expressed as an annual 

58 
 21029590V.1 
 
 rate, is equivalent to such rate as determined multiplied by the actual number of days in the calendar year in which the period for which such interest or fee is payable (or compounded) ends and divided by the number of days comprising such other period. Each determination by Administrative Agent of an interest rate and fees hereunder shall be presumptive evidence of the correctness of such rates and fees, absent manifest error. Payments due on a day that is not a Business Day shall (except as otherwise required by Administrative Agent) be made on the immediately preceding Business Day and such reduction of time shall not be included in computing interest and fees in connection with that payment but shall be included in computing interest and fees in connection with the immediately succeeding payment. 
 
 SECTION 4.06 Maximum Interest . 
 
 (a) In no event whatsoever shall interest and other charges charged hereunder exceed the highest rate permissible under applicable law. In the event interest and other charges as computed hereunder would otherwise exceed the highest rate permitted under applicable law: (i) the interest rates hereunder will be reduced to the maximum rate permitted under applicable law; (ii) such excess amount shall be first applied to any unpaid principal balance owed by Borrowers; and (iii) if the then remaining excess amount is greater than the previously unpaid principal balance, the applicable Lender shall promptly refund such excess amount to Borrowers and the provisions hereof shall be deemed amended to provide for such permissible rate. 

(b) If the amount of any interest, premium, fees or other monies or any rate of interest stipulated for, taken, reserved or extracted under the Credit Documents would otherwise contravene the provisions of Section 347 of the Criminal Code (Canada), Section 8 of the Interest Act (Canada) or any successor or similar legislation (including any usury law in the U.S.), or would exceed the amounts which any Lender is legally entitled to charge and receive under any law to which such compensation is subject, then such amount or rate of interest shall be reduced to such maximum amount as would not contravene such provision; and to the extent that any excess has been charged or received such Lender shall apply such excess against the outstanding Loans and refund any further excess amount to the applicable Borrower. 

(c) If any provision of this Agreement or any other Credit Document would obligate Borrowers or a Credit Party to make any payment of interest or other amount payable to any Lender in an amount or calculated at a rate which would be prohibited by law or would result in a receipt by any Lender of interest at a criminal rate (as construed under the Criminal Code (Canada)), then notwithstanding that provision, that amount or rate shall be deemed to have been adjusted with retroactive effect to the maximum amount or rate of interest, as the case may be, as would not be so prohibited by law or result in a receipt by such Lender of interest at a criminal rate, the adjustment to be effected, to the extent necessary, as follows: 

(i) first, by reducing the amount or rate of interest required to be paid to such Lender under this Section 4.06 ; and 

(ii) thereafter, by reducing any fees, commissions, premiums and other amounts required to be paid to such Lender which would constitute interest for purposes of the Criminal Code (Canada) or other applicable law; 

provided that, notwithstanding the foregoing, and after giving effect to all adjustments contemplated thereby, if any Lender receives an amount in excess of the maximum permitted by the Criminal Code (Canada) or other Applicable Law, then Borrowers shall be entitled, by notice in writing to such Lender, to obtain reimbursement from such Lender in an amount equal to the excess, and 

59 
 21029590V.1 
 
 pending reimbursement, the amount of the excess shall be deemed to be an amount payable by such Lender to Borrowers and shall be promptly paid to Borrowers. 
 
 Any amount or rate of interest referred to in this Agreement shall be determined in accordance with generally accepted actuarial practices and principles as an effective annual rate of interest over the term that any Loan remains outstanding on the assumption that any charges, fees or expenses that fall within the meaning of interest (as defined in the Criminal Code (Canada)) shall, if they relate to a specific period of time, be pro-rated over that period of time and otherwise be pro-rated over the period from the earlier of the date of advance and the Closing Date to the relevant Maturity Date and, in the event of a dispute, a certificate of a Fellow of the Canadian Institute of Actuaries appointed by Administrative Agent shall be conclusive for the purposes of that determination.

Agents may deem and treat the payee of any note as the owner thereof for all purposes unless a written notice of assignment, negotiation or transfer thereof shall have been filed with Agents.

Collateral Agent shall not be deemed to have knowledge or notice of the occurrence of any Default or Event of Default hereunder unless Collateral Agent has received notice from a Lender or a Borrower referring to this Agreement, describing such Default or Event of Default and stating that such notice is a notice of default .

Each Agent shall take such action with respect to such Default or Event of Default as shall be reasonably directed by Required Lenders (or, if so specified by this Agreement, all Lenders or any other instructing group of Lenders specified by this Agreement); provided that unless and until each Agent shall have received such directions, Agents may (but shall not be obligated to) take such action, or refrain from taking such action, with respect to such Default or Event of Default as such Agent shall deem advisable in the best interests of the Secured Parties. 
 
 SECTION 11.06	 Non-Reliance on Agents and other Lenders .

Except for notices, reports and other documents expressly required to be furnished to the Lenders by any Agent or Arranger hereunder, Agents and Arranger shall not have any duty or responsibility to provide any Lender or any other Secured Party with any credit or other information concerning the business, operations, property, condition (financial or otherwise), prospects or creditworthiness of any Credit Party or any Affiliate of a Credit Party that may come into the possession of such Agent or any of its officers, directors, employees, agents, attorneys in fact or Affiliates. 
 
 SECTION 11.07	 Indemnification . The Lenders agree to indemnify each Agent in its capacity as such (to the extent not reimbursed by the Credit Parties and without limiting the obligation of the Credit Parties to do so), ratably according to their respective Total Credit Exposure in effect on the date on which indemnification is sought under this Section 11.07 (or, if indemnification is sought after the date upon which the Commitments shall have terminated and the Loans shall have been paid in full, ratably in accordance with such Total Credit Exposure immediately prior to such date), from and against any and all liabilities, obligations, losses, damages, penalties, actions, judgments, suits, costs, expenses or disbursements of any kind whatsoever that may at any time (whether before or after the payment of the Loans) be imposed on, incurred by or asserted against such Agent in any way relating to or arising out of, the Commitments, this Agreement, any of the other Credit Documents, or any documents contemplated by or referred to herein or therein or the transactions contemplated hereby or thereby or any action taken or omitted by such Agent under or in connection with any of the foregoing; provided that no Lender shall be liable for the payment of any portion of such liabilities, obligations, losses, damages, penalties, actions, judgments, suits, costs, expenses or disbursements that are found by a final and non-appealable decision of a court of competent jurisdiction to have resulted from such Agent s gross negligence, bad faith or willful misconduct. The agreements in this Section 11.07 shall survive the payment of the Loans and all other amounts payable hereunder. 
 
 SECTION 11.08	 Agent in Its Individual Capacity . Each Agent and its Affiliates may make loans to, accept deposits from and generally engage in any kind of business with any Credit Party as though such Agent were not an Agent. With respect to its Loans made or renewed by it, each Agent shall have the same rights and powers under this Agreement and the other Credit Documents as any Lender and may exercise the same as though it were not an Agent, and the terms Lender , Lenders , Secured Party and Secured Parties shall include each Agent in its individual capacity. 
 
 SECTION 11.09	 Successor Agents . Either Agent may resign as Agent upon 20 days notice to the Lenders, such other Agent and Borrowers. If either Agent shall resign as such Agent in its applicable capacity under this Agreement and the other Credit Documents, then Required Lenders shall appoint a successor agent, which successor agent shall, unless an Event of Default shall have occurred and be continuing, be subject to approval by Parent (which approval shall not be unreasonably withheld, delayed or conditioned), whereupon such successor agent shall succeed to the rights, powers and duties of such Agent in its applicable capacity, and the term Administrative Agent or Collateral Agent , as the case may be, shall mean such successor agent effective upon such appointment and approval, and the former Agent s rights, powers and duties as Agent in its applicable capacity shall be terminated, without any other or further act or deed on the part of such former Agent or any of the parties to this Agreement or any holders of the Loans. If no applicable successor agent has accepted appointment as such Agent in its applicable capacity by the date that is 20 days following such retiring Agent s notice of resignation, such retiring Agent s resignation shall nevertheless thereupon become effective and the Lenders shall assume and perform all of the duties of such Agent hereunder until such time, if any, as Required Lenders appoint a successor agent as provided for above.

Each of the Lenders further agrees that it shall not, unless specifically requested to do so in writing by Collateral Agent, take or cause to be taken any action, including, the commencement of any legal or equitable proceedings to enforce any Credit Document against any Credit Party or to foreclose any Lien on, or otherwise enforce any security interest in, any of the Collateral.

 (ii) Ongoing Compliance . This Agreement and the other Loan Documents are subject to strict requirements for ongoing regulatory compliance by the parties hereto, including, without limitation, requirements that the parties take no action in violation of either any State Cannabis Laws or the guidance or instruction of any applicable state regulatory body (together with any successor or regulator with overlapping jurisdiction, the Regulator ). The parties acknowledge and understand that Federal Cannabis Laws, State Cannabis Laws and/or the requirements of the Regulator are subject to change and are evolving as the marketplace for state-compliant cannabis businesses continues to evolve. If necessary or desirable to comply with the requirements of Federal Cannabis Laws permitting or authorizing the Cannabis Business, State Cannabis Laws and/or the Regulator that do not constitute a Change in Cannabis Law, upon notice from one party to the other (the Compliance Notice ), the parties hereby agree to (and to cause their respective affiliates and related parties and representatives to) use their respective commercially reasonable efforts to take all actions reasonably requested to ensure compliance with such Legal Requirements and/or the Regulator, including, without limitation, negotiating in good faith to amend, restate, amend and restate, supplement, or otherwise modify this Agreement and the other Loan Documents to reflect terms that most closely approximate the parties original intentions.

(c) No Right of Rescission . No party hereto shall have any right of rescission or amendment arising out of or relating to any non-compliance with Federal Cannabis Laws existing on the Effective Date, and no party shall seek to enforce the provisions hereof in federal court unless and until the parties have reasonably determined that State Cannabis Laws are fully compliant with Federal Cannabis Laws.

(iii) Each Loan Party hereby unconditionally and irrevocably waives to the extent permitted under applicable law, all rights of a property owner under Section 1265.225(a) of the California Code of Civil Procedure or any successor statute providing for the allocation of condemnation proceeds between a property owner and a lien holder,

 (b) CCP Section 726.5 . In the event that any portion of the Property is determined to be environmentally impaired (as environmentally impaired is defined in California Code of Civil Procedure Section 726.5(e)(3)) or to be an affected parcel (as affected parcel is defined in California Code of Civil Procedure Section 726.5(e)(1)), then, without otherwise limiting or in any way affecting Lender s rights and remedies under this Agreement or any trustee s rights and remedies under the applicable Security Instrument, Lender may elect to exercise its right under California Code of Civil Procedure Section 726.5(a) to (1) waive its lien on such environmentally impaired or affected portion of the Property and (2) exercise (i) the rights and remedies of an unsecured creditor, including reduction of its claim against any Loan Party to judgment, and (ii) any other rights and remedies permitted by law. For purposes of determining Lender s right to proceed as an unsecured creditor under California Code of Civil Procedure Section 726.5(a), the owner of the Property shall be deemed to have willfully permitted or acquiesced in a release or threatened release of hazardous materials, within the meaning of California Code of Civil Procedure Section 726.5(d)(1), if the release or threatened release of hazardous materials was knowingly or negligently caused or contributed to by any lessee, authorized occupant or authorized user of any portion of the Property and the owner of the Property knew or should have known of the activity by such lessee, authorized occupant or authorized user which caused or contributed to the release or threatened release. All costs and expenses, including, but not limited to, attorneys fees, incurred by Lender in connection with any action commenced under this Section 12.28(b) , including any action required by California Code of Civil Procedure Section 726.5(b) to determine the degree to which the Property is environmentally impaired, plus interest thereon at the rate specified in the Note until paid, shall be added to the indebtedness secured by the Security Instrument(s) and shall be due and payable to Lender upon its demand made at any time following the conclusion of such action. 

(c) Additional Provision Regarding Application of Payments . Borrower agrees that, if Lender accepts a guaranty of only a portion of the obligations under the Loan Documents, Borrower waives its right under California Civil Code Section 2822(a), to designate the portion of the Obligation which will be satisfied by a guarantor s partial payment. 

(d) Waiver of Defenses . In accordance with CCP 2856, the Loan Parties waive all rights and defenses that any such party may have because the debtor s debt is secured by real property. This means, among other things: 

(1) The creditor may collect from the guarantor without first foreclosing on any real or personal property collateral pledged by the debtor. 

(2) If the creditor forecloses on any real property collateral pledged by the debtor: 

(A) The amount of the debt may be reduced only by the price for which that collateral is sold at the foreclosure sale, even if the collateral is worth more than the sale price. 

(B) The creditor may collect from the guarantor even if the creditor, by foreclosing on the real property collateral, has destroyed any right the guarantor may have to collect from the debtor.

(any of such events in subsections 1(e)(i)(A), 1(e)(i)(B) or 1(e)(i)(C) being called a Common Share Reorganization then, in each such event, the Exercise Price shall be adjusted as of the effective date or record date of such Common Share Reorganization, as the case may be, and shall, in the case of the events referred to in (A) or (C) above, be decreased in proportion to the increase in the number of outstanding Common Shares and/or Exchangeable Shares resulting from such subdivision, re-division, change or distribution, or shall, in the case of the events referred to in (B) above, be increased in proportion to the decrease in the number of outstanding Common Shares and/or Exchangeable Shares resulting from such reduction, combination or consolidation, in each case by multiplying the Exercise Price in effect immediately prior to such effective date or record date by a fraction, the numerator of which shall be the number of Common Shares outstanding on such effective date or record date before giving effect to such Common Share Reorganization and the denominator of which shall be the number of Common Shares outstanding as of the effective date or record date after giving effect to such Common Share Reorganization. Such 

4 
 
 adjustment shall be made successively whenever any event referred to in this subsection 1(e)(i) shall occur. Upon any adjustment of the Exercise Price pursuant to subsection 1(e)(i), the Exchange Rate (as defined below) shall be contemporaneously adjusted by multiplying the number of Common Shares theretofore obtainable on the exercise thereof by a fraction of which the numerator shall be the Exercise Price in effect immediately prior to such adjustment and the denominator shall be the Exercise Price resulting from such adjustment. Exchange Rate means the number of Common Shares subject to the right of purchase under each Warrant, which, as of the date hereof, is one (1) Common Share for one (1) Warrant. 
 
 (ii) If and whenever at any time during the Adjustment Period, the Corporation shall fix a record date for the issuance of rights, options or warrants to all or substantially all the holders of its outstanding Common Shares and/or Exchangeable Shares entitling them, for a period expiring not more than 45 days after such record date, to subscribe for or purchase Common Shares and/or Exchangeable Shares (or securities convertible or exchangeable into Common Shares and/or Exchangeable Shares) at a price per Common Share (or having a conversion or exchange price per Common Share) less than 95 of the Current Market Price (as defined below) on the date of announcement of such issuance (a Rights Offering ), the Exercise Price shall be adjusted immediately after such record date so that it shall equal the amount determined by multiplying the Exercise Price in effect on such record date by a fraction, of which the numerator shall be the total number of Common Shares and/or Exchangeable Shares outstanding on such record date plus a number of Common Shares and/or Exchangeable Shares equal to the number arrived at by dividing the aggregate price of the total number of additional Common Shares and/or Exchangeable Shares offered for subscription or purchase (or the aggregate conversion or exchange price of the convertible or exchangeable securities so offered) by the Current Market Price, and of which the denominator shall be the total number of Common Shares and/or Exchangeable Shares outstanding on such record date plus the total number of additional Common Shares and/or Exchangeable Shares offered for subscription or purchase or into which the convertible or exchangeable securities so offered are convertible or exchangeable. Any Common Shares and/or Exchangeable Shares owned by or held for the account of the Corporation shall be deemed not to be outstanding for the purpose of any such computation. Such adjustment shall be made successively whenever such a record date is fixed. To the extent that no such rights or warrants are exercised prior to the expiration thereof, the Exercise Price shall be readjusted to the Exercise Price which would then be in effect if such record date had not been fixed or, if any such rights or warrants are exercised, to the Exercise Price which would then be in effect based upon the number of Common Shares and/or Exchangeable Shares (or securities convertible or exchangeable into Common Shares) actually issued upon the exercise of such rights or warrants, as the case may be. Upon any adjustment of the Exercise Price pursuant to this subsection 1(e)(ii), the Exchange Rate 

5 
 
 will be adjusted immediately after such record date so that it will equal the rate determined by multiplying the Exchange Rate in effect on such record date by a fraction, of which the numerator shall be the Exercise Price in effect immediately prior to such adjustment and the denominator shall be the Exercise Price resulting from such adjustment. 
 
 (iii) If and whenever at any time during the Adjustment Period the Corporation shall fix a record date for the making of a distribution to all or substantially all the holders of its outstanding Common Shares and/or Exchangeable Shares of (i) securities of any class, whether of the Corporation or any other entity (other than Common Shares and/or Exchangeable Shares), (ii) rights, options or warrants to subscribe for or purchase Common Shares and/or Exchangeable Shares (or other securities convertible into or exchangeable for Common Shares and/or Exchangeable Shares), other than pursuant to a Rights Offering; (iii) evidences of its indebtedness or (iv) any cash, securities or other property or other assets (other than, if applicable, dividends paid in the ordinary course) and if such issue or distribution does not constitute a Common Share Reorganization, a Rights Offering or a distribution of Common Shares upon the exercise of Warrants or any outstanding options, then, in each such case, the Exercise Price shall be adjusted immediately after such record date so that it shall equal the price determined by multiplying the Exercise Price in effect on such record date by a fraction, of which the numerator shall be the total number of Common Shares and/or Exchangeable Shares outstanding on such record date multiplied by the Current Market Price on such record date, less the excess, if any, of the fair market value on such record date, as determined by the directors of the Corporation, acting reasonably (whose determination shall be conclusive, subject to stock exchange approval), of such cash, securities or other property or other assets so issued or distributed over the fair market value of any consideration received therefor by the Corporation from the holders of the Common Shares and/or Exchangeable Shares, and of which the denominator shall be the total number of Common Shares and/or Exchangeable Shares outstanding on such record date multiplied by the Current Market Price. Any Common Shares and/or Exchangeable Shares owned by or held for the account of the Corporation shall be deemed not to be outstanding for the purpose of any such computation. Such adjustment shall be made successively whenever such a record date is fixed. To the extent that such distribution is not so made, the Exercise Price shall be readjusted to the Exercise Price which would then be in effect if such record date had not been fixed. Upon any adjustment of the Exercise Price pursuant to this subsection 1(e)(iii), the Exchange Rate will be adjusted immediately after such record date so that it will equal the rate determined by multiplying the Exchange Rate in effect on such record date by a fraction, of which the numerator shall be the Exercise Price in effect immediately prior to such adjustment and the denominator shall be the Exercise Price resulting from such adjustment. 

6 
 
 (iv) If and whenever at any time during the Adjustment Period, there is a reclassification of the Common Shares and/or Exchangeable Shares or a capital reorganization of the Corporation other than as described in subsection 1(e)(i) or a consolidation, amalgamation, arrangement or merger of the Corporation with or into any other body corporate, trust, partnership or other entity, or a sale or conveyance of the property and assets of the Corporation as an entirety or substantially as an entirety to any other body corporate, trust, partnership or other entity, any Holder that has not exercised its Warrants prior to the effective date of such reclassification, capital reorganization, consolidation, amalgamation, arrangement or merger, sale or conveyance, upon the exercise of such Warrant thereafter, shall be entitled to receive upon payment of the Exercise Price and shall accept, in lieu of the number of Common Shares that prior to such effective date the Holder would have been entitled to receive the number of shares or other securities or property of the Corporation or of the body corporate, trust, partnership or other entity resulting from such merger, amalgamation or consolidation, or to which such sale or conveyance may be made, as the case may be, that such Holder would have been entitled to receive on such reclassification, capital reorganization, consolidation, amalgamation, arrangement or merger, sale or conveyance, if, on the effective date thereof, as the case may be, the Holder had been the registered holder of the number of Common Shares to which prior to such effective date it was entitled to acquire upon the exercise of the Warrants. If determined appropriate by the Corporation, relying on advice of legal counsel, to give effect to or to evidence the provisions of this subsection 1(e)(iv), the Corporation, its successor, or such purchasing body corporate, partnership, trust or other entity, as the case may be, shall, prior to or contemporaneously with any such reclassification, capital reorganization, consolidation, amalgamation, arrangement, merger, sale or conveyance, enter into an agreement or certificate which shall provide, to the extent possible, for the application of the provisions set forth in this Certificate with respect to the rights and interests thereafter of the Holder to the end that the provisions set forth in this Certificate shall thereafter correspondingly be made applicable, as nearly as may reasonably be, with respect to any shares, other securities or property to which the Holder is entitled on the exercise of its acquisition rights thereafter. Any agreement or certificate entered into between the Corporation, any successor to the Corporation or such purchasing body corporate, partnership, trust or other entity and the Holder shall provide for adjustments which shall be as nearly equivalent as may be practicable to the adjustments provided in this subsection 1(e) and which shall apply to successive reclassifications, capital reorganizations, amalgamations, consolidations, mergers, sales or conveyances arrangements. 

(v) If and whenever at any time during the Adjustment Period the Corporation or a subsidiary of the Corporation shall make an issuer bid or a tender or exchange offer (other than an odd lot offer or a normal course issuer bid) to all or substantially all of the holders of Common Shares and/or 

7 
 
 Exchangeable Shares for all or any portion of the Common Shares and/or Exchangeable Shares where the cash and the value of any other consideration included in such payment per Common Share and/or Exchangeable Shares exceeds the Current Market Price on the trading day immediately preceding the commencement of the issuer bid or tender or exchange offer (any such issuer bid or tender or exchange offer being called an Issuer Bid ), the Exercise Price shall be adjusted to a price determined by multiplying the applicable Exercise Price in effect on the date of the completion of such Issuer Bid by a fraction, the numerator of which shall be the product of (A) the number of Common Shares and/or Exchangeable Shares outstanding immediately prior to the completion of the Issuer Bid (without giving effect to any reduction in respect of any tendered or exchanged shares) and (B) the Current Market Price on the trading day immediately preceding the commencement of the Issuer Bid, and the denominator of which shall be the sum of (A) the fair market value (determined by the board of directors of the Corporation, acting reasonably and in good faith) of the aggregate consideration paid by the Corporation or subsidiary to holders of Common Shares and/or Exchangeable Shares upon the completion of such Issuer Bid, and (B) the product of (I) the difference between the number of Common Shares and/or Exchangeable Shares outstanding immediately prior to the completion of the Issuer Bid (without giving effect to any reduction in respect of tendered or exchanged shares) and the number of Common Shares and/or Exchangeable Shares actually purchased by the Corporation or subsidiary pursuant to the Issuer Bid, and 
 (II) the Current Market Price on the trading day immediately preceding the commencement of the Issuer Bid. 
 
 (vi) In any case in which this subsection 1(e) shall require that an adjustment shall become effective immediately after a record date for an event referred to herein, the Corporation may defer, until the occurrence of such event, issuing to the Holder of any Warrant exercised after the record date and prior to completion of such event the additional Common Shares issuable by reason of the adjustment required by such event before giving effect to such adjustment; provided, however, that the Corporation shall deliver to the Holder an appropriate instrument evidencing the Holder's right to receive such additional Common Shares upon the occurrence of the event requiring such adjustment and the right to receive any distributions made on such additional Common Shares and/or Exchangeable Shares declared in favour of holders of record of Common Shares and/or Exchangeable Shares on and after the relevant date of exercise or such later date as the Holder would, but for the provisions of this subsection 1(e)(vi), have become the holder of record of such additional Common Shares pursuant to this subsection 1(e). 

(vii) In any case in which subsection 1(e)(i)(C), subsection 1(e)(ii) or subsection 1(e)(iii) require that an adjustment be made to the Exercise Price, no such adjustment shall be made if the Holder of the outstanding Warrants receives, 

8 
 
 subject to any required stock exchange or regulatory approval, the rights or warrants referred to in subsection 1(e)(i)(C), subsection 1(e)(ii) or the shares, rights, options, warrants, evidences of indebtedness or assets referred to in subsection 1(e)(iii), as the case may be, in such kind and number as they would have received if they had been holders of Common Shares on the applicable record date or effective date, as the case may be, by virtue of their outstanding Warrants having then been exercised into Common Shares at the Exercise Price in effect on the applicable record date or effective date, as the case may be. 
 
 (viii) Each Common Share issued upon exercise of Warrants shall be entitled to receive, in addition to any Common Shares received in connection with such exercise, rights under the shareholder rights plan or equivalent plan, if any, and the certificates (if applicable) representing the Common Shares issued upon such exercise shall bear such legends, if any, in each case as may be provided by the terms of any shareholder rights plan or equivalent plan adopted by the Corporation, as the same may be amended from time to time, and the Exercise Price shall not be adjusted in connection therewith. If prior to any exercise of Warrants, however, such rights have separated from the Common Shares in accordance with the provisions of the applicable shareholder rights agreement, the Exercise Price shall be adjusted at the time of separation as if the Corporation distributed to all holders of Common Shares, rights options or warrants as described in subsection 1(e)(iii), subject to readjustment in the event of the expiration, termination or redemption of such rights. 

(ix) The adjustments provided for in this subsection 1(e) are cumulative, and shall, in the case of adjustments to the Exercise Price be computed to the nearest whole cent and shall apply to successive subdivisions, re-divisions, reductions, combinations, consolidations, distributions, issues or other events resulting in any adjustment under the provisions of this subsection 1(e), provided that, notwithstanding any other provision of this Section, no adjustment of the Exercise Price shall be required unless such adjustment would require an increase or decrease of at least 1 in the Exercise Price then in effect or the number of Common Shares issuable upon the exercise of a Warrant by at least one one-hundredth of a Common Share; provided, however, that any adjustments which by reason of this subsection 1(e)(ix) are not required to be made shall be carried forward and taken into account in any subsequent adjustment. 

(x) After any adjustment pursuant to this subsection 1(e), the term Common Shares , where used in this Certificate, shall be interpreted to mean securities of any class or classes which, as a result of such adjustment and all prior adjustments pursuant to this subsection 1(e), the Holder is entitled to receive upon the exercise of Warrants, and the number of Common Shares indicated by any exercise made pursuant to a Warrant shall be interpreted to mean the number of Common Shares or other property or 

9 
 
 securities the Holder is entitled to receive, as a result of such adjustment and all prior adjustments pursuant to this subsection 1(e), upon the full exercise of a Warrant. 
 
 (xi) All Common Shares or shares of any class or other securities, which the Holder is at the time in question entitled to receive on the exercise of its Warrant, whether or not as a result of adjustments made pursuant to this subsection 1(e), shall, for the purposes of the interpretation of this Certificate, be deemed to be Common Shares which such Holder is entitled to acquire pursuant to such Warrant. 

(xii) Notwithstanding anything in this subsection 1(e), no adjustment shall be made in the acquisition rights attached to the Warrants if the issue of Common Shares is being made pursuant to this Certificate or in connection with (a) any share incentive plan or restricted share unit plan or share purchase plan in force from time to time for directors, officers, employees, consultants or other service providers of the Corporation; or (b) the satisfaction of existing instruments issued as of the date hereof. 

(xiii) As a condition precedent to the taking of any action which would require an adjustment in any of the acquisition rights pursuant to any of the Warrants, including the number of Common Shares which are to be received upon the exercise thereof, the Corporation shall take any action which may, in the opinion of legal counsel, be necessary in order that the Corporation has unissued and reserved in its authorized capital and may validly and legally issue as fully paid and non-assessable all the Common Shares which the holders of such Warrants are entitled to receive on the full exercise thereof in accordance with the provisions hereof. 

(xiv) The Corporation shall from time to time promptly after the occurrence of any event which requires an adjustment or readjustment as provided in subsection 1(e), deliver a certificate of the Corporation to the Holder specifying the nature of the event requiring the same and the amount of the adjustment or readjustment necessitated thereby and setting forth in reasonable detail the method of calculation and the facts upon which such calculation is based. 

(xv) The Corporation covenants to and in favour of the Holder that so long as this Warrant remains outstanding, it will give notice to the Holder of the effective date or of its intention to fix a record date for any event referred to in this subsection 1(e) whether or not such action would give rise to an adjustment in the Exercise Price or the number and type of securities issuable upon the exercise of the Warrants, and, in each case, such notice shall specify the particulars of such event and the record date and the effective date for such event; provided that the Corporation shall only be required to specify in such notice such particulars of such event as have been fixed and determined on the date on which such notice is given. Such 

10 
 
 notice shall be given not less than 14 days in each case prior to such applicable record date or effective date. 
 
 (xvi) The Corporation covenants with the Holder that it will not close its transfer books or take any other corporate action which might deprive the Holder of the opportunity to exercise its right of acquisition hereunder during the period of 10 business days after the giving of the certificate set forth in subsection 1(e)(xiii). 

(xvii) If the Corporation, after the date hereof, shall take any action affecting the Common Shares other than action described in subsection 1(e), which in the reasonable opinion of the directors of the Corporation would materially affect the rights of the Holder, the Exercise Price and/or the Exchange Rate, the number of Common Shares which may be acquired upon exercise of the Warrants shall be adjusted in such manner and at such time, by action of the directors, acting reasonably and in good faith, in their sole discretion as they may determine to be equitable to the Holder in the circumstances, provided that no such adjustment will be made unless any requisite prior approval of any stock exchange on which the Common Shares are listed for trading has been obtained. No adjustments shall be made pursuant to this subsection 1(e) if the Holder is entitled to participate in any event described in this subsection 1(e) on the same terms, mutatis mutandis, as if the Holder had exercised their Warrants prior to, or on the effective date or record date (as applicable) of, such event. 

(xviii) If at any time a question or dispute arises with respect to adjustments provided for in this subsection 1(e), such question or dispute will be conclusively determined by the auditor of the Corporation or, if they are unable or unwilling to act, by such other firm of independent chartered accountants as may be selected by action of the directors of the Corporation and any such determination, subject to regulatory approval and absent manifest error, will be binding upon the Corporation and the Holder. The Corporation will provide such auditor or chartered accountant with access to all necessary records of the Corporation. 

(f) Shares to be Reserved . The Corporation will at all times keep available and reserve out of its authorized Common Shares, solely for the purpose of issuing upon the exercise of the Warrants, such number of Common Shares as shall then be issuable upon the exercise of the Warrants. The Corporation covenants and agrees that all such Common Shares which shall be so issuable will, upon issuance and receipt of the Exercise Price therefore, be duly authorized and issued as fully paid and non-assessable. The Corporation will take all such actions as may be necessary to ensure that all such Common Shares may be so issued without violation of any applicable requirements of any exchange upon which the Common Shares may be listed or in respect of which the Common Shares are qualified for unlisted trading privileges. The Corporation will take all such actions 

11 
 
 as are within its power to ensure that all such Common Shares may be so issued without violation of any applicable law. 
 
 (g) Issue Tax . Upon the exercise of Warrants, the issuance of certificates, if any, for the Common Shares and the issuance of Certificates for any unexercised Warrants shall be made without charge to the Holder, including for any issuance tax in respect thereto, provided that the Corporation shall not be required to pay any tax which may be payable in respect of any transfer involved in the issuance and delivery of any such certificate(s) in a name other than that of the Holder. 

(h) Listing . The Corporation will, at its expense and as expeditiously as possible, use its reasonable commercial efforts to cause all Common Shares issuable upon the exercise of the Warrants to be duly listed on the Canadian Securities Exchange and/or any other stock exchange upon which the Common Shares may be then listed prior to the issuance of such Common Shares. 

(i) Current Market Price . For the purposes of any computation hereunder, the Current Market Price at any date shall be the volume-weighted average price VWAP per Common Share for the 20 consecutive trading days ending five 

(5) trading days prior to the relevant date on the most senior stock exchange in Canada on which the Common Shares may then be listed and on which there is the greatest volume of trading of the Common Shares for such 20 day period, or, if the Common Shares or any other security in respect of which a determination of Current Market Price is being made are not listed on any stock exchange, which includes the Canadian Securities Exchange, the Current Market Price shall be determined in good faith by the directors of the Corporation, which determination shall be conclusive, absent fraud or manifest error. The VWAP shall be determined by dividing the aggregate sale price of all such Common Shares sold on the said exchange during the said 20 consecutive trading days by the total number of such Common Shares so sold. 
 
 2. Transfer of Warrants. Subject to applicable securities laws, the Warrants represented by this Certificate are transferable by the Holder to any person, upon delivery of this Certificate and a duly executed transfer form in substantially the form attached hereto as Schedule 2 (the Transfer Form or such other instrument of transfer in such form as the Corporation may from time to time prescribe and delivered to the Corporation. The Warrants may be offered, sold, pledged or otherwise transferred only: (A) to the Corporation, (B) pursuant to an effective registration statement under the U.S. Securities Act, (C) in accordance with Rule 144A under the U.S. Securities Act, if available, and in compliance with applicable state securities laws, (D) outside the United States in accordance with the provisions of Rule 904 of Regulation S under the U.S. Securities Act, if available, or (E) in a transaction that does not otherwise require registration under the 

U.S. Securities Act or any applicable state securities laws. No transfer of the Warrants represented by this Certificate shall be made if in the opinion of counsel to the Corporation such transfer would result in the violation of any applicable securities laws. Subject to the foregoing, the Corporation shall issue and mail as soon as practicable, and in any event within five business days of such delivery, a new Certificate registered in the name of the 

12 
 
 transferee or as the transferee may direct and shall take all other necessary actions to effect the transfer as directed. Upon the transfer of any Warrant in accordance with the terms hereof, the Corporation shall enter the name of the transferee in the register as the registered holder of such transferred Warrants.
