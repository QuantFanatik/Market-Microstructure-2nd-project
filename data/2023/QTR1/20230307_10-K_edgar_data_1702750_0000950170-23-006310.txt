unforeseen credit quality problems or changing economic conditions that could result in charge-offs greater than we have anticipated in our allowance for credit losses - loans and leases or changes in the value of our investments; 

commercial real estate market conditions in the Chicago metropolitan area and southern Wisconsin; 

deterioration in the financial condition of our borrowers resulting in significant increases in our loan and lease losses and provisions for those losses and other related adverse impacts to our results of operations and financial condition; 

estimates of fair value of certain of our assets and liabilities, which could change in value significantly from period to period; 

competitive pressures in the financial services industry in our market areas relating to both pricing and loan and lease structures, which may impact our growth rate;

availability of sufficient and cost-effective sources of liquidity, funding, and capital as and when needed; 

our ability to attract, retain or the loss of key personnel or an inability to recruit appropriate talent cost-effectively; 

adverse effects on our information technology systems resulting from failures, human error or cyberattack, including the potential impact of disruptions or security breaches at our third-party service providers, any of which could result in an information or security breach, the disclosure or misuse of confidential or proprietary information, significant legal and financial losses and reputational harm; 

greater-than-anticipated costs to support the growth of our business, including investments in new lines of business, products and services, or technology, process improvements or other infrastructure enhancements, or greater-than-anticipated compliance or regulatory costs and burdens; 

the impact of possible future acquisitions, if any, including the costs and burdens of integration efforts; 

the ability of the Company to receive dividends from Byline Bank; 

legislative or regulatory changes, particularly changes in regulation of financial services companies and/or the products and services offered by financial services companies; 

2 

changes in Small Business Administration SBA and U.S. Department of Agriculture USDA U.S. government guaranteed lending rules, regulations, loan and lease products and funding limits, including specifically the SBA Section 7(a) program, as well as changes in SBA or USDA standard operating procedures or changes to the status of Byline Bank as an SBA Preferred Lender; 

changes in accounting principles, policies and guidelines applicable to bank holding companies and banking generally; 

the impact of a possible change in the federal or state income tax rates on our deferred tax assets and provision for income tax expense; 

our ability to implement our growth strategy, including via acquisitions; 

the possibility that any of the anticipated benefits of acquisitions will not be realized or will not be realized within the expected time period;

PART I 
 Item 1. Business . 
 General 
 Byline Bancorp, Inc., headquartered in Chicago, Illinois, is a bank holding company and we conduct all our business activities through our subsidiary, Byline Bank, a full service commercial bank, and Byline Bank s subsidiaries. The words the Company, we, Byline, our and us refer to Byline Bancorp, Inc. and its consolidated subsidiaries, unless we indicate otherwise. 
 We offer a broad range of banking products and services to small and medium sized businesses, commercial real estate and financial sponsors and to consumers who generally live or work near our branches. We offer online account opening to consumer and business customers through our website. We also provide trust and wealth management services to our customers. In addition to our traditional commercial banking business, we provide small ticket equipment leasing solutions through Byline Financial Group, a wholly-owned subsidiary of Byline Bank, headquartered in Bannockburn, Illinois with sales offices in Illinois, and sales representatives in Illinois, Michigan, New Jersey, and New York. We participate in U.S. government guaranteed lending programs and originate U.S. government guaranteed loans. Byline Bank was the fifth most active originator of SBA loans in the country and the most active SBA lender in Illinois, and Wisconsin, as reported by the SBA for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2022. As of December 31, 2022, we had consolidated total assets of 7.4 billion, total gross loans and leases outstanding of 5.5 billion, total deposits of 5.7 billion, and total stockholders equity of 765.8 million. 
 Strategic growth 
 As part of our strategic growth plan, we explore potential opportunities for expansion in our primary and adjacent market areas through organic growth and the acquisition of financial institutions, branches, and non-banking organizations. 
 Organic Growth 
 We believe our local presence and our scale are essential to the continued growth of our deposit base. Small businesses are a significant source of low-cost deposits and represent opportunities for future growth. We believe our small business customers value our ability to provide convenience and access to local, responsive decision makers. As of December 31, 2022, commercial deposits accounted for 48.5 of total deposits and were 77.5 of non-interest bearing deposits. Commercial accounts generally have higher deposit balances and transaction volumes than individual deposit accounts. 
 Our ability to originate loans and leases across a range of industries and product types helps us maintain a diversified loan and lease portfolio across various sectors, including commercial and industrial lending, leasing, U.S. government guaranteed loans and real estate loans, allowing us to efficiently manage our credit exposures and capitalize on more lending opportunities. We have also enhanced our product and lending capabilities with the addition of experienced lending teams hired from larger banks. 
 The following charts outline the composition of our loan and lease and deposit portfolios as of December 31, 2022:

Acquisitions 
 Our ability to engage in certain merger or acquisition transactions depends on a number of factors, including opportunities in our market areas, access to capital, our bank regulators' views at the time as to the capital levels, quality of management and our overall financial condition, in addition to their assessment of a variety of other factors, including our compliance with laws and regulations. We have successfully completed a number of strategic acquisitions since our recapitalization in 2013, which include:

On November 30, 2022 we announced the execution of an Agreement and Plan of Merger in connection with a proposed acquisition of Inland Bancorp, Inc., a Maryland corporation Inland Bancorp ), and Inland Bancorp's wholly owned bank subsidiary, Inland Bank and Trust, an Illinois chartered bank. As of December 31, 2022, Inland Bancorp had 1.2 billion in total assets, 888.7 million of loans, 5.0 million of loans held for sale, and 997.1 million of total deposits. Completion of the transaction is subject to regulatory approvals, the approval of Inland Bancorp's stockholders, and the satisfaction of certain other closing conditions. We expect the acquisition to close in the first half of 2023. 
 Branch network and distribution channels 
 The primary market in which we operate is the Chicago metropolitan area, and our 37 branch network in this area is our core distribution channel. We take advantage of our focused footprint and deep-rooted relationships to target local customers with a diversified product offering. 
 Our local branch network enables us to gather low cost deposits, promote the Byline brand and customer loyalty, originate loans, leases and other products and maintain relationships with our customers through regular community involvement. We believe our branch network is fundamental to our ability to achieve successful customer outreach in line with our culture, which promotes high touch engagement with our customers and proactive solutions. 
 While our branch network continues to be our primary delivery channel, we understand the evolving banking environment requires digital interaction to keep pace with our customers needs. We continually perform strategic reviews of our branch network and our existing banking footprint. With technology improvements and changes to customers banking preferences, we examine branch growth and consolidation potential, customer usage, branch profitability, services provided, markets served and proximity to other locations with a goal of minimizing customer impact and deposit runoff. 
 Since our recapitalization in June 2013, our branch network has been reduced from 88 to 38, including 13 branches added through acquisition. During 2022 we consolidated six branches within our network with minimal impact on our customer service levels, convenience, and business development capabilities. 
 We plan to continue to leverage our seasoned management team, the attractive market opportunity in the Chicago metropolitan area, our diversified lending approach and our track record of successfully integrating acquisitions to drive future growth. We believe that having a deep understanding of customers, longstanding ties to the communities in which we operate, a strong market position, and exceptional employees allow us to provide the attention, responsiveness, and customized service our customers seek while offering a diverse range of products to serve a variety of needs. 
 Segments 
 We have one reportable segment. Our chief operating decision makers evaluate our business and operations using consolidated information for purposes of allocating resources and assessing performance. 
 Our Products and Services 
 We are a full service, commercial bank offering a broad range of deposit products and lending services to small and medium sized businesses, commercial real estate and financial sponsors, and consumers around our 37 branch locations in the Chicago metropolitan area and one branch in Brookfield, Wisconsin. The products and services we offer are described below. 
 Commercial banking 
 Commercial banking is a fundamental component of our business. We define commercial banking as lending to small and medium sized businesses, real estate and financial sponsors. We offer a comprehensive range of commercial loan, deposit and treasury management products. Our primary commercial lending groups are described below: 
 Commercial Industrial . Our commercial and industrial C I group focuses on small and lower middle market businesses with up to 100 million of annual revenue and seeks to establish long term relationships. We believe this customer segment is underserved by larger institutions that do not focus on this space, as well as by smaller institutions that lack product sophistication and capabilities. We offer a broad range of lending products including term loans, revolving lines of credit and treasury management products and services. As of December 31, 2022, the C I group managed a portfolio of 2.2 billion in loans outstanding. 
 5 

Commercial real estate . Our commercial real estate CRE business focuses on experienced real estate professionals with long track records of performance and access to ample equity capital sources. We believe our specialized expertise and efficient decision making process differentiate us from our competitors. We offer fixed and floating rate term loans, construction financing and revolving lines of credit with a wide range of term options. Our portfolio is broadly diversified by geography and property type including loans secured by multifamily, industrial, retail, and office properties. As of December 31, 2022, the CRE group had 962.7 million in loans outstanding. 
 Sponsor finance . Our sponsor finance group provides senior secured financing solutions to private equity backed lower middle market companies throughout the U.S. with earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortization generally between 2.0 million and 10.0 million. We support the acquisition, recapitalization and growth investment efforts of private equity firms operating in the lower middle market, and we believe our expertise in this niche is unique for a bank our size. As of December 31, 2022, we had 556.6 million in sponsor finance loans outstanding. 
 Syndications . From time to time, our syndications group seeks to deploy excess liquidity by opportunistically participating in syndicated loans, acquiring whole loans, or purchasing participations from lead banks that have existing relationships with well capitalized and experienced sponsors. We employed this strategy extensively following our recapitalization by leveraging our relationships with local, regional and national lenders as we developed our own lending capabilities and had excess liquidity. Now, with developed lending capabilities, our participation in syndications has decreased and represents a smaller portion of our portfolio. The syndications group targets transactions in the home mortgage, CRE, and C I categories that provide attractive risk/reward characteristics, and we continue to maintain the ability to sell loan positions to manage credit and specific customer and industry concentrations. As of December 31, 2022, the group had 329.2 million in loan syndications outstanding. 
 Commercial deposits and treasury management . We also support our business customers with a variety of deposit and treasury management products, along with business transaction accounts. Our comprehensive suite of products includes treasury services, information reporting, fraud management, cash collection, and interest rate derivative products. We believe these tailored products allow us to provide a robust service offering to our customers and to support their day to day funding and risk management needs. These services are provided through multiple points of contact including branch, online, and mobile interfaces. 
 Small Business Capital. Our U.S. government guaranteed lending business serves small businesses in need of, and qualifying for, SBA and USDA loans (referred to together as U.S. government guaranteed loans ). We provide SBA lending services throughout the country, with a primary focus on the Midwest, Tennessee, Florida, Texas, Colorado, Utah, and California. We generally sell the government guaranteed portion of SBA and USDA loans into the secondary market while retaining the non-guaranteed portion of the loan and the servicing rights. This allows us to realize one time gain on sale income along with a recurring servicing and interest revenue stream. In addition to the business development officers who we rely on to generate new business, we also have a dedicated servicing, portfolio management and workout staff with specialized expertise in U.S. government guaranteed loans. As of December 31, 2022, total loans and leases included the guaranteed amount of U.S. government guaranteed loans of 123.2 million. The total unpaid principal balances of SBA and USDA loans serviced for others was 1.7 billion at December 31, 2022. 
 Retail deposits 
 We offer customers traditional retail deposit products through our branch network, consumer and business online account opening through our website, and customer access to their accounts through online and mobile banking platforms. The wide variety of deposit products we offer include non-interest-bearing accounts, money market demand accounts, savings accounts, interest-bearing checking accounts and time deposits with maturities ranging from seven days to five years. We consider our core deposits, defined as all deposits except time deposits exceeding 100,000, to be our primary and most valuable funding source. As of December 31, 2022, core deposits represented 92.7 of our total deposits. In addition to these products, we offer ATM and debit cards as well as online, mobile, and text banking. We strive to retain an attractive deposit mix from both large and small customers as well as a broad market reach, which has resulted in our top 50 customers accounting for approximately 12 of all deposits as of December 31, 2022. Our bankers are incentivized to acquire and maintain quality core deposits as we depend on these deposits to fund the majority of our loans and leases. We believe that our long standing and high quality relationships with our depositors who provide us with long term funding are due to the convenience and dedicated service we offer. We leverage our expansive branch locations and deep network of customer relationships in the Chicago metropolitan area to provide both low cost funding sources for our lending business and deposit related fee income. We had 5.7 billion of deposits at December 31, 2022, and our average cost of deposits was 0.36 for the year ended December 31, 2022. 
 Small ticket equipment leasing 
 Through our Bank s subsidiary, Byline Financial Group BFG ), we provide financing solutions for equipment vendors and their end users. The vertical markets served by our equipment vendors specialize primarily in healthcare, manufacturing, technology, materials handlings, small equipment construction, specialty vehicles and energy efficiency. The end users (i.e., our lessees and borrowers) are primarily physician group practices, other healthcare related entities, manufacturers, retailers, veterinarians, and wholesalers. The average lease size at origination for BFG for the year ended December 31, 2022 was approximately 72,000. Our sales team originates leases throughout the country, and we have lessees in nearly every state. As of December 31, 2022, BFG had 524.0 million in leases outstanding with a weighted average life of approximately 3.5 years. 
 6 

Trust and wealth management 
 We provide investment, trust and wealth management services to our customers, such as foundations and endowments and high net worth individuals, which include fiduciary and executor services, financial planning solutions, investment advisory services, and private banking services. These services are provided through credentialed investment, legal, tax, and wealth management professionals who identify opportunities and provide services tailored to our customers goals and objectives. Assets under administration were 548.7 million as of December 31, 2022. 
 Competition 
 The financial services industry is highly competitive as we compete for loans, leases, deposits and customer relationships within and outside of our markets. Competition involves efforts to retain current customers, make new loans and leases, obtain new deposits, increase the scope and sophistication of services offered, the availability, ease of use, and range of banking services provided on the internet and through mobile devices, and offer competitive interest rates paid on deposits and charged on loans and leases. We face competition not only from other financial holding companies and commercial banks, but also from internet banks, savings and loan associations, FinTech companies, credit unions, trust and wealth management providers, and other providers of financial services and products. Competition is generally based on the variety, rates and terms of products and services offered to customers and the performance of funds under management. 
 Human Capital 
 At Byline, we are a bank that believes in putting our name behind everything we do and we re here to roll up our sleeves and help our customers write their stories. Our #1 core value, reflected in our Things That Matter, is our People, all of whom are encouraged to live out a shared purpose of making people s lives better, helping businesses thrive, and strengthening the communities we serve . We believe purpose driven leadership facilitates progress in achieving a diverse and inclusive workforce and in driving performance. We are dedicated to attracting, retaining, and developing top talent to accomplish our long-term strategy which is critical to our success. 
 Governance and Oversight 
 Our Board of Directors and executive management team are committed to executing on our long-term vision. Our Board members are accomplished leaders from diverse backgrounds, bringing the perspectives, skills, and experience necessary to use independent judgment that will effectively challenge and drive continued success. Our Board members oversee our corporate strategy and sets the tone for our culture, values and high ethical standards, and , through its Committees, holds management accountable for results. 
 Beginning in 2020, the Board expanded the scope of our Compensation Committee beyond its traditional compensation focused role to include oversight of Byline s human capital management efforts. The Compensation Committee reviews and monitors matters related to human capital management, including Company culture, talent development, diversity, equity and inclusion DEI programs and initiatives and other environmental, social, and governance ESG matters. 
 Diversity, Equity and Inclusion 
 To facilitate talent attraction, development and retention across our franchise, we strive to make Byline a diverse, inclusive, safe and healthy workplace, with opportunities for our employees to grow and develop in their careers, supported by strong compensation, benefits, health and welfare programs. Our key programs and initiatives that are focused to attract, develop and retain our diverse workforce include: 
 The DEI Council , made up of three senior executives and 16 employees with representation across all business units, is the foundation and catalyst for honoring our employees, engaging our customers and community, creating a great place to work, and ultimately driving business success led by our executive team. 

We pledge to create an environment where every employee can bring their authentic self to work and knows that their background, ethnicity, experiences, perspective, and contributions serve to strengthen us, and where growth opportunities exist at all levels. 

For our customers and community, we seek to demonstrate through our actions our commitment to being better together through community development loans and investments, community service, grants, donations, and sponsorships. 

We seek to leverage our current diverse workforce and prominent community outreach efforts to further define and enhance our DEI focus in four key areas: 

o Workforce Promoting representation at all levels and in all areas and business lines of the Bank, with attention on recruiting and developing diverse talent and focusing on engagement and employee recognition. 

o Workplace Creating a culture where everyone brings their authentic self to work and knows that their unique background, ethnicity, experiences, perspective, and contribution serve to strengthen the Bank. 

7 

o Community Building meaningful, supportive relationships in the communities we work. 

o Marketplace Provide greater accessibility to banking products, services, and financial education to minority owned small businesses, including in low and moderate income areas.

We offer a compensation package which includes base pay, short-term incentives (annual cash bonuses, commissions plans, and referral incentives) and long-term incentives (equity-based compensation) for applicable roles. Our approach to compensation is driven by internal and external equity which seeks to ensure our compensation elements are competitive and market driven. Our compensation programs are structured to: (1) deliver competitive compensation under a disciplined and objective structure; (2) establish target pay at market competitive levels; and (3) provide short-term incentive opportunities to employees who impact department and business results. Over the past year we have taken several steps to seek to ensure market competitiveness, including raising the starting wage of all employees to at least 18/hour, providing higher than average salary adjustments and including additional personnel in our incentive programs. In addition, we have implemented a job architecture and paygrade structure that has been communicated to all employees.

Development Opportunities 
 We recognize the critical importance of providing career development and advancement opportunities for all employees. Accordingly, we provide a variety of formal and informal development opportunities to help employees grow in their current roles and build new skills. During 2022, we continued our focus on development by holding all managers accountable for setting goals, having frequent career development conversations, providing regular coaching and feedback, and recognizing accomplishments of all employees. We introduced resources that allow managers to conduct career conversations based on the desires of the employees and create development opportunities to take on new roles and assignments across the bank. We continued our investment in both leader and manager development in 2022 with a new management program and will continue to invest in these programs in 2023 and beyond. 
 The 2022 performance management process included the addition of four behavioral competencies expected of all Byline employees that are aligned with our values and our strategic plan: Valuing Differences, Collaborating for Results, Delivering Customer Focused Solutions, and Continuous Improvement. Each employee received feedback and education on these competencies throughout our performance management process and we will create greater accountability in 2023 and beyond.

We strive to optimally deploy existing talent across Byline by focusing on where our employees excel and helping them find their best roles. We believe one example of our success in this effort is our ability to fill vacancies from within. During 2022, 20 of our job postings were filled internally. 
 We encourage our team members to pursue educational opportunities that will help improve job performance and professional development. Our tuition reimbursement and student loan repayment programs have helped to further this goal for many of our employees. We also support employees in obtaining certifications and taking approved educational courses to support their job and expand their skills. 
 Talent development is also a key part of our succession planning for executive management. Our Board of Directors oversees the succession planning for executive management on an annual basis. Key development needs are identified through formalized assessments for leadership, business, and executive role-based skills, and collaborative talent review and feedback sessions. 
 Employee Recognition and Engagement 
 We conduct an annual employee engagement survey with over 90 participation and continue to see strong improvements in employee engagement year-over-year. 

We focus on communication with employees and managers through monthly manager forums, quarterly all employee calls, and business unit town hall meetings. These meetings focus on delivering information on business metrics, but also key information for operating, recognition and engagement. 

We focus on work-life balance and flexibility with over 60 of our non-Retail branch employees on a hybrid work schedule and over 36 working fully remote. 

We provide everyday recognition that celebrates employees living our core values, or Things That Matter . 

Our annual CEO Circle Awards highlight our employees who have demonstrated extraordinary performance during the year and exemplify our values. 

Community and Social Impact 
 We are committed to helping the local communities in which we live and work, grow and thrive, today and into the future. One way we seek to do this is by providing employees paid time off to participate in community-based volunteer programs. Throughout the year, employees make a positive impact in their local communities and have found a multitude of special ways to volunteer and give back. During 2022, Byline made and/or supported: 
 Community development investments totaling 60.4 million. 

45 community development grants 

Over 70 million in community development loans 

1,700 CRA volunteer hours 

157 financial literacy sessions 

Over 680,000 in grants, donations and sponsorships 

Top SBA lender for Illinois and Wisconsin for the 9 th consecutive year 

Human Capital Metrics 
 As of December 31, 2022, we had 977 employees (948 full time, and 29 part time) in locations primarily across the Chicagoland and greater Milwaukee, Wisconsin areas. Our employees are not represented by a collective bargaining agreement. We consider our relationship with our employees to be good. The average tenure of our employees is seven years. During 2022, our employee voluntary attrition rate was 15 , which, although lower year-over-year, remains higher than the abnormally low attrition prior to and during the pandemic in 2019 and 2020. During 2022, we hired 202 new employees into the Bank with 46 being hired into our customer-facing retail branches, and 54 into other key areas across the Bank. We believe we have a strong bench of talent and are attracting experienced bankers from larger regional banks as a result of continued market disruption.

 Supervision and Regulation 
 We and our subsidiaries are subject to extensive regulation under federal and state banking laws that establish a comprehensive framework for our operations. This framework may materially affect our growth potential and financial performance and is intended primarily for the protection of depositors, customers, federal deposit insurance funds and the banking system as a whole, not for the protection of our stockholders and creditors. Significant elements of the statutes, regulations and policies applicable to us and our subsidiaries are described below. 
 Regulatory Agencies 
 We are a bank holding company under the Bank Holding Company BHC Act. Consequently, we and our subsidiaries are subject to supervision, regulation and examination by the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (the FRB ). The BHC Act provides generally for umbrella regulation of bank holding companies and functional regulation of holding company subsidiaries by applicable regulatory agencies. Byline Bank, our bank subsidiary, is a Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation FDIC insured commercial bank chartered under the laws of Illinois. Our bank is not a member of the FRB. Consequently, the FDIC and the Illinois Department of Financial and Professional Regulation IDFPR are the primary regulators of our bank and also regulate our bank s subsidiaries. As the owner of an Illinois-chartered bank, we are also subject to supervision and examination by the IDFPR. We are also subject to the disclosure and regulatory requirements of the Securities Act and the Exchange Act as administered by the SEC, and the rules adopted by the New York Stock Exchange (the NYSE applicable to NYSE listed companies. 
 10 

Permissible Activities for Bank Holding Companies 
 In general, the BHC Act limits the business of bank holding companies to banking, managing or controlling banks and other activities that the FRB has determined to be so closely related to banking as to be a proper incident thereto, which include certain activities relating to extending credit or acting as an investment or financial advisor. We currently do not conduct any non-banking activities through any non-bank subsidiaries. 
 Bank holding companies that qualify and elect to be treated as financial holding companies may engage in a broader range of additional activities than bank holding companies that are not financial holding companies. In particular, financial holding companies may engage in activities that are (i) financial in nature or incidental to such financial activities or (ii) complementary to a financial activity and do not pose a substantial risk to the safety and soundness of depository institutions or the financial system generally. These activities include securities underwriting and dealing, insurance underwriting and making merchant banking investments. We have not elected to be treated as a financial holding company and currently have no plans to make a financial holding company election. 
 The FRB has the power to order any bank holding company or any of its subsidiaries to terminate any activity or to terminate its ownership or control of any subsidiary when the FRB has reasonable grounds to believe that continuing such activity, ownership or control constitutes a serious risk to the financial soundness, safety or stability of any bank subsidiary of the bank holding company. 
 Permissible Activities for Banks 
 As an Illinois-chartered commercial bank, our bank s business is subject to extensive supervision and regulation by state and federal bank regulatory agencies. Our business is generally limited to activities permitted by Illinois law and any applicable federal laws. Under the Illinois Banking Act, our bank may generally engage in all usual banking activities, including, among other things, accepting deposits; lending money on personal and real estate security; issuing letters of credit; buying, discounting, and negotiating promissory notes and other forms of indebtedness; buying and selling foreign currency and, subject to certain limitations, certain investment securities; engaging in certain insurance activities and maintaining safe deposit boxes on premises. 
 Illinois law also imposes restrictions on Byline Bank s activities intended to ensure the safety and soundness of our bank. For example, Byline Bank is restricted under the Illinois Banking Act from investing in certain types of investment securities and is generally limited in the amount of money it can lend to a single borrower or invest in securities issued by a single issuer. 
 Acquisitions by Bank Holding Companies 
 The BHC Act, Section 18(c) of the Federal Deposit Insurance Act, popularly known as the Bank Merger Act , the Illinois Banking Act, the Illinois Bank Holding Company Act and other federal and state statutes regulate acquisitions of commercial banks and other FDIC-insured depository institutions. We must obtain the prior approval of the FRB under the BHC Act before (i) acquiring more than 5 of the voting stock of any FDIC-insured depository institution or other bank holding company (other than directly through our bank), (ii) acquiring all or substantially all of the assets of any bank or bank holding company or (iii) merging or consolidating with any other bank holding company. Under the Bank Merger Act, the prior approval of the FDIC is required for our bank to merge with another bank or purchase all or substantially all of the assets or assume any of the deposits of another FDIC- insured depository institution or to assume certain liabilities of non-banks. In reviewing applications seeking approval of merger and acquisition transactions, banking regulators consider, among other things, the competitive effect and public benefits of the transactions, the capital position and managerial resources of the combined organization, the risks to the stability of the U.S. banking or financial system, the applicant s performance record under the Community Reinvestment Act of 1977 CRA ), the applicant s compliance with fair housing and other consumer protection laws and the effectiveness of all organizations involved in combating money laundering activities. In addition, failure to implement or maintain adequate compliance programs could cause banking regulators not to approve an acquisition where regulatory approval is required or to prohibit an acquisition even if approval is not required. 
 Dividends 
 We are a legal entity separate and distinct from Byline Bank and other subsidiaries. As a bank holding company, we are subject to certain restrictions on our ability to pay dividends under applicable banking laws and regulations. 
 Federal banking regulators are authorized to determine under certain circumstances relating to the financial condition of a bank holding company or a bank that the payment of dividends would be an unsafe or unsound practice and to prohibit payment thereof. In particular, federal banking regulators have stated that paying dividends that deplete a banking organization s capital base to an inadequate level would be an unsafe and unsound banking practice and that banking organizations should generally pay dividends only out of current operating earnings. In addition, in the current financial and economic environment, the FRB has indicated that bank holding companies should carefully review their dividend policy and has discouraged payment ratios that are at maximum allowable levels unless both asset quality and capital are very strong. Under the capital rules defined in the Regulatory Capital Requirements section, institutions that seek to pay dividends must maintain 2.5 in Common Equity Tier 1 capital attributable to the capital conservation buffer. For more information on these financial measures at the Company and Byline Bank, see Note 20 of the notes to our audited consolidated financial statements contained in Item 8 of this report. 
 11 

A significant portion of our income, on a stand-alone basis, comes from dividends from our bank, which is also the primary source of our liquidity. In addition to the restrictions discussed previously, our bank is subject to limitations under Illinois law regarding the level of dividends that it may pay to us. Under the Illinois Banking Act, Byline Bank generally may not pay dividends in excess of its net profits. Under these restrictions, Byline Bank could pay aggregate dividends of approximately 126.9 million to us without obtaining affirmative regulatory approvals as of December 31, 2022. 
 Transactions with Affiliates and Insiders 
 Transactions between our bank and its subsidiaries, on the one hand, and us or any other subsidiary, on the other hand, are regulated under Sections 23A and 23B of the Federal Reserve Act. The Federal Reserve Act imposes quantitative and qualitative requirements and collateral requirements on covered transactions by Byline Bank with, or for the benefit of, its affiliates. Generally, Sections 23A and 23B of the Federal Reserve Act limit the extent to which our bank or its subsidiaries may engage in covered transactions with any one affiliate to an amount equal to 10 of our bank s capital stock and surplus, limits the aggregate amount of all such transactions with all affiliates to an amount equal to 20 of such capital stock and surplus, and requires those transactions to be on terms at least as favorable to our bank as if the transaction were conducted with an unaffiliated third-party. Covered transactions are defined by statute to include a loan or extension of credit, as well as a purchase of securities issued by an affiliate, a purchase of assets (unless otherwise exempted by the FRB) from the affiliate, certain derivative transactions with an affiliate, the acceptance of securities issued by the affiliate as collateral for a loan, and the issuance of a guarantee, acceptance or letter of credit on behalf of an affiliate. In addition, any credit transactions with any affiliate must be secured by designated amounts of specified collateral. 
 Federal law also limits our bank s authority to extend credit to its insiders, which is defined under applicable law to include its directors, executive officers and 10 stockholders, as well as to entities controlled by such persons. Among other things, extensions of credit to insiders are required to be made on terms that are substantially the same as, and follow credit underwriting procedures that are not less stringent than, those prevailing for comparable transactions with unaffiliated persons. Also, the terms of such extensions of credit may not involve more than the normal risk of non-repayment or present other unfavorable features and may not exceed certain limitations on the amount of credit extended to such persons individually and in the aggregate. In addition, we have certain stockholders who are foreign nationals, and we and these foreign national stockholders have entered into commitments with the FRB that restrict our ability to engage in certain business transactions without the consent of the FRB. 
 Source of Strength 
 FRB policy and federal law require bank holding companies to act as a source of financial and managerial strength to their subsidiary banks. Under this requirement, we are expected to commit resources to support Byline Bank, including at times when we may not be in a financial position to provide such resources, and it may not be in our, or our stockholders or creditors , best interests to do so. In addition, any capital loans we make to our bank are subordinate in right of payment to depositors and to certain other indebtedness of our bank. In the event of our bankruptcy, any commitment by us to a federal banking regulatory agency to maintain the capital of our bank will be assumed by the bankruptcy trustee and entitled to priority of payment. 
 Regulatory Capital Requirements 
 The FRB monitors the capital adequacy of our holding company on a consolidated basis, and the FDIC and the IDFPR monitor the capital adequacy of our bank. The banking regulators use a combination of risk-based guidelines and a leverage ratio to evaluate capital adequacy. The risk-based capital guidelines applicable to us and our bank are based on the Basel Committee s December 2010 final capital framework for strengthening international capital standards, known as Basel III, as implemented by the federal banking regulators, as well as various other rules implemented by the federal banking regulators as described below. The risk-based guidelines are intended to make regulatory capital requirements sensitive to differences in credit and market risk profiles among banks and bank holding companies, to account for off-balance sheet exposure and to minimize disincentives for holding liquid assets. 
 The Capital Rules . Over the past several years, the federal banking regulators have adopted a number of final rules, which we refer to as the Capital Rules, implementing Basel III, various provisions of the Dodd-Frank Act, various provisions of the Economic Growth Regulatory Relief and Consumer Protection Act (the Consumer Protection Act and certain other statutory and regulatory provisions relating to capital requirements . The Capital Rules, among other things, (i) include a capital measure called Common Equity Tier 1 CET1 ), (ii) specify that Tier 1 capital consists of CET1 and Additional Tier 1 capital instruments meeting certain revised requirements, (iii) define CET1 narrowly by requiring that most deductions/adjustments to regulatory capital measures be made to CET1 and not to the other components of capital, and (iv) expand the scope of the deductions/adjustments to capital as compared to prior regulations. The Capital Rules also address risk based capital requirements and risk weights and other issues affecting regulatory capital ratio calculations. 
 Under the Capital Rules, the minimum capital ratios are (i) 4.5 CET1 to risk-weighted assets, (ii) 6 Tier 1 capital (that is, CET1 plus Additional Tier 1 capital) to risk-weighted assets, (iii) 8 total capital (that is, Tier 1 capital plus Tier 2 capital) to risk-weighted assets and (iv) 4 Tier 1 capital to average consolidated assets as reported on consolidated financial statements (known as the leverage ratio ). 
 12 

The current Capital Rules also include a capital conservation buffer designed to absorb losses during periods of economic stress. The capital conservation buffer, which is composed entirely of CET1, is in addition to these minimum risk-weighted asset ratios. The capital conservation buffer is equal to 2.5 of CET1. In addition, the Capital Rules provide for a countercyclical capital buffer applicable only to certain covered institutions. We do not expect the countercyclical capital buffer to be applicable to us or our bank. Banking institutions with a ratio of CET1 to risk-weighted assets above the minimum but below the capital conservation buffer (or below the combined capital conservation buffer and countercyclical capital buffer, when the latter is applied) will face constraints on dividends, equity repurchases, and compensation based on the amount of the shortfall. 
 As a result of the fully phased-in capital conservation buffer rule, we and our bank are required to maintain an additional capital conservation buffer of 2.5 of CET1, effectively resulting in minimum ratios of (i) 7 CET1 to risk-weighted assets, (ii) 8.5 Tier 1 capital to risk-weighted assets, (iii) 10.5 total capital to risk-weighted assets and (iv) a minimum leverage ratio of 4 . 
 The Capital Rules provide for a number of deductions from and adjustments to CET1. These include, for example, the requirement that mortgage servicing rights, certain deferred tax assets and significant investments in non-consolidated financial entities be deducted from CET1 to the extent that any one such category exceeds 10 of CET1 or all such categories in the aggregate exceed 15 of CET1. Implementation of the deductions and other adjustments to CET1 began on January 1, 2015 and have been phased in over the past several years. The Capital Rules also generally preclude certain hybrid securities, such as trust preferred securities, from being counted as Tier 1 capital for most bank holding companies. Bank holding companies such as us who had less than 15 billion in assets as of December 31, 2009 (and who continue to have less than 15 billion in assets) are permitted to include qualifying trust preferred securities issued prior to May 19, 2010 as Additional Tier 1 capital under the Capital Rules, however. 
 In addition, under the general risk-based Capital Rules, the effects of accumulated other comprehensive income items included in capital were excluded for the purposes of determining regulatory capital ratios. Under the Capital Rules, the effects of certain accumulated other comprehensive income items are not excluded; however, non-advanced approaches banking organizations, including us and Byline Bank, were able to make a one-time permanent election to continue to exclude these items. 
 The Capital Rules also include a standardized approach for risk weightings of assets that include more risk-sensitive categories compared to previous capital rules. These risk-weighting categories depend on the nature of the assets, generally ranging from 0 , for U.S. government and agency securities, to 600 for certain equity exposures, and resulting in higher risk weights for a variety of asset categories. 
 With respect to our bank, the Capital Rules also revised the prompt corrective action regulations pursuant to Section 38 of the Federal Deposit Insurance Act (the FDIA ). On September 17, 2019, pursuant to the Consumer Protection Act, the federal banking regulators issued a final rule meant to simplify the capital rules for community banks. Under the final rule, most depository institutions and depository institution holding companies that have less than 10 billion in total consolidated assets, that have limited amounts of off-balance sheet exposures and trading assets and liabilities, and that have a community bank leverage ratio of greater than 9 would be eligible to opt into a community bank leverage ratio framework beginning on January 1, 2020. Under the final rule, should a qualified community bank or its holding company elect to use the community bank leverage ratio and maintain a community bank leverage ratio of greater than 9 then it would not be subject to other risk-based and leverage capital requirements, including the risk-based capital rules relating to high volatility commercial real estate, mortgage servicing rights, certain deferred tax assets and significant investments in non-consolidated financial entities, and would be considered to have met the well capitalized ratio requirements for purposes of Section 38 of the Federal Deposit Insurance Act and the generally applicable capital requirements under the federal banking regulators capital rules. While the community bank leverage ratio framework is available to us and Byline Bank, neither we nor Byline Bank have elected to adopt the community bank leverage ratio framework at this time. 
 As part of the adoption of ASU 2016-13, the Company has elected to opt into the regulators joint current expected credit losses CECL transition provision, which allows the Company to phase in the capital impact of the adoption of CECL over the next three years beginning January 1, 2022. Accordingly, capital ratios as of December 31, 2022 reflect 25 of the CECL impact.

Liquidity Regulations 
 Historically, the regulation and monitoring of bank and bank holding company liquidity has been addressed as a supervisory matter, without required formulaic measures. The Basel III final framework requires banks and bank holding companies to measure their liquidity against specific liquidity tests that, although similar in some respects to liquidity measures historically applied by banks and regulators for management and supervisory purposes, going forward would be required by regulation. One test, referred to as the liquidity coverage ratio, or LCR, is designed to ensure that the banking entity maintains an adequate level of unencumbered high-quality liquid assets equal to the entity s expected net cash outflow for a 30 day time horizon (or, if greater, 25 of its expected total cash outflow) under an acute liquidity stress scenario. The other test, referred to as the net stable funding ratio, or NSFR, is designed to promote more medium- and long-term funding of the assets and activities of banking entities over a one-year time horizon. These requirements incentivize banking entities to increase their holdings of U.S. Treasury securities and other sovereign debt as a component of assets and increase the use of long-term debt as a funding source. 
 The federal banking regulators approved final rules implementing the LCR for advanced approaches banking organizations (i.e., banking organizations with 250 billion or more in total consolidated assets or 10 billion or more in total on-balance sheet foreign exposure) and a modified version of the LCR for bank holding companies with at least 50 billion in total consolidated assets that are not advanced approaches banking organizations. Neither of these final versions of the LCR apply to us or our bank. On October 20, 2020, the federal banking regulators also approved a final rule implementing the NSFR that requires certain U.S. banking organizations to ensure that they have access to stable funding over a defined time period. The final rule does not apply to U.S. banking organizations with less than 50 billion in total consolidated assets such as us and Byline Bank. 
 Prompt Corrective Action Framework 
 The FDIA also requires the federal banking regulators to take prompt corrective action in respect of depository institutions that fail to meet specified capital requirements. The FDIA establishes five capital categories: well-capitalized , adequately capitalized , undercapitalized , significantly undercapitalized , and critically undercapitalized . The federal banking regulators are required to take certain mandatory supervisory actions, and are authorized to take other discretionary actions, with respect to institutions that are undercapitalized, significantly undercapitalized or critically undercapitalized. The severity of these mandatory and discretionary supervisory actions depends upon the capital category in which the institution is placed. The relevant capital measures, which reflect changes under the Capital Rules that became effective on January 1, 2015, are the total capital ratio, the CET1 capital ratio, the Tier 1 capital ratio and the leverage ratio. 
 A bank will be (i) well capitalized if the institution has a total risk-based capital ratio of 10 or greater, a CET1 capital ratio of 6.5 or greater, a Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio of 8 or greater and a leverage ratio of 5 or greater, and is not subject to any order or written directive by any such regulatory authority to meet and maintain a specific capital level for any capital measure; (ii) adequately capitalized if the institution has a total risk-based capital ratio of 8 or greater, a CET1 capital ratio of 4.5 or greater, a Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio of 6 or greater and a leverage ratio of 4 or greater and is not well capitalized (iii) undercapitalized if the institution has a total risk-based capital ratio that is less than 8 , a CET1 capital ratio less than 4.5 , a Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio of less than 6 or a leverage ratio of less than 4 ; (iv) significantly undercapitalized if the institution has a total risk-based capital ratio of less than 6 , a CET1 capital ratio less than 3 , a Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio of less than 4 or a leverage ratio of less than 3 ; and (v) critically undercapitalized if the institution s tangible equity is equal to or less than 2 of average quarterly tangible assets. A bank s capital category is determined solely for the purpose of applying prompt corrective action regulations, and the capital category may not constitute an accurate representation of Byline Bank s overall financial condition or prospects for other purposes. 
 The FDIA generally prohibits a depository institution from making any capital distributions (including payment of a dividend) or paying any management fee to its parent holding company if the depository institution would thereafter be undercapitalized . An institution that is categorized as undercapitalized, significantly undercapitalized or critically undercapitalized is required to submit an acceptable capital restoration plan to its appropriate federal banking regulator. Under the FDIA, in order for the capital restoration plan to be accepted by the appropriate federal banking agency, a bank holding company must guarantee that a subsidiary depository institution will comply with its capital restoration plan, subject to certain limitations. The bank holding company must also provide appropriate assurances of performance. The obligation of a controlling bank holding company under the FDIA to fund a capital restoration plan is limited to the lesser of 5 of an undercapitalized subsidiary s assets or the amount required to meet regulatory capital requirements. An undercapitalized institution is also generally prohibited from increasing its average total assets, making acquisitions and capital distributions, establishing any branches or engaging in any new line of business, except in accordance with an accepted capital restoration plan or with the approval of the FDIC. Institutions that are undercapitalized and either fail to submit an acceptable capital restoration plan or fail to implement an approved capital restoration plan may be subject to a number of requirements and restrictions, including orders to sell sufficient voting stock to become adequately capitalized, requirements to reduce total assets and cessation of receipt of deposits from correspondent banks. 
 Significantly undercapitalized depository institutions may be subject to a number of requirements and restrictions, including orders to sell sufficient voting stock to become adequately capitalized, requirements to reduce total assets, and cessation of receipt of deposits from correspondent banks. Critically undercapitalized depository institutions are subject to appointment of a receiver or conservator. 
 The appropriate federal banking agency may, under certain circumstances, reclassify a well-capitalized insured depository institution as adequately capitalized. The FDIA provides that an institution may be reclassified if the appropriate federal banking agency 
 14 

determines (after notice and opportunity for hearing) that the institution is in an unsafe or unsound condition or deems the institution to be engaging in an unsafe or unsound practice. The appropriate agency is also permitted to require an adequately capitalized or undercapitalized institution to comply with the supervisory provisions as if the institution were in the next lower category (but not treat a significantly undercapitalized institution as critically undercapitalized) based on supervisory information other than the capital levels of the institution. An institution may be downgraded to, or deemed to be in, a capital category that is lower than indicated by its capital ratios if it is determined to be in an unsafe or unsound condition or if it receives an unsatisfactory examination rating with respect to certain matters. 
 As part of the adoption of ASU 2016-13, the Company has elected to opt into the regulators joint CECL transition provision, which allows the Company to phase in the capital impact of the adoption of CECL over the next three years beginning January 1, 2022. Accordingly, capital ratios as of December 31, 2022 reflect 25 of the CECL impact. As of December 31, 2022, our bank was considered well capitalized with a Tier 1 capital ratio of 11.27 , total capital ratio of 12.34 , Tier 1 leverage ratio of 10.67 , and a CET1 capital ratio of 11.27 , as calculated under Basel III. For more information on these financial measures at the Company and Byline Bank, see Note 20 of the notes to our audited consolidated financial statements contained in Item 8 of this report. 
 Safety and Soundness Standards 
 The FDIA requires the federal banking agencies to prescribe standards, by regulations or guidelines, relating to internal controls, information systems and internal audit systems, loan documentation, credit underwriting, interest rate risk exposure, asset growth, asset quality, earnings, stock valuation and compensation, fees and benefits, and such other operational and managerial standards as the agencies deem appropriate. The federal banking agencies have adopted the Interagency Guidelines for Establishing Standards for Safety and Soundness. The guidelines establish general standards relating to internal controls and information systems, internal audit systems, loan documentation, credit underwriting, interest rate exposure, asset growth, asset quality, earnings and compensation, fees and benefits. In general, these guidelines require, among other things, appropriate systems and practices to identify and manage the risk and exposures specified in the guidelines. These guidelines also prohibit excessive compensation as an unsafe and unsound practice and describe compensation as excessive when the amounts paid are unreasonable or disproportionate to the services performed by an executive officer, employee, director or principal stockholder. In addition, the agencies adopted regulations that authorize, but do not require, an agency to order an institution that has been given notice by an agency that it is not satisfying any of such safety and soundness standards to submit a compliance plan. If, after being so notified, an institution fails to submit an acceptable compliance plan or fails in any material respect to implement an acceptable compliance plan, the banking regulator must issue an order directing action to correct the deficiency and may issue an order directing other actions of the types to which an undercapitalized institution may be subject under the FDIA. See Item 1. Business Supervision and Regulation Prompt Corrective Action Framework . If an institution fails to comply with such an order, the banking regulator may seek to enforce such order in judicial proceedings and to impose civil money penalties. 
 Deposit Insurance 
 FDIC insurance assessments 
 As an FDIC-insured bank, our bank must pay deposit insurance assessments to the FDIC based on its average total assets minus its average tangible equity. Deposits are insured up to applicable limits by the FDIC and such insurance is backed by the full faith and credit of the United States Government. 
 As an institution with less than 10 billion in assets, our bank s assessment rates are based on the level of risk it poses to the FDIC s deposit insurance fund DIF ). Pursuant to changes adopted by the FDIC that were effective July 1, 2016, the initial base rate for deposit insurance is between three and 30 basis points. Total base assessment after possible adjustments now ranges between 1.5 and 40 basis points. For established smaller institutions, like Byline Bank, supervisory ratings are used along with (i) an initial base assessment rate, (ii) an unsecured debt adjustment (which can be positive or negative), and (iii) a brokered deposit adjustment, to calculate a total base assessment rate. We are generally unable to control the amount of deposit insurance assessments that we are required to pay the FDIC. At least semi-annually, the FDIC will update its loss and income projections for the DIF and, if needed, will increase or decrease assessment rates, following notice-and-comment rulemaking, if required. 
 The limit on FDIC deposit insurance is 250,000. The coverage limit is per depositor, per insured depository institution for each account ownership category. The minimum DIF reserve ratio is 1.35 of estimated insured deposits. Under the FDIA, the FDIC may terminate deposit insurance upon a finding that an institution has engaged in unsafe and unsound practices, is in an unsafe or unsound condition to continue operations or has violated any applicable law, regulation, rule, order or condition imposed by the FDIC. 
 On October 18, 2022, the FDIC issued a notice of proposed rulemaking, applicable to all insured depository institutions, to increase initial base deposit insurance assessment rates by 2 basis points, beginning with the first quarterly assessment period of 2023. The stated purpose of the increase in deposit insurance assessment rates is to increase the likelihood that the Designated Reserve Ratio DRR of the DIF reaches the statutory minimum of 1.35 by the statutory deadline of September 30, 2028. The proposed assessment rate schedules would remain in effect unless and until the reserve ratio meets or exceeds 2 in order to support growth in the DIF in progressing toward the FDIC's long-term goal of a 2 DRR.

Other assessments 
 All Illinois state-chartered banks are required to pay supervisory assessments to the IDFPR to fund the operations of that agency. The amount of the assessment is calculated on the basis of Byline Bank s total assets. 
 The Volcker Rule 
 The Dodd-Frank Act, pursuant to a statutory provision commonly called the Volcker Rule , prohibits banks and their affiliates from engaging in proprietary trading and investing in and sponsoring hedge funds and private equity funds. The Volcker Rule became effective in July 2015. On July 9, 2019, pursuant to the Consumer Protection Act, the federal banking regulators issued a final rule to exempt community banks that have total assets of 10 billion or less and total consolidated trading assets and liabilities equal to or less than 5 of total consolidated assets from the Volcker Rule. Although we and Byline Bank qualify for exemption under the final rule, the Volcker Rule would not significantly affect the operations of us and our subsidiaries, as we do not have any significant engagement in the businesses covered by the Volcker Rule. 
 Depositor Preference 
 The FDIA provides that, in the event of the liquidation or other resolution of an insured depository institution, the claims of depositors of the institution, including the claims of the FDIC as subrogee of insured depositors, and certain claims for administrative expenses of the FDIC as a receiver, will have priority over other general unsecured claims against the institution. If an insured depository institution fails, insured and uninsured depositors, along with the FDIC, will have priority in payment ahead of unsecured, non-deposit creditors, including depositors whose deposits are payable only outside of the United States and the parent bank holding company, with respect to any extensions of credit they have made to such insured depository institution. 
 Interstate Branching 
 Illinois state-chartered banks, such as Byline Bank, have the authority under Illinois law to establish branches anywhere in the State of Illinois, subject to receipt of all required regulatory approvals. 
 Federal law permits state and national banks to merge with banks in other states subject to: (i) regulatory approval; (ii) federal and state deposit concentration limits; and (iii) any state law limitations requiring the merging bank to have been in existence for a minimum period of time (not to exceed five years) prior to the merger. The establishment of new interstate branches or the acquisition of individual branches of a bank in another state (rather than the acquisition of an out-of-state bank in its entirety) has historically been permitted only in those states the laws of which expressly authorize such expansion. However, the Dodd-Frank Act permits well-capitalized and well-managed banks to establish new branches across state lines without these impediments. 
 Consumer Financial Protection 
 We are subject to a number of federal and state consumer protection laws that extensively govern our relationship with our customers. These laws include the Equal Credit Opportunity Act ECOA ), the Fair Credit Reporting Act, the Truth in Lending Act TILA ), the Truth in Savings Act, the Electronic Fund Transfer Act, the Expedited Funds Availability Act, the Home Mortgage Disclosure Act, the Fair Housing Act, the Real Estate Settlement Procedures Act, the Fair Debt Collection Practices Act, the Fair Credit Reporting Act, the Service Members Civil Relief Act, the Right to Financial Privacy Act, the Telephone Consumer Protection Act, the CAN-SPAM Act, and these laws respective state-law counterparts, as well as state usury laws and laws regarding unfair and deceptive acts and practices. These and other federal laws, among other things, require disclosures of the cost of credit and terms of deposit accounts, provide substantive consumer rights, prohibit discrimination in credit transactions, regulate the use of credit report information, provide financial privacy protections, restrict our ability to raise interest rates on extensions of credit and subject us to substantial regulatory oversight. Violations of applicable consumer protection laws can result in significant potential liability from litigation brought by customers, including actual damages, restitution and attorneys fees. Federal banking regulators, state attorneys general and state and local consumer protection agencies may also seek to enforce consumer protection requirements and obtain these and other remedies, including regulatory sanctions, customer rescission rights, action by the state and local attorneys general in each jurisdiction in which we operate and civil money penalties. Failure to comply with consumer protection requirements may also result in our failure to obtain any required bank regulatory approval for merger or acquisition transactions we may wish to pursue or our prohibition from engaging in such transactions even if approval is not required. 
 The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau CFPB ), has broad rulemaking, supervisory and enforcement powers under various federal consumer financial protection laws with respect to certain consumer financial products and services, including the ability to require reimbursements and other payments to customers for alleged legal violations. The CFPB has the authority to impose significant penalties, as well as injunctive relief that prohibits lenders from engaging in allegedly unlawful practices. The CFPB is also authorized to engage in consumer financial education, track consumer complaints, request data and promote the availability of financial services to underserved consumers and communities. Although all institutions are subject to rules adopted by the CFPB and examination by the CFPB in conjunction with examinations by the institution s primary federal regulator, the CFPB has primary examination and enforcement authority over banks with assets of 10 billion or more. The FDIC has primary responsibility for examination of our bank and enforcement with respect to various federal consumer protection laws so long as our bank has total consolidated assets of less than 10 billion, and state authorities are responsible for monitoring our compliance with all state consumer laws. The CFPB also has the authority to require reports from institutions with less than 10 billion in assets, such as our bank, to support the CFPB in implementing 
 16 

federal consumer protection laws, supporting examination activities, and assessing and detecting risks to consumers and financial markets. 
 The consumer protection provisions of the Dodd-Frank Act and the examination, supervision and enforcement of those laws and implementing regulations by the CFPB have created a more intense and complex environment for consumer finance regulation. The CFPB has significant authority to implement and enforce federal consumer finance laws, including the TILA and the ECOA. 
 The CFPB has broad rulemaking authority for a wide range of consumer financial laws that apply to all banks including, among other things, the authority to prohibit unfair, deceptive, or abusive acts and practices. Abusive acts or practices are defined in the Dodd-Frank Act as those that (1) materially interfere with a consumer s ability to understand a term or condition of a consumer financial product or service, or (2) take unreasonable advantage of a consumer s (a) lack of financial savvy, (b) inability to protect herself or himself in the selection or use of consumer financial products or services, or (c) reasonable reliance on a covered entity to act in the consumer s interests. The review of products and practices to prevent such acts and practices is a continuing focus of the CFPB, and of banking regulators more broadly. The ultimate impact of this heightened scrutiny is uncertain but it could result in changes to pricing, practices, products and procedures. It could also result in increased costs related to regulatory oversight, supervision and examination, additional remediation efforts and possible penalties. The Dodd-Frank Act does not prevent states from adopting stricter consumer protection standards. State regulation of financial products and potential enforcement actions could also adversely affect our business, financial condition or results of operations. 
 Federal Home Loan Bank Membership 
 Byline Bank is a member of the Federal Home Loan Bank of Chicago FHLB ), which serves as a central credit facility for its members. The FHLB is funded primarily from proceeds from the sale of obligations of the FHLB system. It makes loans to member banks in the form of FHLB advances. All advances from the FHLB are required to be fully collateralized as determined by the FHLB. 
 Ability-To-Pay Rules and Qualified Mortgages 
 As required by the Dodd-Frank Act, the CFPB issued a series of final rules amending Regulation Z, implementing TILA, which requires mortgage lenders to make a reasonable and good faith determination, based on verified and documented information, that a consumer applying for a residential mortgage loan has a reasonable ability to repay the loan according to its terms. These rules prohibit creditors, such as Byline Bank, from extending residential mortgage loans without regard for the consumer s ability to repay and add restrictions and requirements to residential mortgage origination and servicing practices. In addition, these rules restrict the imposition of prepayment penalties and restrict compensation practices relating to residential mortgage loan origination. 
 On April 27, 2021, the CFPB issued two new rules that would modify qualified mortgage loan requirements and provide flexibility to banks and other lenders in determining consumers ability-to-repay. Compliance with these rules was required by October 1, 2022. Byline Bank complies with, and will continue with, all applicable qualified mortgage loan requirements. 
 Commercial Real Estate Guidance 
 In December 2015, the federal banking regulators released a statement entitled Interagency Statement on Prudent Risk Management for Commercial Real Estate Lending (the CRE Guidance ). In the CRE Guidance, the federal banking regulators (i) expressed concerns with institutions that ease commercial real estate underwriting standards, (ii) directed financial institutions to maintain underwriting discipline and exercise risk management practices to identify, measure and monitor lending risks, and (iii) indicated that they will continue to pay special attention to commercial real estate lending activities and concentrations going forward. The federal banking regulators previously issued guidance in December 2006, entitled Interagency Guidance on Concentrations in Commercial Real Estate Lending, Sound Risk Management Practices , which stated that an institution is potentially exposed to significant commercial real estate concentration risk, and should employ enhanced risk management practices, where (1) total commercial real estate loans represent 300 or more of its total capital and (2) the outstanding balance of such institution s commercial real estate loan portfolio has increased by 50 or more during the prior 36 months. 
 Leveraged Lending Guidance 
 The federal banking regulators have jointly issued guidance on leveraged lending that updates and replaces prior guidance for leveraged finance activities. The revised leveraged lending guidance describes regulatory expectations for the sound risk management of leveraged lending activities, including the importance for institutions to maintain, among other things, (i) a credit limit and concentration framework consistent with the institution s risk appetite, (ii) underwriting standards that define acceptable leverage levels, (iii) strong pipeline management policies and procedures and (iv) guidelines for conducting periodic portfolio and pipeline stress tests. 
 Community Reinvestment Act of 1977 
 Under the CRA, our bank has an obligation, consistent with safe and sound operations, to help meet the credit needs of the market areas where it operates, which includes providing credit to low- and moderate-income individuals and communities. In connection with its examination of our bank, the FDIC is required to assess our bank s compliance with the CRA. Our bank s failure to comply with the CRA could, among other things, result in the denial or delay of certain corporate applications filed by us or our bank, including applications for branch openings or relocations and applications to acquire, merge or consolidate with another banking institution or holding company. Our bank received a rating of Satisfactory in its most recently completed CRA examination which is dated August 15, 2022. 
 17 

On July 20, 2021, the OCC, FDIC and the FRB issued a joint statement committing to work together to strengthen and modernize the CRA rules. On May 5, 2022, the OCC, FDIC and FRB issued an Advanced Notice of Proposed Rulemaking with the goals of (i) expanding access to credit, investment and basic banking services in low- and moderate-income communities, (ii) adapting to changes in the banking industry, including internet and mobile banking, (iii) providing greater clarity, consistency and transparency, (iv) tailoring CRA evaluation and data collection to bank size and type, and (v) maintaining a unified approach. However, these agencies have not yet issued a new proposed rule. At this time, we are unable to determine what impact, if any, potential CRA reform may have on the operations of Byline Bank. 
 Financial Privacy 
 The federal banking regulators have adopted rules limiting the ability of banks and other financial institutions to disclose non-public information about consumers to unaffiliated third parties. These limitations require disclosure of privacy policies to consumers and, in some circumstances, allow consumers to prevent disclosure of certain personal information to an unaffiliated third party. These regulations affect how consumer information is transmitted through diversified financial companies and conveyed to outside vendors. 
 Anti-Money Laundering and the USA PATRIOT Act 
 A major focus of governmental policy on financial institutions in recent years has been combating money laundering and terrorist financing. The Uniting and Strengthening America by Providing Appropriate Tools Required to Intercept and Obstruct Terrorism Act of 2001, or the USA PATRIOT Act, substantially broadened the scope of United States anti money laundering laws and regulations by imposing significant new compliance and due diligence obligations, creating new crimes and penalties and expanding the extra-territorial jurisdiction of the United States in these areas: customer identification programs, money laundering, terrorist financing, identifying and reporting suspicious activities and currency transactions, currency crimes, and cooperation between financial institutions and law enforcement authorities. The U.S. Treasury Department s Financial Crimes Enforcement Network FinCEN ), among other federal agencies, also promulgates rules and regulations regarding the USA PATRIOT Act with which financial institutions are required to comply. Financial institutions are prohibited from entering into specified financial transactions and account relationships and must use enhanced due diligence procedures in their dealings with certain types of high-risk customers and implement a written customer identification program. Financial institutions must take certain steps to assist government agencies in detecting and preventing money laundering and report certain types of suspicious transactions. Regulatory authorities routinely examine financial institutions for compliance with these obligations, and failure of a financial institution to maintain and implement adequate programs to combat money laundering and terrorist financing, or to comply with all of the relevant laws or regulations, could have serious legal and reputational consequences for the institution, including causing applicable bank regulatory authorities not to approve merger or acquisition transactions when regulatory approval is required or to prohibit such transactions even if approval is not required. Regulatory authorities have imposed cease and desist orders and significant civil money penalties against institutions found to be violating these obligations and have in some cases brought criminal actions against some institutions for these types of violations. 
 On January 1, 2021, Congress passed the Corporate Transparency Act as part of the National Defense Authorization Act, which enacted the most significant overhaul of the anti-money laundering laws since the USA PATRIOT Act. Notable amendments include (i) significant changes to the collection of beneficial ownership information and the establishment of a beneficial ownership registry, which requires corporate entities (generally, any corporation, limited liability company, or other similar entity with 20 or fewer employees and annual gross income of 5 million or less) to report beneficial ownership information to FinCEN (which will be maintained by FinCEN and made available upon request to financial institutions); (ii) enhanced whistleblower provisions, which provide that one or more whistleblowers who voluntarily provide original information leading to the successful prosecution of violations of the anti-money laundering laws in any judicial or administrative action brought by the Secretary of the Treasury or the U.S. Attorney General resulting in monetary sanctions exceeding 1 million (including disgorgement and interest but excluding forfeiture, restitution, or compensation to victims) will receive not more than 30 of the monetary sanctions collected and will receive increased protections; (iii) increased penalties for violations of anti-money laundering laws and regulations; (iv) improvements to existing information sharing provisions that permit financial institutions to share information relating to suspicious activity reports with foreign branches, subsidiaries, and affiliates (except those located in China, Russia, or certain other jurisdictions) for the purpose of combating illicit finance risks; and (v) expanded duties and enforcement powers for FinCEN. Many of the amendments, including those with respect to beneficial ownership, require FinCEN to promulgate rules. On September 29, 2022, FinCEN finalized the first of three proposed rules to implement changes to the beneficial ownership requirements and related amendments set forth in the Corporate Transparency Act. The final rule prescribes which corporate entities created in or registered to do business in the U.S. will be required to report beneficial ownership information directly to FinCEN. The rule is effective and compliance is required on January 1, 2024. On December 15, 2022, FinCEN issued a second proposed rule to establish and manage access to beneficial ownership information that FinCEN will collect and maintain once all three rules are finalized. At this time, due to the fact that two of the proposed rules have not yet been finalized and issued, respectively, we are unable to determine what impact, if any, the finalized rules may have on the operations of Byline Bank. 
 Office of Foreign Assets Control Regulation 
 The U.S. Treasury Department s Office of Foreign Assets Control, or OFAC, under authority of various laws, administers and enforces economic and trade sanctions against targeted foreign countries and regimes, including designated foreign countries, nationals and others. OFAC publishes lists of specially designated targets and countries. We and our bank are responsible for, among other things, blocking accounts of, and transactions with, such targets and countries, prohibiting unlicensed trade and financial transactions with them 
 18 

and reporting blocked transactions after their occurrence. Failure to comply with these sanctions could have serious legal and reputational consequences and could result in civil money penalties imposed on the institution by OFAC. Failure to comply with these sanctions could also cause applicable bank regulatory authorities not to approve merger or acquisition transactions when regulatory approval is required or to prohibit such transactions even if approval is not required. 
 Cybersecurity 
 In March 2015, federal regulators issued two related statements regarding cybersecurity. One statement indicates that financial institutions should design multiple layers of security controls to establish lines of defense and to ensure that their risk management processes also address the risk posed by compromised customer credentials, including security measures to reliably authenticate customers accessing internet-based services of the financial institution. The other statement indicates that a financial institution s management is expected to maintain sufficient business continuity planning processes to ensure the rapid recovery, resumption and maintenance of the institution s operations after a cyberattack involving destructive malware. A financial institution is also expected to develop appropriate processes to enable recovery of data and business operations and address rebuilding network capabilities and restoring data if the institution or its critical service providers fall victim to this type of cyberattack. If we fail to observe the regulatory guidance, we could be subject to various regulatory sanctions, including financial penalties. 
 In November 2021, the federal regulators finalized a rule concerning notification requirements for banks related to significant computer security incidents. Under the final rule, a bank or its bank holding company is required to notify its applicable federal banking regulators within 36 hours of incidents that have materially disrupted or degraded, or are reasonably likely to materially disrupt or degrade, the banking organization s ability to deliver services to a material portion of its customer base, jeopardize the viability of key operations of the organization, or impact the stability of the financial sector. The rule was effective April 1, 2022 and compliance was required by May 1, 2022. 
 In the ordinary course of business, we rely on electronic communications and information systems to conduct our operations and to store sensitive data. We employ an in-depth, layered, defensive approach that leverages people, processes and technology to manage and maintain cybersecurity controls. We employ a variety of preventative and detective tools to monitor, block, and provide alerts regarding suspicious activity, as well as to report on any suspected advanced persistent threats. Notwithstanding the strength of our defensive measures, the threat from cyberattacks is severe, attacks are sophisticated and increasing in volume, and attackers respond rapidly to changes in defensive measures. While to-date we have not experienced a significant compromise, significant data loss or any material financial losses related to cybersecurity attacks, our systems and those of our customers and third party service providers are under constant threat and it is possible that we could experience a significant event in the future. Risks and exposures related to cybersecurity attacks are expected to remain high for the foreseeable future due to the rapidly evolving nature and sophistication of these threats, as well as due to the expanding use of internet banking, mobile banking and other technology-based products and services by us and our customers. 
 Future Legislation and Regulation 
 Congress may enact legislation from time to time that affects the regulation of the financial services industry, and state legislatures may enact legislation from time to time affecting the regulation of financial institutions chartered by or operating in those states. Federal and state regulatory agencies also periodically propose and adopt changes to their regulations or change the manner in which existing regulations are applied. The substance or impact of pending or future legislation or regulation, or the application thereof, cannot be predicted, although enactment of the proposed legislation could affect the regulatory structure under which we operate and may significantly increase our costs, impede the efficiency of our internal business processes, require us to increase our regulatory capital or modify our business strategy, or limit our ability to pursue business opportunities in an efficient manner. Our business, financial condition, results of operations or prospects may be adversely affected, perhaps materially, as a result.

 Item 1A. Risk Factors . 
 The material risks and uncertainties that management believes affect us are described below. You should carefully consider these risks, together with all of the information included herein. Any of the following risks, as well as risks that we do not know or currently deem immaterial, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, or results of operations. 
 Risks Related to Our Business 
 Credit and Interest Rate Risks 
 Our business depends on our ability to successfully manage credit risk. 
 The operation of our business requires us to manage credit risk. As a lender, we are exposed to the risk that our borrowers may be unable to repay their loans and leases according to their terms, and that the collateral securing repayment of their loans or leases, if any, may not be sufficient to ensure repayment. In addition, there are risks inherent in making any loan or lease, including risks with respect to the period of time over which the loan or lease may be repaid, risks relating to proper loan or lease underwriting, risks resulting from changes in economic and industry conditions and risks inherent in dealing with individual borrowers, including the risk that a borrower may not provide information to us about its business in a timely manner, and/or may present inaccurate or incomplete information to us, and risks relating to the value of collateral. In order to manage credit risk successfully, we must, among other things, maintain disciplined and prudent underwriting standards. The weakening of these standards for any reason, a lack of discipline or diligence in underwriting and monitoring loans and leases, the inability to adequately adapt policies and procedures to changes in economic or any other conditions affecting borrowers and the quality of our loan and lease portfolio, may result in defaults, foreclosures and additional charge-offs and may necessitate that we significantly increase our allowance for credit losses - loans and leases, each of which could adversely affect our net income. As a result, our inability to successfully manage credit risk could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, or results of operations. 
 We may underestimate the credit losses inherent in our loan and lease portfolio and have credit losses in excess of the amount we provide for loan and lease losses. 
 The credit quality of our loan and lease portfolio can have a significant impact on our earnings. We maintain an allowance for credit losses, which is a reserve established through a provision charged to expense representing management s estimate of current expected credit losses. The allowance, in the judgment of management, is necessary to reserve for current expected losses and risks inherent in our loan and lease portfolio. The level of the allowance reflects management s continuing evaluation of specific credit risks; the quality of the portfolio; the value of the underlying collateral; the level of non-accruing loans and leases; current expected losses inherent in the portfolio; and economic, political, and regulatory conditions. Management estimates the allowance balance using relevant available information from internal and external sources relating to past events, current conditions, and reasonable and supportable 
 20 

forecasts, which could increase the subjectivity of the calculation. This process, which is critical to our financial results and condition, requires difficult, subjective and complex judgments. In accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America GAAP for business combination accounting, the loans acquired through subsequent bank acquisitions are recorded at their estimated fair value, and an allowance for credit losses associated with those loans also recorded. 
 Although we believe our allowance for credit losses is adequate to absorb current expected losses in our loan and lease portfolio, it may not be sufficient. We could sustain credit losses that are significantly higher than the amount of our allowance as a result of a variety of reasons, such as changes in economic conditions affecting borrowers, new information and other factors within and outside our control. If real estate values were to decline or if economic conditions in our markets were to deteriorate unexpectedly, additional losses not incorporated in the existing allowance might occur. Losses in excess of the existing allowance will reduce our net income and could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, or results of operations. A severe downturn in the economy generally, in our markets specifically, or affecting the business and assets of individual customers, would generate increased charge-offs and a need for higher provision for credit losses. 
 We may also be required to take additional provisions for credit losses in the future to further supplement the allowance due to requirements by our banking regulators. Bank regulatory agencies periodically review our allowance, the policies and procedures we use to determine the level of the allowance and the value attributed to non-performing loans or to real estate acquired through foreclosure. Such regulatory agencies may require us to make further provisions or recognize future charge-offs. Further, charge-offs in future periods that exceed the allowance would require an increase to the allowance. 
 Any increases in our provision for credit losses will result in a decrease in net income and may reduce retained earnings and capital and, therefore, have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. 
 In June 2016, the Financial Accounting Standards Board FASB issued Accounting Standards Update ASU No. 2016 13, Financial Instruments - Credit Losses (Topic 326) on the recognition of credit losses, otherwise known as the current expected credit loss model or CECL , which replaces the incurred loss impairment methodology with a methodology that reflects current expected credit losses. As an emerging growth company, we elected to delay the adoption of the standard in accordance with ASU No. 2019-10, Effective Dates, which delayed the effective date of the ASU for entities not classified as Public Business Entities. The Company s EGC status expired on December 31, 2022, requiring CECL adoption be reflected in our December 31, 2022 financial statements and Form 10-K. The Company adopted CECL on December 31, 2022, and has applied it retroactively to the period beginning January 1, 2022 using the modified retrospective method of accounting. Cumulative adjustments related to adoption were made to capital and are disclosed in Note 2 of the audited consolidated financial statements contained in Item 8 of this report.

Our business is subject to interest rate risk and fluctuations in interest rates may adversely affect our earnings. 
 Fluctuations in interest rates may negatively affect our business and may weaken demand for some of our products. Our earnings and cash flows are largely dependent on net interest income, which is the difference between the interest income that we earn on interest-earning assets, such as investment securities, loans, and leases, the interest expense that we pay on interest-bearing liabilities, such as deposits and borrowings. Additionally, changes in interest rates also affect the premiums we may receive in connection with the sale of U.S. government guaranteed loans in the secondary market, pre-payment speeds of loans for which we own servicing rights, our ability to fund our operations with customer deposits, and the fair value of securities in our investment portfolio. Therefore, any change in general market interest rates can have a significant effect on our net interest income and results of operations. 
 We seek to mitigate our interest rate risk by entering into interest rate swaps and other interest rate derivative contracts from time to time with counterparties. Our hedging strategies rely on assumptions and projections regarding interest rates, asset levels, and general market factors and subject us to counterparty risk. There is no assurance that our interest rate mitigation strategies will be successful, and if our assumptions and projections prove to be incorrect or our hedging strategies do not adequately mitigate the impact of changes in interest rates, we may incur losses that could adversely affect our earnings. 
 Our interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities may react in different degrees to changes in market interest rates. Interest rates on some types of assets and liabilities may fluctuate prior to changes in broader market interest rates, while rates on other types of assets and liabilities may lag. The result of these changes to rates may cause differing spreads on interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities. Although we take measures intended to manage the risks from changes in market interest rates, we cannot control or accurately predict changes in market rates of interest or be sure our protective measures are adequate. 
 As of December 31, 2022, we had 2.1 billion of non-interest-bearing demand deposits and 592.1 million of interest-bearing checking accounts. As the Federal Reserve raised its overnight target from nearly zero at the beginning of the year to a range of 4.25 to 4.50 at December 31, 2022, we have cautiously managed our deposit repricing strategies to seek to expand our net interest margin by keeping deposit rates at relatively low levels. As the competition for funding among banks increases, and customers move money to achieve higher yields, we may need to increase our deposit pricing accordingly. To the extent we offer higher interest rates on targeted interest-bearing deposit products to maintain current customers or attract new customers, our interest expense will increase, perhaps materially. Furthermore, if we fail to offer interest rates at a sufficient level to keep these demand deposits, our core deposits may be reduced, which would require us to obtain funding in other ways or risk slowing our future asset growth. 
 We may be adversely impacted by the transition from the London Interbank Offered Rate LIBOR as a reference rate. 
 On March 5, 2021, the United Kingdom s Financial Conduct Authority and the Intercontinental Exchange Benchmark Administration announced that the one-week and two-month U.S. dollar LIBOR USD LIBOR settings would cease to be published immediately after December 31, 2021. The publication of overnight and one-, three-, six , and 12-month USD LIBOR settings would be extended through June 30, 2023 to provide additional time for market participants to wind down or modify existing contracts that reference these LIBOR tenors. 
 In response, the FDIC, the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, and the OCC issued joint guidance directing banks and market participants to cease entering new LIBOR contracts after December 31, 2021, which we have done. Although most LIBOR tenors will continue to be published through June 30, 2023 to aid in the transition of legacy LIBOR contracts (e.g. maturity), as of January 1, 2021, we no longer originate loans indexed to LIBOR nor enter into modifications which create new LIBOR exposure. 
 During 2021, we began a transition to using a forward-looking term rate based upon the Secured the Overnight Financing Rate SOFR ), CME Term SOFR Term SOFR as the replacement benchmark index in lieu of LIBOR. SOFR is the Alternative Reference Rates Committee s recommended alternative to USD LIBOR. Because the Term SOFR market continues to develop and deepen, changes in SOFR or Term SOFR or changes in market perceptions of the acceptability of Term SOFR as a benchmark could result in changes to our risk exposures (for example, because SOFR is a broad measurement of the cost borrowing cash secured by U.S. Treasury securities, changes or disruptions in the repo market may adversely affect the availability or cost of floating-rate funding and, therefore, our exposure to fluctuations in interest rates) or otherwise result in losses on a product or having to pay more or receive less on financial instruments that we own or have issued. 
 Uncertainty as to the nature of other alternative reference rates (i.e. the Bloomberg Short-Term Bank Yield Index, Ameribor) and their broader acceptance by the market may also adversely affect SOFR rates and the value of SOFR-based loans, and to a lesser extent securities in our portfolio, and may impact the availability and cost of hedging instruments and borrowings, including the rates we pay on our subordinated debentures and trust preferred securities. 
 Such uncertainty may result in pricing volatility and increased capital requirements, accounting impacts, compliance, basis risk, legal and operational costs and risks associated with customer disclosures, discretionary actions taken or negotiation of loan modifications to move from LIBOR to Term SOFR prior to the June 30, 2023 cessation, reduced loan balances if borrowers do not accept the substitute indices we are able provide, systems disruption, business continuity, or model disruption. Finally, if we or other market participants fail to properly plan to implement alternative rates other than LIBOR, it could have an adverse effect on us and the financial system as a whole. 
 22 

Our business, profitability, and liquidity may be adversely affected by deterioration in the credit quality of, or defaults by, third parties who owe us money, securities or other assets or whose securities, or obligations we hold. 
 In addition to relying on borrowers to repay their loans and leases, we are exposed to the risk that third parties that owe us money, securities, or other assets will not perform their obligations. These parties may default on their obligations to us due to bankruptcy, lack of liquidity, operational failure, or other reasons. A default by a significant market participant, or concerns that such a party may default, could lead to significant liquidity problems, losses, or defaults by other parties, which in turn could adversely affect us. 
 We are also subject to the risk that our rights against third parties may not be enforceable in all circumstances. Deterioration in the credit quality of third parties whose securities or obligations we hold, including the Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation, Government National Mortgage Association and municipalities, could result in significant losses. 
 We depend on the accuracy and completeness of information about customers and counterparties. 
 In deciding whether to extend credit or enter into other transactions, and in evaluating and monitoring our loan and lease portfolio on an ongoing basis, we may rely on information furnished by or on behalf of customers and counterparties, including financial statements, credit reports, and other financial information. We may also rely on representations of those customers or counterparties or of other third parties, such as independent auditors, as to the accuracy and completeness of that information. Reliance on inaccurate, incomplete, fraudulent, or misleading financial statements, credit reports or other financial or business information, or the failure to receive such information on a timely basis, could result in loan or lease losses, reputational damage or other effects that could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, or results of operations. 
 The value of the financial instruments we own may decline in the future. 
 As of December 31, 2022, we owned 1.2 billion of investment securities, which consisted primarily of our positions in U.S. government and government-sponsored enterprises and federal agency obligations, mortgage and asset-backed securities and municipal securities. We evaluate our investment securities on at least a quarterly basis, and more frequently when economic and market conditions warrant such an evaluation, to determine whether any decline in fair value below amortized cost is the result of credit losses. The process for determining whether unrealized losses contain credit losses usually requires complex, subjective judgments in order to assess the probability of receiving all contractual principal and interest payments on the security. We may be required to recognize credit losses in future periods, which could adversely affect our business, results of operations or financial condition. In addition, further increases in market interest rates may continue to affect the market value of our securities portfolio, potentially further reducing accumulated other comprehensive income and/or earnings. 
 Funding Risks 
 A lack of liquidity could affect operations and jeopardize our business, financial condition, and results of operations. 
 Liquidity risk is the risk that we will not be able to meet our obligations, including financial commitments, as they come due and is inherent in our operations. An inability to raise funds through deposits, borrowings, the sale of loans and/or investment securities, and from other sources could have a material negative effect on our liquidity. Our most important source of funds consists of our customer deposits. If customers move money out of bank deposits and into other investments, we could lose a relatively low cost source of funds. This loss would require us to seek other funding alternatives in order to continue to grow, thereby increasing our funding costs and reducing our net interest income and net income. 
 Other primary sources of funds consist of cash from operations and investment maturities, redemptions, and sales, as well as borrowings from the Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago, the FHLB and other third-party lenders from time to time. Our access to funding sources in amounts adequate to finance or capitalize our activities or on terms that are acceptable to us could be impaired by factors that affect us directly or the financial services industry or economy in general, such as disruptions in the financial markets or negative views and expectations about the prospects for the financial services industry. 
 Any decline in available funding could adversely impact our ability to continue to implement our business plan, which could have a material adverse impact on our liquidity, business, financial condition, and results of operations. 
 Our liquidity is dependent on dividends from Byline Bank. 
 We are a legal entity separate and distinct from Byline Bank, our wholly-owned banking subsidiary. A substantial portion of our cash flow from operating activities, comes primarily from dividends we receive from Byline Bank. Various federal and state laws and regulations limit the amount of dividends that the bank may pay to us. As of December 31, 2022, Byline Bank had the capacity to pay us dividends of up to 126.9 million without the need to obtain prior regulatory approval. Also, our right to participate in a distribution of assets upon a subsidiary s liquidation or reorganization is subject to the prior claims of the subsidiary s creditors. In the event Byline Bank is unable to pay dividends to us, we may not be able to service our existing debt or any debt we may incur, pay obligations or pay dividends on our common and preferred stock, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations. 
 23 

We may need to raise additional capital in the future, and such capital may not be available when needed or at all. 
 We may need to raise additional capital, in the form of debt or equity securities, in the future to have sufficient capital resources to meet our commitments and fund our business and future growth, particularly if the quality of our assets or earnings were to deteriorate significantly. Our ability to raise additional capital, if needed, will depend on, among other things, conditions in the capital markets at that time, which are outside of our control, and our financial condition. Further, if we need to raise capital in the future, we may have to do so when many other financial institutions are also seeking to raise capital and would then have to compete with those institutions for investors. An inability to raise additional capital on acceptable terms when needed, or at all, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations. 
 Operational Risks 
 We may not be able to implement our growth strategy or manage costs effectively, resulting in lower earnings or profitability. 
 There can be no assurance that we will be able to continue to grow and to be profitable in future periods, or, if profitable, that our overall earnings will remain consistent or increase in the future. Our strategy focuses on organic growth, supplemented by opportunistic acquisitions. 
 Our growth requires that we increase our loan and deposit growth while managing risks by following prudent loan underwriting standards without increasing interest rate risk or compressing our net interest margin, maintaining more than adequate capital at all times, hiring and retaining qualified employees, and successfully implementing strategic projects and initiatives. Even if we are able to increase our interest income, our earnings may nonetheless be reduced by increased expenses, such as additional employee compensation or other general and administrative expenses and increased interest expense on any liabilities incurred or deposits solicited to fund increases in assets. Additionally, if our competitors extend credit on terms we find to pose excessive risks, or at interest rates which we believe do not warrant the credit exposure, we may not be able to maintain our lending volume and could experience deteriorating financial performance. Our inability to manage our growth successfully or to continue to expand into new markets could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, or results of operations. 
 New lines of business, products, product enhancements or services may subject us to additional risks. 
 From time to time, we may implement new lines of business or offer new products and product enhancements as well as new services within our existing lines of business. There are substantial risks and uncertainties associated with these efforts, particularly in instances in which the markets are not fully developed. In implementing, developing, or marketing new lines of business, products, product enhancements or services, we may invest significant time and resources and not realize their expected results or returns. Further, initial timetables for the introduction and development of new lines of business, products, product enhancements or services may not be achieved, and price and profitability targets may not prove feasible. External factors, such as compliance with regulations, competitive alternatives and shifting market preferences, may also affect the ultimate implementation of a new line of business or offerings of new products, product enhancements or services. Furthermore, any new line of business, product, product enhancement or service or system conversion could have a significant impact on the effectiveness of our system of internal controls. Failure to successfully manage these risks in the development and implementation of new lines of business or offerings of new products, product enhancements or services could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, or results of operations. 
 External Risks 
 Our business may be adversely affected by conditions in the financial markets and economic conditions generally. 
 Our financial performance generally, and in particular the ability of our borrowers to pay interest on and repay principal of outstanding loans and leases and the value of collateral securing those loans and leases, as well as demand for loans and leases and other products and services we offer, is highly dependent upon the business environment in the markets in which we operate and in the United States as a whole. Unlike larger banks that are more geographically diversified, we provide banking and financial services to customers primarily in the Chicago metropolitan area. The economic conditions in this local market may be different from, or worse than, the economic conditions in the United States as a whole. Some elements of the business environment that affect our financial performance include short-term and long-term interest rates, the prevailing yield curve, inflation and price levels, tax policy, monetary policy, unemployment, and the strength of the domestic economy and the local economy in the markets in which we operate. Also, the occurrence of other external events, such as geopolitical events and widespread public health emergencies or pandemics may negatively affect the business environment in our markets. Unfavorable market conditions can result in a deterioration in the credit quality of our borrowers and the demand for our products and services, an increase in the number of loan and lease delinquencies, defaults and charge-offs, additional provisions for credit losses and an overall material adverse effect on the quality of our loan and lease portfolio. Unfavorable or uncertain economic and market conditions can be caused by, among other factors, declines in economic growth, business activity or investor or business confidence; limitations on the availability or increases in the cost of credit and capital; changes in inflation 
 24 

or interest rates; increases in real estate and other state and local taxes; high unemployment; natural disasters; geopolitical issues and uncertainty; public health concerns; and other external factors or a combination of these or other factors. 
 Our business is significantly dependent on the real estate markets in which we operate, as a significant percentage of our loan portfolio is secured by real estate. 
 Many of the loans in our portfolio are secured by real estate. As of December 31, 2022, our real estate loans held for investment include 436.6 million of construction and development loans, 304.2 million of multifamily loans, 736.7 million of non-owner occupied CRE loans and 187.0 million of residential mortgage loans, with the majority of these real estate loans concentrated in the City of Chicago and the State of Illinois. Real property values in our primary market may differ from real property values in other markets where we may do business and may be affected by a variety of factors outside of our control and the control of our borrowers, including national and local economic conditions, generally. The Chicago metropolitan area has experienced volatility in real estate values over the past decade. Declines in real estate values, including prices for homes and commercial properties in the Chicago metropolitan area, could result in a deterioration of the credit quality of our borrowers, an increase in the number of loan delinquencies, defaults and charge-offs, and reduced demand for our products and services, generally. In addition, our appraisal of the property may change significantly in relatively short periods of time and may not accurately describe the fair value of the real property collateral after the loan is made, resulting in loss if we foreclose on the property prior to realizing the full amount of any remaining indebtedness. Our CRE loans may have a greater risk of loss than residential mortgage loans, in part because these loans are generally larger or more complex to underwrite. In particular, real estate construction and acquisition and development loans have certain risks not present in other types of loans, including risks associated with construction cost overruns, project completion risk, general contractor credit risk and risks associated with the ultimate sale or use of the completed construction. In addition, declines in real property values could reduce the value of any collateral we realize following a default on these loans. An increase in the level of non-performing assets increases our risk profile and may affect the capital levels regulators believe are appropriate in light of the ensuing risk profile. In addition, we rely on appraisals and other valuation techniques to establish the value of our other real estate owned OREO and personal property that we acquire through foreclosure proceedings and to determine certain loan impairments. If any of these valuations are inaccurate, our consolidated financial statements may not reflect the correct value of our OREO, and our allowance for credit losses - loans and leases may not reflect accurate loan impairments. This could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations. Our failure to effectively mitigate these risks could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, or results of operations. 
 Technology Risks 
 We depend on information technology and telecommunications systems of third parties, and any systems failures, interruptions, or data breaches involving these systems could adversely affect our operations and financial condition. 
 Our business is highly dependent on the successful and uninterrupted functioning of our information technology and telecommunications systems, third-party servicers, accounting systems, mobile and online banking platforms and financial intermediaries. We outsource to third parties many of our major systems, such as data processing, loan servicing, deposit processing, and internal audit systems. The failure of these systems, or the termination of a third-party software license or service agreement on which any of these systems is based, could interrupt our operations. Because our information technology and telecommunications systems interface with and depend on third-party systems, we could experience service denials if demand for such services exceeds capacity or such third-party systems fail or experience interruptions. If sustained or repeated, a system failure or service denial could result in a deterioration of our ability to operate effectively or service our customers, resulting in potential noncompliance with applicable laws or regulations, loss of customer business, and/or subject us to additional regulatory scrutiny and possible financial liability, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition. In addition, failure of third parties to comply with applicable laws and regulations, or fraud or misconduct on the part of employees of any of these third parties, could disrupt our operations or adversely affect our reputation. 
 It may be difficult for us to replace some of our third-party vendors, particularly vendors providing our core banking, debit card services, and information services, in a timely manner if they are unwilling or unable to provide us with these services in the future for any reason, and even if we are able to replace them, it may be at higher cost or result in the loss of customers. Any such events could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, or results of operations. 
 The occurrence of fraudulent activity, breaches or failures of our information security controls or cybersecurity-related incidents could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, or results of operations. 
 As a financial institution, we are susceptible to fraudulent activity, information security breaches, and cybersecurity-related incidents that may be committed against us, our customers, or third-party service providers that we utilize, which may result in financial losses or increased costs to us or our customers, disclosure or misuse of our information or our customer information, misappropriation of assets, privacy breaches against our customers, litigation, or damage to our reputation. Information security breaches and cybersecurity-related incidents may include fraudulent or unauthorized access to systems used by us or our customers, denial or degradation of service attacks, and malware or other cyberattacks. There continues to be a rise in electronic fraudulent activity, security 
 25 

breaches, and cyberattacks directed at the financial services industry. Consistent with industry trends, we have also experienced an increase in attempted electronic fraudulent activity, security breaches, and cybersecurity-related incidents. Information pertaining to us and our customers is maintained, and transactions are executed, on networks and systems maintained by us and certain third-party partners, such as our online banking or reporting systems. The secure maintenance and transmission of confidential information, as well as execution of transactions over these systems, are essential to protect us and our customers against fraud and security breaches and to maintain our customers confidence and privacy. Although we have developed, and continue to invest in, systems and processes that are designed to detect and prevent security breaches and cyberattacks and periodically test our security, our or our third-party partners inability to anticipate, or failure to adequately mitigate, breaches of security could result in: losses to us or our customers; our loss of business and/or customers; damage to our reputation; the incurrence of additional expenses; disruption to our business; our inability to grow our online services or other businesses; additional regulatory scrutiny or penalties; or our exposure to civil litigation and possible financial liability-any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, or results of operations. 
 We continually encounter technological change. 
 The financial services industry is continually undergoing rapid technological change with frequent introductions of new, technology-driven products and services. Our future success depends, in part, upon our ability to address the needs of our customers by using technology to provide products and services that will satisfy customer demands, as well as to create additional efficiencies in our operations. Many of our competitors have substantially greater resources to invest in technological improvements than we do. We may not be able to effectively implement new, technology-driven products and services, or be successful in marketing these products and services to our customers. In addition, the implementation of technological changes and upgrades to maintain current systems and integrate new ones may also cause service interruptions, transaction processing errors, and system conversion delays, and may cause us to fail to comply with applicable laws. Failure to successfully keep pace with technological change affecting the financial services industry and failure to avoid interruptions, errors, and delays could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, or results of operations. 
 Guaranteed Loans Risks 
 Small Business Administration lending and other government guaranteed lending is an important part of our business. Our government guaranteed lending programs are dependent upon the U.S. federal government, and we face specific risks associated with originating SBA and other government guaranteed loans. 
 Our SBA lending program is dependent upon the U.S. federal government. As an approved participant in the SBA Preferred Lender s Program (an SBA Preferred Lender ), we enable our customers to obtain SBA loans without being subject to the potentially lengthy SBA approval process necessary for lenders that are not SBA Preferred Lenders. The SBA periodically reviews the lending operations of participating lenders to assess, among other things, whether the lender exhibits prudent risk management. When weaknesses are identified, the SBA may request corrective actions or impose enforcement actions, including revocation of the lender s SBA Preferred Lender status. If we lose our status as an SBA Preferred Lender, we may lose some or all of our customers to lenders who are SBA Preferred Lenders, and as a result we could experience a material adverse effect to our financial results. Any changes to the SBA program, changes to program-specific rules impacting volume eligibility under the guaranty program, as well as changes to the program amounts authorized by Congress, may also have a material adverse effect on our business. In addition, any default by the U.S. government on its obligations or any prolonged government shutdown could impede our ability to originate SBA loans or other government guaranteed loans or sell such loans in the secondary market, which could materially adversely affect our business, results of operations, and financial condition. 
 Generally, we sell the guaranteed portion of our SBA 7(a) loans in the secondary market. These sales result in premium income for us at the time of sale and create a stream of future servicing income, as we retain the servicing rights to these loans. For the reasons described above, we may not be able to continue originating these loans or sell them in the secondary market. Furthermore, even if we are able to continue to originate and sell SBA 7(a) loans in the secondary market, we might not continue to realize premiums upon the sale of the guaranteed portion of these loans, or the premiums may decline due to economic and competitive factors. When we originate SBA loans, we incur credit risk on the non-guaranteed portion of the loans, and if a customer defaults on a loan, we share any loss and recovery related to the loan pro-rata with the SBA. If the SBA establishes that a loss on an SBA guaranteed loan is attributable to significant technical deficiencies in the manner in which the loan was originated, funded, or serviced by us, the SBA may seek recovery of the principal loss related to the deficiency from us. Generally, we do not maintain reserves or loss allowances for such potential claims and any such claims could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition, or results of operations. 
 The laws, regulations and standard operating procedures that are applicable to government guaranteed loan products may change in the future. We cannot predict the effects of these changes on our business and profitability. Because government regulation greatly affects the business and financial results of all commercial banks and bank holding companies and especially our organization, changes in the laws, regulations and procedures applicable to government guaranteed loans could adversely affect our ability to operate profitably. 
 26 

The recognition of gains on the sale of loans and servicing asset valuations reflect certain assumptions. 
 We continue to expect that gains on the sale of U.S. government guaranteed loans will continue to comprise a significant component of our revenue. The gain on such sales recognized for year ended December 31, 2022 was 31.9 million. The determination of these gains is based on assumptions regarding the value of unguaranteed loans retained, servicing rights retained and deferred fees and costs, and net premiums paid by purchasers of the guaranteed portions of U.S. government guaranteed loans. The value of retained unguaranteed loans and servicing rights are determined based on market-derived factors such as prepayment rates, current market conditions and recent loan sales. Deferred fees and costs are determined using internal analysis of the cost to originate loans. Significant errors in assumptions used to compute gains on sale of loans or servicing asset valuations could result in material revenue misstatements, which may have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and profitability. In addition, while we believe these valuations reflect fair value and such valuations are subject to validation by an independent third-party, if such valuations are not reflective of fair market value then our business, results of operations and financial condition may be materially and adversely affected. 
 Legal, Accounting, and Compliance Risks 
 Our accounting estimates and risk management processes and controls rely on analytical and forecasting techniques and models and assumptions, which may not accurately predict future events. 
 Our accounting policies and methods are fundamental to the manner in which we record and report our financial condition and results of operations. Our management must exercise judgment in selecting and applying many of these accounting policies and methods so they comply with GAAP and reflect management s judgment of the most appropriate manner to report our financial condition and results of operations. In some cases, management must select the accounting policy or method to apply from two or more alternatives, any of which may be reasonable under the circumstances, yet which may result in our reporting materially different results than would have been reported under a different alternative. 
 Certain accounting policies and estimates are critical to presenting our financial condition and results of operations. They require management to make difficult, subjective or complex judgments about matters that are uncertain. Materially different amounts could be reported under different conditions or using different assumptions or estimates. These critical accounting policies and estimates include (i) the carrying value of loans and leases, (ii) determining the provision and allowance for credit losses, (iii) the valuation of intangible assets such as goodwill, servicing assets, core deposit intangibles, and customer relationship intangible (iv) the determination of fair value for financial instruments, and (v) the valuation of or recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities. See Note 1 of the notes to our audited consolidated financial statements contained in Item 8 of this report for further information. Because of the uncertainty of estimates involved in these matters, we may be required to do one or more of the following: significantly increase the allowance for credit losses - loans and leases or sustain loan and lease losses that are significantly higher than the reserve provided; reduce the carrying value of an asset measured at fair value; or significantly increase our accrued tax liability. Any of these could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations. See Item 7. Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations . 
 Our internal controls, disclosure controls, processes and procedures, and corporate governance policies and procedures are based in part on certain assumptions and can provide only reasonable (not absolute) assurances that the objectives of the system are met. Furthermore, we currently outsource our internal audit function. Any failure or circumvention of our controls, processes and procedures or failure to comply with regulations related to controls, processes and procedures could necessitate changes in those controls, processes and procedures, which may increase our compliance costs, divert management attention from our business or subject us to regulatory actions and increased regulatory scrutiny. Any of these could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, or results of operations. 
 Our goodwill may become impaired, which may adversely impact our results of operations and financial condition and may limit Byline Bank s ability to pay dividends to us, thereby causing liquidity issues. 
 As of December 31, 2022, we had goodwill of 148.4 million, or 19.4 of our total stockholders equity. The excess purchase consideration over the fair value of net assets from acquisitions, or goodwill, is evaluated for impairment at least annually and on an interim basis if an event or circumstance indicates that it is more likely than not that an impairment has occurred. In testing for impairment, we conduct a qualitative assessment and we also estimate the fair value of net assets based on analyses of our market value, discounted cash flows and peer values. Consequently, the determination of the fair value of goodwill is sensitive to market-based economics and other key assumptions. Variability in market conditions or in key assumptions could result in impairment of goodwill, which is recorded as a non-cash adjustment to income. An impairment of goodwill could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. 
 27 

The accounting for loans acquired in connection with our recapitalization and acquisitions is based on numerous subjective determinations that may prove to be inaccurate and have a negative impact on our results of operations. 
 All loans acquired as part of our recapitalization in 2013 as well as loans acquired in connection with our subsequent acquisitions were recorded at their estimated fair value on their acquisition date without a carryover of the related allowance for loan losses. The determination of estimated fair value of purchased credit deteriorated and acquired non-credit-deteriorated loans requires management to make subjective determinations regarding discount rate, estimates of losses on defaults, market conditions and other factors that are highly subjective in nature. A risk exists that our estimate of the fair value of purchased credit deteriorated and acquired non-credit-deteriorated loans will prove to be inaccurate and that we ultimately will not recover the amount at which we recorded such loans on our balance sheet, which would require us to recognize losses. 
 Loans acquired that have experienced more than insignificant credit deterioration since origination are accounted for under Accounting Standards Codification ASC Topic 326, Financial Instruments Credit Losses . These purchased credit deteriorated (PCD) loans have experienced more than insignificant credit deterioration since origination, like non-credit-deteriorated loans acquired, and have been recorded at the amount paid. An allowance for credit losses is determined using the same methodology as other loans held for investment. The initial allowance for credit losses - loans and leases, determined on a collective basis, is allocated to individual loans. The sum of the loan s purchase price and allowance for credit losses becomes its initial amortized cost basis. The difference between the initial amortized cost basis and the par value of the loan is a noncredit discount or premium, which is amortized into interest income over the life of the loan. Subsequent changes to the allowance for credit losses are recorded through credit loss expense. 
 Acquired non credit-deteriorated loans and leases are accounted for under ASC Subtopic 310 20, Receivables Nonrefundable Fees and Other Costs ASC 310 20 ). The difference between the fair value and unpaid principal balance of the loan at the acquisition date is amortized or accreted to interest income over the life of the loan. While credit discounts are included in the determination of the fair value from non-credit-deteriorated loans, since these discounts are expected to be accreted over the life of the loans, they cannot be used to offset the allowance for credit losses that must be recorded at the acquisition date. As a result, an allowance for credit losses is determined at the acquisition date using the same methodology as other loans held for investment and is recognized as a provision for credit losses in the consolidated statements of operations. Any subsequent deterioration (improvement) in credit quality is recognized by recording a provision (recapture) for credit losses. 
 
 Our ability to recognize the benefits of deferred tax assets is dependent on future cash flows and taxable income. 
 We recognize the expected future tax benefit from deferred tax assets when it is more likely than not that the tax benefit will be realized. Otherwise, a valuation allowance is applied against deferred tax assets, reducing the value of such assets. Assessing the recoverability of deferred tax assets requires management to make significant estimates related to expectations of future taxable income from all sources, including reversal of taxable temporary differences, forecasted operating earnings and available tax planning strategies. Estimates of future taxable income are based on forecasted income from operations and the application of existing tax laws in each jurisdiction. Our acquisitions and risk profile are key components used in the determination of our ability to realize the expected future benefit of our deferred tax assets. To the extent that future taxable income differs significantly from estimates as a result of the interest rate environment and loan and lease growth capabilities or other factors, our ability to realize the net deferred tax assets could be affected. 
 Certain activities are restricted due to commitments entered into with the FRB by us and our foreign national stockholders. 
 We have certain stockholders who invested in our recapitalization who are foreign nationals, and we and these foreign national stockholders have entered into commitments with the FRB that restrict some of our activities. In particular, without approval of the FRB, we are restricted from engaging in certain transactions with these foreign national stockholders, their immediate families, and any company controlled by such foreign national stockholders or by their immediate families. If we were to fail to comply with any of these restrictions, we could be subject to enforcement and other legal actions by the FRB, including civil and criminal penalties, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. 
 Monetary policies and regulations of the FRB could adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations. 
 In addition to being affected by general economic conditions, our earnings and growth are affected by the policies of the FRB. An important function of the FRB is to regulate the money supply and credit conditions. Among the instruments used by the FRB to implement these objectives are open market purchases and sales of U.S. government securities, adjustments of the discount rate, and changes in banks reserve requirements against bank deposits. These instruments are used in varying combinations to influence overall economic growth and the distribution of credit, bank loans, investments, and deposits. Their use also affects interest rates charged on loans or paid on deposits. 
 The monetary policies and regulations of the FRB have had a significant effect on the operating results of commercial banks in the past and are expected to continue to do so in the future. The effects of such policies upon our business, financial condition, and results of operations cannot be predicted. 
 28 

We are subject to numerous laws designed to protect consumers, including the Community Reinvestment Act and fair lending laws, and failure to comply with these laws could lead to a wide variety of sanctions. 
 The CRA requires our bank, consistent with safe and sound operations, to ascertain and meet the credit needs of its entire community, including low and moderate income areas. Our bank s failure to comply with the CRA could, among other things, result in the denial or delay of certain corporate applications filed by us or our bank, including applications for branch openings or relocations and applications to acquire, merge or consolidate with another banking institution or holding company. In addition, the ECOA, the Fair Housing Act, and other fair lending laws and regulations prohibit discriminatory lending practices by financial institutions. A challenge to an institution s compliance with fair lending laws and regulations could result in a wide variety of sanctions, including damages and civil money penalties, injunctive relief, restrictions on mergers and acquisitions activity, restrictions on expansion, and restrictions on entering new business lines. Private parties may also challenge an institution s performance under fair lending laws in private class action litigation. Such actions could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, and growth prospects. 
 Litigation and regulatory actions, including possible enforcement actions, could subject us to significant fines, penalties, judgments, or other requirements resulting in increased expenses or restrictions on our business activities. 
 Our business is subject to increased litigation and regulatory risks as a result of a number of factors, including the highly regulated nature of the financial services industry and the focus of state and federal prosecutors on banks and the financial services industry generally. In the normal course of business, we have in the past and may in the future be named as a defendant in various legal actions, including arbitrations, class actions, and other litigation, arising in connection with our current and/or prior business activities. Legal actions could include claims for substantial compensatory or punitive damages or claims for indeterminate amounts of damages, resulting in increased expenses, diminished income, damage to our reputation, and divert management attention from the operation of our business. In addition, while the arbitration provisions in certain of our customer agreements historically have limited our exposure to consumer class action litigation, there can be no assurance that we will be successful in enforcing our arbitration clause in the future. Further, we have in the past and may in the future be subject to consent orders with our regulators. 
 We may also, from time to time, be the subject of subpoenas, requests for information, reviews, investigations and proceedings (both formal and informal) by governmental agencies regarding our current and/or prior business activities. Further, any settlement, consent order or adverse judgment in connection with any formal or informal proceeding or investigation by government agencies may result in litigation, investigations or proceedings as other litigants and government agencies begin independent reviews of the same activities. As a result, the outcome of legal and regulatory actions could be material to our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows. 
 Non-compliance with the USA PATRIOT Act, the Bank Secrecy Act or other laws and regulations could result in fines or sanctions against us. 
 The USA PATRIOT Act of 2001 and the Bank Secrecy Act require financial institutions to design and implement programs to prevent financial institutions from being used for money laundering and terrorist activities. If such activities are detected, financial institutions are obligated to file suspicious activity reports with the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network of the U.S. Department of the Treasury. These rules require financial institutions to establish procedures for identifying and verifying the identity of customers seeking to open new financial accounts. Federal and state bank regulators also have focused on compliance with Bank Secrecy Act and anti-money laundering regulations. Failure to comply with these regulations could result in fines or sanctions, including restrictions on conducting acquisitions or establishing new branches. While we have developed policies and procedures designed to assist in compliance with these laws and regulations, these policies and procedures may not be effective in preventing violations of these laws and regulations. Failure to maintain and implement adequate programs to combat money laundering and terrorist financing could also have serious reputational consequences for us, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations. 
 Regulations relating to privacy, information security, and data protection could increase our costs, affect or limit how we collect and use personal information, and adversely affect our business opportunities. 
 We are subject to various privacy, information security, and data protection laws, including requirements concerning security breach notification, and we could be negatively affected by these laws. For example, our business is subject to the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act which, among other things: (i) imposes certain limitations on our ability to share nonpublic personal information about our customers with nonaffiliated third parties; (ii) requires that we provide certain disclosures to customers about our information collection, sharing and security practices, and (iii) requires that we develop, implement and maintain a written comprehensive information security program. Various state and federal banking regulators and states have also enacted data security breach notification requirements with varying levels of individual, consumer, regulatory or law enforcement notification in certain circumstances in the event of a security breach. Moreover, legislators and regulators in the United States are increasingly adopting or revising privacy, information security and data protection laws that potentially could have a significant impact on our privacy, data protection and information security-related practices, our collection, use, sharing, retention and safeguarding of consumer or employee information, and some of our current or 
 29 

planned business activities. This could also increase our costs of compliance and business operations and could reduce income from certain business initiatives. 
 Compliance with current or future privacy, data protection, and information security laws to which we are subject could result in higher compliance and technology costs and could restrict our ability to provide certain products and services, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations. Our failure to comply with privacy, data protection and information security laws could result in potentially significant regulatory or governmental investigations or actions, litigation, fines, sanctions and damage to our reputation, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, or results of operations. 
 Risks Related to Acquisition Activity 
 We may be adversely affected by risks associated with completed and potential acquisitions, including execution risks, failure to realize anticipated transaction benefits, and failure to overcome integration risks, which could adversely affect our growth and profitability. 
 We have continued to grow our business both organically and through the acquisition of smaller banks that management believes strategically fit within our franchise and that we believe support our businesses and make financial and strategic sense. In the event that we continue to pursue further acquisitions, we may have difficulty executing on and may not realize the anticipated benefits of any transaction we complete. Any of the foregoing matters could materially and adversely affect us. 
 Generally, any acquisition of target financial institutions, branches, or other banking assets by us will require approval by, and cooperation from, a number of governmental regulatory agencies, possibly including the FRB and the FDIC as well as the IDFPR. Such regulators could deny our application, which would restrict our growth, or the regulatory approvals may not be granted on terms that are acceptable to us. 
 As to any acquisition that we complete, we may fail to realize some or all of the anticipated transaction benefits if the integration process takes longer or is more costly than expected or otherwise fails to meet our expectations. Depending on the condition of any institution or assets or liabilities that we may acquire, that acquisition may, at least in the near term, adversely affect our capital and earnings and, if not successfully integrated with our organization, may continue to have such effects over a longer period. Also, acquisitions may involve the payment of a premium over book and market values and, therefore, some dilution of our tangible book value and net income per common share may occur in connection with any future transaction. Our inability to overcome these risks could have a material adverse effect on our profitability, return on equity, return on assets, and our ability to implement our business strategy and enhance stockholder value, which, in turn, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations. 
 General Risk Factors 
 Loss of deposits could increase our funding costs. 
 We rely on customer deposits to meet a considerable portion of our funding needs, and we continue to seek customer deposits to maintain this funding base. We accept deposits directly from consumer and commercial customers and, as of December 31, 2022, we had 5.7 billion in deposits. These deposits are subject to potential fluctuations in availability or the price we must pay (in the form of interest) to obtain them due to certain factors outside our control, such as increasing competitive pressures from other financial services firms for deposits and changes in interest rates and returns on other investment classes, which could result in significant outflows of deposits within short periods of time or significant changes in pricing necessary to maintain current deposits or attract additional deposits. The loss of customer deposits for any reason could increase our funding costs. 
 We operate in a highly competitive and changing industry and market area and compete with both banks and non-banks. 
 We operate in the highly competitive financial services industry and face significant competition for customers from financial institutions located both within and beyond our principal markets. We compete with national commercial banks, regional banks, private banks, savings banks, credit unions, non-bank financial services companies, FinTech companies and other financial institutions operating within or near the areas we serve, many of whom are much larger and have significantly greater resources than us and that target the same customers we do in the Chicago metropolitan area. In order to compete, we may have to pay higher interest rates to attract deposits, accept lower yields to attract loans and pay higher wages for new employees, resulting in lower net interest margins and reduced profitability. As customer preferences and expectations continue to evolve, technology has lowered barriers to entry and made it possible for banks to expand their geographic reach by providing digital banking services and for non-banks to offer products and services traditionally provided by banks. The banking industry is experiencing rapid changes in technology, and, as a result, our future success will depend in part on our ability to address our customers needs by using technology. Many of our non-bank competitors are not subject to the same extensive regulations that govern our activities and, as a result, may have greater flexibility in competing for business. We also face increased competition in our U.S. government guaranteed lending business, which can adversely affect our volume and the premium, if any, recognized on sales of the guaranteed portions of such U.S. government guaranteed loans. Our inability 
 30 

to compete successfully in the markets in which we operate could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, or results of operations. 
 Our principal stockholder, MBG Investors I, L.P. has significant influence over us, and its interests could conflict with those of our other stockholders. 
 Currently, our principal stockholder, MBG Investors I, L.P., owns approximately 30.8 of the outstanding shares of our common stock and its general partner is one of our directors. As a result, MBG Investors I, L.P. is able to influence matters requiring approval by our stockholders, including the election of directors and the approval of mergers or other extraordinary transactions. MBG Investors I, L.P. may also have interests that differ from yours and may vote in a way with which you disagree and which may be adverse to your interests. The concentration of ownership may also have the effect of delaying, preventing, or deterring a change of control of the Company, could deprive our stockholders of an opportunity to receive a premium for their common stock as part of a private sale of their shares of the Company, subject us to the influence of a presently unknown third-party and might ultimately affect the market price of our common stock. 
 Future sales of our common stock in the public market, including by our pre-IPO stockholders, could lower our stock price. 
 The market price of our common stock could decline as a result of sales of a large number of shares of our common stock or from the perception that such sales could occur. These sales, or the possibility that these sales may occur, also may make it more difficult for us to raise additional capital by selling equity securities in the future, at a time and price that we deem appropriate. 
 Certain of our pre-IPO stockholders, including affiliates such as MBG Investors, I, L.P., hold restricted shares that could be sold in accordance with the volume, manner of sale, and other limitations under Rule 144 or through registration under the Securities Act. We cannot predict the size of future issuances or sales of our common stock by our pre-IPO stockholders or the effect, if any, that future issuances or sales of shares of our common stock may have on the market price of our common stock. Sales or distributions of substantial amounts of our common stock (including shares issued in connection with an acquisition), or the perception that such sales could occur, may cause the market price of our common stock to decline.

 Item 2. Pr operties . 
 Our corporate headquarters is located at 180 North LaSalle Street, Suite 300, Chicago, IL 60601. In addition to our corporate headquarters, we operate 37 branch offices located in the Chicago metropolitan area and one branch office in Brookfield, Wisconsin. We lease nine of our branch offices and our headquarters and own the remainder of our branch offices. We are continually evaluating opportunities to improve our existing branches and branch network, and we have in the recent past closed and may in the future choose to close branches in certain circumstances in order to improve our efficiency or for other business reasons. 
 Item 3. Legal Proceedings. 
 We operate in a highly regulated environment. From time to time we are a party to various litigation matters incidental to the conduct of our business. We are not presently a party to any legal proceedings the resolution of which we believe would have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, liquidity, results of operation, cash flows or capital levels.

PART II 
 Item 5. Market for Registrant s Common Equity, Related Stockholder Matters and Issuer Purchases of Equity Securities. 
 Our common stock is listed on the New York Stock Exchange (the NYSE under the symbol BY . There were approximately 953 holders of record of our common stock as of March 1, 2023. 
 The timing and amount of cash dividends paid on our common stock depends on our earnings, financial condition, capital requirements and other relevant factors. The primary sources for payment of dividends to our stockholders are dividends paid to the Company by Byline Bank and cash on hand. We are subject to state law limitations on the payment of dividends. Delaware law generally limits dividends if: (a) the corporation does not have a surplus; or (b) the corporation does not have net profits for the fiscal year in which the dividend is declared and/or the preceding fiscal year. We have an internal policy that prohibits the Board of Byline Bank from declaring and paying dividends that would cause the minimum capital amounts required for Byline Bank to be considered less than well capitalized for regulatory purposes. See Item 1. Business Supervision and Regulations Dividends above and Note 20 of notes to consolidated financial statements contained in Item 8 of this report. 
 We paid a cash dividend of 0.09 per share for each quarter of 2022. We paid a cash dividend of 0.06 per share for the first and second quarters of 2021 and a 0.09 per share cash dividend for the third and fourth quarter of 2021. 
 Issuer Purchases of Equity Securities. 
 On December 10, 2020, we announced that our Board of Directors approved a stock repurchase program authorizing the purchase of up to an aggregate of 1,250,000 shares of our outstanding common stock, and on July 27, 2021, our Board of Directors authorized an expansion of the stock repurchase program. Under the extended program, the Company was authorized to repurchase an additional 1,250,000 shares of the Company's outstanding common stock. The program was in effect until December 31, 2022. 
 We purchased 689,068 shares at a cost of 17.3 million under the stock repurchase program during the year ended December 31, 2022. We purchased 1,331,708 shares at a cost of 28.9 million under this program during the year ended December 31, 2021. 
 On December 12, 2022, we announced that our Board of Directors approved a new stock repurchase program authorizing the purchase of up to an aggregate of 1,250,000 shares of our outstanding common stock. The program will be in effect from January 1, 2023 until December 31, 2023 unless terminated earlier. The shares may, at the discretion of management, be repurchased from time to time in open market purchases as market conditions warrant or in privately negotiated transactions. We are not obligated to purchase any shares under the program, and the program may be discontinued at any time. The actual timing, number and share price of shares purchased under the repurchase program will be determined by us at our discretion and will depend on a number of factors, including the market price of our stock, general market and economic conditions and applicable legal requirements. The shares authorized to be repurchased represent approximately 3.3 of our outstanding common stock at December 31, 2022. 
 The table below includes information regarding purchases of our common stock during the quarter ended December 31, 2022. We did not purchase any shares of our common stock during the fourth quarter of 2022 under our stock repurchase program.

I tem 7. Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. 
 The following is a discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations and should be read in conjunction with our financial statements and notes thereto included in Item 8 of this report. In addition to historical information, this discussion contains forward looking statements that involve risks, uncertainties and assumptions that could cause actual results to differ materially from management s expectations. Factors that could cause such differences are discussed in the sections entitled Special Note Regarding Forward Looking Statements and Risk Factors . Byline assumes no obligation to update any of these forward looking statements. 
 Management s discussion focuses on 2022 results compared to 2021. For a discussion of 2021 results compared to 2020, refer to Part I, Item 7 of our 2021 Annual Report filed on Form 10-K , which was filed with the SEC on March 7, 2022. 
 Executive Summary 
 Our results of operations depend substantially on net interest income, which is the difference between interest income on interest-earning assets, consisting primarily of interest income on loans and lease receivables, including accretion income on loans, investment securities and other short-term investments, and interest expense on interest-bearing liabilities, consisting primarily of deposits and borrowings. Our results of operations are also dependent upon our generation of non-interest income, consisting primarily of income from fees and service charges on deposits, loan servicing revenue, wealth management and trust income, ATM and interchange fees, and net gains on sales of investment securities and loans. Other factors contributing to our results of operations include our provisions for credit losses, provision for income taxes, and non-interest expenses, such as salaries and employee benefits, occupancy and equipment expenses and other miscellaneous operating costs. 
 We reported consolidated net income of 88.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2022, compared to net income of 92.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2021, a decrease of 4.8 million. The decrease in net income was attributable to a 22.9 million increase in the provision for credit losses, and a 16.9 million decrease in non-interest income, offset by a 28.9 million increase in net interest income, a 1.4 million decrease in non-interest expense, and a 4.7 million decrease in provision for income taxes. The increase in provision for credit losses was mainly driven by increases in the general reserves as a result of growth in the loan and lease portfolio and the adoption of CECL. The decrease in non-interest income was primarily driven by decreases in gains on the sales of loans. The increase in net interest income during the year ended December 31, 2022 was primarily a result of an increase in average interest earning assets. The decrease in provision for income taxes was mostly driven by a decrease in net income before provision for income taxes during the period. 
 Dividends declared and paid on preferred shares were 196,000 and 783,000 for the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021. Dividends declared on common shares were 13.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2022. Dividends paid on common shares were 13.4 million and 11.3 million for the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021 respectively. For the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, net income available to common stockholders was 87.8 million, or 2.37 per basic and 2.34 per diluted common share, and 92.0 million, or 2.45 per basic and 2.40 per diluted common share, respectively. Our results of operations for the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, produced an annual return on average assets of 1.25 and 1.40 and a return on average stockholders equity of 11.33 and 11.31 , respectively. 
 Since our recapitalization in June 2013, our branch network has been reduced from 88 to 38, including 13 branches added through acquisition. During 2022 we consolidated six branches within our network with minimal impact on our customer service levels, convenience, and business development capabilities. 
 Critical accounting policies and estimates 
 Our accounting and reporting policies conform to GAAP and to general practices within the banking industry. To prepare financial statements and interim financial statements in conformity with GAAP, management makes estimates, assumptions and judgments based on available information. These estimates, assumptions and judgments affect the amounts reported in the financial statements and accompanying notes; and are based on information available as of the date of the financial statements. As this information changes, actual results could differ from the estimates, assumptions and judgments reflected in the financial statements. In particular, management has identified several accounting policies that, due to the estimates, assumptions and judgments inherent in those policies, are critical in understanding our financial statements. 
 These critical accounting policies and estimates include (i) the carrying value of loans and leases, (ii) determining the provision and allowance for credit losses, (iii) the valuation of intangible assets such as goodwill, servicing assets and core deposit intangibles, (iv) the determination of fair value for financial instruments, and (v) the valuation or recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities. 
 The following is a discussion of the critical accounting policies and significant estimates that require us to make complex and subjective judgments. Additional information about these policies can be found in Note 1 of our audited consolidated financial statements contained in Item 8 of this report. 
 Originated loans and leases 
 We account for originated loans and leases and purchased loans and leases not acquired through business combinations as originated loans and leases. Newly originated loans that management has the intent and ability to hold for the foreseeable future are reported at their outstanding principal balances net of any allowance for credit losses, unamortized deferred fees and costs and unamortized premiums or discounts. The net amount of nonrefundable loan origination fees and certain direct costs associated with the 
 34 

loan origination process are deferred and amortized to interest income over the contractual lives of the new loans using methods which approximate the level yield method. Discounts and premiums are amortized or accreted to interest income over the estimated term of the new loans using methods that approximate the effective yield method. Interest income on new loans is accrued based on the unpaid principal balance outstanding. Additionally, once an acquired loan reaches its contractual maturity date, it is re-underwritten, and if renewed, it is classified as an originated loan. 
 Purchased credit deteriorated loans and leases 
 Purchased credit deteriorated PCD loans have experienced more than insignificant credit deterioration since origination. PCD loans are recorded at the amount paid. An allowance for credit losses is determined using the same methodology as other loans held for investment. The initial allowance for credit losses determined on a collective basis is allocated to individual loans. The sum of the loan s purchase price and allowance for credit losses becomes its initial amortized cost basis. The difference between the initial amortized cost basis and the par value of the loan is a noncredit discount or premium, which is amortized into interest income over the life of the loan. Subsequent changes to the allowance for credit losses are recorded through credit loss expense. 
 Acquired non-credit-deteriorated loans and leases 
 For acquired non credit-deteriorated loans and leases, the difference between the fair value and unpaid principal balance of the loan at the acquisition date is amortized or accreted to interest income over the life of the loan. While credit discounts are included in the determination of the fair value for non-credit-deteriorated loans, since these discounts are expected to be accreted over the life of the loans, they cannot be used to offset the allowance for credit losses that must be recorded at the acquisition date. As a result, an allowance for credit losses is determined at the acquisition date using the same methodology as other loans held for investment and is recognized as a provision for credit losses in the consolidated statements of operations. Any subsequent deterioration (improvement) in credit quality is recognized by recording a provision (recapture) for credit losses. 
 Provision and allowance for credit losses 
 The provision for credit losses reflects the amount required to maintain the allowance for credit losses ACL at an appropriate level based upon management s evaluation of the adequacy of collectively and individually evaluated loss reserves. 
 The ACL is maintained at a level that management believes is appropriate to provide for current expected credit losses as of the dates of the Consolidated Statements of Financial Condition, and we have established methodologies for the determination of its adequacy. The methodologies are set forth in a formal policy and take into consideration relevant available information, from internal and external sources, relating to past events, current conditions, and reasonable and supportable forecasts. We increase our ACL by recording provisions for current expected credit losses against our income and decrease by charge offs, net of recoveries. 
 The evaluation is inherently subjective, as it requires estimates that are susceptible to significant revision as more information becomes available. While management uses available information to recognize losses on loans and leases, changes in economic or other conditions may necessitate revision of the estimate in future periods. 
 The ACL is maintained at a level management believes is sufficient to provide for current expected credit losses based upon an ongoing review of the loan and lease portfolios by portfolio category, which include consideration of actual loss experience, peer loss experience, changes in the size and risk profile of the portfolio, identification of individual problem loan and lease situations which may affect a borrower s ability to repay, reasonable and supportable forecasts, and evaluation of prevailing economic conditions. We use risk ratings as credit indicators to classify loans and leases into pools and to estimate loss rates for each of the loan and lease pools. Additional information about these policies can be found in Note 5 of our audited consolidated financial statements contained in Item 8 of this report. 
 For each portfolio, management estimates expected credit losses over the life of each loan and lease utilizing lifetime or cumulative loss rate methodology, which identifies macroeconomic factors and asset-specific characteristics that are correlated with credit loss experience including loan age, loan type, and leverage. The lifetime loss rate is applied to the amortized cost of the loan or lease. This methodology builds on default and loss probabilities by utilizing pool-specific historical loss rates to calculate expected credit losses. These pool-specific historical loss rates may be adjusted for a forecast of certain macroeconomic variables, and other factors such as differences in underwriting standards, or portfolio mix. Each time we measure expected credit losses, management assesses the relevancy of historical loss information and considers any necessary adjustments to address any differences in asset-specific characteristics. 
 The lifetime loss rates are estimated by analyzing a combination of internal and external data related to historical performance of each loan and lease pool over a complete economic cycle. Loss rates are based on historical averages for each loan and lease pool, adjusted to reflect the impact of a forward-looking forecast of certain macroeconomic variables such as unemployment rates, gross domestic product, or commercial property values, which management considers to be both reasonable and supportable. Various economic scenarios are considered and weighted to arrive at the forecast that most reflects management s expectation of future conditions. After a one-year forecast period, a one-year reversion period adjusts loss experience to the historical average on a straight-line basis. 
 35 

Management also considers qualitative risk factor adjustments that are intended to capture internal and external trends not reflected in historical loss history. Each risk factor is assigned an allowance level based on management s judgment as to the expected impact of each risk factor on each loan portfolio and is monitored quarterly. All acquired non-credit-deteriorated loans and leases and originated loans and leases of 500,000 or greater with an internal risk rating of substandard or below, or on nonaccrual, as well as loans classified as TDR, are reviewed individually for impairment on a quarterly basis. 
 The Company also maintains an allowance for credit losses on off-balance sheet credit exposures for unfunded loan commitments. This allowance is reflected as a component of other liabilities which represents management s current estimate of expected losses in the unfunded loan commitments. The estimate includes consideration of the likelihood that funding will occur and an estimate of expected credit losses on commitments expected to be funded over its estimated life based on management s consideration of past events, current conditions, and reasonable and supportable economic forecasts. Management tracks the level and trends in unused commitments and takes into consideration the same factors as those considered for purposes of the allowance for credit losses on outstanding loans. The Company also evaluates its held-to-maturity debt securities for current expected credit losses. Additional information about these policies can be found in Note 1 of our audited consolidated financial statements contained in Item 8 of this report. 
 Results for the year ended December 31, 2022 are presented under CECL methodology while prior period amounts continue to be reported in accordance with ASC Topic 450, Contingencies, and specific reserves based upon ASC Topic 310, Receivables. The ASC for impairment, ASC 310, is applied to commercial and consumer loans that are individually assessed for impairment. 
 Goodwill and intangible assets 
 Goodwill . Goodwill represents the excess of the purchase consideration over the fair value of net assets acquired in connection with our recapitalization and acquisitions using the acquisition method of accounting. Goodwill is not amortized but is periodically evaluated for impairment under the provisions of ASC Topic 350, Intangibles Goodwill and Other ASC 350 ). 
 Impairment testing is performed using either a qualitative or quantitative approach at the reporting unit level. Our goodwill is allocated to Byline Bank, which is our only applicable reporting unit for the purposes of testing goodwill for impairment. We have selected November 30 as the date to perform the annual goodwill impairment test. Additionally, we perform a goodwill impairment evaluation on an interim basis when events or circumstances indicate impairment potentially exists. 
 Servicing assets . Servicing assets are recognized separately when they are acquired through sales of loans or when the rights to service loans are purchased. When loans are sold with servicing rights retained, servicing assets are recorded at fair value in accordance with ASC Topic 860, Transfers and Servicing ASC 860 ). Fair value is based on market prices for comparable servicing contracts, when available, or alternatively, is based on a valuation model that calculates the present value of estimated future net servicing income. The fair value of servicing rights is highly sensitive to changes in underlying assumptions. Changes in the prepayment speed and discount rate assumptions have the most significant impact on the fair value of servicing rights. See Note 6 and Note 17 of the notes to our audited consolidated financial statements contained in Item 8 of this report for additional information. 
 Core deposit intangible assets . Other intangible assets primarily consist of core deposit intangible assets. In valuing core deposit intangibles, we consider variables such as deposit servicing costs, attrition rates and market discount rates. Core deposit intangibles are reviewed annually, or more frequently when events or changes in circumstances occur that indicate that their carrying values may not be recoverable. If the recoverable amount of the core deposit intangibles is determined to be less than its carrying value, we would then measure the amount of impairment based on an estimate of the fair value at that time. We also evaluate whether the events or circumstances have occurred that warrant a revision to the remaining useful lives of intangible assets. In cases where a revision is deemed appropriate, the remaining carrying amounts of the intangible assets are amortized over the revised remaining useful life. Core deposit intangibles are currently amortized over an approximate ten-year period. 
 Customer relationship intangible . Other intangible assets also include our customer relationship intangible asset. In valuing our customer relationship intangibles, we consider variables such as assets under administration, attrition rates, and fee structure. Customer relationship intangibles are currently amortized over a 12-year period. 
 Fair value of financial instruments 
 ASC Topic 820, Fair Value Measurement defines fair value as the price that would be received to sell a financial asset or paid to transfer a financial liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. 
 The degree of management judgment involved in determining the fair value of assets and liabilities is dependent upon the availability of quoted market prices or observable market parameters. For financial instruments that trade actively and have quoted market prices or observable market parameters, there is minimal subjectivity involved in measuring fair value. When observable market prices and parameters are not available, management judgment is necessary to estimate fair value. In addition, changes in market conditions may reduce the availability of quoted prices or observable data. For example, reduced liquidity in the capital markets or changes in secondary market activities could result in observable market inputs becoming unavailable. Therefore, when market data is not available, we would use valuation techniques requiring more management judgment to estimate the appropriate fair value measurement. 
 See Note 17 of the notes to our audited consolidated financial statements contained in Item 8 of this report for a complete discussion of our use of fair value of financial assets and liabilities and their related measurement practices.

Income taxes 
 We use the asset and liability method to account for income taxes. The objective of the asset and liability method is to establish deferred tax assets and liabilities for the temporary differences between the financial reporting basis and the income tax basis of our assets and liabilities at enacted tax rates expected to be in effect when such amounts are realized or settled. Our annual tax rate is based on our income, statutory tax rates and available tax planning opportunities. Tax laws are complex and subject to different interpretations by the taxpayer and respective governmental taxing authorities. Significant judgment is required in determining tax expense and in evaluating tax positions, including evaluating uncertainties. 
 Deferred income tax assets represent amounts available to reduce income taxes payable on taxable income in future years. Such assets arise because of temporary differences between the financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities, as well as from net operating loss carryforwards. We review our deferred tax positions quarterly for changes which may impact realizability. We evaluate the recoverability of these future tax deductions by assessing the adequacy of future expected taxable income from all sources, including reversal of taxable temporary differences, forecasted operating earnings and available tax planning strategies. We use short and long range business forecasts to provide additional information for its evaluation of the recoverability of deferred tax assets. It is our policy to recognize interest and penalties associated with uncertain tax positions, if applicable, as components of non interest expense. 
 A deferred tax valuation allowance is established to reduce the net carrying amount of deferred tax assets if it is determined to be more likely than not that all or some of the deferred tax asset will not be realized. See Note 11 of the notes to our audited consolidated financial statements contained in Item 8 of this report for further information on income taxes. 
 Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements 
 For a discussion of recent accounting pronouncements, including the effective dates of adoption and anticipated effects on our results of operations and finance as condition, see Note 2 of the notes to our audited consolidated financial statements contained in Item 8 of this report. 
 Primary Factors Used to Evaluate Our Business 
 As a financial institution, we manage and evaluate various aspects of both our results of operations and our financial condition. We evaluate the levels and trends of the line items included in our consolidated financial statements as well as various financial ratios that are commonly used in our industry. We analyze these ratios and financial trends against our own historical performance, our budgeted performance and the final condition and performance of comparable financial institutions in our region. Comparison of our financial performance against other financial institutions is impacted by the accounting for acquired non credit-deteriorated and purchased credit deteriorated loans.

GAAP Reconciliation and Management Explanation of Non-GAAP Financial Measures 
 Some of the financial measures included in the Selected Financial Data are not measures of financial performance in accordance with GAAP. Our management uses the non GAAP financial measures set forth below in its analysis of our performance. 
 Adjusted net income and adjusted diluted earnings per share exclude certain significant items, which include impairment charges on assets held for sale and right-of use asset ROU and merger-related expenses adjusted for applicable income tax. Management believes the significant items are not indicative of or useful to measure our operating performance on an ongoing basis. 

Net interest income, fully taxable-equivalent and net interest margin, fully taxable-equivalent are adjusted to reflect tax-exempt interest income on an equivalent before-tax basis using tax rates effective as of the end of the period. Management believes the metric provides useful comparable information to investors and that these measures may be useful for peer comparison. 

Adjusted non-interest expense is non-interest expense excluding certain significant items, which include impairment charges on assets held for sale and ROU asset and merger-related expenses. 

Adjusted efficiency ratio is adjusted non-interest expense less amortization of intangible assets divided by net interest income and non-interest income. Management believes the metric is an important measure of our operating performance on an ongoing basis. 

Adjusted non-interest expense to average assets is adjusted non-interest expense divided by average assets. Management believes the metric is an important measure of our operating performance on an ongoing basis. 

Adjusted return on average stockholders equity is adjusted net income divided by average stockholders equity. Management believes the metric is an important measure of our operating performance on an ongoing basis. 

Adjusted return on average assets is adjusted net income divided by average assets. Management believes the metric is an important measure of our operating performance on an ongoing basis. 

Non-interest income to total revenues is non-interest income divided by net interest income plus non-interest income. Management believes that it is standard practice in the industry to present non-interest income as a percentage of total revenue. Accordingly, management believes providing these measures may be useful for peer comparison. 

Pre tax pre provision net income is pre tax income plus the provision for credit losses. The metric demonstrates income excluding the tax provision or benefit and the provision for credit losses, and enables investors and others to assess our ability to generate capital to cover credit losses through a credit cycle. 

Adjusted pre-tax pre-provision net income is pre-tax pre-provision net income excluding certain significant items, which include impairment charges on assets held for sale and ROU asset and merger-related expenses. Management believes the metric is an important measure of our operating performance on an ongoing basis. 

Pre tax pre provision return on average assets is pre-tax income plus the provision for credit losses, divided by average assets. The ratio demonstrates profitability excluding the tax provision or benefit and excludes the provision for credit losses. 

Adjusted pre-tax pre-provision return on average assets excludes certain significant items, which include impairment charges on assets held for sale and ROU asset and merger-related expenses. 

Tangible common equity is defined as total stockholders equity reduced by preferred stock and goodwill and other intangible assets. Management does not consider servicing assets as an intangible asset for purposes of this calculation. 

Tangible assets is defined as total assets reduced by goodwill and other intangible assets. Management does not consider servicing assets as an intangible asset for purposes of this calculation. 

Net income, fully taxable-equivalent and net interest margin, fully taxable-equivalent are adjusted to reflect tax-exempt interest income on an equivalent before-tax basis using tax rates effective as of the end of the period. Management believes the metric provides useful comparable information to investors and that these measures may be useful for peer comparison. 

Total revenue is the combination of net interest income and non-interest income. Management believes the metric is an important measure of the Company's operating performance on an ongoing basis. 

Tangible book value per common share is calculated as tangible common equity, which is stockholders equity reduced by preferred stock and goodwill and other intangible assets, divided by total shares of common stock outstanding. 

39 

Management believes this metric is important due to the relative changes in the book value per share exclusive of changes in intangible assets. 

Tangible common equity to tangible assets is calculated as tangible common equity divided by tangible assets, which is total assets reduced by goodwill and other intangible assets. Management believes this metric is important to investors and analysts interested in relative changes in the ratio of total stockholders equity to total assets, each exclusive of changes in intangible assets. 

Tangible net income available to common stockholders is net income available to common stockholders excluding after-tax intangible asset amortization. 

Adjusted tangible net income available to common stockholders is tangible net income available to common stockholders excluding certain significant items. Management believes the metric is an important measure of our operating performance on an ongoing basis. 

Return on average tangible common stockholders equity is tangible net income available to common stockholders divided by average tangible common stockholders equity. Management believes the metric is an important measure of our operating performance on an ongoing basis. 

Adjusted return on average tangible common stockholders equity is adjusted tangible net income available to common stockholders divided by average tangible common stockholders equity. Management believes the metric is an important measure of our operating performance on an ongoing basis. 

We believe that these non GAAP financial measures provide useful information to its management and investors that is supplementary to our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows computed in accordance with GAAP; however, we acknowledge that our non GAAP financial measures have a number of limitations. As such, you should not view these disclosures as a substitute for results determined in accordance with GAAP financial measures that we and other companies use. Management also uses these measures for peer comparison.

Results of Operations 
 Net interest income 
 Net interest income, representing interest income less interest expense, is a significant contributor to our revenues and earnings. We generate interest income from interest and dividends on interest-earning assets, which include loans, leases and investment securities we own. We incur interest expense from interest paid on interest-bearing liabilities, which include interest-bearing deposits, subordinated notes, junior subordinated debentures and other borrowings. To evaluate net interest income, we measure and monitor (i) yields on our loans and other interest-earning assets, (ii) the costs of our deposits and other funding sources, (iii) our net interest spread and (iv) our net interest margin. Net interest spread is the difference between rates earned on interest-earning assets and rates paid on interest-bearing liabilities. Net interest margin is calculated as the net interest income divided by average interest-earning assets. Because non-interest-bearing sources of funds, such as non-interest-bearing deposits and stockholders equity, also fund interest-earning assets, net interest margin includes the benefit of these non-interest-bearing sources. 
 We also recognize income from the accretable discounts associated with the purchase of interest-earning assets. Because of our recapitalization and acquisitions, we derive a portion of our interest income from the accretable discounts on purchased credit deteriorated and acquired non-credit-deteriorated loans. The accretion is generally recognized over the life of the loan. As of December 31, 2022, purchased credit deteriorated loans accounted for under ASC Topic 326 represented 1.4 of our total loan portfolio, compared to 2.8 at December 31, 2021. 
 Changes in the market interest rates we earn on interest-earning assets or pay on interest-bearing liabilities, as well as the volume and types of interest-earning assets, interest-bearing and non-interest-bearing liabilities, are the largest drivers of periodic changes in net interest spread, net interest margin and net interest income. In addition, our interest income includes the accretion of the discounts on our purchased credit deteriorated and acquired non-credit-deteriorated loans, which will also affect our net interest spread, net interest margin and net interest income.

Increases and decreases in interest income and interest expense result from changes in average balances (volume) of interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities, as well as changes in average interest rates. The following tables set forth the effects of changing rates and volumes on our net interest income during the periods shown. Information is provided with respect to (i) effects on interest income attributable to changes in volume (changes in volume multiplied by prior rate) and (ii) effects on interest income attributable to changes in rate (changes in rate multiplied by prior volume). Changes applicable to both volume and rate have been allocated to volume. Yields have been calculated on a pre-tax basis. The tables below are a summary of the increases and decreases in interest income and interest expense resulting from changes in average balances (volume) and changes in average interest rates (dollars in thousands):

Net interest income for the year ended December 31, 2022 was 265.3 million, an increase of 28.9 million, or 12.2 compared to 2021. The increase in interest income of 52.5 million was principally a result of an increase in the average loan and lease portfolio balance and higher yields on loans and leases. The average balance of interest-earning assets was 6.6 billion for the year ended December 31, 2022, an increase of 481.6 million, or 7.8 , compared to 2021, primarily due to growth in our loan and lease portfolios. Interest expense increased by 23.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2022 compared to 2021, mostly due to increased rates paid on time deposits. Average total interest-bearing deposits increased 271.8 million, or 9.0 year over year. 
 Interest expense on borrowings for the year ended December 31, 2022 was 16.4 million compared to 8.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2021, an increase of 8.4 million, or 104.5 . This increase was primarily driven by increases in rates paid on borrowed funds. 
 The net interest margin for the year ended December 31, 2022 was 4.00 , an increase of 16 basis points compared to 3.84 for the year ended December 31, 2021. The average yield on interest-earning assets increased 49 basis points for the year ended December 31, 2022 compared to the year ended December 31, 2021, while the average rate paid on interest-bearing liabilities increased by 59 basis points, for a decrease in the interest rate spread of 10 basis points. 
 Provision for credit losses 
 The provision for credit losses represents a charge to earnings necessary to establish an allowance for credit losses that, in management s evaluation, is appropriate to provide coverage for current expected credit losses in the loan and lease portfolio. The allowance for credit losses is increased by the provision for credit losses and is decreased by charge-offs, net of recoveries on prior charge-offs. 
 Provisions for credit losses for the year ended December 31, 2022 were 23.9 million compared to 973,000 for the year ended December 31, 2021, an increase of 22.9 million. The increase reflects increased provisions related to loan and lease portfolio growth, qualitative adjustments to address economic uncertainty and to address the negative credit impact of increased interest rates based on portfolio classification, and migration of individually evaluated loans from the collectively evaluated portfolio. The ACL as a percentage of loans and leases increased from 1.21 at December 31, 2021 to 1.51 at December 31, 2022. 
 45 

Non-interest income 
 Non-interest income was 57.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2022, compared to 74.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2021, a decrease of 16.9 million or 22.8 . The decrease in non-interest income was mostly due to an decrease in net gains on sale of loans. 
 The following table presents the major components of our non-interest income for the periods indicated (dollars in thousands):

Fees and service charge on deposits was 8.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2022, compared to 7.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2021, an increase of 898,000 or 12.4 . The increase was a result of higher average balances of deposits. 
 Loan servicing revenue was 13.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2022, compared to 12.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2021, an increase of 786,000, or 6.2 . The increase was primarily driven by an increase in total loans serviced due to additional U.S. government guaranteed loans sold with retained servicing rights. At December 31, 2022 and 2021, the outstanding balances of U.S. government guaranteed loans serviced, was 1.7 billion. 
 Loan servicing asset revaluation represents net changes in the fair value of our servicing assets. Loan servicing asset revaluation had a downward adjustment of 11.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2022, compared to a downward adjustment of 6.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2021, an increase of 5.1 million, or 76.4 . The variance was primarily driven by the change in fair value of the servicing asset as a result of changes to valuation assumptions, including prepayment speeds, discount rates, and expected average loan life on U.S. government guaranteed loans based on the current interest rate environment. 
 Gains on sales of securities were 50,000 for the year ended December 31, 2022 compared to 1.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2021, a decrease of 1.4 million or 96.5 . The variance was due to sales volume and changing market conditions. We sold 23.2 million and 201.5 million of securities during the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. 
 Net gains on sales of loans were 31.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2022 compared to 46.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2021, a decrease of 14.4 million, or 31.1 . The decrease in net gains on sales was primarily driven by lower volume of government guaranteed loans sold and lower market premiums for government guaranteed loans. We sold 382.2 million and 392.6 million of U.S. government guaranteed loans during the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. 
 Wealth management and trust income represents fees charged to customers for investment, trust, or wealth management services and are primarily determined by total assets under administration. Wealth management and trust income was 3.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2022 compared to 3.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2021, an increase of 738,000 or 24.0 primarily due to an increase in non-recurring revenue. Assets under administration were 548.7 million and 663.4 million as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. 
 Other non-interest income was 7.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2022 compared to 5.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2021, an increase of 2.1 million or 35.8 . Customer derivative products fee income was 2.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2022 compared to 1.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2021, an increase of 1.2 million. Increase in cash surrender value of bank owned life insurance was 2.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2022 compared to 1.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2021, an increase of 582,000.

Non-interest expense 
 We reported non-interest expense for the year ended December 31, 2022 of 184.1 million compared to 185.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2021, a decrease of 1.4 million or 0.7 . The decrease was primarily due to decreases in impairment charges on assets held for sale, loan and lease related expenses, and occupancy expense, net. These were offset by increases in salaries and employee benefits.

 47 

Other non-interest expense for the year ended December 31, 2022 was 9.2 million compared to 10.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2021, a decrease of 873,000, or 8.7 . The decrease was primarily a result of decreased general expenses. 
 For the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021 , our efficiency ratio was 54.99 and 57.27 , respectively. The improvement in our efficiency ratio was primarily attributable to increased net interest income. For the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, our adjusted efficiency ratio was 54.70 and 51.98 , respectively. Please refer to the GAAP Reconciliation and Management Explanation of Non-GAAP Financial Measures included in Item 6 of this report, for more information on how our adjusted efficiency ratio is calculated. 
 Income Taxes 
 Income tax expense was 26.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2022, compared to 31.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2021. The decrease in income tax expense was primarily due to decreased income before provision for income taxes during 2022. 
 Our effective tax rate was 23.3 for the year ended December 31, 2022 and 25.3 for the year ended December 31, 2021. The decrease in our effective tax rate was primarily driven by a reduction in state income tax rate, net of federal benefit. We expect our effective tax rate for 2023 to be approximately 25 to 27 . 
 Financial Condition 
 Balance sheet analysis 
 Our total assets increased by 666.8 million, or 10.0 , to 7.4 billion at December 31, 2022, compared to 6.7 billion at December 31, 2021. The increase in total assets includes an increase of 884.1 million, or 19.5 , in loans and leases from 4.5 billion at December 31, 2021 to 5.4 billion at December 31, 2022. Our originated loan and lease portfolio increased by 1.0 billion and our purchased credit deteriorated and acquired non-credit-deteriorated loan and lease portfolio decreased by 152.3 million. The increase in our originated portfolio was mostly attributed to organic loan and lease growth. The decrease in our acquired portfolio was due to renewals reflected in originated loans, payoffs and pay downs during the year. 
 Total liabilities increased by 737.3 million, or 12.6 , to 6.6 billion at December 31, 2022 compared to 5.9 billion at December 31, 2021. The increase is a result of an increase in total deposits of 540.1 million, or 10.5 , primarily attributed growth in interest bearing deposits. 
 Investment portfolio 
 Our investment securities portfolio consists of securities classified as equity and other securities, at fair value, available-for-sale, and held-to-maturity. There were no securities classified as trading in our investment portfolio as of or for the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021. All available-for sale securities are carried at fair value and may be used for liquidity purposes should management consider it to be in our best interest. Securities available-for-sale consist primarily of residential mortgage-backed securities, commercial mortgage-backed securities and U.S. government agencies securities. 
 Securities available-for-sale decreased 280.1 million, or 19.3 , from 1.5 billion at December 31, 2021 to 1.2 billion at December 31, 2022, primarily due to decreases in the in fair value of securities. 
 48 

Our held-to-maturity securities portfolio consists of municipal securities. We carry these securities at amortized cost. Securities held-to-maturity were 2.7 million and 3.9 million at December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. 
 The fair value of our equity and other securities portfolio was 8.0 million at December 31, 2022, and 10.6 million at December 31, 2021.

Certain securities have fair values less than amortized cost and, therefore, contain unrealized losses. At December 31, 2022, we evaluated the securities which had an unrealized loss for credit losses and determined there were none. There were 280 investment securities with unrealized losses at December 31, 2022. We anticipate full recovery of amortized cost with respect to these securities by maturity, or sooner in the event of a more favorable market interest rate environment. We do not intend to sell these securities and it is not more likely than not that we will be required to sell them before recovery of their amortized cost basis, which may be at maturity. 
 The following table (dollars in thousands) set forth certain information regarding contractual maturities and the weighted average yields of our debt securities as of December 31, 2022.

As of December 31, 2022 and 2021, investment securities indexed to LIBOR were 43.5 million and 58.2 million, respectively. 
 Total non-taxable securities classified as obligations of states, municipalities and political subdivisions were 43.8 million at December 31, 2022, a decrease of 17.8 million from December 31, 2021. 
 There were no holdings of securities of any one issuer, other than U.S. government-sponsored entities and agencies, with total outstanding balances greater than 10 of our stockholders equity as of December 31, 2022 and 2021. 
 Restricted stock 
 As a member of the Federal Home Loan Bank system, Byline Bank is required to maintain an investment in the capital stock of the FHLB. No market exists for this stock, and it has no quoted market value. The stock is redeemable at par by the FHLB and is, therefore, carried at cost. In addition, Byline Bank owns stock of Bankers Bank, which is redeemable at par and carried at cost. As of December 31, 2022 and 2021, we held 28.2 million and 22.0 million, respectively, in FHLB and Bankers Bank stock. We evaluate impairment of our investment in FHLB and Bankers Bank based on the ultimate recoverability of the par value rather than by recognizing temporary declines in value. We did not identify any indicators of impairment of FHLB and Bankers Bank stock as of December 31, 2022 and 2021. 
 Loan and lease portfolio 
 Lending-related income is the most important component of our net interest income and is the main driver of the results of our operations. Total loans and leases at December 31, 2022 and 2021 were 5.4 billion and 4.5 billion, respectively, an increase of 884.1 million or 19.5 . The growth in the originated loan and lease portfolio was primarily driven by increases in commercial and industrial loans and leases, commercial real estate, and leasing financing receivables. Purchased credit deteriorated loans and acquired non-credit-deteriorated loans and leases were 290.5 million at December 31, 2022 a decrease of 152.3 million or 34.4 , compared to 442.8 million at December 31, 2021. The decrease in the purchased credit deteriorated and acquired non-credit-deteriorated loan and lease portfolio was driven by renewals that are reflected within originated loans, payoffs, and maturities during the period.

We strive to maintain a relatively diversified loan and lease portfolio to help reduce the risk inherent in concentration in certain types of collateral. Our exposure to certain industries as of December 31, 2022 represents the following percentages of the portfolio: 35.9 real estate, 14.3 manufacturing, 7.4 wholesale trade, 6.8 finance and insurance, 6.1 retail trade, and all other industries represent less than 5 of the portfolio or 29.4 of the total loan and lease portfolio. As of December 31, 2022, the loan portfolio included 420.8 million of unguaranteed SBA 7(a) and USDA loans with exposure to the following top three industries: 16.5 retail trade, 14.1 accommodation and food services and 12.0 manufacturing. The following table shows our allocation of originated, purchased credit deteriorated, and acquired non-credit-deteriorated loans and leases as of the dates presented (dollars in thousands):

As of December 31, 2022, 45.2 of the loan and lease portfolio bears interest at fixed rates and 54.8 at floating rates. In addition, 2.1 billion, or 37.7 , of the loan and lease portfolio had interest rate floors. The expected life of our loan portfolio will differ from contractual maturities because borrowers may have the right to curtail or prepay their loans with or without penalties. Because a portion of the portfolio is accounted for under ASC 326, the carrying value is significantly affected by estimates and it is impracticable to allocate scheduled payments for those loans based on those estimates. Consequently, the tables presented include information limited to contractual maturities of the underlying loans. As of December 31, 2022, we had 731.2 million in loans indexed to LIBOR and 925.3 million in loans indexed to SOFR.

Allowance for credit losses - loans and leases 
 The ACL is determined by us on a quarterly basis, although we are engaged in monitoring the appropriate level of the allowance on a more frequent basis. The ACL reflects management s estimate of current expected credit losses inherent in the loan and lease portfolios. The computation includes elements of judgment and high levels of subjectivity. 
 Factors considered by us include, but are not limited to, actual loss experience, peer loss experience, changes in size and risk profile of the portfolio, identification of individual problem loan and lease situations that may affect a borrower s ability to repay, application of a reasonable and supportable forecast, and evaluation of the prevailing economic conditions. Changes in conditions may necessitate revision of the estimate in future periods. 
 We assess the ACL based on three categories: (i) originated loans and leases, (ii) acquired non-credit-deteriorated loans and leases, and (iii) purchased credit deteriorated loans. 
 Total ACL was 81.9 million at December 31, 2022 compared to 55.0 million at December 31, 2021, an increase of 26.9 million, or 48.9 . The increase was primarily due to a 12.2 million increase for the CECL adoption cumulative adjustment and increases in the general reserve driven by qualitative adjustments addressing economic uncertainty. Total ACL to total loans and leases held for investment, net before ACL was 1.51 and 1.21 of total loans and leases at December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. As of December 31, 2022, approximately 37.1 million of the ACL was allocated to unguaranteed loans.

 Non-performing assets 
 Non-performing loans and leases include loans and leases 90 days past due and still accruing and loans and leases accounted for on a non-accrual basis. Non-performing assets consist of non-performing loans and leases plus other real estate owned. Non-accrual loans and leases as December 31, 2022 and 2021 totaled 36.0 million and 23.1 million, respectively. Non-performing assets consisted of 2.2 million and 3.3 million of U.S. government guaranteed balances at December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. 
 Total OREO increased from 2.1 million as of December 31, 2021 to 4.7 million at December 31, 2022. The 2.6 million increase in OREO resulted primarily from transfers into OREO. 
 The following table sets forth the amounts of non-performing loans and leases, non-performing assets, and OREO at the dates indicated (dollars in thousands):

Prior to the implementation of ASC 326 on January 1, 2022, loans acquired with deteriorated credit quality in merger transactions were accounted for as purchased credit impaired PCI ). Subsequent to acquisition, PCI loans were not reported as non-performing loans based upon their individual performance status, so the loan categories of non-accrual, 90 days past due and still accruing, and impaired did not include any PCI loans. 
 Total non-accrual loans increased by 12.9 million between December 31, 2022 and 2021 primarily due to increases in non-accrual commercial real estate and commercial and industrial loans. 
 Total accruing loans past due decreased from 34.1 million at December 31, 2021 to 15.4 million at December 31, 2022, a decrease of 18.7 million, and can be primarily attributed to decreases in residential real estate and construction, land development, and other land loans. See Note 5 of the notes to our audited consolidated financial statements contained in Item 8 of this report for further information.

Deposits 
 We gather deposits primarily through each of our 37 branch locations in the Chicago metropolitan area and one branch in Brookfield, Wisconsin. Through our branch network, online, mobile and other banking channels, we offer a variety of deposit products including demand deposit accounts, interest-bearing products, savings accounts, and certificates of deposit. Small businesses are a significant source of low cost deposits as they value convenience, flexibility and access to local decision makers that are responsive to their needs. 
 Total deposits at December 31, 2022 were 5.7 billion, representing an increase of 540.1 million, or 10.5 , compared to 5.2 billion at December 31, 2021. Non-interest-bearing deposits were 2.1 billion, or 37.6 of total deposits, at December 31, 2022, a decrease of 19.8 million, or 0.9 , compared to 2.2 billion at December 31, 2021, or 41.9 of total deposits. Core deposits were 92.7 and 91.9 of total deposits at December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively.

Our average cost of deposits was 36 basis points during the year ended December 31, 2022 compared to nine basis points during the year ended December 31, 2021. This increase was primarily attributed to higher rates on interest-bearing deposits as a result of the interest rate environment. 
 There were 251.5 million of brokered deposits included in Time deposits of below 250,000 at December 31, 2022. There were no brokered deposits included in time deposits at December 31, 2021.

 Borrowed funds 
 At December 31, 2022, fixed-rate advances totaled 225.0 million, with interest rates ranging from 4.38 to 4.66 and maturities ranging from February 2022 to March 2023. Total variable rate advances were 400.0 million at December 31, 2022, with interest rates ranging from 4.23 to 4.33 that may reset daily, and mature in February 2023. The Company s advances from the FHLB are collateralized by residential real estate loans, commercial real estate loans, and securities. The Company s required investment in FHLB stock is 4.50 for every 100 in advances. Refer to Note 3 Securities for additional discussion. subject to the availability of proper collateral. The Bank s maximum borrowing capacity is limited to 35 of total assets. 
 In addition to deposits, we also utilize FHLB advances as a supplementary funding source to finance our operations. The Bank s advances from the FHLB are collateralized by residential and multi-family real estate loans and securities. At December 31, 2022 and 2021, we had maximum borrowing capacity from the FHLB of 1.9 billion and 1.8 billion, respectively, subject to the availability of collateral. At December 31, 2022, we had outstanding FHLB advances of 625.0 million with maturities through March 2023. 
 61 

We have the capacity to borrow funds from the discount window of the FRB. We did not utilize the discount window during 2022 and there were no borrowings outstanding under the FRB discount window line as of December 31, 2022. We pledge loans as collateral for any borrowings under the FRB discount window. 
 During 2020, we issued 75.0 million in fixed-to-floating subordinated notes that mature on July 1, 2030. The subordinated notes bear a fixed interest rate of 6.00 until July 1, 2025 and a floating interest rate equal to a benchmark rate, which is expected to be three-month Secured Overnight Financing Rate plus 588 basis points thereafter until maturity. The transaction resulted in debt issuance costs of approximately 1.7 million that are being amortized over 10 years.

(1) We amended our existing revolving credit agreement with a correspondent lender in October 2022, which extended the maturity date to October, 2023. The amended revolving line of credit bears interest at either the SOFR Rate plus 195 basis points or the Prime Rate minus 75 basis points, based on our election, which is required to be communicate to the lender at least three business days prior to the commencement of an interest period. If we fail to provide timely notification, the interest rate will be Prime Rate minus 75 basis points. See Liquidity below for further information regarding the revolving line of credit. 

Customer repurchase agreements (sweeps) 
 Securities sold under agreements to repurchase represent a demand deposit product offered to customers that sweep balances in excess of the FDIC insurance limit into overnight repurchase agreements. We pledge securities as collateral for the repurchase agreements. Securities sold under agreements to repurchase were 15.4 million at December 31, 2022, compared to 29.7 million at December 31, 2021 a decrease of 14.3 million. 
 Liquidity 
 We manage liquidity based upon factors that include the amount of core deposits as a percentage of total deposits, the level of diversification of our funding sources, the amount of non-deposit funding used to fund assets, the availability of unused funding sources, off-balance sheet obligations, the availability of assets readily converted into cash without undue loss, the amount of cash and liquid securities we hold and the re-pricing characteristics and maturities of our assets when compared to the re-pricing characteristics of our liabilities, the ability to securitize and sell certain pools of assets and other factors. 
 62 

Our liquidity needs are primarily met by cash and investment securities positions, growth in deposits, cash flow from amortizing loan portfolios, and borrowings from the FHLB. For additional information regarding our operating, investing, and financing cash flows, see Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows in our audited consolidated financial statements contained in Item 8 of this report. 
 As of December 31, 2022, Byline Bank had maximum borrowing capacity from the FHLB of 2.5 billion and 804.6 million from the FRB. As of December 31, 2022, Byline Bank had open advances from the FHLB of 625.0 million and open letters of credit of 13.5 million, providing available aggregate borrowing capacity of 1.0 billion. In addition, Byline Bank had an uncommitted federal funds line available of 135.0 million and 804.6 million available under the FRB discount window line at December 31, 2022. 
 As of December 31, 2021, Byline Bank had maximum borrowing capacity from the FHLB of 2.3 billion and 603.0 million from the FRB. As of December 31, 2020, Byline Bank had open advances from the FHLB of 490.0 million and open letters of credit of 19.7 million, providing available aggregate borrowing capacity of 715.4 million. In addition, Byline Bank had an uncommitted federal funds line available of 115.0 million and 625.4 million available under the FRB discount window line at December 31, 2021. 
 The Company is currently party to a revolving credit agreement with a correspondent bank with availability of up to 15.0 million that matures on October 6, 2023. The revolving line of credit bears interest at either SOFR plus 195 basis points or the Prime Rate minus 75 basis points, not to be less than 2.00 , based on the Company s election, which is required to be communicated at least three business days prior to the commencement of an interest period. If the Company fails to provide timely notification, the interest rate will be Prime Rate minus 75 basis points. At December 31, 2022 and December 31, 2021, the line of credit had no outstanding balance. 
 There are regulatory limitations that affect the ability of Byline Bank to pay dividends to the Company. See Note 20 of the notes to our audited consolidated financial statements contained in Item 8 of this report for additional information. Management believes that such limitations will not impact our ability to meet our ongoing short-term cash obligations. 
 At December 31, 2022, we had outstanding commitments to extend credit of 1.6 billion, primarily related to unused credit lines and 15.5 million of commitments under operating lease agreements. For additional information regarding future financial commitments, see Notes 9 and 16 of the notes to our audited consolidated financial statements contained in Item 8 of this report for additional information. 
 We expect that our cash and liquidity resources will be generated by the operations of Byline Bank, which we expect to be sufficient to satisfy our liquidity and capital requirements for at least the next 12 months. 
 Capital resources 
 Stockholders equity at December 31, 2022 was 765.8 million compared to 836.4 million at December 31, 2021, a decrease of 70.6 million, or 8.4 . The decrease was primarily driven by increases in accumulated other comprehensive loss reflecting increases in the unrealized losses in our available-for-sale securities portfolio. 
 The Company and Byline Bank are subject to various regulatory capital requirements administered by federal banking regulators. Failure to meet minimum capital requirements can initiate certain mandatory and possibly additional discretionary actions by federal banking regulators that, if undertaken, could have a direct material effect on our financial statements. 
 Under applicable bank regulatory capital requirements, each of the Company and Byline Bank must meet specific capital guidelines that involve quantitative measures of their assets, liabilities and certain off-balance sheet items as calculated under regulatory accounting practices. Byline Bank must also meet certain specific capital guidelines under the prompt corrective action framework. The capital amounts and classification are subject to qualitative judgments by the federal banking regulators about components, risk weightings and other factors. Quantitative measures established by regulation to ensure capital adequacy require the Company and Byline Bank to maintain minimum amounts and ratios of CET1 capital, Tier 1 capital and total capital to risk-weighted assets and Tier 1 capital to average consolidated assets, (referred to as the leverage ratio ), as defined under these capital requirements. For further information, see Item 1. Business Supervision and Regulation Regulatory Capital Requirements , Business Supervision and Regulation Prompt Corrective Action Framework and Note 20 of the notes to our audited consolidated financial statements contained in Item 8 of this report for additional information. 
 As of December 31, 2022, Byline Bank exceeded all applicable regulatory capital requirements and was considered well-capitalized . There have been no conditions or events since December 31, 2022 that management believes have changed Byline Bank s classifications. 
 On December 10, 2020, the Company announced that its Board of Directors approved a stock repurchase program authorizing the purchase of up to an aggregate of 1,250,000 shares of the Company s outstanding common stock, and on July 27, 2021, the Company's Board of Directors authorized an expansion of the stock repurchase program. Under the extended program, the Company was authorized to repurchase an additional 1,250,000 shares of the Company's outstanding common stock. The program was effective until and expired on December 31, 2022. 
 On December 12, 2022, the Company announced that its Board of Directors approved a new stock repurchase program authorizing the purchase of up to an aggregate of 1,250,000 shares of the Company s outstanding common stock. The new program is effective from January 1, 2023 until December 31, 2023, unless terminated earlier. The shares may, at the discretion of management, be repurchased from time to time in open market purchases as market conditions warrant or in privately negotiated transactions. The Company is not obligated to purchase any shares under the program, and the program may be discontinued at any time. The actual timing, number and share price of shares purchased under the repurchase program will be determined by the Company at its discretion 
 63 

and will depend on a number of factors, including the market price of the Company s stock, general market and economic conditions and applicable legal requirements. The shares authorized to be repurchased represent approximately 3.3 of the Company s outstanding common stock at December 31, 2022. 
 Off-balance sheet items and other financing arrangements 
 We are a party to financial instruments with off-balance sheet risk in the normal course of business to meet the financing needs of our customers. These financial instruments include commitments to extend credit, commercial letters of credit and standby letters of credit. Those instruments involve, to varying degrees, elements of credit and interest rate risk in excess of the amount recognized in the Consolidated Statements of Financial Condition. The contractual or notional amounts of those instruments reflect the extent of involvement we have in particular classes of financial instruments. 
 Commitments to extend credit are agreements to lend to a customer as long as there is no violation of any condition established in the contract. Commitments generally have fixed expiration dates or other termination clauses and may require payment of a fee. Since many of the commitments are expected to expire without being drawn upon, the total commitment amount does not necessarily represent future cash requirements. We evaluate each customer s creditworthiness on a case-by-case basis. The amount of collateral obtained, if deemed necessary by Byline Bank upon extension of credit, is based on management s credit evaluation of the counterparty. Collateral is primarily obtained in the form of commercial and residential real estate (including income producing commercial properties). 
 Letters of credit are conditional commitments issued by Byline Bank to guarantee the performance of a customer to a third-party. Those guarantees are primarily issued to support public and private borrowing arrangements, bond financing and similar transactions. The credit risk involved in issuing letters of credit is essentially the same as that involved in extending loan facilities to customers. 
 Commitments to make loans are generally made for periods of 90 days or less. The fixed rate loan commitments have interest rates ranging from 1.00 to 18.00 and maturities up to 2050. Variable rate loan commitments have interest rates ranging from 1.75 to 11.50 and maturities up to 2048. 
 Our exposure to credit loss in the event of non-performance by the other party to the financial instrument for commitments to extend credit and standby letters of credit is represented by the contractual or notional amount of those instruments. We use the same credit policies in making commitments and conditional obligations as for funded instruments. We do not anticipate any material losses as a result of the commitments and standby letters of credit. 
 We enter into interest rate swaps that are used to manage differences in the amount, timing, and duration of our known or expected cash receipts and its known or expected cash payments principally related to certain variable rate borrowings. We also enter into interest rate derivatives with certain qualified borrowers to facilitate the borrowers risk management strategies and concurrently entered into mirror-image derivatives with a third party counterparty. 
 We recognize derivative financial instruments at fair value regardless of the purpose or intent for holding the instrument. We record derivative assets and derivative liabilities on the Consolidated Statements of Financial Condition within other assets and other liabilities, respectively. See Note 21 of the notes to our audited consolidated financial statements contained in Item 8 of this report for additional information. Because the derivative assets and liabilities recorded on the balance sheet at December 31, 2022 do not represent the amounts that may ultimately be paid under these contracts, these assets and liabilities are listed in the table below (dollars in thousands):

Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitati ve Disclosures About Market Risk. 
 
 Our primary market risk is interest rate risk, which is defined as the risk of loss of net interest income or net interest margin because of changes in interest rates. 
 We seek to measure and manage the potential impact of interest rate risk. Interest rate risk occurs when interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities mature or re-price at different times, on a different basis or in unequal amounts. Interest rate risk also arises when our assets, liabilities and off-balance sheet contracts each respond differently to changes in interest rates, including as a result of explicit and implicit provisions in agreements related to such assets and liabilities and in off-balance sheet contracts that alter the applicable interest rate and cash flow characteristics as interest rates change. 
 We are also exposed to interest rate risk through the retained portion of the U.S. government guaranteed loans we make and the related servicing rights. Our U.S. government guaranteed loan portfolio is comprised primarily of SBA 7(a) loans, virtually all of which are quarterly or monthly adjustable with the prime rate. The SBA portfolio reacts differently in a rising rate environment than our other non-guaranteed portfolios. Generally, when interest rates rise, the prepayments in the SBA portfolio tend to increase. 
 Our management of interest rate risk is overseen by our Board of Directors and management asset liability committees based on a risk management infrastructure approved by our Board of Directors that outlines reporting and measurement requirements. Our risk management infrastructure also requires a periodic review of all key assumptions used, such as identifying appropriate interest rate scenarios, setting loan prepayment rates based on historical analysis, non-interest-bearing and interest-bearing demand deposit lives based on historical analysis and the targeted investment term of capital. The committees closely monitor our interest sensitivity exposure, asset and liability allocation decisions, liquidity and capital positions, and local and national economic conditions and attempts to structure the loan and investment portfolios and funding sources to maximize earnings within acceptable risk tolerances. 
 We manage the interest rate risk associated with our interest-bearing liabilities by managing the interest rates and tenors associated with our borrowings from the FHLB, and deposits from our customers that we rely on for funding. We manage the interest rate risk associated with our interest-earning assets by managing the interest rates and tenors associated with our investment and loan portfolios, from time to time purchasing and selling investment securities. 
 We utilize interest rate derivatives to hedge our interest rate exposure on commercial loans when it meets our customers and Byline Bank s needs. As of December 31, 2022, we had a notional amount of 1.1 billion of interest rate derivatives outstanding that includes customer swaps and those on Byline Bank s balance sheet. The overall effectiveness of our hedging strategies is subject to market conditions, the quality of our execution, the accuracy of our valuation assumptions, the associated counterparty credit risk and changes in interest rates. 
 We do not engage in speculative trading activities relating to interest rates, foreign exchange rates, commodity prices, equities or credit. 
 
 Evaluation of Interest Rate Risk 
 
 We use a net interest income simulation model to measure and evaluate potential changes in our net interest income. We run various hypothetical interest rate scenarios at least quarterly and compare these results against a scenario with no changes in interest rates. Our net interest income simulation model incorporates various assumptions, which we believe are reasonable but which may have a significant impact on results such as: (1) the timing of changes in interest rates, (2) shifts or rotations in the yield curve, (3) re-pricing characteristics for market-rate-sensitive instruments on and off balance sheet, (4) differing sensitivities of financial instruments due to differing underlying rate indices, (5) the effect of interest rate limitations in our assets, such as floors and caps, (6) the effect of our interest rate swaps and (7) overall growth and repayment rates and product mix of assets and liabilities. Because of limitations inherent in any approach used to measure interest rate risk, simulation results are not intended as a forecast of the actual effect of a change in market interest rates on our results but rather as a means to better plan and execute appropriate asset-liability management strategies and manage our interest rate risk. 
 Potential changes to our net interest income in hypothetical rising and declining rate scenarios calculated as of December 31, 2022 is presented below. For the dynamic balance sheet and rate shift scenarios, we assume interest rates follow a forward yield curve and then increase it by 1/12th of the total change in rates each month for 12 months.

For dynamic balance sheet and rate shifts, a gradual shift downward of 100 basis points would result in a 2.9 decrease to net interest income, and a gradual shift upwards of 100 and 200 basis points would result in 3.5 and 7.1 increases to net interest income, respectively, over the next 12 months. 
 The Bank's aggregate interest rate risk exposure is monitored and managed based on the economic outlook and under guidance of board-approved policy limits. The results of this simulation analysis are hypothetical, and a variety of factors might cause actual results to differ substantially from what is depicted including the timing, magnitude, and frequency of interest rate changes as well as changes in market conditions and management strategies.

Report of Independe nt Registered Public Accounting Firm 
 
 To the Stockholders and the Board of Directors of 
 Byline Bancorp, Inc. and Subsidiaries 
 
 Opinions on the Financial Statements and Internal Control over Financial Reporting 
 We have audited the accompanying consolidated statements of financial condition of Byline Bancorp, Inc. and Subsidiaries (the Company as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, the related consolidated statements of operations, comprehensive income (loss), changes in stockholders equity, and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2022, and the related notes (collectively referred to as the consolidated financial statements). We also have audited the Company s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2022, based on criteria established in Internal Control Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO). 
 In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the consolidated financial position of the Company as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, and the consolidated results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2022, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. Also in our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2022, based on criteria established in Internal Control Integrated Framework (2013) issued by COSO. 
 Change in Accounting Principle 
 As discussed in Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company changed its method of accounting for credit losses effective January 1, 2022, due to the adoption of Accounting Standards Codification Topic 326: Financial Instruments Credit Losses Topic 326 ). The Company adopted the new credit loss standard using the modified retrospective approach such that prior period amounts are not adjusted and continue to be reported in accordance with previously applicable generally accepted accounting principles. 
 Basis for Opinions 
 The Company s management is responsible for these consolidated financial statements, for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting, and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in the accompanying Management Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company s consolidated financial statements and an opinion on the Company s internal control over financial reporting based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. 
 We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audits to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud, and whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. 
 Our audits of the consolidated financial statements included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures to respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the consolidated financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the consolidated financial statements. Our audit of internal control over financial reporting included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk. Our audits also included performing such other 
 68 

procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinions. 
 Definition and Limitations of Internal Control Over Financial Reporting 
 A company s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements. 
 Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. 
 Critical Audit Matter 
 The critical audit matter communicated below is a matter arising from the current period audit of the consolidated financial statements that was communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that (1) relates to accounts or disclosures that are material to the consolidated financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion on the consolidated financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matter below, providing a separate opinion on the critical audit matter or on the accounts or disclosures to which it relates. 
 
 Allowance for Credit Losses for Loans and Leases Adoption, Identifying Loans to be Individually Evaluated, Loan Risk Ratings, Reasonable and Supportable Forecasts and Qualitative Factors 
 As described in Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company adopted Accounting Standards Update No. 2016-13, Accounting Standards Codification Topic 326, Financial Instruments Credit Losses (Topic 326), as of January 1, 2022, using the modified retrospective method of adoption. Topic 326 requires the measurement of the current expected credit losses CECL for financial assets, including the Company s loan and lease portfolio, held at the reporting date. Accordingly, upon adoption the Company recorded a decrease to retained earnings of 10,097,000, net of taxes, as of January 1, 2022, for the cumulative effect of adopting Topic 326. As further discussed in Note 5, the Company s allowance for credit losses for loans and leases was 81,924,000 as of December 31, 2022, and consists of both a historical credit loss experience component and management s estimates of current conditions and reasonable and supportable forecasts. The Company s allowance for credit losses for loans and leases is a valuation account that is deducted from the amortized cost basis of loans and leases to present the net carrying value at the amount expected to be collected on such loans and leases and is a material and complex estimate requiring significant management judgment in the estimation of expected lifetime losses within the loan and lease portfolio at both the date of adoption and the balance sheet date. 
 We identified management s adoption of Topic 326, risk rating of loans, identifying loans to be individually evaluated, and the reasonable and supportable forecasts, including the estimate of qualitative risk factor adjustments that are intended to capture internal and external trends not reflected in historical loss history, and the selection of the methodology and economic variables and forecast scenarios utilized, as a critical audit matter. In estimating the allowance for credit losses on loans and leases, the Company utilizes relevant information from internal and external sources relating to past events, current conditions, and reasonable and supportable forecasts. The Company considers loan-specific risk characteristics for each loan and lease segment, identifies loans to be individually evaluated, and estimates losses for each loan and lease cohort based upon their nature, historical experience, and risk profile. This process requires significant management 
 69 

judgment in the review of the loan and lease portfolio and identification of individually evaluated loans based upon the characteristics of loans and leases. In addition, estimation of the lifetime expected credit losses for loans and leases requires significant management judgment, particularly as it relates to forward-looking information through the use of qualitative risk factors and peer data applied over the forecasted life of the loans and leases. Auditing these complex judgments and assumptions involves especially challenging auditor judgment due to the nature and extent of audit evidence and effort required to address these matters. 
 The primary procedures we performed to address this critical audit matter included: 
 Testing the design, implementation and operating effectiveness of controls relating to management s adoption of Topic 326 and the calculation of the allowance for credit losses for loans and leases, including controls over the review of loans and leases and identification of individually evaluated loans, evaluation of the qualitative and forecast factors, model development and validation, selection and application of new accounting policies, and disclosures. 

Evaluating the appropriateness of the Company s assumptions and elections involved in the adoption of the CECL methodology, including the cohort methodology selected by the Company compared to other available methodologies as well as the economic variables selected based on the correlation to historical charge-offs, and the forecasting assumptions used in the reasonable and supportable forecast adjustment. 

Evaluating the appropriateness of the Company s loan and lease risk rating policy and testing a risk-based targeted selection of loans and leases to gain substantive evidence that the Company is appropriately classifying loans and identifying loans to be individually evaluated in accordance with its policies, and that the allowance for credit losses on those loans and leases is reasonable. 

Evaluating the reasonableness and appropriateness of the estimated qualitative risk factor adjustments utilized by management in forming the loss estimate by comparing any qualitative adjustments to relevant external data, including historical trends. 

Testing the mathematical accuracy and computation of the allowance for credit losses for loans and leases by re-performing or independently calculating significant elements of the allowance, including quantitative historical loss factors applied to the loan and lease segments based on risk ratings and utilizing relevant source documents, including the completeness and accuracy of the data used in the calculation. 

Evaluating the accuracy and completeness of the Company s disclosures in accordance with Topic 326.

 Chicago metropolitan area and Brookfield, Wisconsin, banking offices. The Bank operates under an Illinois state bank charter, provides a full range of banking services, and has full trust powers. The Bank also provides wealth management services. As an Illinois state chartered financial institution that is not a member of the Federal Reserve System (the FRB ), the Bank is subject to regulation by the Illinois Department of Financial and Professional Regulation and the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation FDIC ). The Company is regulated by the FRB. The Bank is a participant in the Small Business Administration SBA and the United States Department of Agriculture USDA (collectively referred to as U.S. government guaranteed loans lending programs and originates U.S. government guaranteed loans. The Bank engages in short term direct financing lease contracts through BFG Corporation, doing business as Byline Financial Group BFG ), a wholly owned subsidiary of the Bank. BFG is located in Bannockburn, Illinois with sales offices in Illinois, and sales representatives in Illinois, Florida, Michigan, New Jersey and New York.

Note 1 Business and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies (continued) Restricted stock is generally viewed as a long term investment. Accordingly, when evaluating for impairment, its value is determined based on the ultimate recoverability of the par value rather than by recognizing declines in value. The Company did not recognize impairment of its restricted stock as a result of its impairment analyses for the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020 . 

Note 1 Business and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies (continued) Expected credit losses are estimated over the contractual term of the loans, adjusted for expected prepayments when appropriate. The contractual term excludes expected extensions, renewals, and modifications unless either of the following applies: management has a reasonable expectation at the reporting date that a troubled debt restructuring will be executed with an individual borrower or the extension or renewal options are included in the original or modified contract at the reporting date and are not unconditionally cancellable by the Company. The Company also maintains an allowance for credit losses on off-balance sheet credit exposures for unfunded loan commitments. This allowance is reflected as a component of other liabilities which represents management s current estimate of expected losses in the unfunded loan commitments. The estimate includes consideration of the likelihood that funding will occur and an estimate of expected credit losses on commitments expected to be funded over its estimated life based on management s consideration of past events, current conditions and reasonable and supportable economic forecasts. Management tracks the level and trends in unused commitments and takes into consideration the same factors as those considered for purposes of the allowance for credit losses on outstanding loans. Results for the full year and period end December 31, 2022, are presented under the current expected credit losses CECL methodology while prior period amounts continue to be reported in accordance with Accounting Standards Codification ASC Topic 450, Contingencies, and specific reserves based upon ASC Topic 310, Receivables. ASC for impairment, ASC 310 was applied to commercial and consumer loans that are individually assessed for impairment. Refer to Note 5 Allowance for Credit Losses, for further discussion. 
 Note 1 Business and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies (continued) Sales of U.S. government guaranteed loans are executed on a servicing retained basis. The standard SBA loan sale agreement is structured to provide the Company with a servicing spread paid from a portion of the interest cash flow of the loan. SBA regulations require the Company to retain a portion of the cash flow from the interest payments received for a sold loan. The USDA loan sale agreements are not standardized with respect to servicing. Servicing fee income, which is reported on the Consolidated Statements of Operations as loan servicing revenue, is recorded for fees earned for servicing loans. The fees are based on a contractual percentage of the outstanding principal. Late fees and ancillary fees related to loan servicing are not material. The Company has elected the fair value measurement method and measures servicing rights at fair value at each reporting date and reports changes in fair value of servicing assets in earnings in the period in which the changes occur, and are recorded as loan servicing asset revaluation on the Consolidated Statements of Operations. The fair value of servicing rights is highly sensitive to changes in underlying assumptions. Changes in the prepayment speed and discount rate assumptions have the most significant impact on the fair value of servicing rights. Servicing fee income, which is reported on the Consolidated Statements of Operations as loan servicing revenue, is recorded for fees earned for servicing loans. The fees are based on a contractual percentage of the outstanding principal. Late fees and ancillary fees related to loan servicing are not material. 

. Land is also carried at its fair value following a business combination and is not subject to depreciation. Leasehold improvements are amortized over the shorter of the life of the related asset or expected term of the underlying lease. Gains and losses on the dispositions of premises and equipment are included in non interest income. Expenditures for new premises, equipment and major betterments are capitalized. Normal costs of maintenance and repairs are expensed as incurred. Long lived depreciable assets are evaluated periodically for impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying amounts may be not recoverable. Impairment exists when the undiscounted expected future cash flows of a long lived asset are less than its carrying value. In that event, the Company recognizes a loss for the difference between the carrying amount and the estimated fair value of the asset based on a quoted market price, if applicable, or a discounted cash flow analysis. Impairment losses are recorded in non interest expense.

 period. In valuing core deposit intangibles, the Company considered variables such as deposit servicing costs, attrition rates and market discount rates. If the estimated fair value is less than the carrying value, the core deposit intangible would be reduced to such value and the impairment recognized as non interest expense. 
 years. In valuing the relationship intangibles, the Company considered variables such as attrition, investment appreciation, and discount rates. 
 
 Note 1 Business and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies (continued) material uncertain tax positions. The Company elects to treat interest and penalties recognized for the underpayment of income taxes as income tax expense. However, interest and penalties imposed by taxing authorities on issues specifically addressed in ASC Topic 740 will be taken out of the tax reserves up to the amount allocated to interest and penalties. The amount of interest and penalties exceeding the amount allocated in the tax reserves will be treated as income tax expense. A deferred tax valuation allowance is established to reduce the net carrying amount of deferred tax assets if it is determined to be more likely than not that all or some of the deferred tax asset will not be realized. At December 31, 2022 and 2021, the Company did not record a deferred tax valuation allowance. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are adjusted for the effects of changes in tax laws and rates on the date of enactment.

There was allowance for credit losses recorded for any held-to-maturity debt securities upon adoption of CECL. Note 2 Accounting Pronouncements Recently Issued (continued) Income Taxes (Topic 740) On January1, 2022, the Company adopted ASU No. 2019-12, Simplifying the Accounting for Income Taxes . The ASU simplifies the accounting for income taxes by removing the following: the exception to the incremental approach for intraperiod tax allocation when there is a loss from continuing operations and income or a gain from other items; the exception to the requirement to or not to recognize a deferred tax liability for a foreign entity when it becomes an equity method investment or it becomes a subsidiary, respectively; and the exception to the general methodology for calculating income taxes in an interim period when a year-to-date loss exceeds the anticipated loss for the year. The amendments in the ASU change current authoritative guidance by requiring the recognition of franchise tax that is partially based on income as an income-based tax and account for any incremental amount incurred as a non-income-based tax; requiring an evaluation when a step up in the tax basis of goodwill should be considered part the of business combination; specifying that it is not required to allocate the consolidated amount of current and deferred tax expense to a legal entity that is not subject to tax in its separate financial statements; and requiring that an entity reflect the effect of an enacted change in tax laws or rates in the annual effective tax rate computation in the interim period that includes the enactment date. Adoption of the provisions of ASU No. 2019-12 did not impact our financial result for the year ended December 31, 2022. Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 121 SAB 121 Accounting for Obligations to Safeguard Digital Assets - The SEC released SAB 121, which provides interpretive guidance regarding the accounting for obligations to safeguard crypto-assets an entity holds for its customers, either directly or through an agent or another third party acting on its behalf. SAB 121 requires an entity to recognize a liability on its balance sheet to reflect the obligation to safeguard the crypto-assets of others, along with a corresponding safeguarding asset, both of which are measured at fair value. The corresponding asset should consider potential loss events when measuring its fair value. SAB 121 also requires disclosure of the nature and amount of crypto assets being safeguarded with separate disclosure for each significant crypto asset, and the vulnerabilities the entity has due to any concentrations in such activities. Additionally, disclosure of how the fair value is determined, an entity s accounting policy for safeguarding liabilities and corresponding safeguarding assets, and other information about risks and uncertainties arising from the entity s safeguarding activities is required. As of December 31, 2022, the Company does not have a safeguarding obligation under SAB 121. The Company will continue to evaluate its digital-asset obligations and policies as it considers future programs. Issued Accounting Pronouncements Pending Adoption Reference Rate Reform (Topic 848) In March 2020, FASB issued ASU No. 2020-04, Facilitation of the Effects of Reference Rate Reform on Financial Reporting . The amendments in the ASU provide optional guidance for a limited period of time to ease the potential burden in accounting for (or recognizing the effects of) reference rate reform on financial reporting. The amendments in the ASU provide optional expedients and exceptions for applying generally accepted accounting principles to contract modifications and hedging relationships, subject to meeting certain criteria, that reference the London Interbank Offered Rate LIBOR or another reference rate expected to be discontinued. The ASU is intended to help stakeholders during the global market-wide reference rate transition period. The amendments in the ASU will be in effect for all entities as of March 12, 2020 through December 31, 2024. Banking regulators have provided guidance which prohibits new financial contracts from referencing LIBOR as the relevant index after December 31, 2021. The guidance goes on to indicate that beginning after June 2023, LIBOR can no longer be used for existing financial contracts. In December 2021, management approved the use of Term Secured Overnight Financing Rate SOFR as an alternative reference rate to LIBOR. Other alternative reference rates may be considered in the future. At December 31, 2022, million of loans, derivatives with a notional amount of million, and securities available for sale with a fair value of million, include fallback provisions that define the trigger events (an occurrence that precipitates the conversion from LIBOR to a new reference rate), and allow for the selection of a benchmark replacement and a spread adjustment between LIBOR and that benchmark replacement. Junior subordinated debentures carrying value of million were also tied to LIBOR. Fair Value Measurement (Topic 820) - In June 2022, the FASB issued ASU No. 2022-03, Fair Value Measurement of Equity Securities Subject to Contractual Sale Restrictions. The guidance in the ASU clarifies that a contractual restriction on the sale of an equity security is not considered part of the unit of account on the equity security and, therefore, is not considered in measuring fair value. The ASU also requires additional disclosures about the restriction. The amendments in this update are effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2023, and interim periods within those fiscal years. The Company is evaluating the accounting and disclosure requirements of this update and does not expect them to have a material effect on the consolidated financial statements. Note 2 Accounting Pronouncements Recently Issued (continued) ASU 2022-02 - Financial Instruments Credit Losses Troubled Debt Restructurings and Vintage Disclosures (Topic 326) This update eliminates the recognition and measurement guidance for troubled debt restructurings TDRs by creditors in ASC 310-40. The update also enhances disclosure requirements for certain loan restructurings by creditors when a borrower is experiencing financial difficulty. Specifically, rather than applying the recognition and measurement guidance for TDRs, an entity will apply the loan refinancing and restructuring guidance to determine whether a modification or other form of restructuring results in a new loan or a continuation of an existing loan. Additionally, the amendments in this ASU require a public business entity to disclose current-period gross write-offs by year of origination for financing receivables and net investments in leases in the existing vintage disclosures. As of December 31, 2022, the Company has million in TDRs that will need to be reevaluated under the new restructuring guidance. Management is also modifying its disclosure control process to capture gross charge-offs by year of origination. ASU 2022-02 is effective for organizations that have adopted ASU 2016-13 for the fiscal year beginning after December 15, 2022.

Certain securities have fair values less than amortized cost and, therefore, contain unrealized losses. The Company evaluated the securities which had unrealized losses for potential credit losses and determined there were none. There were securities available-for-sale with unrealized losses at December 31, 2022 , compared to at December 31, 2021 . There were securities held-to-maturity with unrealized losses at December 31, 2022 and none at December 31, 2021. There was no allowance for credit losses for held-to-maturity debt securities at December 31, 2022. The Company anticipates full recovery of amortized cost with respect to these securities by maturity, or sooner, in the event of a more favorable market interest rate environment. The Company does not intend to sell these securities and it is not more likely than not that the Company will be required to sell them before recovery of their amortized cost basis, which may be at maturity.

Originated loans and leases represent originations excluding loans initially acquired in a business combination. However, once an acquired non-credit-deteriorated loan reaches its maturity date, and is re-underwritten and renewed, it is internally classified as an originated loan. PCD loans are loans acquired from a business combination with evidence of more than insignificant credit deterioration and are accounted for under ASC Topic 326. Acquired non-credit-deteriorated loans and leases represent loans and leases acquired from a business combination without more than insignificant evidence of credit deterioration and are accounted for under ASC Topic 310-20.

The Company increased the allowance for credit losses - loans and leases by million for the year ended December 31, 2022, which included a million cumulative effective adjustment as of January 1, 2022 for the impact of adopting CECL. The remaining increase in current expected credit losses reflects increased provisions related to loan and lease portfolio growth, qualitative adjustments, and increases in individually evaluated loans. Portfolio growth, summarized by loan category in the previous tables, indicates growth in commercial and industrial loans of million for the year and a related million increase in ACL (excluding the CECL adoption adjustment). The commercial real estate portfolio grew million from prior year resulting in an increase of million to ACL. An increase in qualitative adjustments was allocated to address economic uncertainty and to address the negative credit impact of increased interest rates based on portfolio classification. Additionally, the allocation of ACL to the individually evaluated portfolio increased million during the year due to migration of classified loans from the collectively evaluated portfolio. For the year ended December 31, 2022, the provision for credit losses on PCD loans decreased million, primarily related to a million decrease in loans outstanding and of net recoveries on PCD loans. Comparisons between 2022 and 2021 balances are not presented because of the different classifications used for CECL adoption. The Company decreased the allowance by million, and increased the allowance by million for the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020 , respectively. For acquired impaired loans, the Company decreased the allowance by million and increased the allowance by million for the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively. For loans individually evaluated for impairment, the Company decreased the allowance by million for the year ended December 31, 2021, and increased the allowance for credit losses by million for the year ended December 31, 2020 . For loans collectively evaluated for impairment, the Company decreased the allowance by million, and increased it by million for the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively.

For purposes of these tables, the unpaid principal balance represents the outstanding contractual balance. Impaired loans include loans that are individually evaluated for impairment as well as troubled debt restructurings for all loan categories. The sum of non accrual loans and loans past due 90 days still on accrual will differ from the total impaired loan amount. The Bank s credit risk rating methodology assigns risk ratings from 1 to 10, where a higher rating represents higher risk. Risk ratings for all loans of million or more are reviewed annually. The risk rating categories are described by the following groupings: Pass Ratings 1 4 define the risk levels of borrowers and guarantors that offer a minimal to an acceptable level of risk. Watch A watch asset (rating of 5) has credit exposure that presents higher than average risk and warrants greater than routine attention by Bank personnel due to conditions affecting the borrower, the borrower s industry or the economic environment. Special Mention A special mention asset (rating of 6) has potential weaknesses that deserve management s close attention. If left uncorrected, these potential weaknesses may result in deterioration of the repayment prospects for the asset or in the Company s credit position at some future date. Substandard Accrual A substandard accrual asset (rating of 7) has well defined weakness or weaknesses in cash flow and collateral coverage resulting in a distinct possibility that the Company will sustain some loss if the deficiencies are not corrected. This classification may be used in limited cases, where despite credit severity, the borrower is current on payments and there is an agreed plan for credit remediation. Substandard Non Accrual A substandard asset (rating of 8) has well defined weakness or weaknesses in cash flow and collateral coverage resulting in the distinct possibility that the Company will sustain some loss if the deficiencies are not corrected. Doubtful A doubtful asset (rating of 9) has all the weaknesses inherent in one classified substandard with the added characteristic that the weaknesses make collection or liquidation in full, on the basis of currently existing facts, conditions and values, highly questionable and improbable. Loss A loss asset (rating of 10) is considered uncollectible and of such little value that its continuance as a realizable asset is not warranted. Note 5 Allowance for Credit Losses (continued)

Loan servicing revenue totaled million, million, and million for the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021, and 2020, respectively. Loan servicing asset revaluation, which represents the changes in fair value of servicing assets, totaled downward valuations of million, million, and million for the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021, and 2020, respectively. Changes in the fair value of the loan servicing asset are reported on the Consolidated Statement of Operations. The fair value of servicing rights is highly sensitive to changes in underlying assumptions. Changes in prepayment speed and discount rate assumptions have the most significant impact on the fair value of servicing rights. Generally, as interest rates rise on variable rate loans, loan prepayments increase due to an increase in refinance activity, which may result in a decrease in the fair value of servicing assets. Measurement of fair value is limited to the condition existing and the assumptions used as of a particular point in time, and those assumptions may change over time. In addition, as loan sale premium pricing in the secondary market decreases, the discount rate increases which leads to a lower servicing asset valuation. Refer to Note 17 Fair Value Measurement for further details.

 , some of which include renewal or termination options to extend the lease. In addition, the Company leases or subleases real estate to third parties. The Company includes lease extension and termination options in the lease term if, after considering relevant economic factors, it is reasonably certain the Company will exercise the option. In addition, the Company has elected to account for any non-lease components in its real estate leases as part of the associated lease component. The Company has also elected not to recognize leases with original lease terms of 12 months or less (short-term leases) on the Company s balance sheet. Leases are classified at the lease commencement date. Lease expense for operating leases and short-term leases is recognized on a straight-line basis over the lease term. Right-of-use assets represent our right to use an underlying asset for the lease term and lease liabilities represent our obligation to make lease payments arising from the lease. Right-of-use assets and lease liabilities are recognized at the lease commencement date based on the estimated present value of lease payments over the lease term. The Company uses its incremental borrowing rate at leases commencement to calculate the present value of lease payments when the rate implicit in a lease is not known. The Company's incremental borrowing rate is based on the FHLB regular advance rate, adjusted for the lease term and other factors. At December 31, 2022, the weighted average discount borrowing rate was and the weighted average remaining life of operating leases was years compared to and years for December 31, 2021.

Letters of credit 

Total 

Commitments to extend credit are agreements to lend to a customer as long as there is no violation of any condition established in the contract. Commitments generally have fixed expiration dates or other termination clauses and may require payment of a fee. Since many of the commitments are expected to expire without being drawn upon, the total commitment amount does not necessarily represent future cash requirements. The Company evaluates each customer s creditworthiness on a case-by-case basis. The amount of collateral obtained, if deemed necessary by the Company upon extension of credit, is based on management s credit evaluation of the counterparty. Collateral is primarily obtained in the form of commercial and residential real estate (including income producing commercial properties). Letters of credit are conditional commitments issued by the Company to guarantee to a third-party the performance of a customer. Those guarantees are primarily issued to support public and private borrowing arrangements, bond financing and similar transactions. The credit risk involved in issuing letters of credit is essentially the same as that involved in extending loan facilities to customers. Note 16 Commitments and Contingent Liabilities (continued) Commitments to make loans are generally made for periods of or less. The fixed rate loan commitments have interest rates ranging from to and maturities up to . Variable rate loan commitments have interest rates ranging from to and maturities up to . 

Note 17 Fair Value Measurement (continued) The Company used the following methods and significant assumptions to estimate fair value for certain assets measured and carried at fair value on a recurring basis: Securities available-for-sale The Company obtains fair value measurements from an independent pricing service. Management reviews the procedures used by the third party, including significant inputs used in the fair value calculations. The fair value measurements consider observable data that may include dealer quotes, market spreads, cash flows, the U.S. Treasury yield curve, live trading levels, trade execution data, market consensus prepayment speeds, credit information and the bond s terms and conditions, among other things. When market quotes are not readily accessible or available, alternative approaches are utilized, such as matrix or model pricing. The Company s methodology for pricing non-rated bonds focuses on three distinct inputs: equivalent rating, yield and other pricing terms. To determine the rating for a given non-rated municipal bond, the Company references a publicly issued bond by the same issuer if available as well as other additional key metrics to support the credit worthiness. Typically, pricing for these types of bonds would require a higher yield than a similar rated bond from the same issuer. A reduction in price is applied to the rating obtained from the comparable bond, as the Company believes if liquidated, a non-rated bond would be valued less than a similar bond with a verifiable rating. The reduction applied by the Company is one notch lower (i.e,. a AA rating for a comparable bond would be reduced to AA- for the Company s valuation). In 2022 and 2021, all of the ratings derived by the Company were BBB or better with and without comparable bond proxies. The fair value measurement of municipal bonds is sensitive to the rating input, as a higher rating typically results in an increased valuation. The remaining pricing inputs used in the bond valuation are observable. Based on the rating determined, the Company obtains a corresponding current market yield curve available to market participants. Other terms including coupon, maturity date, redemption price, number of coupon payments per year, and accrual method are obtained from the individual bond term sheets. Equity and other securities The Company utilizes the same fair value measurement methodology for equity and other securities as detailed in the securities available-sale portfolio above. Servicing assets Fair value is based on a loan-by-loan basis taking into consideration the original term to maturity, the current age of the loan and the remaining term to maturity. The valuation methodology utilized for the servicing assets begins with generating estimated future cash flows for each servicing asset, based on their unique characteristics and market-based assumptions for prepayment speeds and costs to service. The present value of the future cash flows are then calculated utilizing market-based discount rate assumptions. Derivative instruments Interest rate derivatives are valued by a third party, using models that primarily use market observable inputs, such as yield curves, and are validated by comparison with valuations provided by the respective counterparties. Derivative financial instruments are included in other assets and other liabilities in the Consolidated Statements of Financial Condition. Note 17 Fair Value Measurement (continued)

The Company used the following methods and significant assumptions to estimate fair value for certain assets measured and carried at fair value on a n-recurring basis: Individually Evaluated Loans The Company individually evaluates loans that do not share similar risk characteristics, including non-accrual loans and loans designated as a TDR. Specific allowance for credit losses is measured based on a discounted cash flow of ongoing operations, discounted at the loan s original effective interest rate, or a calculation of the fair value of the underlying collateral less estimated selling costs. Valuations of individually assessed loans that are collateral dependent are supported by third party appraisals in accordance with the Bank s credit policy. Accordingly, individually evaluated loans are classified as Level 3. Assets held for sale Assets held for sale consist of former branch locations and real estate previously purchased for expansion. Assets are considered held for sale when management has approved to sell the assets following a branch closure or other events. The properties are being actively marketed and transferred to assets held for sale based on the lower of carrying value or its fair value, less estimated costs to sell. Other real estate owned Certain assets held within other real estate owned represent real estate or other collateral that has been adjusted to its estimated fair value, less cost to sell, as a result of transferring from the loan portfolio at the time of foreclosure or repossession and based on management s periodic impairment evaluation. From time to time, non-recurring fair value adjustments to other real estate owned are recorded to reflect partial write-downs based on an observable market price or current appraised value of property. Note 17 Fair Value Measurement (continued) Adjustments to fair value based on such non-recurring transactions generally result from the application of lower-of-cost-or-market accounting or write-downs of individual assets due to impairment.

The following methods and assumptions were used by the Company in estimating fair values of other assets and liabilities for disclosure purposes: Cash and cash equivalents For these short-term instruments, the carrying amount is a reasonable estimate of fair value. Securities held-to-maturity The Company obtains fair value measurements from an independent pricing service. Management reviews the procedures used by the third party, including significant inputs used in the fair value calculations. The fair value measurements consider observable data that may include dealer quotes, market spreads, cash flows, the U.S. Treasury yield curve, live trading levels, trade execution data, market consensus prepayment speeds, credit information and the bond s terms and conditions, among other things. When market quotes are not readily accessible or available, alternative approaches are utilized, such as matrix or model pricing. Restricted stock The fair value has been determined to approximate cost. Loans held for sale The fair value of loans held for sale are based on quoted market prices, where available, and determined by discounted estimated cash flows using interest rates approximating the Company s current origination rates for similar loans adjusted to reflect the inherent credit risk. Loan and lease receivables, net For certain variable rate loans that reprice frequently and with no significant changes in credit risk, fair value is estimated at carrying value. The fair value of other types of loans is estimated using an exit price notion for 2022 and 2021 values. It is estimated by discounting future cash flows, using current rates at which similar loans would be made to borrowers with similar credit ratings and for the same remaining maturities. Deposits The fair value of demand deposits, savings accounts, and certain money market deposits is the amount payable on demand at the reporting date. The fair value of fixed-maturity certificates of deposit is estimated by discounting future cash flows, using rates currently offered for deposits of similar remaining maturities. Note 17 Fair Value Measurement (continued) Federal Home Loan Bank advances The fair value of FHLB advances is estimated by discounting the agreements based on maturities using rates currently offered for FHLB advances of similar remaining maturities adjusted for prepayment penalties that would be incurred if the borrowings were paid off on the measurement date. Securities sold under agreements to repurchase The carrying amount approximates fair value due to maturities of less than ninety days. Subordinated notes The fair value is based on available market prices. Junior subordinated debentures The fair value of junior subordinated debentures, in the form of trust preferred securities, is determined using rates currently available to the Company for debt with similar terms and remaining maturities. Accrued interest receivable and payable The carrying amount approximates fair value. Commitments to extend credit and letters of credit The fair values of these off-balance sheet commitments to extend credit and commercial and letters of credit are not considered practicable to estimate because of the lack of quoted market prices and the inability to estimate fair value without incurring excessive costs.

Interest rate swaps designated as cash flow hedges Cash flow hedges of interest payments associated with certain other borrowings had notional amounts totaling million and million as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively . The Company assesses the effectiveness of each hedging relationship by comparing the changes in fair value of the derivatives hedging instrument with the fair value of the designated hedged transactions. As of December 31, 2022, the cash flow hedges aggregating million in notional amounts are comprised of of six forward starting pay fixed interest rate swaps totaling million; two totaling million are effective in March 2023; two totaling million are effective in May 2023; one for million is effective in June 2023; and one for million is effective in September 2023. There are two hedges totaling million that were already effective as of December 31, 2022. Included in other comprehensive income is the remaining balance related to previously terminated interest rate swaps designated as cash flow hedges of as of December 31, 2022 and as of December 31, 2021. These are amortized over the original life of the cash flow hedge.

Derivatives not designated as hedges are not speculative and are used to manage the Company s exposure to interest rate movements and other identified risks but do not meet the strict hedge accounting requirements and/or the Company has not elected to apply hedge accounting. Changes in the fair value of derivatives not designated in hedging relationships are recorded directly in earnings. Other interest rate derivatives The total combined notional amount was million as of December 31, 2022 , with maturities ranging from to . The fair values of the interest rate derivative agreements are reflected in other assets and other liabilities with corresponding gains or losses reflected in non-interest income. During the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021 , and 2020, there were million, , and of transaction fees, respectively, included in other non-interest income, related to these derivative instruments. These instruments are inherently subject to market risk and credit risk. Market risk is associated with changes in interest rates and credit risk relates to the Company s risk of loss when the counterparty to a derivative contract fails to perform according to the terms of the agreement. Market and credit risks are managed and monitored as part of the Company s overall asset-liability management process. The credit risk related to derivatives entered into with certain qualified borrowers is managed through the Company s loan underwriting process. The Company s loan underwriting process also approves the Bank s swap counterparty used to mirror the borrowers swap. The Company has a bilateral agreement with each swap counterparty that provides that fluctuations in derivative values are to be fully collateralized with either cash or securities.

Item 9. Changes in and Disagreements With Accountants on Accounting and Financial Disclosure . 
 None. 
 Item 9A. Controls and Procedures . 
 Evaluation of disclosure controls and procedures . The Company s management, including our Chief Executive Officer and our Chief Financial Officer, have evaluated the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) under the Exchange Act), as of the end of the period covered by this report. Based on such evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and our Chief Financial Officer have concluded that, as of December 31, 2022, the Company s disclosure controls and procedures were effective to provide reasonable assurance that the information required to be disclosed by the Company in the reports it files or submits under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the rules and forms of the SEC and is accumulated and communicated to the Company s management, including our Chief Executive Officer and our Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. 
 Management s annual report on internal control over financial reporting . Management of the Company is responsible for establishing and maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting. Internal control is designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of published financial statements. Internal control over financial reporting includes self-monitoring mechanisms, and actions are taken to correct deficiencies as they are identified. 
 Management assessed the effectiveness of the Company s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2022. This assessment was based on criteria for effective internal control over financial reporting established in Internal Control-Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO). Based on this assessment, our Chief Executive Officer and our Chief Financial Officer have determined that the Company maintained effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2022, based on the specified criteria. 
 All internal control systems, no matter how well designed, have inherent limitations. Therefore, even those systems determined to be effective can provide only reasonable assurance with respect to financial statement preparation and presentation. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. 
 Moss Adams LLP, an independent registered public accounting firm that audited the Consolidated Financial Statements of the Company included in this Annual Report, has issued an audit opinion on the effectiveness of the Company's internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2022. The report, which expresses an unqualified opinion on the effectiveness of the Company's internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2022 is included in Item 15 - Financial Statements under the heading Reporting of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm on Internal Controls Over Financial Reporting . 
 Changes in internal control over financial reporting. There was no change in the Company s internal control over financial reporting during the quarter ended December 31, 2022, that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, the Company s internal control over financial reportin g.

It is subject to and qualified in its entirety by reference to our Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation (the Certificate of Incorporation and our Amended and Restated Bylaws (the Bylaws ), each of which are incorporated by reference as an exhibit to the Annual Report on Form 10-K of which this Exhibit 4.2 is a part. 
 General 
 Our authorized common stock consists of 150,000,000 shares, 0.01 par value per share. As of December 31, 2022, there were 39,518,702 shares of our common stock issued and 37,492,775 shares of our common stock outstanding. The authorized but unissued shares of our common stock will be available for future issuance without stockholder approval, unless otherwise required by applicable law or the rules of any applicable securities exchange. All of our issued and outstanding shares of common stock are validly issued, fully paid and non-assessable. 
 Subject to the rights and preferences granted to holders of our preferred stock then outstanding, and except with respect to voting rights, conversion rights and certain distributions of our capital stock, holders of our common stock rank equally with respect to distributions and have identical rights, preferences, privileges and restrictions, including the right to attend meetings and receive any information distributed by us with respect to such meetings. 
 Dividends. Holders of our common stock are equally entitled to receive ratably such dividends as may be declared from time to time by our board of directors out of legally available funds. In no event will any stock dividends or stock splits or combinations of stock be declared or made on common stock unless the shares of common stock at the time outstanding are treated equally and identically, provided that, in the event of a dividend of common stock, shares of common stock shall only be entitled to receive shares of common stock. The ability of our board of directors to declare and pay dividends on our common stock is subject to the laws of the state of Delaware, applicable federal and state banking laws and regulations, and the terms of any senior securities (including preferred stock) we may then have outstanding. Our principal source of income is dividends that are declared and paid by Byline Bank on its capital stock. Therefore, our ability to pay dividends is dependent upon the receipt of dividends from Byline Bank. 
 Voting rights. Each holder of our common stock is entitled to one vote for each share of record held on all matters submitted to a vote of stockholders, except as otherwise required by law and subject to the rights and preferences of the holders of any outstanding shares of our preferred stock. Holders of our common stock are not entitled to cumulative voting in the election of directors. Directors are elected by a plurality of the votes cast. 
 Liquidation rights. In the event of our liquidation, dissolution or winding up, holders of our common stock are entitled to share ratably in all of our assets remaining after payment of liabilities, including, but not limited to, the liquidation preference of any then outstanding preferred stock. Because we are a bank holding company, our rights and the rights of our creditors and stockholders to receive the assets of any subsidiary upon liquidation or recapitalization may be subject to prior claims of our subsidiary s creditors, except to the extent that we may be a creditor with recognized claims against our 
 subsidiary. 

EXHIBIT 4.2 
 Preemptive and other rights. Holders of our common stock are not entitled to any preemptive, subscription or redemption rights, and no sinking fund will be applicable to our common stock. 
 Authorized but Unissued Capital Stock 
 The Delaware General Corporation Law (the DGCL does not generally require stockholder approval for the issuance of authorized shares. These additional shares may be used for a variety of corporate purposes, including future public offerings, to raise additional capital or to facilitate acquisitions. However, the listing requirements of the NYSE, which would apply so long as the common stock remains listed on the NYSE, require stockholder approval of certain issuances equal to or exceeding 20 of the then outstanding voting power or then outstanding number of shares of common stock. 
 One of the effects of the existence of unissued and unreserved common stock or preferred stock may be to enable our board of directors to issue shares to persons friendly to current management, which issuance could render more difficult or discourage an attempt to obtain control of us by means of a merger, tender offer, proxy contest or otherwise, and thereby protect the continuity of our management and possibly deprive our stockholders of opportunities they may believe are in their best interests or in which they may receive a premium for their common stock over the market price of the common stock. 
 Anti-Takeover Provisions in our Certificate of Incorporation and Bylaws 
 Business Combination Statute. We have elected to opt out of Section 203 of the DGCL, which prohibits a Delaware corporation from engaging in any business combination with any interested stockholder for a period of three years after the date that such stockholder became an interested stockholder, subject to certain exceptions. 
 Federal banking law . The ability of a third party to acquire our stock is also limited under applicable U.S. banking laws, including regulatory approval requirements. The BHC Act requires any bank holding company to obtain the approval of the Federal Reserve before acquiring, directly or indirectly, more than 5 of our outstanding common stock. Any company (as defined in the BHC Act) other than a bank holding company is required to obtain the approval of the Federal Reserve before acquiring control of us. Control generally means (i) the ownership or control of 25 or more of a class of voting securities, (ii) the ability to elect a majority of the directors or (iii) the ability otherwise to exercise a controlling influence over management and policies. A person, other than an individual or a qualified family partnership, that controls us for purposes of the BHC Act is subject to regulation and supervision as a bank holding company under the BHC Act. In addition, under the Change in Bank Control Act of 1978, as amended, and the Federal Reserve s regulations thereunder, any person, either individually or acting through or in concert with one or more persons, is required to provide notice to the Federal Reserve prior to acquiring, directly or indirectly, 10 or more of our outstanding common stock (or any other class of our voting securities). 
 Requirements for advance notification of stockholder nominations and proposals . Our Bylaws establish advance notice procedures with respect to stockholder proposals and nomination of candidates for election as directors. These procedures provide that notice of such stockholder proposal must be timely given in writing to our corporate secretary prior to the meeting at which the action is to be taken. Generally, to be timely, notice must be received at our principal executive offices not less than 90 days nor more than 120 days prior to the first anniversary date of the annual meeting for the preceding year. The notice must contain certain information required to be provided by our Bylaws. 
 Limits on written consents . Our Certificate of Incorporation provides that any action to be taken by the stockholders that the stockholders are required or permitted to take must be effected at a duly 

EXHIBIT 4.2 
 called annual or special meeting of stockholders. Our stockholders are not permitted to take action by written consent. 
 Limits on special meetings . Subject to the rights of the holders of any series of preferred stock, special meetings of the stockholders may be called only by (i) our board of directors, (ii) the Chairperson of the board of directors, (iii) our Chief Executive Officer, (iv) our President or (v) our Executive Vice President. 
 Amending our Certificate of Incorporation and Bylaws 
 Our Certificate of Incorporation may be amended or altered in any manner provided by the DGCL. Our Bylaws may be adopted, amended, altered or repealed by stockholders only upon the affirmative vote of holders of a majority of the shares of our common stock present in person or represented by proxy at the meeting and entitled to vote thereon. Additionally, our Certificate of Incorporation provides that our Bylaws may be amended, altered or repealed by our board of directors by a majority vote. 
 Sole and Exclusive Forum 
 Our Bylaws provide that, unless we consent in writing to an alternative forum, the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware will be the sole and exclusive forum for (i) any derivative action or proceeding brought on our behalf, (ii) any action asserting a claim of breach of a fiduciary duty owed by any of our directors, officers, employees or agents to us or our stockholders, (iii) any action asserting a claim arising pursuant to any provision of the DGCL, our Certificate of Incorporation or our Bylaws or (iv) any action asserting a claim that is governed by the internal affairs doctrine. Any person purchasing or otherwise acquiring any interest in any shares of our capital stock shall be deemed to have notice of and to have consented to this provision of our Bylaws. This choice of forum provision may have the effect of discouraging lawsuits against us and our directors, officers, employees and agents. However, the exclusive forum clause described above shall not apply to suits brought to enforce a duty or liability created by federal law, including the Exchange Act and the Securities Act, for which the federal courts have exclusive jurisdiction. To the extent the exclusive forum provision restricts the courts in which our stockholders may bring claims arising under the Securities Act, there is uncertainty as to whether a court would enforce such provision. Our stockholders will not be deemed to have waived compliance with the federal securities laws and the rules and regulations thereunder. 
 Indemnification and Limitation of Liability 
 Our Bylaws provide generally that we will indemnify and hold harmless, to the full extent permitted by law, our directors, officers, employees and agents, as well as other persons who have served as our directors, officers, employees or agents and other persons who serve or have served at our request at another corporation, limited liability company, public limited company, partnership, joint venture, trust, employee benefit plan, fund or other enterprise in connection with any actual or threatened action, suit or proceeding, subject to limited exceptions. Insofar as indemnification for liabilities arising under the Securities Act may be permitted to our directors, officers and controlling persons, we have been informed that, in the opinion of the SEC, such indemnification is against public policy as expressed in the Securities Act and is, therefore, unenforceable. Finally, our ability to provide indemnification to our directors and officers is limited by federal banking laws and regulations. 
 Our Certificate of Incorporation limits, to the full extent permitted by law, the personal liability of our directors in actions brought on our behalf or on behalf of our stockholders for monetary damages as a result of a director s breach of fiduciary duty while acting in a capacity as a director. Our 

EXHIBIT 4.2 
 Certificate of Incorporation does not eliminate or limit our right or the right of our stockholders to seek injunctive or other equitable relief not involving monetary damages. 
 Listing 
 Our common stock is listed on the NYSE under the symbol BY .
