PART I 
 
 ITEM 1. BUSINESS 
 The Company 
 The reporting company is Sensata Technologies Holding plc, a public limited company incorporated under the laws of England and Wales, and its consolidated subsidiaries, collectively referred to as the "Company," "Sensata," "we," "our," and "us." We are a global industrial technology company that strives to create a safer, cleaner, and more efficient, electrified, and connected world. We develop, manufacture, and sell sensors and sensor-rich solutions, electrical protection components and systems, and other products used in mission-critical systems and applications that create valuable business insights for our customers and end users. For more than 100 years, we have been providing a wide range of customized solutions that address increasingly complex engineering and operating performance requirements to help our customers solve their most difficult challenges. We serve customers in the automotive, heavy vehicle and off-road ("HVOR"), fleet management, industrial, clean energy, and aerospace industries. We present financial information for two reportable segments, Performance Sensing and Sensing Solutions. 
 Our sensors are used by our customers to translate a physical parameter, such as pressure, temperature, position, or location of an object, into electronic signals that our customers products and solutions can act upon. Our electrical protection portfolio (which includes both components and systems) is comprised of various switches, fuses, battery management systems, inverters, energy storage systems, high-voltage distribution units, controllers, and software, and includes high-voltage contactors and other products embedded within systems to maximize their efficiency and performance and ensure safety. Other products and services we provide include vehicle area networks and data collection devices and software, battery storage systems, and power conversion systems, the latter of which include inverters, converters, and rectifiers for renewable energy generation, green hydrogen production, electric vehicle charging stations, and microgrid applications, as well as industrial and defense applications. 
 Original equipment manufacturers ("OEMs") are facing ever-increasing mandates, due to regulation and consumer demand, to make their products safer, cleaner, and more efficient, electrified, and connected. Our products and solutions are being used by our customers in applications to address these demands, including those that help: industrial customers introduce new energy-efficient and environmentally friendly motors, compressors, and heating, ventilation and air conditioning ("HVAC") systems; transportation customers to meet the standards of emissions and pollution-control legislation; and fleet managers to proactively monitor the location and performance of their vehicles and to operate more efficiently. We consider these capabilities to be core to our historical success and will continue to be significant drivers of market outgrowth in the future. We use the term "market outgrowth" to describe the impact of an increasing quantity and value of our products used in customer systems and applications above external market growth. It is only loosely correlated to normal unit demand fluctuations in the markets we serve. 
 We have long-standing relationships with a geographically-diverse base of leading OEMs and other multinational companies. In certain geographic and product markets, where it is more effective and efficient for us and our customers, we use third-party distributors to sell our products. We have had relationships with our top ten customers for an average of 27 years. Our largest customer accounted for approximately 6 of our net revenue for the year ended December 31, 2022. 
 Business Strategy 
 Our business strategy involves leveraging certain material growth drivers to deliver products used in mission-critical systems and applications that create valuable business insights for our customers and end users. These growth drivers include (1) the overarching trend related to our core historical business that enables vehicles, industrial equipment, aircraft, and other systems to be safer and more energy-efficient (a trend which we refer to as Safe Efficient and (2) certain new and emerging technology trends that complement or enhance our existing product offerings (which we refer to as megatrends ). These megatrends, which are described more fully under the heading Growth Drivers included elsewhere in this Item 1: Business, are significantly transforming the industries in which we operate and are creating greater secular demand for our current and new innovative products, resulting in growth that exceeds end market production growth in many of the markets we serve, a defining characteristic of our company. 
 We believe the medium- to long-term outlook for internal combustion engine powertrains and industrial equipment will evolve with, and be impacted by, Electrification and other adjacent technologies. Accordingly, we are focusing on expanding our market share on electrified platforms, including sensors, electrical protection components and systems, and battery-energy management systems as full solutions. Many of the components and subsystems we have historically developed and produced will play a significant role in this expansion, but we have and will continue to consider strategic partnerships and acquisitions to

 Our strategies of leveraging core technology platforms and focusing on high-volume applications enable us to provide our customers with highly customized products at a relatively low cost compared to the systems in which our products are embedded. We have achieved our current cost position through a continual process of migration and transformation to best-cost manufacturing locations, global best-cost sourcing, product design improvements, and ongoing productivity-enhancing initiatives. 
 Growth drivers 
 Significant drivers of growth in our business, which are expected to significantly impact our customers and business strategy, include the Electrification and Insights/IoT megatrends, as well as the Safe Efficient growth trend, each described in more detail below. 
 Electrification megatrend 
 Our objective with the Electrification megatrend initiative is to become a leading and foundational player in electrification components and sub-systems across broad industrial, transportation, aerospace, and stationary infrastructure recharging and energy storage end markets and to be a comprehensive solutions provider in select end market segments. These components and solutions will support a future that is more environmentally sustainable and efficient and include (1) clean energy transportation components for electric vehicles, charging stations, and chargers and (2) mission-critical high-voltage components and subsystems combined into high-value energy management or energy storage solutions. Throughout this Report, we use the term electric vehicles holistically to reference plug-in hybrid and battery-electric vehicles of all kinds, unless otherwise specified. The Electrification megatrend initiative provides a significant opportunity for us to expand our market share on electrified platforms, including sensors, electrical protection components and systems, and battery-energy power conversion and storage systems as full solutions within all of our end markets in the automotive, HVOR, industrial, material handling, and aerospace industries. 
 Our transportation addressable markets (automotive and HVOR) are large today and growing, with expectations that they will continue to grow over the next ten years. In addition to transportation applications, manufacturers of material handling equipment, marine vessels, aircraft, and industrial systems are also addressing ever-tightening greenhouse gas emissions regulations and taking advantage of falling battery costs and increasing energy capacities of lithium-ion battery cells to provide electrified solutions to their customers.

Because of the prevalence of internal combustion engine vehicles today, applications in these vehicles make up most of our current transportation addressable markets. As the demand and production of electric vehicles increase in the coming years, we expect our automotive revenue mix to shift more towards electric vehicles. Our average U.S. dollar content in an electric vehicle is expected to expand over the next several years to approximately two times the content that we currently realize on average for internal combustion vehicles, resulting from the broad array of sensors and other components designed into electric vehicles. 
 We provide many of our innovative and differentiated components, such as those used in braking, tires, and environmental control, from traditional internal combustion engine vehicles for use in electric vehicle applications. Specific to electric vehicles, we also provide and are developing several components that enable the safe and efficient operation of electrified platforms, such as high-voltage electrical protection, advanced temperature and thermal management sensing, highly-sensitive electric motor position, and next-generation current sensing. Thanks to products and services we have added via acquisition, we have expanded our capabilities and reach to provide our customers with not only components but also either the subsystem of assembled components to manage battery charging in the form of a power distribution unit for renewable energy systems and applications or, in certain specialty transportation markets like marine, the full energy storage system, including battery management and a customized battery pack. 
 Within Electrification, we address the needs of the charging infrastructure necessary to support the electrification ecosystem. In addition, we see opportunities in industrial and grid applications, some of which are nascent today. Sensata is a leading provider of high-voltage electrical protection on electric vehicles and charging infrastructure and we seek to be the partner of choice for HVOR, industrial, marine, and aerospace OEMs transitioning to electrified solutions. We also intend to participate in other areas of the evolving market that enable electrification to become more widespread. 
 To better pursue clean energy components and system opportunities, in fiscal year 2021, we organized a new business unit in our Sensing Solutions reportable segment, Clean Energy Solutions, which includes products and solutions such as high-voltage contactors, inverters, rectifiers, and battery management systems, that serve the industrial, stationary, and commercial energy conversion and storage end markets. With the fiscal year 2021 acquisitions of Spear Power Systems ("Spear") and Sendyne Corp. ("Sendyne"), we expanded our portfolio to include energy storage systems and electrical sensing products, augmenting our offerings to our existing end markets as well as providing access to new end markets and applications. In addition, our fiscal year 2022 acquisition of Dynapower is a foundational addition to our Clean Energy Solutions strategy. Refer to the discussion under the heading Business Combinations below and in Note 21: Acquisitions and Divestitures of our audited consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes thereto (the "Financial Statements") included elsewhere in this Report for additional discussion of this acquisition. 
 Insights/IoT megatrend 
 Our objective within the Insights/IoT megatrend initiative is to become a leader in delivering data-driven insight, connectivity, and prognostics to commercial fleet operators and asset managers, by providing solutions that increase overall operational productivity and efficiency for these customers. The Insights/IoT megatrend initiative addresses a large and fast-growing market opportunity to deliver data insights across heavy, medium, and light vehicle fleets, which require data on the location and operation of their assets to monitor equipment health, lower maintenance costs, optimize operations, and improve safety and performance. 
 Leveraging Sensata s long history and expertise in sensor development, Sensata INSIGHTS portfolio includes a full-stack offering of sensors, cameras, vehicle area networks, telematics gateways, cloud solutions, and data services. We collect data from cameras and wireless sensors measuring information such as video telematics, tire pressure, cargo capacity, and a variety of other sensing parameters, along with related vehicle system information. We then communicate this valuable data from our telematics and video telematics devices to the cloud via Application Programming Interfaces for integration into our customers enterprise systems. Through cloud-based mobile applications and web portals, this data delivers actionable insight to drivers, maintenance workers, and back-office personnel allowing participants in the ecosystem to proactively monitor the health of their vehicles, conduct proactive maintenance, optimize fleet operations, and enhance driver safety. As an independent third-party technology provider, we serve multiple channels to market, including partnering with telematics service providers, resellers and carriers, and serving fleet operators directly. 
 With the fiscal year 2021 acquisitions of Xirgo Technologies, LLC and SmartWitness Holdings, Inc. ("SmartWitness"), we expanded our capabilities to provide data insights to transportation and logistics customers through telematics, video telematics, asset tracking devices, and other cloud-based solutions. In addition, the fiscal year 2022 acquisition of Elastic M2M, Inc. ("Elastic M2M") augments our cloud capabilities critical to delivering actionable sensor-based insights, an increasingly important capability in this fast-growing industry segment.

below and in Note 21: Acquisitions and Divestitures of our Financial Statements included elsewhere in this Report for additional discussion of the acquisition of Elastic M2M. 
 Safe Efficient 
 Due to global regulation and societal forces, our customers are facing increasing mandates to make higher-performance products that are more reliable, safe, and efficient. Many customers are shifting their designs to meet these evolving requirements. We will continue to design and manufacture products and solutions for mission-critical, hard-to-do applications that enable our customers to protect the environment and improve quality of life. Examples of applications that fall within this trend include next-generation powertrains, tire pressure monitoring systems ("TPMS ), safety and environmental systems, operator sensing systems, and HVAC variable speed, flow, and air systems. 
 For example, responding to tightening legislation requirements and proliferating content, we enable vehicle OEMs to improve combustion, reduce tailpipe emissions, and increase fuel economy in both traditional and hybrid vehicles with a combination of sensors, such as pressure, high-temperature, and speed, in next-generation powertrains. In addition, tightening HVOR emissions regulations in the United States, Europe, and China have resulted in increased sensor content in engines and after-treatment. Our differentiated operator controls and systems improve operator productivity and enable simplified, improved, and safer operation, even in harsh conditions. Our TPMS is used in automotive and HVOR OEMs and fleets to eliminate downtime, reduce operating costs, improve fuel efficiency, and create safer driving conditions. Also, HVAC variable systems are the preferred method to meet stringent energy efficiency and environmental regulations. Our pressure and temperature sensors are critical to optimize these systems and enable them to achieve higher levels of efficiency.

It primarily serves the Automotive and HVOR industries through the development and manufacture of sensors, high-voltage solutions (i.e., electrical protection components), and other solutions that are used in mission-critical systems and applications. Examples include those used in subsystems of 
 7 

Table of Contents 

automobiles, on-road trucks, and off-road equipment, such as tire pressure monitoring, thermal management, electrical protection, regenerative braking, powertrain (engine/transmission), exhaust management, and operator controls. Our products are used in subsystems that, among other things, improve operating performance and efficiency, contribute to environmentally sustainable and safe solutions, and provide data-driven insight, connectivity, and prognostics to commercial fleet operators and asset managers. 
 For fleet transportation and logistics customers and end users, we provide hardware and services that enable a variety of end-use applications, including vehicle tracking and on-board vehicle diagnostic data to monitor vehicle health; the provision of vehicle data to enable usage-based insurance offerings; cargo capacity data for trailers that increase the operational efficiency of fleets; video telematics offerings that provide event analysis and in-cab monitoring to prevent and lower the cost of incidents; and visibility to where assets are located across the supply chain. 
 Customers 
 Our customers include leading global automotive, on-road truck, construction, and agriculture OEMs, the companies that supply parts directly to these OEMs, known as Tier 1 suppliers, various aftermarket distributors, fleet transportation, and logistics customers. We believe large OEMs and other multinational companies are increasingly demanding a global presence to supply sensors and electrical protection components for their key platforms worldwide. As our customers develop common global electrified platforms to drive scale and efficiency across their global markets, we are well-positioned to serve them with our global manufacturing and technical centers. We also see the growing importance of new startup OEMs as market disruptors, and Sensata s flexibility, speed, expertise, and global footprint provide these new entrants with a supplier/partner capable of meeting their demanding requirements. Fleet transportation and logistics customers demand data-driven insight, connectivity, and prognostics to increase productivity and operational efficiency. We provide all our customers with a worldwide technical, manufacturing presence and service support to enable their success globally. 
 Markets 
 The global sensor market is characterized by a broad range of products and applications across a diverse set of market segments. According to third-party data, the global automotive sensor market was 24.4 billion in 2022, compared to 21.3 billion in 2021. 
 The markets we serve are seeking to provide cleaner, safer, more electrified, and connected solutions. Our solutions are present in a wide variety of transportation systems and subsystems, playing a critical role in ensuring the functionality and safety of a vehicle s operation. Within the combustion and electrified propulsion architecture, we provide various sensor solutions (e.g., electric motor position, gasoline direct injection, oil pressure monitoring, fuel delivery, and various others) that enable superior functionality, efficiency, and optimized performance while reducing environmental impact. As electrification proliferates, the ability to protect the vehicle systems/sub-systems from high-voltage power sources becomes critical, a need that our electrical protection portfolio (e.g., high-voltage contactors, fuses, high-voltage junction boxes) addresses. Our chassis (e.g., tire management solutions), thermal management (e.g., pressure plus temperature sensing), and safety (e.g., braking and electronic stability control) sensor/product solutions all play critical roles in enabling the safety, improved performance, and increased efficiency and range of both electrified vehicles and internal combustion engine powertrains. 
 Applications we serve require close engineering collaboration between us and the OEM or their Tier 1 suppliers. Solutions are designed to meet application-specific requirements with customer-specific fit, form, and function. As a result, OEMs and Tier 1 suppliers make significant investments in selecting, integrating, and testing sensors as part of their product development. Once our solutions are designed into an application, we are well positioned as the incumbent supplier due to the high degree of sensor customization and application/vehicle platform certification. This results in high switching costs for automotive and HVOR manufacturers once a sensor is designed into a particular system or platform. We believe this is one of the reasons that sensors are rarely changed during a platform life cycle, which in the case of the automotive industry typically lasts four to six years. OEMs and Tier 1 suppliers seek to partner with suppliers with a proven record of quality, on-time delivery, and performance, as well as the engineering and manufacturing scale/resources to meet their needs over the multi-year lifecycle of these highly engineered vehicles and systems. As electrified transportation platforms continue to evolve and grow, we expect OEM and Tier 1 suppliers to continue to require sensing partners that can continue to meet their increasing needs for mission-critical sensors and solutions, enabling their global vehicle strategies. We continue to drive investments in innovative technologies, competencies, and solutions to enable our customers' success as they pivot toward an electrified world. Transportation industries provide some of the largest markets for sensors, giving participants with a presence in these markets significant scale advantages over those participating only in smaller, more niche industrial and medical markets.

 We believe that net revenue growth from the automotive and HVOR sensor markets served by Performance Sensing has historically been driven by three principal trends, including (1) growth in the number of vehicles produced globally, (2) expansion in the number and type of sensors per vehicle, and (3) efforts toward commercializing higher value sensors. In addition, we believe that the automotive and HVOR sensor markets are, and will continue to be, substantially impacted in the near term by current megatrends, including Electrification and Insights/IoT. 
 Light vehicle production : Global production of light vehicles had consistently demonstrated steady annual growth for most of the decade up to 2019 when it started to decline. Fiscal years 2020 and 2021 were depressed production years due to the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on global markets. Fiscal year 2020 was hardest hit, with global production of light vehicles declining approximately 16 from fiscal year 2019. In fiscal year 2022, global production of light vehicles increased about 6 from fiscal year 2021, according to third-party data. 
 On-Road Truck Production: Global production of heavy-duty trucks had also demonstrated consistent growth until fiscal year 2020, which declined as a result of the economic impacts of COVID-19. Global production of heavy- and medium-duty trucks in the markets we serve rebounded to increase approximately 20 in fiscal year 2021, but decreased approximately 12 in fiscal year 2022. 
 Number of sensors per vehicle: We believe that the number of sensors used in vehicles of all classes will continue to be driven by increasing requirements in vehicle emissions, efficiency, safety, electrification, and comfort-related control systems that depend on sensors for proper functioning, such as electronic stability control, tire pressure monitoring, advanced driver assistance, advanced combustion and exhaust after-treatment applications, and operator controls in heavy off-road equipment. For example, government regulation of emissions, including fuel economy standards such as the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration's Corporate Average Fuel Economy requirements in the U.S. and emissions requirements such as "Euro 6d" in Europe, "China National 6" in China, and "Bharat Stage VI" in India, require advanced sensors to achieve these performance metrics. Sensors are crucial enablers for a vehicle s systems and sub-systems to meet the ever-increasing requirements in a vehicle s operation. 
 Higher value sensors: We believe that our revenue growth has been augmented by a continuing shift away from legacy sensors to next-generation, value-rich sensors and related solutions that include controllers, receivers, and software and will continue to grow as our sensors get "smarter" with more embedded algorithms. As we strive to increase the value we bring to the market and our customers, we are continually looking to bring solutions to our customers that drive the next-generation vehicle enhancement in electrification, safety, and reliability through our engineering solutions combined with increased data insights that are derived from these sensing solutions. Our ability to provide our customers with not only solutions in sensing and electrical protection components and systems but also insights into the systems/sub-systems we serve increases the value of our offering and enables improved performance, safety, efficiency, and environmental impacts. Our focus on delivering enhanced value through our mission-critical solutions to the market positions us to drive profitable revenue growth as the market demands continue to evolve. 
 New Technology: Automobiles and heavy vehicles continue to evolve, with new alternative technologies being developed to make these vehicles more efficient, reliable, financially viable, and safe. We believe this trend will drive growth in our business for the foreseeable future, particularly in the areas of Electrification and Insights/IoT. Moreover, we believe our broad customer base, global diversification, and evolving portfolio provide the foundation that will allow us to grow with these megatrends across a diverse set of markets. 
 Our GIGAVAC-branded high-voltage electrical protection products augment our electrical protection portfolio to address many of the needs in electric vehicles as voltage systems continue to increase. As system voltages increase, the burden on the systems and subsystems to properly control and protect the vehicle from electrical failure becomes mission-critical, and is where our solutions play a critical role. Our electrical protection solutions safeguard the expensive electronics used to power the vehicle and allow for an increase in power levels to improve charging times. The joint venture created with Churod Electronics in early fiscal year 2021 expanded our contactor offering by making available new technology applicable to lower voltage ranges than GIGAVAC's solutions. 
 The adoption of more advanced sensing technologies is also a key market trend, as fleet operators and owners demand more sophisticated information about trucks and trailers, driving demand for cargo capacity, video telematics, and other sensing applications. Also, participants across the supply chain ecosystem are increasingly adopting IoT solutions to provide them with (1) tracking/visibility to where assets or goods are in the supply chain, (2) more advanced applications such as predictive algorithms on the estimated time of arrival and sensors that can provide information on the condition of the goods (temperature,

 The table below sets forth the amount of net revenue generated by our sensors and electrical protection product categories in Sensing Solutions, reconciled to total segment net revenue, for the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021, and 2020: 
 For the year ended December 31, (In thousands) 2022 2021 2020 Net revenue: Electrical protection 625,316 593,259 468,635 Sensors 259,275 230,364 209,244 Other 167,915 149,275 143,889 Sensing Solutions net revenue 1,052,506 972,898 821,768 
 Competitors 
 Within each of the principal product categories in Sensing Solutions, we compete with divisions of large multinational industrial corporations and companies with smaller market share that compete primarily in specific markets, applications, systems, or products. We believe that the key competitive factors in these markets are product performance, quality, and reliability. 
 Technology and Intellectual Property 
 We develop products that address increasingly complex engineering and operating performance requirements to help our customers solve their most difficult engineering challenges in the automotive, HVOR, fleet management, industrial, clean energy, and aerospace industries. We believe that continued focused investment in research and development ("R D") is critical to our future growth and maintaining our leadership positions in the markets we serve. Our R D efforts are directly related to the timely development of new and enhanced products that are central to our business strategy. We continually develop our technologies to meet an evolving set of customer requirements and new product introductions. We conduct such activities in areas we believe will increase our long-term revenue growth. Our development expense is typically associated with engineering core technology platforms to specific applications and engineering major upgrades that improve functionality or reduce the cost of existing products. 
 A large portion of our R D activities is directed towards technologies and megatrends that we believe have the potential for significant future growth but relate to products that are not currently within our core business or include new features and capabilities for existing products. Expenses related to these activities are less likely than our more mainstream development activities to result in increased near-term revenue.

We benefit from many development opportunities at an early stage for several reasons: (1) we are the incumbent in many systems for our key customers; (2) we have robust design and service capability; and (3) our global engineering teams are located close to key customers in regional business centers. We work closely with our customers to deliver solutions that meet their needs today and in the future. As a result of development lead times and the embedded nature of our products, we collaborate closely with our customers throughout the design and development phase of their products. Systems development by our customers typically requires significant multi-year investment for certification and qualification, which are often government or customer mandated. We believe the capital commitment and time required for this process significantly increase the switching costs once a customer has designed and installed a particular sensor into a system. 
 We rely primarily on patents, trade secrets, manufacturing know-how, confidentiality procedures, and licensing arrangements to maintain and protect our intellectual property rights. While we consider our patents to be valuable assets, we do not believe that our overall competitive position is dependent on patent protection or that our overall business is dependent upon any single patent or group of related patents. Many of our patents protect specific functionality in our products, and others consist of processes or techniques that result in reduced manufacturing costs. 
 The following table presents information on our patents and patent applications as of December 31, 2022: 
 U.S. 
 Non-U.S. 
 Patents 341 587 Pending patent applications filed within the last five years 105 340 
 Our patents have expiration dates ranging from 2023 to 2045. We also own a portfolio of trademarks and license various patents and trademarks. "Sensata" and our logo are trademarks. 
 We use licensing arrangements with respect to certain technology provided in our sensor and electrical protection products. In 2006, we entered into a perpetual, royalty-free cross-license agreement with our former owner, Texas Instruments Incorporated, which permits each party to use specified technology owned by the other party in its business. No license may be terminated under the agreement, even in the event of a material breach. 
 Raw Materials 
 We use a broad range of manufactured components, subassemblies, and raw materials in the manufacture of our products in both our Performance Sensing and Sensing Solutions segments, including those containing certain commodities (e.g., semiconductors, resins, and metals), which may experience significant volatility in their price and availability due to, among other things: new laws or regulations, including labor laws and the impact of tariffs; trade barriers and disputes; global economic or political events, including government actions and labor strikes; suppliers' allocations to other purchasers; interruptions in production by suppliers; increased logistics costs; changes in foreign currency exchange rates; and prevailing price levels. 
 It has historically been difficult to pass increased prices for manufactured components and raw materials to our customers through price increases. Therefore, a significant increase in the price or decrease in the availability of these items could materially increase our operating costs and materially and adversely affect our business and results of operations. However, the impact of the global supply chain shortages, including production delays on a vast and varied number of products across industries and geographies and increased procurement and logistics costs, is unprecedented. Accordingly, we are actively working with our customers to share the inflationary burden of these factors. In addition, where possible, we are working to adjust our long-term supply agreements, strengthen our relationships with our suppliers, increase inventories on hand, increase visibility into long-term supply and demand, and accelerate the use of alternate materials to improve supply chain visibility. 
 Seasonality 
 Because of the diverse global nature of the markets in which we operate, our net revenue is only moderately impacted by seasonality. Sensing Solutions experiences some seasonality, specifically in its air conditioning and refrigeration products, which tend to peak in the first two quarters of the year as inventories are built up for spring and summer sales. In addition, Performance Sensing's net revenue tends to be weaker in the third quarter of the year as automotive OEMs retool production lines for the coming model year. Our Sensata INSIGHTS business within Performance Sensing tends to peak in the last quarter of the calendar year as customers exhaust their annual capital budgets.

One of our key areas of prioritization as identified in the Sustainability Report is to empower our workforce through promotion of a culture that values inclusion and diversity and prioritizes employee well-being and safety. A summary of additional content in the Sustainability Report can be found under the heading Sustainability Report included elsewhere in this Item 1: Business . The full report can be found on our website at www.sensata.com/sustainability . 
 Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion ("DEI") 
 We believe in treating all people with respect and dignity. Each person brings unique value through their varying backgrounds and life experiences, no matter their age, race, color, disability, ethnicity, family or marital status, gender identity or expression, language, national origin, physical or mental ability, political affiliation, religion, sexual orientation, socio-economic status, veteran status, and other characteristics that make our employees unique. It is our policy and practice to hire and employ qualified individuals without regard to these characteristics. Our DEI policy can be found at www.sensata.com/diversity-equity-and-inclusion . This policy applies to all terms and conditions of employment, including recruitment and selection; compensation and benefits; professional development and training; promotions; transfers; social and recreational programs; reductions in force; terminations; and the ongoing development of a work environment built on the premise of diversity, equity, and inclusion. 
 We provide regular training to all employees regarding our diversity policies and practices through which we communicate our expectations that each employee is responsible for maintaining a respectful and inclusive workplace. We strive to create and foster a supportive and understanding environment in which ideas are shared freely, helping all individuals realize their maximum potential within Sensata, regardless of their differences. An inclusive culture is fundamental to innovation and problem-solving, improving our ability to innovate, and is vital to our business. 
 We sponsor various employee resource groups ERGs ), groups of employees that come together to work strategically, both internally and externally, to benefit and advance their group members by fostering awareness, respect, and inclusion within the workplace. Our ERGs support our commitment to creating and sustaining a diverse workforce and a culture of inclusion where everyone can thrive, encouraging different perspectives, thoughts, and ideas creating a sense of community. Our ERGs provide our employees meaningful community and global engagement, networking and mentoring opportunities, and an inclusive workplace culture. Through interaction with these groups, senior leadership can identify emerging and high-potential talent, acquire cultural knowledge, hear directly from employees who face challenges inherent in underrepresented groups, and strengthen diversity management skills. Our ERGs contribute to our market success by actively contributing to our broader DEI strategy. As of December 31, 2022, we had eleven ERGs globally focused on the following areas gender equity, generational diversity, cross-cultural appreciation, Black/African American, Hispanic/Latinx, Asian/ Asian-American Pacific Islander heritage, and LGBTQIA+ Pride. 
 We have published our diversity goals in our Sustainability Report as discussed under the heading Sustainability Report included elsewhere in this Item 1: Business .

Social and Human Rights Matters 
 We have policies related to our position on various social and human rights matters, including child labor, forced labor, human trafficking, health and safety, non-discrimination, and environmental matters. Each of these policies can be found on our website at www.sensata.com . Our human rights expectations apply to all our personnel, business partners, and other parties involved directly in our operations, products, or services. 
 We are committed to responsible corporate practices in the area of human rights and working conditions and we respect the United Nations Guiding Principles for Business and Human Rights (2011) and its principles within our operations and supply chains. We also align with practices recommended by industry standards such as the Global Automotive Sustainability Practical Guidance and the RBA Code of Conduct, which incorporate the International Bill of Human Rights, namely the Universal Convention of Human Rights (1948), the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights and the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights and its two Optional Protocols (1966). 
 We also adhere to the principles set forth in the fundamental International Labor Organization ("ILO") Conventions, namely the Forced Labor Convention (1930), the Minimum Age Convention (1973), the Worst Forms of Child Labor Convention (1999), and the ILO Declaration on Fundamental Principles and Rights at Work (1998). The working conditions of our employees are, at minimum, in compliance with internationally recognized labor standards and the laws of the countries we operate in. When national law directly conflicts with international human rights standards or does not fully comply with them, we seek ways to respect internationally recognized human rights. 
 Employee Engagement 
 Our long-term success depends on hiring, retaining, training, rewarding, and engaging employees. We strive to retain and engage employees by providing competitive pay and benefits packages, a challenging and rewarding work experience, and by consistently connecting how integral their work is to Sensata's larger purpose and to the work we do as a company. 
 We focus our employee communications on continual engagement, providing updates on our business, technology, and workforce, including learning opportunities. We work to provide our employees with information to help them feel connected to the business and company strategy and purpose, what we are doing to be a responsible corporate citizen and community neighbor, and how we add value to our customers and investors. 
 We recognize the importance of supporting our employees health and well-being. Accordingly, we regularly review our benefit offerings with external advisers with deep industry expertise in risk insurance, health insurance, and other employee benefits for advice and market expertise. We are committed to providing comprehensive and competitive benefits packages that attract, retain, and enhance the well-being of our employees by supporting their physical, financial, and emotional wellness.

We have a three-part annual training covering the topics discussed in the Code of Business Conduct and Ethics on Sensata Learning, our online global learning management system. 
 We hold an annual "Integrity Week," which focuses on integrity as a core value of the organization and underscores our commitment to operating responsibly, one of the four key priority areas outlined in our Sustainability Report. Integrity is at the core of what we do from how we govern ourselves to how we conduct our business and manage relationships with our stakeholders. The most recent Integrity Week, in fiscal year 2022, focused on Doing What s Right Every Day, Every Site. By sharing best practices and stories from their professional journeys, various executives and site leaders at Sensata illustrated how integrity is not just about doing the right thing but how it is intrinsic to delivering value and sustainability for our company, environment, and communities. 
 We believe our management team has the experience necessary to effectively execute our strategy and advance our product and technology leadership. Our chief executive officer and business leaders average approximately 25 years of industry experience. They are supported by an experienced and talented management team dedicated to maintaining and expanding our position as a global leader in the industry. For a discussion of the risks relating to the attraction and retention of management and executive management employees, see Item 1A: Risk Factors included elsewhere in this Report. 
 Sustainability Report 
 In June 2022, we published our second annual Sustainability Report, which shares our ESG strategies, performance, and goals that support our vision of creating a safer, cleaner, more efficient, more electrified, and increasingly more connected world. 
 Our sustainability efforts focus on four key areas of prioritization against which we measure progress: 
 Empowering our workforce : We nurture a culture that promotes diversity and inclusion and prioritizes employee health, safety, and well-being while supporting our communities and suppliers; 
 Innovating for Sustainability : We develop products and technology solutions that help create a safer, cleaner, more efficient, electrified, and connected world; 
 Protecting Our Environment : We focus on building products that reduce environmental impact and improve technological efficiencies while optimizing and reducing our operational footprint through energy, water, and waste reduction; 
 Operating Responsibly : We consider transparency and accountability fundamental in everything we do, guiding our approach to governance, risk management, and ESG management. 
 As described in the Sustainability Report, we conducted a materiality assessment to identify the ESG issues that were most important to our business and stakeholders. We identified the following key issues and set corresponding goals as follows: 
 DEI : Our goals in this area are by 2026 to reach (1) 30 female representation in manager and above roles worldwide and (2) 25 racial/ethnic diversity representation in manager and above roles in the U.S.; 
 Energy and Emissions : Our goals in this area are (1) to achieve carbon neutrality in our operations by 2050 and (2) to reduce greenhouse gas emissions intensity by 10 by 2026, from a 2021 baseline; 
 Responsible Sourcing : Our goals in this area are by 2026 to (1) achieve a 75 response rate on our responsible sourcing campaigns and (2) achieve 100 sourcing of conflict minerals and cobalt from smelters that are conformant with the Responsible Minerals Assurance Process or equivalent standard. 
 Environmental and Governmental Regulations 
 Our operations and facilities are subject to numerous environmental, health, and safety laws and regulations, both domestic and foreign, including those governing air emissions, chemical usage, water discharges, the management and disposal of hazardous substances and wastes, and the cleanup of contaminated sites. We are not aware of any threatened or pending material environmental investigations, lawsuits, or claims involving us or our operations.

Table of Contents 

Many of our products are governed by material content restrictions and reporting requirements, examples of which include: European Union ("EU") regulations, such as Registration, Evaluation, Authorization, and Restriction of Chemicals ("REACH"), Restriction of Hazardous Substances ("RoHS"), and End of Life Vehicle ("ELV"); U.S. regulations, such as the conflict minerals requirements of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act; and similar regulations in other countries, such as the German Explosives Act. Further, numerous customers across all end markets require us to provide declarations of compliance or, in some cases, extra material content documentation as a requirement of doing business with them. 
 We are subject to compliance with laws and regulations controlling the import and export of goods, services, software, and technical data. Certain of our products are subject to export regulations of the various jurisdictions in which we operate Controlled Items ). The export of many such Controlled Items requires a license from the applicable government agency. Licensing decisions are made based on the type of product, its destination, end use, end user, the parties involved in the transaction, national security, and foreign policy. As a result, export license approvals are not guaranteed. We have a trade compliance team and other systems in place to apply for licenses and otherwise comply with import and export regulations. Any failure to maintain compliance with such regulations could limit our ability to import or export raw materials and finished goods. These laws and regulations are subject to change, and any such change may limit or exclude existing or future business opportunities, require us to change technology, or incur expenditures to comply with such laws and regulations. 
 Compliance with environmental and governmental regulations and meeting customer requirements have increased our cost of doing business in various ways and may continue to do so in the future. We do not currently anticipate material capital expenditures during fiscal year 2023 for environmental control facilities. We also do not believe that existing or pending legislation, regulation, or international treaties or accords, whether related to environmental or other government regulations, are reasonably likely to have a material adverse effect in the foreseeable future on our business or the markets we serve, nor on our results of operations, capital expenditures, earnings, competitive position, or financial standing.

Additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us or that we currently deem immaterial may also impair our business, operations, liquidity, and financial condition. 
 If actions taken by management to limit, monitor, or control enterprise risk exposures are not successful, our business and consolidated financial statements could be materially adversely affected. In such case, the trading price of our common stock and debt securities could decline and investors may lose all or part of their investment. 
 Business and Operational Risks 
 We are subject to various risks related to public health crises, including the COVID-19 pandemic, which have had, and may in the future have, material and adverse impacts on our business, financial condition, liquidity, and results of operations. 
 Any outbreaks of contagious diseases and other adverse public health developments in countries where we operate could have a material and adverse impact on our business, financial condition, liquidity, and results of operations. As has occurred with the COVID-19 pandemic, a global pandemic could cause significant disruption to the global economy, including in all of the regions in which we, our suppliers, distributors, business partners, and customers do business and in which our workforce is

located. A global pandemic and efforts to manage it, including those by governmental authorities, could have significant impacts on global markets, and could have a significant, negative impact on our sales and operating results. Disruptions could include: partial shutdowns of our facilities as mandated by government decree; government actions limiting our ability to adjust certain costs; significant travel restrictions; work-from-home orders; limited availability of our workforce; supplier constraints; supply chain interruptions; logistics challenges and limitations; and reduced demand from certain customers. The COVID-19 pandemic has had, and could continue to have, these effects on the economy and our business. 
 As of December 31, 2022, we were still experiencing lingering disruptions of these types. The extent to which the COVID-19 pandemic will continue to impact our business and financial results going forward will be dependent on future developments such as the length and severity of the crisis, the potential resurgence of the crisis, variant strains of the virus, vaccine availability and effectiveness, future government actions in response to the crisis and the overall impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the global economy and capital markets, among many other factors, all of which remain highly uncertain and unpredictable. This unpredictability could limit our ability to respond to future developments quickly. Additionally, the impacts described above and other impacts of a global pandemic, including the COVID-19 pandemic and responses to it, could substantially increase the risk to us from the other risks described in this Item 1A: Risk Factors . 
 Our business is subject to numerous global risks, including regulatory, political, economic, governmental, and military concerns and instability. 
 Our business, including our employees, customers, and suppliers, is located throughout the world. We employ approximately 92 of our workforce outside of the U.S. We have many manufacturing, administrative, and sales facilities outside of the U.S. Our subsidiaries located outside of the U.S. generated approximately 61 of our net revenue in fiscal year 2022 (including approximately 20 in China) and we expect sales from non-U.S. markets to continue to represent a significant portion of our total net revenue. International sales and operations are subject to changes in local government regulations and policies, including those related to tariffs and trade barriers, economic sanctions, investments, taxation, exchange controls, and repatriation of earnings. 
 As a result, we are exposed to numerous global, regional, and local risks that could decrease revenue and/or increase expenses, and therefore decrease our profitability. Such risks may result from instability in economic or political conditions, inflation, recession, and/or actual or anticipated military or political conflicts, and include, without limitation: trade regulations, including customs, import, export, and sourcing restrictions, tariffs, trade barriers, trade disputes, and economic sanctions; changes in local employment costs, laws, regulations, and conditions; difficulties with, and costs for, protecting our intellectual property; challenges in collecting accounts receivable; tax laws and regulatory changes, including examinations by taxing authorities, variations in tax laws from country to country, changes to the terms of income tax treaties, and difficulties in the tax-efficient repatriation of earnings generated or held in a number of jurisdictions; natural disasters; and the impact of each of the foregoing on our business operations, manufacturing, and supply chain. 
 Other risks are inherent in our non-U.S. operations, including: the potential for changes in socio-economic conditions and/or monetary and fiscal policies; intellectual property protection difficulties and disputes; the settlement of legal disputes through certain foreign legal systems; the collection of receivables; exposure to possible expropriation or other government actions; unsettled political conditions; and possible terrorist attacks. These and other factors may have a material adverse effect on our non-U.S. operations and, therefore, on our business and results of operations. In addition, a scarcity of resources or other hardships caused by a global pandemic may result in increased nationalism, protectionism, and political tensions which may cause governments and/or other entities to take actions that may have a significant negative impact on our ability and the ability of our suppliers and customers to conduct business. 
 We have sizable operations in China, including two principal manufacturing sites. Economic and political conditions in China have been and may continue to be volatile and uncertain, especially as the U.S. and China continue to discuss and have differences in trade policies and the U.S. continues to add restrictions on both exports to China and use of materials from certain regions within China. In addition, the legal and regulatory system in China is still developing and is subject to change. Our operations and transactions with customers in China could continue to be adversely affected by increased tariffs and export restrictions and could be otherwise adversely affected by other changes to market conditions, changes to the regulatory environment, or interpretation of Chinese law.

Adverse conditions in the industries upon which we are dependent, including the automotive industry, have had, and may in the future have, adverse effects on our business. 
 We are dependent on market dynamics to sell our products, and our operating results could be adversely affected by cyclical and reduced demand in these markets. Periodic downturns in our customers industries could significantly reduce demand for certain of our products, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition, and cash flows. 
 Much of our business depends on, and is directly affected by, the global automobile industry. Sales in our automotive end markets accounted for approximately 52 of our total net revenue in fiscal year 2022. Declines in demand such as experienced as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic and other adverse developments like those we have seen in past years in the automotive industry, including but not limited to customer bankruptcies and increased demands on us for lower prices, could have adverse effects on our results of operations and could impact our liquidity and our ability to meet restrictive debt covenants. In addition, these same conditions could adversely impact certain of our vendors financial solvency, resulting in potential liabilities or additional costs to us to ensure uninterrupted supply to our customers. 
 We may incur material losses and costs as a result of product liability, warranty, and recall claims that may be brought against us. 
 We have been, and will continue to be, exposed to product liability and warranty claims in the event that our products actually or allegedly fail to perform as expected, or the use of our products results, or is alleged to result, in death, bodily injury, and/or property damage. Accordingly, we could experience material warranty or product liability losses in the future and incur significant costs to defend these claims. In addition, if any of our products are, or are alleged to be, defective, we may be required to participate in a recall of the underlying end product, particularly if the defect or the alleged defect relates to product safety and/or regulatory non-compliance. Depending on the terms under which we supply products, an OEM may hold us responsible for some or all of the repair or replacement costs of these products under warranty when the product supplied did not perform as represented. 
 The impact of the current global supply chain shortages includes various factors that could impact our actual or perceived liability due to quality issues, whether at a supplier or customer. Shortages of materials at our suppliers or customers could cause them to work longer production hours to meet demand, resulting in fatigue on manufacturing workers, delays in planned maintenance, and other factors that could impact the actual or perceived quality of our products. In addition, customers may be forced to assemble parts into the end product in an order not anticipated by design, or to assemble parts in a location without proper environmental controls (e.g. a parking lot), increasing the potential that our part fails through no fault of our own. While we would defend ourselves from warranty claims in these circumstances, there is no guarantee that we would prevail. 
 As we continue to develop products containing complex information technology IT systems designed to support today s increasingly connected vehicles, these systems result in potential increases to our risks in product safety, regulatory compliance, product liability, warranty, and recall claims. In addition, the warranty period for certain electric vehicle components is generally eight to ten years, which increases our risk for warranty claims over the life of a product. 
 In addition, a product recall could generate substantial negative publicity about our business and interfere with our manufacturing plans and product delivery obligations as we seek to repair affected products. Our costs associated with product liability, warranty, and recall claims could be material. 
 We are dependent on market acceptance of our new product introductions and product innovations for future revenue and we may not realize all of the revenue or achieve anticipated gross margins from products subject to existing awards or for which we are currently engaged in development. 
 Substantially all markets in which we operate are impacted by technological change or change in consumer tastes and preferences, which are rapid in certain markets. Our operating results depend substantially upon our ability to continually design, develop, introduce, and sell new and innovative products; to modify existing products; and to customize products to meet customer requirements driven by such change. There are numerous risks inherent in these processes, including the risk that we will be unable to anticipate the direction of technological change; that we will be unable to develop and market profitable new products and applications before our competitors or in time to satisfy customer demands; the possibility that investment of significant time and resources will not be successful; the possibility that the marketplace does not accept our products or services; that we are unable to retain customers that adopt our new products or services; and the risk of additional liabilities associated with these efforts.

Our ability to generate revenue from products pending customer awards is subject to a number of important risks and uncertainties, many of which are beyond our control, including the number of products our customers will actually produce, as well as the timing of such production. Many of our customer agreements provide for the supply of a certain share of the customer s requirements for a particular application or platform, rather than for a specific quantity of products. In some cases, we have no remedy if a customer chooses to purchase less than we expect. In cases where customers do make minimum volume commitments to us, our remedy for their failure to meet those minimum volumes may be limited to increased pricing on those products that the customer does purchase from us or renegotiating other contract terms. There is no assurance that such price increases or new terms will offset a shortfall in expected revenue. In addition, some of our customers may have the right to discontinue a program or replace us with another supplier under certain circumstances. As a result, products for which we are currently incurring development expenses may not be manufactured by our customers at all, or they may be manufactured in smaller amounts than currently anticipated. Therefore, our anticipated future revenue from products relating to existing customer awards or product development relationships may not result in firm orders from customers for the originally contracted amount. 
 We also incur capital expenditures and other costs and price our products based on estimated production volumes. If actual production volumes were significantly lower than estimated, our anticipated revenue and gross margin from those new products would be adversely affected. We cannot predict the ultimate demand for our customers products, nor can we predict the extent to which we would be able to pass through unanticipated per-unit cost increases to our customers. 
 Increasing costs for, or limitations on the supply of or access to, manufactured components and raw materials may adversely affect our business and results of operations. 
 We use a broad range of manufactured components, subassemblies, and raw materials in the manufacture of our products in both our Performance Sensing and Sensing Solutions segments, including those containing certain commodities (e.g. semiconductors, resins, and metals), which may experience significant volatility in their price and availability due to, among other things, new laws or regulations, including the impact of tariffs, trade barriers, trade disputes, export or sourcing restrictions, economic sanctions, and global economic or political events including government actions, labor strikes, suppliers' allocations to other purchasers, interruptions in production by suppliers, changes in foreign currency exchange rates, and prevailing price levels. 
 It has historically been difficult to pass increased prices for manufactured components and raw materials through to our customers in the form of price increases. Therefore, a significant increase in the price or a decrease in the availability of these items could materially increase our operating costs and materially and adversely affect our business and results of operations. However, the impact of the current global supply chain shortages, including production delays on a vast and varied number of products across industries and geographies and increased procurement and logistics costs, are unprecedented. Accordingly, we are actively working with our customers to share the inflationary burden of these factors. In addition, where possible, we are working to adjust our long-term supply agreements, strengthen our relationships with our suppliers, increase inventory on hand, increase visibility into long-term supply and demand, and accelerate the use of alternate materials to increase supply chain visibility. If the impacts of these shortages are more severe than we currently expect, it could result in further deterioration of our results, potentially for a longer period than currently anticipated. In addition, the impact of the current global supply chain shortages on one or more of our key suppliers could adversely impact our profitability. 
 We have entered into hedge arrangements for certain metals used in our products in an attempt to minimize commodity pricing volatility and may continue to do so from time to time in the future. Such hedges might not be economically successful. In addition, these hedges do not qualify as accounting hedges in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. Accordingly, the change in fair value of these hedges is recognized in earnings immediately, which could cause volatility in our results of operations from quarter to quarter. 
 In connection with the implementation of our corporate strategies, we face risks associated with the acquisition of businesses, the integration of acquired businesses, and the growth and development of these businesses. 
 In pursuing our corporate strategy, we often acquire other businesses. The success of this strategy is dependent upon our ability to identify appropriate acquisition targets, negotiate transactions on favorable terms, complete transactions, and successfully integrate them into our existing businesses. There can be no assurance that we will realize the anticipated synergies or cost savings related to acquisitions, including, but not limited to, revenue growth and operational efficiencies, or that they will be achieved in our estimated timeframe. We may not be able to successfully integrate and streamline overlapping functions from future acquisitions, and integration may be more costly to accomplish than we expect. In addition, we could encounter difficulties in managing our combined company due to its increased size and scope.

Subject to the terms of our indebtedness, we may finance future acquisitions with cash from operations, additional indebtedness, and/or by issuing additional equity securities. In addition, we could face financial risks associated with incurring additional indebtedness such as reducing our liquidity, limiting our access to financing markets, and increasing the amount of service on our debt. The availability of debt to finance future acquisitions may be restricted, and our ability to make future acquisitions may be limited. Refer to separate risk factor for additional information related to risks regarding our level of indebtedness. 
 In addition, many of the businesses that we acquire and develop will likely have significantly smaller scales of operations prior to the implementation of our growth strategy. If we are not able to manage the growing complexity of these businesses, including improving, refining, or revising our systems and operational practices, and enlarging the scale and scope of the businesses, our business may be adversely affected. Other risks include developing knowledge of and experience in the new business, integrating the acquired business into our systems and culture, recruiting professionals, and developing and capitalizing on new relationships with experienced market participants. External factors, such as compliance with new or revised regulations, competitive alternatives, and shifting market preferences may also impact the successful implementation of a new line of business. Failure to manage these risks in the acquisition or development of new businesses could materially and adversely affect our business, results of operations, and financial condition. 
 Restructuring our business or divesting some of our businesses or product lines in the future may have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition, and cash flows. 
 In pursuing our corporate strategy, we continue to evaluate the strategic fit of specific businesses and products and occasionally dispose of or exit businesses and products. The success of this strategy is dependent upon our ability to identify appropriate disposition targets, negotiate transactions on favorable terms, and complete transactions. Any divestitures may result in significant write-offs, including those related to goodwill and other intangible assets, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition. Divestitures could involve additional risks, including difficulties in the separation of operations, services, products, and personnel; the diversion of management's attention from other business concerns; the disruption of our business; and the potential loss of key employees. There can be no assurance that we will be successful in addressing these or any other significant risks encountered. In the year ended December 31, 2022, we sold various assets and liabilities comprising our semiconductor test and thermal business (collectively, the "Qinex Business"). Refer to Note 21: Acquisitions and Divestitures of our Financial Statements included elsewhere in this Report for additional information 
 We also may seek to restructure our business in the future by relocating operations, disposing of certain assets, or consolidating operations. There can be no assurance that any restructuring of our business will not adversely affect our financial condition, leverage, or results of operations. In addition, any significant restructuring of our business will require significant managerial attention, which may be diverted from our other operations. 
 Labor disruptions or increased labor costs have had, and may in the future have, adverse impacts on our business. 
 A material labor disruption or work stoppage at one or more of our manufacturing or business facilities could have a material adverse effect on our business. In addition, work stoppages occur relatively frequently in the industries in which many of our customers operate, such as the transportation industry. If one or more of our larger customers were to experience a material work stoppage for any reason, that customer may halt or limit the purchase of our products. This could cause us to reduce production levels or shut down production facilities relating to those products, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, and/or financial condition. 
 We operate in markets that are highly competitive and competitive pressures could require us to lower our prices or result in reduced demand for our products. 
 We operate in markets that are highly competitive, and we compete on the basis of product performance in mission-critical operating environments, quality, service, reliability, manufacturing footprint, and commercial competitiveness across the industries and end markets we serve. A significant element of our competitive strategy is to design and manufacture high-quality products that meet the needs of our customers at a commercially competitive price, particularly in markets where low-cost, country-based suppliers, primarily in China with respect to the Sensing Solutions segment, have entered the markets or increased their per-unit sales in these markets by delivering products at low cost to local OEMs. In addition, certain of our competitors in the transportation sensor market are influenced or controlled by major OEMs or suppliers, thereby limiting our access to these customers. Many of our customers also rely on us as their sole source of supply for many of the products that we have historically sold to them. These customers may choose to develop relationships with additional suppliers or elect to produce some or all of these products internally, primarily to reduce risk of delivery interruptions or as a means of extracting more value from us. Certain of our customers currently have, or may develop in the future, the capability to internally produce 
 21

the products that we sell to them and may compete with us with respect to those and other products and with respect to other customers. 
 Many of our customers, including transportation manufacturers and other industrial and commercial OEMs, demand annual price reductions. If we are not able to offset continued price reductions through improved operating efficiencies and reduced expenditures, these price reductions may have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and cash flows. In addition, our customers occasionally require engineering, design, or production changes. In some circumstances, we may be unable to cover the costs of these changes with price increases. Further, as our customers grow larger, they may increasingly require us to provide them with our products on an exclusive basis, which could limit sales, cause an increase in the number of products we must carry and, consequently, increase our inventory levels and working capital requirements. Certain of our customers, particularly in the automotive industry, are increasingly requiring their suppliers to agree to their standard purchasing terms without deviation as a condition to engage in future business transactions, many of which are increasing warranty requirements. As a result, we may find it difficult to enter into agreements with such customers on terms that are commercially reasonable to us. 
 Security breaches and other disruptions to our IT infrastructure could interfere with our operations, compromise confidential information, and expose us to liability, which could have a material adverse impact our business and reputation. 
 In the ordinary course of business, we rely on IT networks and systems, some of which are managed by third parties, to process, transmit, and store electronic information, and to manage or support a variety of business processes and activities. 
 We are at risk of attack by a growing list of adversaries through increasingly sophisticated methods. Because the techniques used to obtain unauthorized access or sabotage systems change frequently, we may be unable to anticipate these techniques or implement adequate preventative measures. In addition, we may not be able to detect breaches in our IT systems or assess the severity or impact of a breach in a timely manner. We have experienced attacks to our systems and networks and have from time to time experienced cybersecurity breaches, such as computer viruses and malware, unauthorized parties gaining access to our IT systems, and similar incidents, which to date have not had a material impact on our business. If we are unable to efficiently and effectively maintain and upgrade our system safeguards, we may incur unexpected costs and certain of our systems may become more vulnerable to unauthorized access. Additionally, we are an acquisitive organization and the process of integrating the information systems of the businesses we acquire is complex and exposes us to additional risk as we might not adequately identify weaknesses in the targets information systems, which could expose us to unexpected liabilities or make our own systems more vulnerable to attack. 
 Despite our cybersecurity measures (including employee and third-party training, monitoring of networks and systems, maintenance of backup and protective systems, and maintenance of cybersecurity insurance), our IT networks and infrastructure may still be vulnerable to damage, disruptions, or shutdowns due to attacks by hackers, breaches, employee error or malfeasance, power outages, computer viruses, malware and ransomware, telecommunication or utility failures, systems failures, natural disasters, or other catastrophic events. We also face the challenge of supporting our older systems and implementing necessary upgrades. 
 Moreover, as we continue to develop products containing complex IT systems designed to support today s increasingly connected world, these systems also could be susceptible to similar interruptions, including the possibility of unauthorized access. Further, as we transition to offering more cloud-based solutions that are dependent on the internet or other networks to operate with increased users, we may become a greater target for cyber threats, such as malware, denial of service, external adversaries, or insider threats. 
 These types of incidents affecting us or our third-party vendors could result in intellectual property or other confidential information being lost or stolen, including client, employee, or company data. Any such events could result in legal claims or proceedings, liability or penalties under privacy laws and/or export control laws, disruption in operations, and damage to our reputation, which could materially adversely affect our business. Further, to the extent that any disruption or security breach results in a loss of, or damage to, our data, or an inappropriate disclosure of confidential information, it could cause significant damage to our reputation, affect our relationships with our customers, lead to claims against us, and ultimately harm our business, financial condition, and/or results of operations.

Improper disclosure of confidential, personal, or proprietary data could result in regulatory scrutiny, legal liability, or harm to our reputation. Changes to data protection laws, new customer requirements, and changes to international data transfer rules could impose new burdens. 
 One of our significant responsibilities is to maintain the security and privacy of our employees and customers confidential and proprietary information. We maintain policies, procedures, and technological safeguards designed to protect the security and privacy of this information and regularly review compliance changes in the jurisdictions where Sensata operates. Nevertheless, we cannot eliminate the risk of human error, employee or vendor malfeasance, or cyber-attacks that could result in improper access to or disclosure or transfer of confidential, personal, or proprietary information by Sensata or our supply chain. Such access transfers could harm our reputation and subject us to liability under our contracts and the laws and regulations that protect personal and export-controlled data, resulting in increased costs, loss of revenue, and loss of customers. The release of confidential information could also lead to litigation or other proceedings against us by affected individuals, business partners, or by regulators, and the outcome of such proceedings, which could include penalties or fines, could have a significant negative impact on our business. 
 In many jurisdictions we are subject to laws and regulations relating to the use of this information. These laws and regulations are changing rapidly, are becoming increasingly complex, and can conflict across the jurisdictions in which we operate. Our failure to adhere to processes in response to changing regulatory requirements could result in legal liability, significant regulator penalties and fines, or impair our reputation in the marketplace. 
 The technological capabilities we are developing in the Sensata INSIGHTS business bring new risks to our company. Laws and regulations for smart vehicles are expected to continue to evolve in numerous jurisdictions globally, which could affect our product portfolio and operations. Further, managing and securing personal and customer data that our products, as well as our partners products, gather is a new and evolving risk for us. We must also prepare and adjust for rapid design philosophies associated with building these new solutions. 
 Our future success depends in part on our ability to attract and retain key senior management and qualified technical, sales, and other personnel. 
 Our future success depends in part on our continued ability to retain key executives and our ability to attract and retain qualified technical, sales, and other personnel. Significant competition exists for such personnel and we cannot assure the retention of our key executives, technical, and sales personnel or our ability to attract, integrate, and retain other such personnel that may be required in the future. We cannot assure that employees will not leave and subsequently compete against us. If we are unable to attract and retain key personnel, our business, financial condition, and results of operations could be adversely affected. 
 Financial Risks 
 We are exposed to fluctuations in currency exchange rates that could negatively impact our financial results and cash flows. 
 A portion of our net revenue, expenses, receivables, and payables are denominated in currencies other than the U.S. dollar (the "USD"). We, therefore, face exposure to adverse movements in exchange rates of currencies other than the USD, which may change over time and could affect our financial results and cash flows. For financial reporting purposes, we, and most of our subsidiaries, operate under a USD functional currency because of the significant influence of the USD on our operations. In certain instances, we enter into transactions that are denominated in a currency other than the USD. At the date that such transaction is recognized, each asset, liability, revenue, expense, gain, or loss arising from the transaction is measured and recorded in USD using the exchange rate in effect at that date. At each balance sheet date, recorded monetary balances denominated in a currency other than the USD are adjusted to USD using the exchange rate at the balance sheet date, with gains or losses recognized in other, net in the consolidated statements of operations. During times of a weakening USD, our revenue recognized in currencies other than the USD may increase because the non-U.S. currency will translate into more USD. Conversely, during times of a strengthening USD, our revenue recognized in currencies other than the USD may decrease because the local currency will translate into fewer USD.

Our level of indebtedness could adversely affect our financial condition and our ability to operate our business, including our ability to service our debt and/or comply with the related covenants. 
 The credit agreement governing our secured credit facility (as amended, the "Credit Agreement") provides for senior secured credit facilities (the "Senior Secured Credit Facilities") consisting of a term loan facility (the "Term Loan"), a 750.0 million revolving credit facility (the "Revolving Credit Facility"), and incremental availability (the "Accordion") under which additional secured credit facilities could be issued under certain circumstances. As of December 31, 2022, we had 4,273.4 million of gross outstanding indebtedness, including various tranches of senior unsecured notes (the Senior Notes ). Refer to Note 14: Debt of our Financial Statements included elsewhere in this Report for additional information related to our outstanding indebtedness. 
 Our substantial indebtedness could have important consequences. For example, it could make it more difficult for us to satisfy our debt obligations; restrict us from making strategic acquisitions; limit our ability to repurchase shares; limit our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our business and future business opportunities, thereby placing us at a competitive disadvantage if our competitors are not as highly-leveraged; increase our vulnerability to general adverse economic and market conditions; or require us to dedicate a substantial portion of our cash flows from operations to payments on our indebtedness if we do not maintain specified financial ratios or are not able to refinance our indebtedness as it comes due, thereby reducing the availability of our cash flows for other purposes. In addition, the Accordion permits us to incur additional secured credit facilities in certain circumstances in the future, subject to certain limitations as defined in the indentures under which the Senior Notes were issued. This could allow us to issue additional secured debt or increase the capacity of the Revolving Credit Facility. If we increase our indebtedness by borrowing under the Revolving Credit Facility or incur other new indebtedness under the Accordion, the risks described above would increase. 
 We cannot guarantee that we will be able to obtain enough capital to service our debt and fund our planned capital expenditures and business plan. If we complete additional acquisitions, our debt service requirements could also increase. If we cannot service our indebtedness, we may have to take actions such as selling assets, seeking additional equity investments, or reducing or delaying capital expenditures, strategic acquisitions, investments, and alliances, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our operations. Additionally, we may not be able to complete such actions, if necessary, on commercially reasonable terms, or at all. 
 If we experience an event of default under any of our debt instruments that is not cured or waived, the holders of the defaulted debt could cause all amounts outstanding with respect to the debt to become due and payable immediately, which, in turn, would result in cross-defaults under our other debt instruments. Our assets and cash flows may not be sufficient to fully repay borrowings if accelerated upon an event of default. If, when required, we are unable to repay, refinance, or restructure our indebtedness under, or amend the covenants contained in, the Credit Agreement, or if a default otherwise occurs, the lenders under the Senior Secured Credit Facilities could: elect to terminate their commitments thereunder; cease making further loans; declare all borrowings outstanding, together with accrued interest and other fees, to be immediately due and payable; institute foreclosure proceedings against those assets that secure the borrowings under the Senior Secured Credit Facilities; and prevent us from making payments on the Senior Notes. Any such actions could force us into bankruptcy or liquidation, and we might not be able to repay our obligations in such an event. 
 Changes in government trade policies, including the imposition of tariffs, may have a material impact on our results of operations. 
 We evaluate all trade policies that impact us, and we adjust our operational strategies to mitigate the impact of these policies. However, trade policies, including quotas, duties, tariffs, taxes, or other restrictions on the import or export of our products, are subject to change, and we cannot ensure that any mitigation strategies employed will remain available in the future or that we will be able to offset tariff-related costs or maintain competitive pricing of our products. The adoption and expansion of trade restrictions, the occurrence of a trade war, or other governmental action related to tariffs or trade agreements or policies has the potential to adversely impact demand for our products, our costs, our customers, our suppliers, and the global economy, which in turn could have a material adverse effect on our business, operating results and financial condition. 
 Existing duty reduction and deferral programs, such as free-trade agreements, duty drawback, and inward processing relief, provide beneficial impacts to our duties and tariffs for qualifying imports and exports, subject to compliance with each program s unique requirements. Changes in laws or policies governing the terms of these duty reduction and deferral programs could have a material adverse effect on our business and financial results. In addition, most of our facilities in Mexico operate under the Mexican Maquiladora program. This program provides for reduced tariffs and eased import regulations; we could be adversely affected by changes in such program, or by our failure to comply with its requirements.

Table of Contents 

Further tariffs may be imposed on other imports of our products or our business may be further impacted by retaliatory trade measures taken by China or other countries in response to existing or future U.S. tariffs or other measures (e.g., subsidies). We may raise our prices on products subject to such tariffs to share the cost with our customers, which could harm our operating performance or cause our customers to seek alternative suppliers. In addition, we may seek to shift some of our China manufacturing to other countries, which could result in additional costs and disruption to our operations. We also sell our products globally and, therefore, our export sales could be impacted by the tariffs. Any material reduction in sales may have a material adverse effect on our results of operations. 
 We have recorded a significant amount of goodwill and other identifiable intangible assets, and we may be required to recognize goodwill or intangible asset impairments, which would reduce our earnings. 
 We have recorded a significant amount of goodwill and other identifiable intangible assets. Goodwill and other intangible assets, net totaled approximately 4.9 billion as of December 31, 2022, or 56 of our total assets. Goodwill, which represents the future economic benefits arising from other assets acquired in a business combination that are not individually identified and separately recognized, was approximately 3.9 billion as of December 31, 2022, or 45 of our total assets. Goodwill and other identifiable intangible assets were recognized at fair value as of the corresponding acquisition date. Impairment of goodwill and other identifiable intangible assets may result from, among other things, deterioration in our performance, adverse market conditions, adverse changes in laws or regulations, significant unexpected or planned changes in the use of assets, and a variety of other factors. We consider a combination of quantitative and qualitative factors to determine whether a reporting unit is at risk of failing the goodwill impairment test, including: the timing of our most recent quantitative impairment tests and the relative amount by which a reporting unit s fair value exceeded its then carrying value, the inputs and assumptions underlying our valuation models and the sensitivity of our fair value measurements to those inputs and assumptions, the impact that adverse economic or market conditions may have on the degree of uncertainty inherent in our long-term operating forecasts, and changes in the carrying value of a reporting unit s net assets from the time of our most recent goodwill impairment test. 
 The amount of any quantified impairment must be expensed immediately as a charge that is included in operating income, which may impact our ability to raise capital. Should certain assumptions used in the development of the fair value of our reporting units change, we may be required to recognize goodwill or other intangible asset impairments. Refer to Note 11: Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets, Net of our Financial Statements included elsewhere in this Report for additional information related to our goodwill and other identifiable intangible assets. Refer to Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates , in Item 7: Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations included elsewhere in this Report for additional information related to the assumptions used in the development of the fair value of our reporting units. 
 Our global effective tax rate is subject to a variety of different factors that could create volatility in that tax rate, expose us to greater than anticipated tax liabilities, or cause us to adjust previously recognized tax assets and liabilities. 
 We are subject to income taxes in the United Kingdom (the "U.K."), China, Mexico, the U.S., and many other jurisdictions. As a result, our global effective tax rate from period to period can be affected by many factors, including changes in tax legislation, changes in tax rates and tax laws, our jurisdictional mix of earnings, the use of global funding structures, the tax characteristics of our income, the effects on our revenues and costs of complying with transfer pricing requirements under differing laws of various countries, consequences of acquisitions and dispositions of businesses and business segments, the generation of sufficient future taxable income to realize our deferred tax assets, and the taxation of subsidiary income in the jurisdiction of its parent company regardless of whether or not distributed. Significant judgment is required in determining our worldwide provision for (or benefit from) income taxes, and our determination of the amount of our tax liability is always subject to review by applicable tax authorities. Refer to Note 7: Income Taxes of our Financial Statements included elsewhere in this Report for additional information related to our accounting for income taxes. 
 We cannot provide any assurances as to what our tax rate will be in any period because of, among other things, uncertainty regarding the nature and extent of our business activities in any particular jurisdiction in the future and the tax laws of such jurisdictions, as well as changes in U.S. and other tax laws, treaties, and regulations, in particular related to proposed tax laws by the U.S. government as a result of a new administration, which could increase our tax liabilities. Our actual global tax rate may vary from our expectation and that variance may be material. We continually monitor all global regulatory developments and consider alternatives to limit their detrimental impacts. However, not all unfavorable developments can be moderated, and we may consequently experience adverse effects on our effective tax rate and cash flows. 
 For example, the European Commission (the "EC") has been conducting investigations of state aid and have focused on whether EU sovereign country laws or rulings provide favorable treatment to taxpayers conflicting with its interpretation of EU law. EC findings may have retroactive effect and can cause increases in tax liabilities where we considered ourselves in full compliance with local legislation.

Furthermore, on October 8, 2021, the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (the "OECD") announced most of its member jurisdictions agreed to the OECD s Inclusive Framework of the Base Erosion and Profit Shifting project, which establishes global minimum tax rules. These rules have begun to be reflected in local country laws where we do business and are expected to apply beginning in calendar 2024. The precise impact of these laws is not yet known, and we cannot provide assurances that Sensata can mitigate any increases in tax liabilities under these new rules. We continue to monitor developments and will react accordingly. 
 We could be subject to future audits conducted by both foreign and domestic tax authorities, and the resolution of such audits could impact our tax rate in future periods, as would any reclassification or other changes (such as those in applicable accounting rules) that increases the amounts we have provided for income taxes in our consolidated financial statements. There can be no assurance that we would be successful in attempting to mitigate the adverse impacts resulting from any changes in law, audits, and other matters. Our inability to mitigate the negative consequences of any changes in the law, audits, and other matters could cause our global tax rate to increase, our use of cash to increase, and our financial condition and results of operations to suffer. 
 We are a holding company and, therefore, may not be able to receive dividends or other payments in needed amounts from our subsidiaries. 
 We are organized as a holding company, a legal entity that is separate and distinct from our operating entities. As a holding company without significant operations of its own, our principal assets are the shares of capital stock of our subsidiaries. We rely on dividends, interest, and other payments from these subsidiaries to meet our obligations for paying principal and interest on outstanding debt, repurchasing ordinary shares, and corporate expenses. Certain of our subsidiaries are subject to regulatory requirements of the jurisdictions in which they operate or other restrictions that may limit the amounts that subsidiaries can pay in dividends or other payments to us. No assurance can be given that there will not be further changes in law, regulatory actions, or other circumstances that could restrict the ability of our subsidiaries to pay dividends or otherwise make payments to us. Furthermore, no assurance can be given that our subsidiaries may be able to make timely payments to us in order for us to meet our obligations. 
 Legal and Regulatory Risks 
 We could be adversely affected by violations of the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (the "U.S. FCPA"), the U.K.'s Bribery Act, and similar worldwide anti-bribery laws. 
 The U.S. FCPA, the U.K.'s Bribery Act, and similar worldwide anti-bribery laws generally prohibit companies and their intermediaries from making improper payments to government officials for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business. Our policies mandate compliance with these anti-bribery laws. We operate in many parts of the world that have experienced governmental corruption to some degree, and in certain circumstances, strict compliance with anti-bribery laws may conflict with local customs and practices. Despite our training and compliance program, we cannot provide assurance that our internal control policies and procedures will protect us from reckless or criminal acts committed by our employees or agents. Violations of these laws, or allegations of such violations, could disrupt our business and result in a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition, and/or cash flows. 
 Export of our products is subject to various export control regulations and may require a license for export. Any failure to comply with such regulations could result in governmental enforcement actions, fines, penalties, loss of export privileges, or other remedies, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, and financial condition. 
 We are subject to compliance with laws and regulations controlling the import and export of goods, services, software, and technical data. Certain of our products are subject to export regulations of the various jurisdictions in which we operate Controlled Items ). The export of many such Controlled Items requires a license from the applicable government agency. Licensing decisions are made based on type of product, its destination, end use, end user, the parties involved in the transaction, national security, and foreign policy. As a result, export license approvals are not guaranteed. We have a trade compliance team and other systems in place to apply for licenses and otherwise comply with import and export regulations. Any failure to maintain compliance with such regulations could limit our ability to import or export raw material and finished goods. These laws and regulations are subject to change, and any such change may limit or exclude existing or future business opportunities, require us to change technology, or incur expenditures to comply with such laws and regulations.

We have discovered in the past, and may discover in the future, deficiencies in our trade compliance program. Although we continue to enhance our trade compliance program, we cannot guarantee that any such enhancements will ensure full compliance with applicable laws and regulations at all times, or that applicable authorities will not raise compliance concerns or perform audits to confirm our compliance with applicable laws and regulations. Any failure by us to comply with applicable laws and regulations could result in governmental enforcement actions, fines, penalties, criminal and/or civil proceedings, or other remedies, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, and/or financial condition. 
 Changes in existing environmental or safety laws, regulations, and programs could reduce demand for our products, which could cause our revenue to decline. 
 A significant amount of our business is generated either directly or indirectly as a result of existing laws, regulations, and programs related to environmental protection, fuel economy, energy efficiency, and safety regulation. Accordingly, a relaxation or repeal of these laws and regulations, or changes in governmental policies regarding the funding, implementation, or enforcement of these programs, could result in a decline in demand for environmental and/or safety products, which may have a material adverse effect on our revenue. 
 Our operations expose us to the risk of material environmental liabilities, litigation, government enforcement actions, and reputational risk. 
 We are subject to numerous federal, state, and local environmental protection and health and safety laws and regulations in the various countries where we operate and where our products are sold. These laws and regulations govern, among other things, the generation, storage, use, and transportation of hazardous materials; emissions or discharges of substances into the environment; investigation and remediation of hazardous substances or materials at various sites; greenhouse gas emissions; product hazardous material content; and the health and safety of our employees. 
 We may not have been, or we may not always be, in compliance with all environmental and health and safety laws and regulations. If we violate these laws, we could be fined, criminally charged, or otherwise sanctioned by regulators. In addition, environmental and health and safety laws are becoming more stringent, resulting in increased costs and compliance burdens. 
 Certain environmental laws assess liability on current or previous owners or operators of real property for the costs of investigation, removal, and remediation of hazardous substances or materials at their properties or properties at which they have disposed of hazardous substances. Liability for investigation, removal, and remediation costs under certain federal and state laws is retroactive, strict, and joint and several. In addition to cleanup actions brought by governmental authorities, private parties could bring personal injury or other claims due to the presence of, or exposure to, hazardous substances. 
 We cannot provide assurance that our costs of complying with current or future environmental protection and health and safety laws, or our liabilities arising from past or future releases of, or exposures to, hazardous substances will not exceed our estimates or adversely affect our results of operations, financial condition, and cash flows, or that we will not be subject to additional environmental claims for personal injury, property damage, and/or cleanup in the future based on our past, present, or future business activities. 
 In addition, our products are subject to various requirements related to chemical usage, hazardous material content, and recycling. The EU, China, and other jurisdictions in which our products are sold have enacted, or are proposing to enact, laws addressing environmental and other impacts from product disposal, use of hazardous materials in products, use of chemicals in manufacturing, recycling of products at the end of their useful life, and other related matters. These laws include but are not limited to the EU RoHS, ELV, and Waste Electrical and Electronic Equipment Directives; the EU REACH regulation; the German Explosives Act; and the China law on Management Methods for Controlling Pollution by Electronic Information Products. These laws prohibit the use of certain substances in the manufacture of our products and directly and indirectly impose a variety of requirements for modification of manufacturing processes, registration, chemical testing, labeling, and other matters. These laws continue to proliferate and expand in these and other jurisdictions to address other materials and aspects of our product manufacturing and sale. These laws could make the manufacture or sale of our products more expensive or impossible, could limit our ability to sell our products in certain jurisdictions, and could result in liability for product recalls, penalties, or other claims.

Our ability to compete effectively depends, in part, on our ability to maintain the proprietary nature of our products and technology. 
 The electronics industry is characterized by litigation regarding patent and other intellectual property rights. Within this industry, companies have become more aggressive in asserting and defending patent claims against competitors. There can be no assurance that we will not be subject to future litigation alleging infringement or invalidity of certain of our intellectual property rights, or that we will not have to pursue litigation to protect our property rights. Depending on the importance of the technology, product, patent, trademark, or trade secret in question, an unfavorable outcome regarding one of these matters may have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition, and/or cash flows. 
 We may be subject to claims that our products or processes infringe on the intellectual property rights of others, which may cause us to pay unexpected litigation costs or damages, modify our products or processes, or prevent us from selling our products. 
 Third parties may claim that our processes and products infringe their intellectual property rights. Whether or not these claims have merit, we may be subject to costly and time-consuming legal proceedings, and this could divert management s attention from operating our business. If these claims are successfully asserted against us, we could be required to pay substantial damages, make future royalty payments, and/or could be prevented from selling some or all of our products. We also may be obligated to indemnify our business partners or customers in any such litigation. Furthermore, we may need to obtain licenses from these third parties or substantially re-engineer or rename our products in order to avoid infringement. In addition, we might not be able to obtain the necessary licenses on acceptable terms, or at all, or be able to re-engineer or rename our products successfully. If we are prevented from selling some or all of our products, our sales could be materially adversely affected. 
 We are a defendant to a variety of litigation in the course of our business that could cause a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition, and/or cash flows. 
 In the normal course of business, we are, from time to time, a defendant in litigation, including litigation alleging the infringement of intellectual property rights, anti-competitive behavior, product liability, breach of contract, and employment-related claims. In certain circumstances, patent infringement and antitrust laws permit successful plaintiffs to recover treble damages. The defense of these lawsuits may divert our management's attention, and we may incur significant expenses in defending these lawsuits. In addition, we may be required to pay damage awards or settlements, or become subject to injunctions or other equitable remedies, that could cause a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition, and/or cash flows. 
 U.K. Domicile Risks 
 As a public limited company incorporated under the laws of England and Wales, we may have less flexibility with respect to certain aspects of capital management. 
 English law imposes additional restrictions on certain corporate actions. For example, English law provides that a board of directors may only allot, or issue, securities with the prior authorization of shareholders, such authorization being up to the aggregate nominal amount of shares and for a maximum period of five years, each as specified in the articles of association or relevant shareholder resolution. English law also generally provides shareholders with preemptive rights when new shares are issued for cash; however, it is possible for the articles of association, or shareholders at a general meeting, to exclude preemptive rights. Such an exclusion of preemptive rights may be for a maximum period of up to five years as specified in the articles of association or relevant shareholder resolution. We currently only have authorization to issue shares under our equity plan excluding preemptive rights until our next annual general meeting. This authorization and exclusion needs to be renewed by our shareholders periodically and we intend to renew the authorization and exclusion at each annual general meeting. 
 English law also requires us to have available "distributable reserves" to make share repurchases or pay dividends to shareholders. Distributable reserves may be created through the earnings of the U.K. parent company or other actions. While we intend to maintain a sufficient level of distributable reserves, there is no assurance that we will continue to generate sufficient earnings in order to maintain the necessary level of distributable reserves to make share repurchases or pay dividends.

English law also generally prohibits a company from repurchasing its own shares by way of "off-market purchases" without the prior approval of our shareholders. Such approval lasts for a maximum period of up to five years. Our shares are traded on the New York Stock Exchange, which is not a recognized investment exchange in the U.K. Consequently, any repurchase of our shares is currently considered an "off-market purchase." Our current authorization expires on May 28, 2025, and we intend to renew this authorization periodically. 
 As a public limited company incorporated under the laws of England and Wales, the enforcement of civil liabilities against us may be more difficult. 
 Because we are a public limited company incorporated under the laws of England and Wales, investors could experience more difficulty enforcing judgments obtained against us in U.S. courts than would have been the case for a U.S. company. In addition, it may be more difficult (or impossible) to bring some types of claims against us in courts in England than it would be to bring similar claims against a U.S. company in a U.S. court. 
 As a public limited company incorporated under the laws of England and Wales, it may not be possible to effect service of process upon us within the U.S. to enforce judgments of U.S. courts against us based on the civil liability provisions of the U.S. federal securities laws. 
 There is doubt as to the enforceability in England and Wales, in original actions or in actions for enforcement of judgments of U.S. courts, of civil liabilities solely based on the U.S. federal securities laws. The English courts will, however, treat any amount payable by us under U.S. judgment as a debt and new proceedings can be commenced in the English courts to enforce this debt against us. The following criteria must be satisfied for the English court to enforce the debt created by the U.S. judgment: (1) the U.S. court having had jurisdiction over the original proceedings according to English conflicts of laws principles and rules of English private international law at the time when proceedings were initiated; (2) the U.S. proceedings not having been brought in breach of a jurisdiction or arbitration clause except with the agreement of the defendant or the defendant s subsequent submission to the jurisdiction of the court; (3) the U.S. judgment being final and conclusive on the merits in the sense of being final and unalterable in the court which pronounced it and being for a definite sum of money; (4) the recognition or enforcement, as the case may be, of the U.S. judgment not contravening English public policy in a sufficiently significant way or contravening the Human Rights Act 1998 (or any subordinate legislation made thereunder, to the extent applicable); (5) the U.S. judgment not being for a sum payable in respect of taxes, or other charges of a like nature, or in respect of a penalty or fine, or otherwise based on a U.S. law that an English court considers to be a penal or revenue law; (6) the U.S. judgment not having been arrived at by doubling, trebling or otherwise multiplying a sum assessed as compensation for the loss or damages sustained, and not otherwise being a judgment contrary to section 5 of the Protection of Trading Interests Act 1980 or is a judgment based on measures designated by the Secretary of State under Section 1 of that Act; (7) the U.S. judgment not having been obtained by fraud or in breach of English principles of natural justice; (8) the U.S. judgment not being a judgment on a matter previously determined by an English court, or another court whose judgment is entitled to recognition (or enforcement as the case may be) in England, in proceedings involving the same parties that conflicts with an earlier judgment of such court; (9) the party seeking enforcement (being a party who is not ordinarily resident in some part of the U.K. or resident in an EU Member State) providing security for costs, if ordered to do so by the English courts; and (10) the English enforcement proceedings being commenced within the relevant limitation period. 
 If an English court gives judgment for the sum payable under a U.S. judgment, the English judgment will be enforceable by methods generally available for this purpose. These methods generally permit the English court discretion to prescribe the manner of enforcement. In addition, in any enforcement proceedings, the judgment debtor may raise any counterclaim that could have been brought if the action had been originally brought in England unless the subject of the counterclaim was in issue and denied in the U.S. proceedings.

 (1) The owned portion of the properties in this location serves the Sensing Solutions segment only. 
 (2) Our U.K. headquarters is located in this facility. 
 (3) Our U.S. headquarters is located in this facility. 
 (4) This facility was added with the acquisition of Dynapower. 
 These facilities are primarily devoted to research, development, engineering, manufacturing, and assembly. In addition to these principal facilities, we occupy other manufacturing, engineering, warehousing, administrative, and sales facilities worldwide, which are primarily leased. 
 We consider our manufacturing facilities sufficient to meet our current operational requirements. An increase in demand for our products may require us to expand our production capacity, which could require us to identify and acquire or lease additional manufacturing facilities. We believe that suitable additional or substitute facilities will be available as required; however, if we are unable to acquire, integrate, and move into production the facilities, equipment, and personnel necessary to meet such an increase in demand, our customer relationships, results of operations, and/or financial condition may suffer materially. Leases covering our currently occupied principal leased facilities expire at varying dates within the next 14 years. We do not anticipate difficulty in retaining occupancy through lease renewals, month-to-month occupancy, or by replacing the leased facilities with equivalent facilities. 
 A significant portion of our owned properties and equipment is subject to a lien under the Senior Secured Credit Facilities. Refer to Note 14: Debt of our Financial Statements included elsewhere in this Report for additional information related to the Senior Secured Credit Facilities. 
 
 ITEM 3. LEGAL PROCEEDINGS 
 We are regularly involved in a number of claims and litigation matters that arise in the ordinary course of business. Although it is not feasible to predict the outcome of these matters, based upon our experience and current information known to us, we do not expect the outcome of these matters, either individually or in the aggregate, to have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition, or cash flows.

Dividends 
 In April 2022, our Board of Directors approved our first quarterly dividend of 0.11 per share, paid in May 2022. Subsequent to this payment, we made additional quarterly payments in August 2022 and November 2022, each at 0.11 per share. Because we are a holding company, our ability to continue to pay cash dividends on our ordinary shares may be limited by restrictions on our ability to obtain sufficient funds through dividends from our subsidiaries, including restrictions under the terms of the agreements governing our indebtedness. In that regard, our indirect, wholly-owned subsidiary, Sensata Technologies B.V. ("STBV"), may be limited in its ability to pay dividends or otherwise make distributions to its immediate parent company and, ultimately, to us. Refer to Note 14: Debt of our audited consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes thereto included elsewhere in this Report for additional information related to our dividend restrictions. 
 Additionally, certain of our subsidiaries may be limited in their ability to pay dividends or make other distributions to the extent that the shareholders' equity of such subsidiary exceeds the reserves required to be maintained by law or under its articles of association. Under the laws of England and Wales, we are able to declare dividends, make distributions, or repurchase shares only out of distributable reserves on our statutory balance sheet. Distributable reserves are a company s accumulated, realized profits, so far as not previously utilized by distribution or capitalization, less its accumulated, realized losses, so far as not previously written off in a reduction or reorganization of capital duly made. Realized reserves are determined in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards at the time the relevant accounts are prepared. We are not permitted to make a distribution if, at the time, the amount of our net assets is less than the aggregate of our issued and paid-up share capital and undistributable reserves or to the extent that the distribution will reduce our net assets below such amount. Subject to these limitations, the payment of future cash dividends will depend upon such factors as earnings levels, capital requirements, contractual restrictions, our overall financial condition, and any other factors deemed relevant by our shareholders and Board of Directors. 
 Under current United Kingdom ("U.K.") tax legislation, any future dividends paid by us will not be subject to withholding or deduction on account of U.K. tax, irrespective of the tax residence or the individual circumstances of the recipient shareholder. Shareholders should consult their tax advisors regarding their particular tax situation and the income tax consequences on any potential dividend income received from us.

ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS 
 The following discussion and analysis is intended to help the reader understand our business, financial condition, results of operations, and liquidity and capital resources. You should read the following discussion in conjunction with Item 1: Business and our audited consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes thereto (the "Financial Statements"), each included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K (this "Report"). 
 The statements in this discussion regarding industry outlook, our expectations regarding our future performance, liquidity and capital resources, and other non-historical statements are forward-looking statements. These forward-looking statements are subject to numerous risks and uncertainties including, but not limited to, the risks and uncertainties described in Item 1A: Risk Factors included elsewhere in this Report. Our actual results may differ materially from those contained in or implied by any forward-looking statements. 
 Overview 
 We innovate on behalf of our broad array of customers, solving some of their most difficult engineering challenges by providing our products and solutions in the areas that we consider our most significant growth drivers, Electrification, Insights/IoT, and Safe Efficient. Solving these mission-critical challenges enables us to deliver differentiated value for both our customers and shareholders while also investing in our growth opportunities and our people. Refer to Item 1: Business , included elsewhere in this Report, for additional discussion on our growth drivers, including megatrends. 
 In fiscal year 2022, we completed two notable acquisitions in Electrification and Insights/IoT, Dynapower and Elastic M2M, Inc. ("Elastic M2M"), respectively. Refer to Item 1: Business Business Combinations and Note 21: Acquisitions and Divestitures of our Financial Statements, each included elsewhere in this Report, for additional information related to these acquisitions. 
 We anticipate significant change in the markets that we serve over the next 10 years, as our customers transform their businesses and product portfolios to adjust to decarbonization trends. Many equipment categories are electrifying, and significant investment is being made in global infrastructure to support this trend. During fiscal year 2022, we recognized approximately 460 million of revenue in Electrification. In addition, new business wins ("NBOs") exceeded 1.0 billion in fiscal year 2022, an increase from NBOs of 640 million in fiscal year 2021. We define NBOs as incremental revenue to our current base of business that is expected to be recognized on average in the fifth year after entry into the agreement, when programs typically reach their normal volume. Accordingly, NBOs are an indicator of future revenue potential. Approximately 70 of those NBOs in fiscal year 2022 were in Electrification, which will help drive future revenue outgrowth in this megatrend. 
 Within our Insights/IoT megatrend initiative, we see a large and fast-growing market opportunity to deliver data insights across heavy, medium, and light vehicle fleets. The Sensata INSIGHTS business addresses this opportunity by providing data and video telematics, asset tracking devices, and other cloud-based solutions. In February 2022, we acquired Elastic M2M, which augments our cloud capabilities critical to delivering actionable sensor-based insights, continuing the expansion of Sensata INSIGHTS begun with the fiscal year 2021 acquisitions of Xirgo Technologies, LLC ("Xirgo") and SmartWitness Holdings, Inc. ("SmartWitness"). Refer to Item 1: Business , included elsewhere in this Report, for additional discussion of the acquisition of Elastic M2M. Sensata INSIGHTS revenue in fiscal year 2022 was approximately 173.3 million. 
 We believe regulatory requirements for safer vehicles, higher fuel efficiency, and lower emissions, as well as customer demand for operator productivity and convenience, drive the need for advancements in powertrain management, efficiency, safety, and operator controls. These advancements lead to sensor growth rates that we expect to exceed underlying production growth in many of our key end markets, which we expect will continue to offer us significant growth opportunities. In fiscal year 2022, according to third party data, global production of light vehicles increased approximately 6 from fiscal year 2021. Global production in the heavy vehicle and off-road ("HVOR") markets we serve decreased approximately 12 from fiscal year 2021. 
 Our consolidated revenue increased 5.5 in fiscal year 2022 from the prior year. Excluding a decrease of 2.4 attributed to changes in foreign currency exchange rates and an increase of 3.1 due to the net effect of acquisitions and divestitures, consolidated net revenue increased 4.8 on an organic basis. This reflects organic revenue growth of 3.9 in Performance Sensing and 7.5 in Sensing Solutions. Organic revenue growth (or decline), discussed throughout this Item 7: Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (this "MD A"), is a financial measure not presented in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles ("GAAP"). Refer to Non-GAAP Financial Measures included elsewhere in this MD A for additional information related to our use of organic revenue growth (or decline).

While our underlying markets were pressured by continuing supply chain disruptions, we produced 820 basis points of market outgrowth in fiscal year 2022, which includes higher pricing, content growth in the automotive and aerospace businesses, and new Electrification launches in our Industrial business. We use the term "market outgrowth" to describe the impact of an increasing quantity and value of our products used in customer systems and applications, above normal market growth. It is only loosely correlated to normal unit demand fluctuations in the markets we serve. We believe we can continue to deliver end market outgrowth based on our high levels of new business awards and our large and expanding pipeline of new opportunities. 
 Operating income for the year ended December 31, 2022 increased 36.9 million, or 5.8 , to 670.1 million (16.6 of net revenue) compared to 633.2 million (16.6 of net revenue) in the prior year. This increase was primarily due to higher volumes, improved pricing to offset inflationary material and logistics costs, partially offset by unfavorable movements in foreign currency, the impact from investments in the growth vectors of Electrification and Insights/IoT, and the divestiture of various assets and liabilities comprising our semiconductor test and thermal business (collectively, the "Qinex Business"). Refer to Results of Operations included elsewhere in this MD A for additional discussion of our earnings results for the year ended December 31, 2022. 
 We have sufficient cash to take advantage of strategic opportunities as they arise. We generated 460.6 million of operating cash flow in fiscal year 2022, ending the year with 1.2 billion in cash. In fiscal year 2022, we used approximately 631.5 million in cash for acquisitions and approximately 292.3 million for share repurchases. We also paid approximately 51.1 million in cash dividends. In fiscal year 2023, we will continue to return capital to shareholders through our dividend and opportunistic share repurchases. We expect improving free cash flow will naturally allow leverage to decline and returns on invested capital to improve over time. On January 31, 2023, we announced that we intended to pay down 250.0 million of principal on the balance outstanding of the term loan facility (the Term Loan under the senior secured credit facilities (the "Senior Secured Credit Facilities"). That payment was completed on February 6, 2023. 
 Our long-standing mission is to help create a cleaner, safer, and more connected world, not just for our customer's products but also through our own operations. We reduced our greenhouse gas emission intensity by more than 10 in fiscal year 2022, reaching our fiscal year 2026 target four years earlier than anticipated. In addition, we're on our way to achieving the other targets laid out in our Sustainability Report, bolstering the long-term sustainability and success of the company for all of its stakeholders.

Net revenue 
 We derive a significant portion of our revenue from sales into the automotive end market, and conditions in the automotive industry can have a significant impact on the amount of revenue that we recognize. Outside of the automotive industry, we sell our products and solutions to end-users in a wide range of industries, end markets, and geographic regions, and the drivers of demand for these products and solutions vary considerably and are influenced by industry, market, or geographic conditions. Changes in demand for these products and solutions could impact our revenue materially. Our overall net revenue is impacted by various factors, which we characterize as "organic" or "inorganic." Inorganic factors include fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates and the net effect of acquisitions and divestitures. 
 Organic factors include fluctuations in overall economic activity within the industries, end markets, and geographic regions in which we operate, which we term market growth. Other organic factors combine to reflect what we refer to as market outgrowth. Such factors include (but are not limited to): (a) the number of our products used within existing applications, or the development of new applications requiring these products, due to regulations or other factors; (b) the "mix" of products sold, including the proportion of new or upgraded products and their pricing relative to existing products; (c) changes in product sales prices (including quantity discounts, rebates, and cash discounts for prompt payment); (d) changes in the level of competition faced by our products, including the launch of new products by competitors; (e) our ability to successfully develop, launch, and sell new products and applications; and (f) the evolution of the markets we serve to safer, cleaner, and more efficient, electrified, and connected technologies. 
 While the factors described above may impact net revenue in each of our reportable segments, the magnitude of that impact can differ. For more information about revenue risks relating to our business, refer to Item 1A: Risk Factors included elsewhere in this Report. 
 Cost of revenue 
 We manufacture most of our products, subcontracting only a limited number to third parties. As such, our cost of revenue consists principally of the following: 
 Production Materials Costs. We source production materials globally to ensure a highly effective and efficient supply chain. However, we are still impacted by local market conditions, including fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates. A portion of our production materials contains certain commodities, resins, and metals, the cost of which may vary with underlying pricing and foreign currency exchange rates. We use forward contracts to economically hedge a portion of our exposure to the potential change in prices associated with certain of these commodities, including the impact of exchange rate fluctuations. The terms of these forward contracts fix the price of these commodities at a future date for various notional amounts. Gains and losses recognized on these derivatives are recorded in other, net and are not included in cost of revenue. Refer to Note 6: Other, Net of our Financial Statements included elsewhere in this Report for additional information. 
 Employee Costs. Wages and benefits, including variable incentive compensation, for employees involved in our manufacturing operations and certain customer service and engineering activities is reflected in cost of revenue. A substantial portion of these costs can fluctuate on an aggregate basis in direct correlation with changes in production volumes. These costs may decline as a percentage of net revenue due to economies of scale associated with higher production volumes, and conversely, may increase with lower production volumes. These costs also fluctuate based on local labor market conditions. We rely on contract workers for direct labor in certain geographies. As of December 31, 2022, we had approximately 1,800 direct labor contract workers worldwide. 
 Sustaining Engineering Activity Costs. Modifications of existing products for use by new and existing customers in familiar applications are included in cost of revenue, as are costs related to improvements in our manufacturing processes. 
 Other. Our remaining cost of revenue primarily consists of: gains and losses on certain foreign currency forward contracts that are designated as cash flow hedges; material yields; costs to import raw materials, such as tariffs; depreciation of fixed assets used in the manufacturing process; freight costs; warehousing expenses; maintenance and repair expenses; costs of quality assurance; operating supplies; and other general manufacturing expenses, such as expenses for energy consumption and operating lease expense. 
 36 

Table of Contents 

Changes in cost of revenue as a percentage of net revenue have historically been impacted by several factors, including: 
 changes in the price of raw materials, including the impact of changes in costs to import such raw materials, such as tariffs; 
 changes in customer prices and surcharges; 
 implementation of cost improvement measures aimed at increasing productivity, including reduction of fixed production costs, refinements in inventory management, design and process driven changes, and the coordination of procurement within each subsidiary and at the business level; 
 product lifecycles, as we typically incur higher costs associated with new product development (related to excess manufacturing capacity and higher production costs during the initial stages of product launches) and during the phase-out of discontinued products; 
 changes in production volumes, as a portion of production costs are fixed; 
 transfer of production to our lower-cost manufacturing facilities; 
 changes in depreciation expense, including those arising from the adjustment of PP E to fair value associated with acquisitions; 
 fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates; 
 changes in product mix; 
 changes in logistics costs; 
 acquisitions and divestitures acquired and divested businesses may generate higher or lower cost of revenue as a percentage of net revenue than our core business; and 
 the increase in the carrying value of inventory adjusted to fair value upon the application of purchase accounting associated with acquisitions. 
 Research and development expense 
 We develop products that address increasingly complex engineering and operating performance requirements to help our customers solve their most difficult challenges in the automotive, HVOR, fleet management, industrial, clean energy, and aerospace industries. We believe that continued focused investment in research and development ("R D") is critical to our future growth and maintaining our leadership positions in the markets we serve. Our R D efforts are directly related to timely development of new and enhanced products that are central to our business strategy. We continually develop our technologies to meet an evolving set of customer requirements and new product introductions. We conduct such activities in areas that we believe will increase our long-term revenue growth. Our development expense is typically associated with engineering core technology platforms to specific applications and engineering major upgrades that improve the functionality or reduce the cost of existing products. In addition, we continually consider new technologies where we may have expertise for potential investment or acquisition. 
 A large portion of our R D activities is directed towards technologies and megatrends that we believe have the potential for significant future growth, but that relate to products that are not currently within our core business or include new features and capabilities for existing products. Expenses related to these activities are less likely to result in increased near-term revenue than our more mainstream development activities. 
 R D expense consists of costs related to product design, development, and process engineering. Costs related to modifications of existing products for use by new and existing customers in familiar applications are presented in cost of revenue and are not included in R D expense. The level of R D expense in any period is related to the number of products in development, the stage of the development process, the complexity of the underlying technology, the potential scale of the product upon successful commercialization, and the level of our exploratory research. 
 Selling, general and administrative expense 
 Selling, general and administrative ("SG A") expense consists of all expenditures incurred in connection with the sale and marketing of our products, as well as administrative overhead costs, including: salary and benefit costs for sales and marketing personnel and administrative staff; share-based incentive compensation expense; charges related to the use and maintenance of administrative offices, including depreciation expense; other administrative costs, including expenses relating to information systems, human resources, and legal, finance, and accounting services; other selling and marketing related costs, such as expenses incurred in connection with travel and communications; and transaction costs associated with acquisitions. 
 37 

Table of Contents 

Changes in SG A expense as a percentage of net revenue have historically been impacted by a number of factors, including: 
 changes in sales volume, as higher volumes enable us to spread the fixed portion of our selling, marketing, and administrative expense over higher revenue (e.g. expenses relating to our sales and marketing personnel can fluctuate due to prolonged trends in sales volume, while expenses relating to administrative personnel generally do not increase or decrease directly with changes in sales volume); 
 changes in customer prices and surcharges; 
 changes in the mix of products we sell, as some products may require more customer support and sales effort than others; 
 new product launches in existing and new markets, as these launches typically involve a more intense sales and marketing activity before they are integrated into customer applications and systems; 
 changes in our customer base, as new customers may require different levels of sales and marketing attention; 
 fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates; and 
 acquisitions and divestitures - acquired and divested businesses may require different levels of SG A expense as a percentage of net revenue than our core business. 
 Depreciation expense 
 Depreciation expense includes depreciation of PP E, which includes assets held under finance lease and amortization of leasehold improvements. Depreciation expense is included in either cost of revenue or SG A expense depending on the use of the asset as a manufacturing or administrative asset. Depreciation expense will vary according to the age of existing PP E and the level of capital expenditures. 
 Amortization expense 
 We have recognized a significant amount of definite-lived intangible assets. Acquisition-related definite-lived intangible assets are amortized on an economic-benefit basis according to the useful lives of the assets, or on a straight-line basis if a pattern of economic benefits cannot be reliably determined. The amount of amortization expense related to definite-lived intangible assets depends on the amount and timing of definite-lived intangible assets acquired and where previously acquired definite-lived intangible assets are in their estimated life-cycle. In general, the economic benefit of a definite-lived intangible asset is concentrated towards the beginning of its useful life. 
 Restructuring and other charges, net 
 Restructuring and other charges, net consists of severance, outplacement, other separation benefits, and facility and other exit costs. These charges may be incurred as part of an announced restructuring plan or may be individual charges recognized related to acquired businesses or the termination of a limited number of employees that do not represent the initiation of a larger restructuring plan. Restructuring and other charges, net also includes the gain, net of transaction costs, from the sale of businesses, expense incurred from acquisition-related compensation arrangements, and other operating income or expense that is not presented elsewhere in operating income. 
 Amounts recognized in restructuring and other charges, net will vary according to the extent of our restructuring programs and other income or expense items not presented elsewhere in operating income. 
 Interest expense, net 
 As of December 31, 2022 and 2021, we had gross outstanding indebtedness of 4,273.4 million and 4,280.2 million, respectively. This indebtedness consists of a secured credit facility and senior unsecured notes. Refer to Note 14: Debt of our Financial Statements included elsewhere in this Report for additional information. 
 The credit agreement governing our secured credit facility (as amended, the "Credit Agreement") provides for the Senior Secured Credit Facilities, consisting of the Term Loan, the 750.0 million revolving credit facility (the "Revolving Credit Facility"), and incremental availability (the "Accordion") under which additional secured credit facilities could be issued under certain circumstances. 
 Our various tranches of senior unsecured notes (the "Senior Notes") accrue interest at fixed rates. However, the Term Loan and the Revolving Credit Facility accrue interest at variable interest rates, which drives some of the variability in interest expense, net. Refer to Item 7A: Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk included elsewhere in this Report for more information regarding our exposure to potential changes in variable interest rates. 
 38 

Table of Contents 

Interest income, which is netted against interest expense on the consolidated statements of operations, relates to interest earned on our cash and cash equivalent balances, and varies according to the balances in, and the interest rates provided by, these investments. 
 Other, net 
 Other, net primarily includes gains and losses associated with the remeasurement of non-USD denominated monetary assets and liabilities into USD, changes in the fair value of derivative financial instruments not designated as cash flow hedges, mark-to-market gains and losses on investments, losses on debt financing transactions, and net periodic benefit cost, excluding service cost. 
 Amounts recognized in other, net vary according to changes in foreign currency exchange rates, changes in the forward prices for the foreign currencies and commodities that we hedge, the value of equity investments recorded on our consolidated balance sheets at fair value, the number and magnitude of debt financing transactions we undertake, and the change in funded status of our pension and other post-retirement benefit plans. 
 Refer to Note 6: Other, Net of our Financial Statements included elsewhere in this Report for additional information related to the components of other, net. Refer to Item 7A: Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk included elsewhere in this Report for additional information related to our exposure to potential changes in foreign currency exchange rates and commodity prices. Refer to Note 14: Debt of our Financial Statements included elsewhere in this Report for additional information related to our debt financing transactions. 
 Provision for (or benefit from) income taxes 
 We are subject to income tax in the various jurisdictions in which we operate. The provision for (or benefit from) income taxes consists of: current tax expense, which relates primarily to our profitable operations in non-U.S. tax jurisdictions and withholding taxes related to interest, royalties, and repatriation of foreign earnings; and deferred tax expense (or benefit), which represents adjustments in book-to-tax basis differences primarily related to the step-up in fair value of fixed and intangible assets, including goodwill, acquired in connection with business combination transactions, the utilization of net operating losses, changes in tax rates, and changes in our assessment of the realizability of our deferred tax assets. 
 Our current tax expense is favorably impacted by the amortization of definite-lived intangible assets and other tax benefits derived from our operating and capital structure, including tax incentives in both the United Kingdom (the "U.K.") and China as well as favorable tax status in Mexico. In addition, our tax structure takes advantage of participation exemption regimes that permit the receipt of intercompany dividends without incurring taxable income in those jurisdictions. 
 While the extent of our future tax liability is uncertain, the impact of purchase accounting for past and future acquisitions, changes to debt and equity capitalization of our subsidiaries, and the realignment of the functions performed and risks assumed by our various subsidiaries are among the factors that will determine the future book and taxable income of each of our subsidiaries and of Sensata as a whole. 
 Our effective tax rate will generally not equal the U.S. statutory tax rate due to various factors, the most significant of which are described below. As these factors fluctuate from year to year, our effective tax rate will change. The factors include, but are not limited to, the following: 
 establishing or releasing a portion of the valuation allowance related to our gross deferred tax assets; 
 foreign tax rate differential - we operate in locations outside the U.S., including Belgium, Bulgaria, China, Malaysia, Malta, the Netherlands, South Korea, and the U.K., that historically have had statutory tax rates different than the U.S. statutory tax rate. This can result in a foreign tax rate differential that may reflect a tax benefit or detriment. This foreign tax rate differential can change from year to year based upon the jurisdictional mix of earnings and changes in current and future enacted tax rates, tax holidays, and favorable tax regimes available to certain of our foreign subsidiaries; 
 changes in tax laws and rates, also Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development ("OECD") developments and European Commission ("EC") challenges to sovereign European Union member states; 
 losses incurred in certain jurisdictions, which cannot be currently benefited, if it is not more likely than not that the associated deferred tax asset will be realized in the foreseeable future; 
 foreign currency exchange gains and losses; 
 as a result of income tax audit settlements, final assessments, or lapse of applicable statutes of limitation, we may recognize an income tax expense or benefit including adjustment of previously accrued interest and penalties; and 
 39

 Results of Operations 
 Our discussion and analysis of results of operations are based upon our Financial Statements included elsewhere in this Report. The Financial Statements have been prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP. The preparation of the Financial Statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the amounts reported therein. We base our estimates on historical experience and assumptions believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, and we re-evaluate such estimates on an ongoing basis. Actual results could differ from our estimates under different assumptions or conditions. Our significant accounting policies and estimates are more fully described in Note 2: Significant Accounting Policies of our Financial Statements included elsewhere in this Report and Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates included elsewhere in this MD A. 
 The table below presents our historical results of operations in millions of dollars and as a percentage of net revenue. We have derived these results of operations from our Financial Statements.

Net Revenue - Performance Sensing 
 Fiscal year 2022 vs. fiscal year 2021 
 Performance Sensing net revenue for the year ended December 31, 2022 increased 4.5 compared to the year ended December 31, 2021. Excluding a decrease of 2.7 attributed to changes in foreign currency exchange rates and an increase of 3.3 due to the effect of acquisitions, Performance Sensing net revenue increased 3.9 on an organic basis. Both the Automotive and HVOR operating segments contributed to these results as discussed below. 
 Automotive net revenue for the year ended December 31, 2022 increased 2.7 compared to the year ended December 31, 2021. Excluding a decrease of 3.0 attributed to changes in foreign currency exchange rates, automotive net revenue increased 5.7 on an organic basis. This organic revenue growth was primarily due to continued content growth and pricing. 
 HVOR net revenue for the year ended December 31, 2022 increased 9.0 compared to the year ended December 31, 2021. Excluding a decrease of 1.7 attributed to changes in foreign currency exchange rates and an increase of 11.4 due to the effect of acquisitions, HVOR net revenue decreased 0.7 on an organic basis. This organic revenue decline was primarily due to declining market conditions, largely offset by continued content growth and pricing. 
 Fiscal year 2021 vs. fiscal year 2020 
 Performance Sensing net revenue for the year ended December 31, 2021 increased 28.1 compared to the year ended December 31, 2020. Excluding an increase of 2.4 attributed to changes in foreign currency exchange rates and an increase of 3.4 due to the effect of acquisitions, Performance Sensing net revenue increased 22.3 on an organic basis compared to the year ended December 31, 2020. Both the Automotive and HVOR operating segments contributed to these results as discussed below. 
 Automotive net revenue for the year ended December 31, 2021 increased 17.6 compared to the year ended December 31, 2020. Excluding an increase of 2.5 attributed to changes in foreign currency exchange rates, automotive net revenue increased 15.1 on an organic basis. Although automotive production was constrained due to global supply chain shortages, resulting in muted end market growth of 1.2 for the year, we delivered organic revenue growth due to our continued outperformance relative to the automotive market, led by new product launches in powertrain and emissions, safety, and electrification-related applications and systems. 
 HVOR net revenue for the year ended December 31, 2021 increased 63.3 compared to the year ended December 31, 2020. Excluding an increase of 2.1 attributed to changes in foreign currency exchange rates and an increase of 14.8 due to the effect of acquisitions, HVOR net revenue increased 46.4 on an organic basis. This organic revenue increase is primarily due to recovery of customer production combined with our continued outperformance relative to the HVOR markets. Our China on-road truck business saw significant market outgrowth from the adoption of NS6 emissions regulations, and we are also benefiting from a wave of electromechanical operator controls being installed in new off-road equipment.

 Cost of revenue 
 Cost of revenue as a percentage of net revenue increased in fiscal year 2022, primarily due to the impacts of inflation on material and logistics costs and the unfavorable impact of product mix, partially offset by improved pricing. 
 Cost of revenue as a percentage of net revenue decreased in fiscal year 2021 primarily as a result of (1) higher volume and the nonrecurrence of productivity headwinds from our manufacturing facilities running at lower-than-normal capacity in fiscal year 2020 and (2) the nonrecurrence of a 29.2 million loss from fiscal year 2020 in intellectual property litigation originally brought against August Cayman Company, Inc. ("Schrader") by Wasica Finance GmbH ("Wasica"). These favorable impacts on cost of revenue as a percentage of revenue were partially offset by increased costs related to global supply chain shortages. 
 Research and development expense 
 We invest in R D in megatrend-related areas to design and develop differentiated solutions for the fast-growing trends impacting our customers businesses, Electrification and Insights/IoT. Megatrend-related R D expense in fiscal year 2022 was 68.5 million, an increase of 20.5 million from fiscal year 2021. We currently expect approximately 65 million to 70 million in total megatrend spend in fiscal year 2023, the vast majority of which will be recorded as R D expense. 
 Total R D expense increased in fiscal year 2022, primarily as a result of (1) higher spend to support megatrend growth initiatives and (2) incremental R D expense related to acquired businesses, partially offset by the favorable effect of foreign currency exchange rates. 
 R D expense increased in fiscal year 2021, primarily as a result of (1) higher spend to support megatrend growth initiatives, (2) incremental R D expense related to acquired businesses, and (3) the unfavorable effect of changes in foreign currency exchange rates, partially offset by the impact on fiscal year 2021 of ongoing savings resulting from cost reduction activities taken in fiscal year 2020. R D expense in fiscal year 2021 related to megatrends was 48.0 million, an increase of 22.0 million from fiscal year 2020. 
 Selling, general and administrative expense 
 SG A expense increased in fiscal year 2022, primarily as a result of (1) incremental SG A expense related to acquired businesses, including related transaction costs, (2) increased selling expenses attributed to organic revenue growth, and (3) higher share-based compensation, partially offset by the favorable effect of changes in foreign currency exchange rates. Refer to Note 21: Acquisitions and Divestitures and Note 4: Share-Based Payment Plans of our Financial Statements, included elsewhere in this Report, for additional information related to acquired businesses and share-based compensation, respectively. 
 SG A expense increased in fiscal year 2021, primarily as a result of (1) incremental SG A expense related to acquired businesses, including related transaction costs, (2) higher incentive compensation aligned to improved financial performance, (3) increased selling expenses attributed to organic revenue growth, and (4) the unfavorable effect of changes in foreign currency exchange rates. These increases were partially offset by the fiscal year 2020 completion of a project related to enhancements and improvements of our global operating processes to increase productivity and the resulting reduction in professional fees.

Amortization of intangible assets 
 Amortization expense increased in fiscal year 2022, primarily due to increased intangibles from recent acquisitions. Refer to Note 21: Acquisitions and Divestitures of our Financial Statements, included elsewhere in this Report, for additional information related to acquired businesses. 
 We expect amortization expense to be approximately 153.7 million in fiscal year 2023. Refer to Note 11: Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets, Net of our Financial Statements included elsewhere in this Report for additional information regarding definite-lived intangible assets and the related amortization. 
 Amortization expense increased in fiscal year 2021 primarily as a result of increased intangibles from recent acquisitions partially offset by the effect of the economic-benefit method of amortization as described in Note 2: Significant Accounting Policies of our Financial Statements included elsewhere in this Report. 
 Restructuring and other charges, net 
 We recorded a net credit of 66.7 million in restructuring and other charges, net in the year ended December 31, 2022, compared to a net charge of 14.9 million in the prior year, representing a favorable change in earnings of 81.6 million. This change was primarily due to (1) a gain of 135.1 million on the sale of the Qinex Business and (2) a gain of 8.6 million resulting from the reduction of the liability for contingent consideration for Spear Power Systems ("Spear"), partially offset by (1) expense of 48.9 million for acquisition-related compensation arrangements and (2) higher severance that does not represent the initiation of a larger plan. Refer to Note 5: Restructuring and Other Charges, Net of our Financial Statements, included elsewhere in this Report, for additional information on the components of restructuring and other charges, net. 
 Restructuring and other charges, net decreased in fiscal year 2021 primarily due to lower restructuring charges incurred as part of a plan commenced in fiscal year 2020 to reorganize our business in response to the potential long-term impact of the global financial and health crisis caused by the COVID-19 pandemic (the Q2 2020 Global Restructure Program ). Refer to Note 5: Restructuring and Other Charges, Net of our Financial Statements included elsewhere in this Report for additional information related to the Q2 2020 Global Restructure Program. 
 Operating income 
 In fiscal year 2022, operating income increased 36.9 million or 5.8 , to 670.1 million (16.6 of net revenue) compared to 633.2 million (16.6 of net revenue) in fiscal year 2021, primarily due to (1) the gain on the sale of the Qinex Business and (2) improvements in pricing to offset increased costs, partially offset by (1) the impact of inflation on our component and logistics costs, (2) higher acquisition-related incentive compensation, (3) the negative impact of product mix, (4) higher amortization, primarily due to acquired intangible assets, (5) higher spend to support our megatrends initiatives, and (6) the unfavorable effect of changes in foreign currency exchange rates. 
 In fiscal year 2021, operating income increased 295.5 million or 87.5 , to 633.2 million (16.6 of net revenue) compared to 337.7 million (11.1 of net revenue) in fiscal year 2020. This increase was primarily driven by improved gross margins, due mainly to (1) higher organic sales volumes and (2) the turnaround effect of the Wasica litigation settlement in fiscal year 2020, partially offset by (1) increased costs related to global supply chain shortages, and (2) lower restructuring costs. This effect of improved gross margins was partially offset by (1) higher spend to support megatrend growth initiatives, (2) higher incentive compensation aligned to improved financial performance, and (3) the turnaround effect of temporary salary reductions and furloughs taken in the second quarter 2020. 
 Interest expense, net 
 Interest expense, net did not change materially in fiscal year 2022, as the impact of various transactions and higher interest rates largely offset. Refer to the table detailing interest expense by debt instrument under the heading Indebtedness and Liquidity , included elsewhere in this MD A. On January 31, 2023, we announced that we intended to pay down 250.0 million of outstanding principal on the Term Loan. That payment was completed on February 6, 2023. 
 Interest expense, net increased in fiscal year 2021 primarily as a result of (1) interest expense in fiscal year 2021 related to the issuance of 1.0 billion aggregate principal amount of 4.0 senior notes due 2029 (the 4.0 Senior Notes ), (2) additional interest expense in fiscal year 2021 related to the 750.0 million aggregate principal amount of 3.75 senior notes due 2031 (the "3.75 Senior Notes") as a result of their issuance in fiscal year 2020, partially offset by reduced interest as a result of the redemption of the 750.0 million aggregate principal amount outstanding on the 6.25 senior notes due 2026 (the "6.25 Senior Notes") early in fiscal year 2021.

 Provision for income taxes 
 The components of provision for income taxes for the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021, and 2020 are described in more detail in the table below (amounts have been calculated based on unrounded numbers, accordingly, certain amounts may not appear to recalculate due to the effect of rounding):

 (2) We operate in locations outside the U.S., including Belgium, Bulgaria, China, Malaysia, Malta, Mexico, the Netherlands, South Korea, and the U.K., that historically have had statutory tax rates different than the U.S. statutory tax rate. This can result in a foreign tax rate differential that may reflect a tax benefit or detriment. This foreign tax rate differential can change from year to year based upon the jurisdictional mix of earnings and changes in current and future enacted tax rates. Certain of our subsidiaries are currently eligible, or have been eligible, for tax exemptions or reduced tax rates in their respective jurisdictions.

(3) During the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021, and 2020, we established an additional valuation allowance and recognized a deferred tax expense. The valuation allowance as of December 31, 2022 and 2021 was 249.5 million and 225.9 million, respectively. A significant portion of our valuation allowance is against interest carryforwards due to our assessment of our inability to utilize these carryforwards based on our forecasts of future taxable income. The remaining valuation allowance primarily relates to foreign tax credits, capital loss carryforwards, goodwill tax basis, and net operating losses in jurisdictions outside the U.S. It is more likely than not that these attributes will not be utilized in the foreseeable future. However, any future release of all or a portion of this valuation allowance resulting from a change in this assessment will impact our future provision for (or benefit from) income taxes. 
 (4) In China, we benefit from the R D super deduction regime. In the U.K., certain of our subsidiaries are eligible for lower tax rates under the "patent box" regime. In the U.S., we benefit from the federal research and development credit. 
 (5) The increase in our effective tax rate for the year ended December 31, 2022 is due to the tax accounting impacts of the divestiture of the Qinex Business, partially offset by separate intangible property transfers. For the year ended December 31, 2020, the decrease in our effective tax rate was due to a net 54.2 million deferred tax benefit in the fourth quarter of 2020 related to intangible property transfers. 
 (6) Refer to Note 7: Income Taxes of our Financial Statements included elsewhere in this Report for additional information related to other components of our rate reconciliation. 
 We do not believe that there are any known trends related to the reconciling items noted above that are reasonably likely to result in our liquidity increasing or decreasing in any material way. 
 Non-GAAP Financial Measures 
 This section provides additional information regarding certain non-GAAP financial measures, including organic revenue growth (or decline), adjusted operating income, adjusted operating margin, adjusted net income, adjusted earnings per share ("EPS"), free cash flow, adjusted corporate and other expenses, net debt, net leverage ratio, and adjusted earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization ("EBITDA"), which are used by our management, Board of Directors, and investors. We use these non-GAAP financial measures internally to make operating and strategic decisions, including the preparation of our annual operating plan, evaluation of our overall business performance, and as a factor in determining compensation for certain employees. 
 The use of our non-GAAP financial measures has limitations. They should be considered as supplemental in nature and are not intended to be considered in isolation from, or as an alternative to, reported net revenue growth (or decline), operating income, operating margin, net income, diluted EPS, operating cash flows, corporate and other expenses, total debt, finance lease, and other financing obligations, or EBITDA, respectively, calculated in accordance with U.S. GAAP. In addition, our measures of organic revenue growth (or decline), adjusted operating income, adjusted operating margin, adjusted net income, adjusted EPS, free cash flow, adjusted corporate and other expenses, net leverage ratio, and adjusted EBITDA may not be the same as, or comparable to, similar non-GAAP financial measures presented by other companies. 
 Organic revenue growth (or decline) 
 Organic revenue growth (or decline) is defined as the reported percentage change in net revenue, calculated in accordance with U.S. GAAP, excluding the period-over-period impact of foreign currency exchange rate differences as well as the net impact of material acquisitions and divestitures for the 12-month period following the respective transaction date(s). 
 We believe that organic revenue growth (or decline) provides investors with helpful information with respect to our operating performance, and we use organic revenue growth (or decline) to evaluate our ongoing operations as well as for internal planning and forecasting purposes. We believe that organic revenue growth (or decline) provides useful information in evaluating the results of our business because it excludes items that we believe are not indicative of ongoing performance or that we believe impact comparability with the prior-year period. 
 Adjusted operating income, adjusted operating margin, adjusted net income, and adjusted EPS 
 We define adjusted operating income as operating income, determined in accordance with U.S. GAAP, excluding certain non-GAAP adjustments which are described below. Adjusted operating margin is calculated by dividing adjusted operating income by net revenue determined in accordance with U.S. GAAP. We define adjusted net income as follows: net income (or loss) determined in accordance with U.S. GAAP, excluding certain non-GAAP adjustments which are described in Non-GAAP adjustments below. Adjusted EPS is calculated by dividing adjusted net income by the number of diluted weighted-average ordinary shares outstanding in the period. 
 45 

Table of Contents 

Management uses adjusted operating income, adjusted operating margin, adjusted net income, and adjusted EPS as measures of operating performance, for planning purposes (including the preparation of our annual operating budget), to allocate resources to enhance the financial performance of our business, to evaluate the effectiveness of our business strategies, in communications with our Board of Directors and investors concerning our financial performance, and as factors in determining compensation for certain employees. We believe investors and securities analysts also use these non-GAAP financial measures in their evaluation of our performance and the performance of other similar companies. These non-GAAP financial measures are not measures of liquidity. 
 Free cash flow 
 Free cash flow is defined as net cash provided by operating activities less additions to PP E and capitalized software. We believe free cash flow is useful to management and investors as a measure of cash generated by business operations that will be used to repay scheduled debt maturities and can be used to, among other things, fund acquisitions, repurchase ordinary shares, and (or) accelerate the repayment of debt obligations. 
 Adjusted corporate and other expenses 
 Adjusted corporate and other expenses is defined as corporate and other expenses calculated in accordance with U.S. GAAP, excluding the portion of non-GAAP adjustments described below that relate to corporate and other expenses. We believe adjusted corporate and other expenses is useful to management and investors in understanding the impact of non-GAAP adjustments on operating expenses not allocated to our segments. 
 Adjusted EBITDA 
 Adjusted EBITDA is defined as net income (or loss), determined in accordance with U.S. GAAP, excluding interest expense, net, provision for (or benefit from) income taxes, depreciation expense, amortization of intangible assets, and the following non-GAAP adjustments, if applicable: (1) restructuring related and other, (2) financing and other transaction costs, (3) deferred loss or gain on derivative instruments, and (4) step-up inventory amortization. Refer to Non-GAAP adjustments below for additional discussion of these adjustments. 
 Net leverage ratio 
 Net leverage ratio represents net debt (total debt, finance lease, and other financing obligations less cash and cash equivalents) divided by last twelve months ("LTM") adjusted EBITDA. We believe that the net leverage ratio is a useful measure to management and investors in understanding trends in our overall financial condition. 
 Non-GAAP adjustments 
 Many of our non-GAAP adjustments relate to a series of strategic initiatives developed by our management aimed at better positioning us for future revenue growth and an improved cost structure. These initiatives have been modified from time to time to reflect changes in overall market conditions and the competitive environment facing our business. These initiatives include, among other items, acquisitions, divestitures, restructurings of certain business, supply chain, or corporate activities, and various financing transactions. We describe these adjustments in more detail below, each of which is net of current tax impacts, as applicable. 
 Restructuring related and other : includes charges, net related to certain restructuring and other exit activities as well as other costs (or income) that we believe are either unique or unusual to the identified reporting period, and that we believe impact comparisons to prior period operating results. Such costs include charges related to optimization of our manufacturing processes to increase productivity. This type of activity occurs periodically, however each action is unique, discrete, and driven by various facts and circumstances. Such amounts are excluded from internal financial statements and analyses that management uses in connection with financial planning, and in its review and assessment of our operating and financial performance, including the performance of our segments. 
 Financing and other transaction costs : includes losses or gains related to debt financing transactions, losses or gains related to the divestiture of a business, and costs incurred, including for legal, accounting, and other professional services, that are directly related to an acquisition, divestiture, or equity financing transaction. 
 Deferred loss or gain on derivative instruments : includes unrealized losses or gains on derivative instruments that do not qualify for hedge accounting as well as the impact of commodity prices on our raw material costs relative to the strike price on our commodity forward contracts. 
 46 

Table of Contents 

Step-up depreciation and amortization : includes depreciation and amortization expense associated with the step-up in fair value of assets acquired in connection with a business combination (e.g., PP E, definite-lived intangible assets, and inventories). 
 Deferred taxes and other tax related : includes adjustments for book-to-tax basis differences due primarily to the step-up in fair value of fixed and intangible assets and goodwill, the utilization of net operating losses, and adjustments to our valuation allowance in connection with certain acquisitions and tax law changes. Other tax related items include certain adjustments to unrecognized tax benefits and withholding tax on repatriation of foreign earnings. 
 Amortization of debt issuance costs . We adjust our results recorded in accordance with U.S. GAAP by the amortization of debt issuance costs, which are deferred as a contra-liability against our long-term debt, net on the consolidated balance sheets and which are reflected in interest expense on the consolidated statements of operations. 
 Where applicable, the current income tax effect of non-GAAP adjustments. 
 Our definition of adjusted net income excludes the deferred provision for (or benefit from) income taxes and other tax related items described above. As we treat deferred income taxes as an adjustment to compute adjusted net income, the deferred income tax effect associated with the reconciling items presented below would not change adjusted net income for any period presented. 
 Non-GAAP reconciliations 
 The following tables present reconciliations of certain financial measures calculated in accordance with U.S. GAAP to the related non-GAAP financial measures for the periods presented.

 The amount of cash and cash equivalents held in these geographic regions fluctuates throughout the year due to a variety of factors, such as our use of intercompany loans and dividends and the timing of cash receipts and disbursements in the normal course of business. Our earnings are not considered to be permanently reinvested in certain jurisdictions in which they were earned. We recognize a deferred tax liability on these unremitted earnings to the extent the remittance of such earnings cannot be recovered in a tax-free manner. 
 In certain jurisdictions, our cash balances are subject to withholding taxes immediately upon withdrawal of funds to a different jurisdiction. In addition, in order to take advantage of incentive programs offered by various jurisdictions, including tax incentives, we are required to maintain minimum cash balances in these jurisdictions. The transfer of cash from these jurisdictions could result in loss of incentives or higher cash tax expense, but those impacts are not expected to be material. 
 Our cash and cash equivalent balances as of December 31, 2022 and 2021 were held in the following significant currencies:

Cash Flows 
 The table below summarizes our primary sources and uses of cash for the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021, and 2020. We have derived this summarized statement of cash flows from our Financial Statements included elsewhere in this Report. Amounts in the table below have been calculated based on unrounded numbers, accordingly, certain amounts may not appear to recalculate due to the effect of rounding. 
 For the year ended December 31, (In millions) 2022 2021 2020 Net cash provided by/(used in): Operating activities: Net income adjusted for non-cash items 586.4 678.2 405.3 Changes in operating assets and liabilities, net (125.8) (124.0) 154.5 Operating activities 460.6 554.2 559.8 Investing activities (590.6) (882.1) (182.1) Financing activities (353.5) 174.9 710.2 Net change in cash and cash equivalents (483.4) (153.0) 1,087.9 
 Operating Activities 
 Net cash provided by operating activities for the year ended December 31, 2022 decreased compared to the prior year, primarily due to lower net income, increases in receivables as our business and revenues grew, our decision to carry higher inventory levels to ensure continuity of supply in uncertain markets, and from acquisition-related compensation payments. Refer to Results of Operations included elsewhere in this MD A for discussion of the drivers of changes in net income from fiscal year 2022. 
 We have non-cancelable purchase agreements with various suppliers, primarily for services such as information technology support. The terms of these agreements are fixed and determinable. We have cash commitments under these agreements of 77.7 million and 11.2 million in fiscal years 2023 and 2024, respectively. Refer to Note 15: Commitments and Contingencies of our Financial Statements included elsewhere in this Report for additional information related to our non-cancelable purchase agreements. 
 Net cash provided by operating activities decreased slightly in fiscal year 2021 compared to fiscal year 2020. Net income adjusted for non-cash items increased significantly from fiscal year 2020, which was substantially offset by changes in working capital. Refer to Results of Operations included elsewhere in this MD A for discussion of the drivers of changes in net income from fiscal year 2020. In fiscal year 2021, management of working capital resulted in a reduction of cash due to higher raw material purchases in order to maximize production flexibility given widespread parts shortages in our supply chain and higher accounts receivables as a result of higher revenue and timing of receipts from customers. In addition, net cash provided by operating activities was reduced by cash paid at closing of certain acquisitions related to employee retention arrangements. 
 Investing Activities 
 Investing activities primarily include cash exchanged for the acquisition or divestiture of a business or group of assets, cash paid for additions to PP E and capitalized software, and the acquisition or sale of certain debt and equity securities. 
 Net cash used in investing activities for the year ended December 31, 2022 decreased compared to the corresponding period of the prior year primarily due to lower cash paid for acquisitions (Elastic M2M and Dynapower) and the receipt of 198.8 million of cash proceeds of from the divestiture of the Qinex Business. In fiscal year 2023, we anticipate additions to PP E and capitalized software of approximately 170.0 million to 180.0 million, which we expect to be funded with cash flows from operations. 
 Net cash used in investing activities increased in fiscal year 2021 primarily due to cash paid for acquisitions. In fiscal year 2021, we completed five acquisitions, Lithium Balance, Xirgo, Spear, SmartWitness, and Sendyne Corp. ("Sendyne"). 
 Financing Activities 
 In fiscal year 2022, we used net cash of 353.5 million in financing activities, compared to net cash of 174.9 million provided by financing activities in fiscal year 2021. This increased use of cash was primarily due to additional payments to repurchase our ordinary shares in fiscal year 2022, less cash received from debt financing in fiscal year 2022, and 51.1 million of cash used for payment of dividends, a program which we began in fiscal year 2022. We used 292.3 million of cash for share

repurchases, compared to 47.8 million in fiscal year 2021. We also issued 500.0 million aggregate principal amount of 5.875 senior notes due 2030 (the "5.875 Senior Notes") and redeemed 500.0 million aggregate principal amount of 4.875 senior notes due 2023 (the "4.875 Senior Notes") in fiscal year 2022, the cash impact of which largely offset. In fiscal year 2021, cash provided by financing activities was primarily the result of the issuance of 1.0 billion of the 4.0 Senior Notes, partially offset by the redemption of 750.0 million of the 6.25 Senior Notes. In addition, in fiscal year 2022 we used 13.7 million in cash related to debt financing transactions, compared to 33.1 million in the prior year. On February 6, 2023, we prepaid 250.0 million of outstanding principal on the Term Loan. 
 In fiscal year 2021, net cash provided by financing activities decreased primarily due to the impact of debt financing transactions. In fiscal year 2021, we issued 1.0 billion of 4.0 Senior Notes and redeemed the 750.0 million aggregate principal amount outstanding on the 6.25 Senior Notes, representing net cash inflow of 218.8 million (including associated fees). This compares to the issuance of 750.0 million aggregate principal amount of 3.75 Senior Notes in fiscal year 2020 and the borrowing and subsequent repayment of 400.0 million on the Revolving Credit Facility, which, including associated fees, provided net cash inflow of 732.8 million.

 Debt Instruments 
 As of December 31, 2022, our debt instruments included the Term Loan, 400.0 million in aggregate principal amount of 5.625 senior notes due 2024 (the "5.625 Senior Notes"), 700.0 million in aggregate principal amount of 5.0 senior notes due 2025 (the "5.0 Senior Notes"), 450.0 million aggregate principal amount of 4.375 senior notes due 2030 (the "4.375 Senior Notes"), the 3.75 Senior Notes, the 4.0 Senior Notes, and the 5.875 Senior Notes. 
 On June 23, 2022, we entered into an amendment (the Eleventh Amendment to (i) the credit agreement, dated as of May 12, 2011 (as amended, supplemented, waived, or otherwise modified, the Credit Agreement ), and (ii) the Foreign Guaranty, dated as of May 12, 2011. The Eleventh Amendment, among other things: increased the aggregate principal amount of the Revolving Credit Facility to 750.0 million; extended the maturity date of the Revolving Credit Facility to June 23, 2027 (subject to certain exceptions as described in Note 14: Debt of our Financial Statements included elsewhere in this Report); released

certain guarantors from their obligations relating to the Revolving Credit Facility and certain related obligations; and replaced the LIBOR-based interest rates referenced by the Credit Agreement regarding revolving credit loans. 
 On August 29, 2022, we completed the issuance and sale of the 5.875 Senior Notes. On September 28, 2022, we redeemed in full the 500.0 million aggregate principal amount outstanding on the 4.875 Senior Notes due 2023 in accordance with the terms of the indenture under which the 4.875 Senior Notes were issued, at a price of 101.0 of the aggregate principal amount of the outstanding 4.875 Senior Notes (which includes the applicable premium), plus accrued and unpaid interest to (but not including) the redemption date. 
 Refer to Note 14: Debt of our Financial Statements included elsewhere in this Report for additional information related to our debt transactions. 
 On February 6, 2023, we prepaid 250.0 million of principal on the Term Loan. 
 The aggregate principal amount of each tranche of our Senior Notes is due in full at its maturity date. The Term Loan must be repaid in full on or prior to its final maturity date. Loans made pursuant to the Revolving Credit Facility must be repaid in full at its maturity date and can be repaid prior to then at par. All letters of credit issued thereunder will terminate at the final maturity of the Revolving Credit Facility unless cash collateralized prior to such time. 
 The following table presents the remaining mandatory principal repayments of long-term debt, in millions, excluding finance lease payments, other financing obligations, and discretionary repurchases of debt, in each of the years ended December 31, 2023 through 2027 and thereafter. The table reflects the payment of 250.0 million principal amount of the Term Loan on February 6, 2023. Amounts have been calculated based on unrounded numbers, accordingly, certain amounts may not appear to recalculate due to the effect of rounding.

 Capital Resources 
 The Credit Agreement provides for the Senior Secured Credit Facilities consisting of the Term Loan, the Revolving Credit Facility, and the Accordion. 
 Our sources of liquidity include cash on hand, cash flows from operations, and available capacity under the Revolving Credit Facility. As of December 31, 2022, there was 746.1 million available under the Revolving Credit Facility, net of 3.9 million of obligations in respect of outstanding letters of credit issued thereunder. Outstanding letters of credit are issued primarily for the benefit of certain operating activities. As of December 31, 2022, no amounts had been drawn against these outstanding letters of credit. 
 Availability under the Accordion varies each period based on our attainment of certain financial metrics as set forth in the terms of the Credit Agreement and the indentures under which our Senior Notes were issued (the "Senior Notes Indentures"). As of December 31, 2022, availability under the Accordion was approximately 0.7 billion. Our primary historical uses of cash on hand have been to support the growth of the business through capital expenditures, acquire businesses that extend our market position within our key growth vectors of Electrification and Insights/IoT, and to repurchase our ordinary shares, augmenting our existing capital deployment strategies and enabling us to drive attractive returns on invested capital over the long-term. 
 We believe, based on our current level of operations for the year ended December 31, 2022, and taking into consideration the restrictions and covenants included in the Credit Agreement and Senior Notes Indentures discussed below and in Note 14: Debt of our Financial Statements included elsewhere in this Report, that these sources of liquidity will be sufficient to fund our operations, capital expenditures, ordinary share repurchases, and debt service for at least the next twelve months. However, we cannot make assurances that our business will generate sufficient cash flows from operations or that future borrowings will be available to us in an amount sufficient to enable us to pay our indebtedness or to fund our other liquidity needs. Further, our highly-leveraged nature may limit our ability to procure additional financing in the future.

The Credit Agreement provides that if our senior secured net leverage ratio exceeds a specified level, we are required to use a portion of our excess cash flow, as defined in the Credit Agreement, generated by operating, investing, or financing activities to prepay some or all of the outstanding borrowings under the Senior Secured Credit Facilities. The Credit Agreement also requires mandatory prepayments of the outstanding borrowings under the Senior Secured Credit Facilities upon certain asset dispositions and casualty events, in each case subject to certain reinvestment rights, and upon the incurrence of certain indebtedness (excluding any permitted indebtedness). These provisions were not triggered during the year ended December 31, 2022. 
 All obligations under the Senior Secured Credit Facilities are unconditionally guaranteed by certain of our subsidiaries (the "Guarantors"). The collateral for such borrowings under the Senior Secured Credit Facilities consists of substantially all present and future property and assets of our indirect, wholly-owned subsidiary, Sensata Technologies B.V. ("STBV"), and the Guarantors. 
 Our ability to raise additional financing, and our borrowing costs, may be impacted by short- and long-term debt ratings assigned by independent rating agencies, which are based, in significant part, on our performance as measured by certain credit metrics such as interest coverage and leverage ratios. As of January 27, 2023, Moody s Investors Service s corporate credit rating for STBV was Ba2 with a stable outlook, and Standard Poor's corporate credit rating for STBV was BB+ with a stable outlook. Any future downgrades to STBV's credit ratings may increase our future borrowing costs but will not reduce availability under the Credit Agreement. 
 The Credit Agreement and the Senior Notes Indentures contain restrictions and covenants (described in more detail in Note 14: Debt of our Financial Statements included elsewhere in this Report) that limit the ability of STBV and certain of its subsidiaries to, among other things, incur subsequent indebtedness, sell assets, pay dividends, and make other restricted payments. These restrictions and covenants, which are subject to important exceptions and qualifications set forth in the Credit Agreement and Senior Notes Indentures, were taken into consideration when we established our share repurchase programs and will be evaluated periodically with respect to future potential funding of those program. We do not believe that these restrictions and covenants will prevent us from funding share repurchases under our share repurchase programs with available cash and cash flows from operations. As of December 31, 2022, we believe that we were in compliance with all the covenants and default provisions under the Credit Agreement and the Senior Notes Indentures. 
 Share repurchase program 
 From time to time, our Board of Directors has authorized various share repurchase programs, which may be modified or terminated by our Board of Directors at any time. Under these programs, we may repurchase ordinary shares at such times and in amounts to be determined by our management, based on market conditions, legal requirements, and other corporate considerations, on the open market or in privately negotiated transactions, provided that such transactions were completed pursuant to an agreement and with a third party approved by our shareholders at the annual general meeting. 
 In July 2019 our Board of Directors authorized a 500.0 million share repurchase program (the "July 2019 Program"). During the year ended December 31, 2021, we repurchased approximately 0.8 million ordinary shares, at a weighted-average price per share of 59.28, under the July 2019 Program. As of December 31, 2021, approximately 254.5 million remained available under the July 2019 Program. 
 On January 20, 2022, we announced that our Board of Directors had authorized a new 500.0 million ordinary share repurchase program (the "January 2022 Program"), which replaced the July 2019 Program. Sensata s shareholders have previously approved the forms of share repurchase agreements and the potential broker counterparties needed to execute the buyback program. 
 During the year ended December 31, 2022, we repurchased approximately 6.3 million ordinary shares under the January 2022 Program, at a weighted-average price per share of 46.08. As of December 31, 2022, approximately 224.5 million remained available under the January 2022 Program. 
 Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates 
 As discussed in Note 2: Significant Accounting Policies of our Financial Statements included elsewhere in this Report, which more fully describes our significant accounting policies, the preparation of consolidated financial statements in accordance with U.S. GAAP requires us to exercise judgment in the process of applying our accounting policies. It also requires that we make estimates and assumptions about future events that affect the amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes. The accounting policies and estimates that we believe are most critical to the portrayal of our financial 
 54 

Table of Contents 

condition and results of operations are listed below. We believe these policies require the most difficult, subjective, and complex judgments in estimating the effect of inherent uncertainties. 
 Revenue Recognition 
 The discussion below details the most significant judgments and estimates we make regarding recognition of revenue in accordance with FASB ASC Topic 606, Revenue from Contracts with Customers . In accordance with FASB ASC Topic 606, we recognize revenue to depict the transfer of promised goods to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which we expect to be entitled in exchange for those goods, using a five-step model. The most critical judgments and estimates we make in the implementation of this model relate to identifying the contract with the customer and determination of the transaction price associated with the performance obligation(s) in the contract, specifically related to variable consideration. 
 While many of the agreements with our customers specify certain terms and conditions that apply to any transaction between the parties, many of which are in effect for a defined term, the vast majority of these agreements do not result in contracts (as defined in FASB ASC Topic 606) because they do not create enforceable rights and obligations on the parties. Specifically, (1) the parties are not committed to perform any obligations in accordance with the specified terms and conditions until a customer purchase order is received and accepted by us and (2) there is a unilateral right of each party to terminate the agreement at any time without compensating the other party. For this reason, the vast majority of our contracts (as defined in FASB ASC Topic 606) are customer purchase orders. If this assessment were to change, it could result in a material change to the amount of net revenue recognized in a period. 
 The transaction price is the amount of consideration to which an entity expects to be entitled in exchange for transferring promised goods or services to a customer. In determining the transaction price related to a contract, we determine whether the amount promised in a contract includes a variable amount (variable consideration). Variable consideration may be specified in the customer purchase order, in another agreement that identifies terms and conditions of the transaction, or based on our customary practices. We have identified certain types of variable consideration that may be included in the transaction price related to our contracts, including sales returns (which generally include a right of return for defective or non-conforming product) and trade discounts (including retrospective volume discounts and early payment incentives). Such variable consideration has not historically been material. However, should our judgments and estimates regarding variable consideration change, it could result in a material change to the amount of net revenue recognized in a period. 
 Goodwill, Intangible Assets, and Long-Lived Assets 
 Businesses acquired are recognized at their fair value on the date of acquisition, with the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed recognized as goodwill. Intangible assets acquired may include either definite-lived or indefinite-lived intangible assets, or both. In accordance with FASB ASC Topic 350, Intangibles Goodwill and Other , goodwill and intangible assets determined to have an indefinite useful life are not amortized. Instead these assets are evaluated for impairment on an annual basis, and whenever events or business conditions change that could indicate that the asset is impaired. 
 Goodwill 
 Our judgments regarding the existence of indicators of goodwill impairment are based on several factors, including the performance of the end markets served by our customers, as well as the actual financial performance of our reporting units and their respective financial forecasts over the long-term. We evaluate goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets for impairment in the fourth quarter of each fiscal year, unless events occur which trigger the need for an earlier impairment review. 
 Identification of reporting units. We have six identified reporting units, Automotive, HVOR, Sensata INSIGHTS, Industrial Solutions, Aerospace, and Clean Energy Solutions. These reporting units have been identified based on the definitions and guidance provided in FASB ASC Topic 350. Identification of reporting units includes an analysis of the components that comprise each of our operating segments, which considers, among other things, the manner in which we operate our business and the availability of discrete financial information. Components of an operating segment are aggregated to form one reporting unit if the components have similar economic characteristics. We periodically review these reporting units to ensure that they continue to reflect the manner in which the business is operated. 
 Assignment of assets, liabilities, and goodwill to reporting units. Some assets and liabilities relate to the operations of multiple reporting units. We allocate these assets and liabilities to the reporting units based on methods that we believe are reasonable and supportable. We apply that allocation method on a consistent basis from year to year. Other assets and liabilities, such as 
 55 

Table of Contents 

debt, cash and cash equivalents, and PP E associated with our corporate offices, are viewed as being corporate in nature. Accordingly, we do not assign these assets and liabilities to our reporting units. 
 In the event we reorganize our business, we reassign the assets (including goodwill) and liabilities among the affected reporting units using a reasonable and supportable methodology. As businesses are acquired, we assign assets acquired (including goodwill) and liabilities assumed to a new or existing reporting unit as of the date of the acquisition. In the event a disposal group meets the definition of a business, goodwill is allocated to the disposal group based on the relative fair value of the disposal group to the retained portion of the related reporting unit. 
 Evaluation of goodwill for impairment. We have the option to first assess qualitative factors to determine whether a quantitative analysis must be performed. The objective of a qualitative analysis is to assess whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying value. We make this assessment based on macroeconomic conditions, industry and market considerations, cost factors, overall financial performance, and other relevant factors as applicable. If we elect not to use this option, or if we determine that it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying value, then we prepare a discounted cash flow analysis to determine whether the carrying value of the reporting unit exceeds its estimated fair value. If the carrying value of a reporting unit exceeds its estimated fair value, we recognize an impairment of goodwill for the amount of this excess, in accordance with the guidance in FASB ASC Topic 350. 
 We evaluated the goodwill of each reporting unit for impairment as of October 1, 2022 using a quantitative method. As a result of this evaluation we determined that none of our reporting units were impaired. In performing our evaluation under the quantitative method, we estimated the fair values of our reporting units using the discounted cash flow method. For this method, we prepared detailed annual projections of future net cash flows for the reporting unit for the subsequent five fiscal years (the "Discrete Projection Period"). We estimated the value of the net cash flows beyond the fifth fiscal year (the "Terminal Year") by applying a multiple to the projected Terminal Year EBITDA. The net cash flows from the Discrete Projection Period and the Terminal Year were discounted at an estimated weighted-average cost of capital ("WACC") appropriate for each reporting unit. The estimated WACC was derived, in part, from comparable companies appropriate to each reporting unit. We believe that our procedures for estimating discounted future net cash flows, including the Terminal Year valuation, were reasonable and consistent with accepted valuation practices. 
 The preparation of forecasts of revenue growth and profitability for use in the long-range forecasts, the selection of the discount rates, and the estimation of the multiples used in valuing the Terminal Year involve significant judgments. Changes to these assumptions could affect the estimated fair value of one or more of our reporting units and could result in a goodwill impairment charge in a future period. 
 Types of events that could result in a goodwill impairment. As noted above, the assumptions used in the quantitative calculation of fair value of our reporting units, including the long-range forecasts, the selection of the discount rates, and the estimation of the multiples or long-term growth rates used in valuing the Terminal Year involve significant judgments. Changes to these assumptions could affect the estimated fair values of our reporting units calculated in prior years and could result in a goodwill impairment charge in a future period. We believe that certain factors, such as a future recession, any material adverse conditions in the automotive industry and other industries in which we operate, and other factors identified in Item 1A: Risk Factors included elsewhere in this Report could cause us to revise our long-term projections and could reduce the multiples used to determine Terminal Year value. Such revisions could result in a goodwill impairment charge in the future. 
 We consider a combination of quantitative and qualitative factors to determine whether a reporting unit is at risk of failing the goodwill impairment test, including: the timing of our most recent quantitative impairment tests and the relative amount by which a reporting unit s fair value exceeded its then carrying value, the inputs and assumptions underlying our valuation models and the sensitivity of our fair value measurements to those inputs and assumptions, the impact that adverse economic or market conditions may have on the degree of uncertainty inherent in our long-term operating forecasts, and changes in the carrying value of a reporting unit s net assets from the time of our most recent goodwill impairment test. We also consider the impact of recent acquisitions in our expectations of the reporting units, and how these acquisitions perform against their original expected performance, as these might put pressure on the reporting units' fair value over carrying value in the short term. Based on the results of this analysis, we do not consider any of our reporting units to be at risk of failing the goodwill impairment test. 
 Evaluation of other intangible assets for impairment 
 Indefinite-lived intangible assets. Similar to goodwill, we perform an annual impairment review of our indefinite-lived intangible assets in the fourth quarter of each fiscal year, unless events occur that trigger the need for an earlier impairment review. We have the option to first assess qualitative factors in determining whether it is more likely than not that an indefinite-lived intangible asset is impaired. If we elect not to use this option, or we determine that it is more likely than not that the asset is impaired, we perform a quantitative impairment analysis in which we estimate the fair value of the indefinite-lived intangible 
 56 

Table of Contents 

asset and compare that amount to its carrying value. In performing this analysis, we estimate the fair value by using the relief-from-royalty method, in which we make assumptions about future conditions impacting the fair value of our indefinite-lived intangible assets, including projected growth rates, cost of capital, effective tax rates, and royalty rates. Impairment, if any, is based on the excess of the carrying value over the fair value of these assets. 
 We evaluated our indefinite-lived intangible assets for impairment as of October 1, 2022 (using the quantitative method) and determined that the estimated fair values of these assets exceeded their carrying values at that date. Should certain assumptions used in the development of the fair values of our indefinite-lived intangible assets change, we may be required to recognize an impairment charge in the future. 
 Definite-lived intangible assets. Reviews are regularly performed to determine whether facts or circumstances exist that indicate that the carrying values of our definite-lived intangible assets to be held and used are impaired. If we determine that such facts or circumstances exist, we estimate the recoverability of these assets by comparing the projected undiscounted net cash flows associated with these assets to their respective carrying values. If the sum of the projected undiscounted net cash flows falls below the carrying value of an asset, the impairment charge is measured as the excess of the carrying value over the fair value of that asset. We determine fair value by using the appropriate income approach valuation methodology depending on the nature of the definite-lived intangible asset. 
 Evaluation of long-lived assets for impairment 
 We periodically re-evaluate the carrying values and estimated useful lives of long-lived assets whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying values of these assets may not be recoverable. We use estimates of undiscounted net cash flows from long-lived assets to determine whether the carrying values of such assets are recoverable over the assets remaining useful lives. These estimates include assumptions about our future performance and the performance of the end markets we serve. If an asset is determined to be impaired, the impairment is the amount by which its carrying value exceeds its fair value. These evaluations are performed at a level where discrete net cash flows may be attributed to either an individual asset or a group of assets. 
 Income Taxes 
 As part of the process of preparing our financial statements, we are required to estimate our provision for (or benefit from) income taxes in each of the jurisdictions in which we operate. This involves estimating our current tax expense, including assessing the risks associated with tax audits, together with assessing temporary differences resulting from the different treatment of items for tax and accounting purposes. These differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities. Management judgment is required in determining various elements of our provision for (or benefit from) income taxes, including the amount of tax benefits on uncertain tax positions, and deferred tax assets that should be recognized. 
 In accordance with FASB ASC Topic 740, Income Taxes , we record uncertain tax positions on the basis of a two-step process. First, we determine whether it is more likely than not that the tax positions will be sustained based on the technical merits of the position. Second, for those tax positions that meet the more-likely-than-not recognition threshold, we recognize the largest amount of tax benefit that is greater than 50 percent likely to be realized upon ultimate settlement with the relevant tax authority. Significant judgment is required in evaluating whether our tax positions meet this two-step process. The more-likely-than-not recognition threshold must be met in each reporting period to support continued recognition of any tax benefits claimed, both in the current year, as well as any year which remains open for review by the relevant tax authority at the balance sheet date. Penalties and interest related to uncertain tax positions may be classified as either income taxes or another expense line item in the consolidated statements of operations. We classify interest and penalties related to uncertain tax positions within the provision for (or benefit from) income taxes line of the consolidated statements of operations. 
 We recognize deferred tax assets to the extent that we believe these assets are more likely than not to be realized. In measuring our deferred tax assets, we consider all available evidence, both positive and negative, including future reversals of existing taxable temporary differences, projected future taxable income, tax-planning strategies, and results of recent operations in various jurisdictions, to determine whether, based on the weight of that evidence, a valuation allowance is needed for all or some portion of the deferred tax assets. Significant judgment is required in considering the relative impact of these items along with the weight that should be given to each category, commensurate with the extent to which it can be objectively verified. The more negative evidence that exists, the more positive evidence is necessary, and the more difficult it is to support a conclusion that a valuation allowance is not needed. Additionally, we utilize the "more likely than not" criteria established in FASB ASC Topic 740 to determine whether the future tax benefit from the deferred tax assets should be recognized. 
 57 

Table of Contents 

Ultimately, the ability to realize our deferred tax assets is based on our assessment of future taxable income, which is based on estimated future results. In the event that actual results differ from these estimates, or we adjust our estimates in the future, we may need to adjust our valuation allowance assessment, which could materially impact our consolidated financial position and results of operations. 
 Share-Based Compensation 
 FASB ASC Topic 718, Compensation Stock Compensation , requires that a company measure at fair value any new or modified share-based compensation arrangements with employees, such as stock options and restricted securities, and recognize as compensation expense that fair value over the requisite service period. 
 Certain of our restricted securities include performance conditions that require us to estimate the probable outcome of the performance condition. This assessment is based on management's judgment using internally developed forecasts and is assessed at each reporting period. Compensation expense is recognized if it is probable that the performance condition will be achieved. 
 We elect to recognize share-based compensation expense net of estimated forfeitures as permitted by FASB ASC Topic 718, and therefore only recognize compensation expense for those awards expected to vest over the requisite service period. The forfeiture rate is based on our estimate of forfeitures by plan participants after consideration of historical forfeiture rates. Compensation expense recognized for each award ultimately reflects the number of units that actually vest. 
 Material changes to any of these assumptions may have a significant effect on our valuation of share-based compensation awards and, accordingly, the related expense recognized in the consolidated statements of operations. 
 Recently Issued Accounting Standards 
 There have been no recently issued accounting standards that have been adopted in the current period or will be adopted in future periods that have had or are expected to have a material impact on our consolidated financial position or results of operations. 
 
 ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK 
 We are exposed to changes in foreign currency exchange rates because we transact in a variety of foreign currencies. We are also exposed to changes in the prices of certain commodities (primarily metals) that we use in production. Changes in these foreign currency exchange rates and commodity prices may have an impact on future cash flows and earnings. We monitor our exposure to these risks and may employ derivative financial instruments to limit the volatility to earnings and cash flows generated by these exposures. We employ derivative contracts that may or may not be designated for hedge accounting treatment under FASB ASC Topic 815, Derivatives and Hedging , which can result in volatility to earnings depending upon fluctuations in the underlying markets. 
 By using derivative instruments, we are subject to credit and market risk. The fair market values of these derivative instruments are based upon valuation models whose inputs are derived using market observable inputs, including foreign currency exchange and commodity spot and forward rates, and reflect the asset and liability positions as of the end of each reporting period. When the fair value of a derivative contract is positive, the counterparty is liable to us, thus creating a receivable risk for us. We are exposed to counterparty credit (or repayment) risk in the event of non-performance by counterparties to our derivative agreements. We attempt to minimize this risk by entering transactions with major financial institutions of investment grade credit rating. 
 Interest Rate Risk 
 As discussed further in Note 14: Debt of our Financial Statements included elsewhere in this Report, the Credit Agreement provides for the Senior Secured Credit Facilities consisting of the Term Loan, the Revolving Credit Facility, and incremental availability under which additional secured credit facilities could be issued under certain circumstances. 
 The Term Loan accrues interest at a variable rate that, as of December 31, 2022, is based on London Interbank Offered Rate ("LIBOR"), plus an interest rate margin, in accordance with the terms of the Credit Agreement. 
 58 

Table of Contents 

Sensitivity Analysis 
 As of December 31, 2022, we had an outstanding balance on the Term Loan (excluding debt discount and deferred financing costs) of 446.8 million. The applicable interest rate associated with the Term Loan at December 31, 2022 was 5.87 . An increase of 100 basis points in this rate would result in additional interest expense of 1.5 million in fiscal year 2023. An additional 100 basis point increase in this rate would result in incremental interest expense of 3.1 million in fiscal year 2023. 
 As of December 31, 2021, we had an outstanding balance on the Term Loan (excluding debt discount and deferred financing costs) of 451.5 million. The applicable interest rate associated with the Term Loan at December 31, 2021 was 1.87 . An increase of 100 basis points in this rate would have resulted in additional interest expense of 3.9 million in fiscal year 2022. An additional 100 basis point increase in this rate would have resulted in incremental interest expense of 8.2 million in fiscal year 2022. 
 Foreign Currency Risk 
 Consistent with our risk management objective and strategy to reduce exposure to variability in cash flows, and for non-trading purposes, we enter into foreign currency exchange rate derivatives that qualify as cash flow hedges, and that are intended to offset the effect of exchange rate fluctuations on forecasted sales and certain manufacturing costs. We also enter into foreign currency forward contracts that are not designated for hedge accounting purposes. Refer to Note 19: Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities of our Financial Statements included elsewhere in this Report for additional information related to the foreign currency forward contracts outstanding as of December 31, 2022.

Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm 
 
 To the Shareholders and the Board of Directors of 
 Sensata Technologies Holding plc 
 Opinion on the Financial Statements 
 We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Sensata Technologies Holding plc (the Company) as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, the related consolidated statements of operations, comprehensive income, cash flows and changes in shareholders equity for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2022, and the related notes and financial statement schedules listed in the Index at Item 15(a) (collectively referred to as the "consolidated financial statements"). In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company at December 31, 2022 and 2021, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2022, in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. 
 We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the Company's internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2022, based on criteria established in Internal Control-Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (2013 framework) and our report dated February 13, 2023 expressed an unqualified opinion thereon. 
 Basis for Opinion 
 These financial statements are the responsibility of the Company's management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company s financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. 
 We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. Our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion. 
 Critical Audit Matters 
 The critical audit matters communicated below are matters arising from the current period audit of the financial statements that were communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that: (1) relate to accounts or disclosures that are material to the financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective or complex judgments. The communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion on the consolidated financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matters below, providing separate opinions on the critical audit matters or on the accounts or disclosures to which they relate. 
 Goodwill - Quantitative Impairment Assessment Description of the Matter As of December 31, 2022, the Company s goodwill balance was 3.9 billion. The Company s goodwill is initially assigned to its reporting units as of the acquisition date. As discussed in Note 2 of the consolidated financial statements, goodwill is tested for impairment at the reporting unit level. The Company evaluated goodwill for impairment as of October 1, 2022, and used the quantitative method to assess their goodwill for impairment. 
 62 

Table of Contents 

Auditing management s quantitative goodwill impairment test involved a high degree of auditor judgment due to the significant estimation required to determine the fair value of each reporting unit. In particular, the fair value estimate for certain reporting units was sensitive to significant assumptions such as the long-range forecasts, the selection of discount rates, and the estimation of the multiples or long-term growth rates used in valuing the terminal year which are affected by expectations about future market or economic conditions, which led to a high degree of auditor judgment, subjectivity and effort in performing procedures and evaluating management's significant assumptions as outlined above, used in determining the fair value of these reporting units. How We Addressed the Matter in Our Audit We obtained an understanding, evaluated the design and tested the operating effectiveness of controls over the Company s quantitative goodwill impairment review process. For example, we tested controls over management s review of the data used in their valuation models and reviewed significant assumptions discussed above used in determining the reporting unit fair values. 
 To test the estimated fair value of the Company s reporting units, with the assistance of our valuation professionals, our audit procedures included, among others, assessing fair value methodologies and testing the significant assumptions discussed above. We compared the significant assumptions used by management to current industry and economic trends, the Company s historical trends with consideration given to changes in the Company s business, customer base or product mix and other relevant factors. We assessed the historical accuracy of management s estimates and performed sensitivity analyses of significant assumptions to evaluate the changes in the fair value of the reporting units that would result from changes in the assumptions. We also evaluated the reconciliation of the estimated aggregate fair value of the reporting units to the Company s market capitalization. 
 Income Taxes Uncertain Tax Positions Description of the Matter As discussed in Note 7, at December 31, 2022, the Company had approximately 224.6 million of unrecognized tax benefits associated with uncertain tax positions. Uncertainty in a tax position may arise as tax laws are subject to interpretation. The Company uses significant judgment in (1) determining whether a tax position s technical merits are more-likely-than-not to be sustained and (2) measuring the amount of tax benefit that qualifies for recognition. 
 Auditing the recognition and measurement of tax positions related to uncertain tax positions involved significant auditor judgment and use of tax professionals with specialized skills and knowledge because both the recognition and measurement of the tax positions are complex, highly judgmental and based on interpretations of tax laws and legal rulings. 
 How We Addressed the Matter in Our Audit We obtained an understanding, evaluated the design and tested the operating effectiveness of controls over the Company s process to identify and record the reserve for uncertain tax positions. For example, we tested controls over management s evaluation of the technical merits of tax positions and identification of uncertain tax positions and the controls to measure the benefit of those tax positions, including management s review of the inputs and calculations of unrecognized tax benefits resulting from uncertain tax positions. 
 To test the amounts recorded as uncertain tax positions we involved our tax professionals to evaluate the technical merits of the Company s income tax positions. Our procedures included, among others, evaluating income tax technical analysis or other third-party advice obtained by the Company and inspecting correspondence from the relevant tax authorities. We also applied our knowledge and experience with the application of federal, foreign and state income tax laws to evaluate the Company s accounting for those tax positions. We analyzed the Company s assumptions and data used to determine the amount of tax benefit to recognize and tested the accuracy of the calculations. We also evaluated the Company s income tax disclosures included in Note 7 in relation to these matters. 
 Accounting for Acquisitions Valuation of Identified Intangibles Description of the Matter As described in Note 21 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company completed the acquisition of DP Acquisition Corp ("Dynapower") for an aggregate cash purchase price of 577.5 million in 2022. The transaction was accounted for as a business combination. The allocation of purchase price is preliminary and is subject to revision as the final valuations are completed. 
 63 

Table of Contents 

Auditing the Company's accounting for its acquisition of Dynapower was complex due to the significant estimation required by management in determining the fair value of identifiable intangible assets of 164.4 million, which principally consisted of completed technologies, customer relationships, and tradename assets. The significant estimation uncertainty was primarily due to the sensitivity of the respective fair values to underlying assumptions about the future performance of the acquired business. The Company used the income approach to measure the completed technologies, customer relationships, and tradenames intangible assets. The significant assumptions used to estimate the fair value of these intangible assets included the expected discounted future net cash flows generated by each asset. These significant assumptions are forward looking and could be affected by future economic and market conditions. How We Addressed the Matter in Our Audit We obtained an understanding, evaluated the design and tested the operating effectiveness of controls over the Company's process for valuing intangible assets acquired in business combinations. For example, we tested controls over the appropriateness of the valuation model, assumptions management used and the completeness and accuracy of the data underlying the valuation of the completed technologies, customer relationships and tradenames intangible assets. 
 To test the estimated fair value of the completed technologies, customer relationships and tradenames intangible assets, our audit procedures included, among others, assessing methodologies and testing the significant assumptions discussed above and the underlying data supporting the significant assumptions and estimates used by the Company in the valuations. We tested significant assumptions through a combination of procedures, as applicable for each assumption, including comparing them to current and forecasted industry trends, as well as to the historical results of the acquired business and other guideline companies within the same industry. With the assistance of our valuation specialists, we evaluated the methodology used by the Company and significant assumptions included in the fair value estimates.

Our liability associated with this warranty is, at our option, to repair the product, replace the product, or provide the customer with a credit. We do not offer separately priced extended warranty or product maintenance contracts. We also sell products to customers under negotiated agreements or where we have accepted the customer s terms of purchase. In these instances, we may provide additional warranties for longer durations, consistent with differing end market practices, and where our liability is not limited.

reporting unit if the components have similar economic characteristics. We periodically review these reporting units to ensure that they continue to reflect the manner in which the business is operated. 
 Some assets and liabilities relate to the operations of multiple reporting units. We allocate these assets and liabilities to the related reporting units based on methods that we believe are reasonable and supportable. We apply that allocation method on a consistent basis from year to year. Other assets and liabilities, such as debt, cash and cash equivalents, and property, plant and equipment ("PP E") associated with our corporate offices, are viewed as being corporate in nature. Accordingly, we do not assign these assets and liabilities to our reporting units. 
 In the event we reorganize our business, we reassign the assets (including goodwill) and liabilities among the affected reporting units using a reasonable and supportable methodology. As businesses are acquired, we assign assets acquired (including goodwill) and liabilities assumed to a new or existing reporting unit as of the date of the acquisition. In the event a disposal group meets the definition of a business, goodwill is allocated to the disposal group based on the relative fair value of the disposal group to the retained portion of the related reporting unit.

 Leasehold improvements are amortized using the straight-line method over the shorter of the remaining lease term or the estimated economic useful lives of the improvements. Amortization of leasehold improvements is included in depreciation expense. 
 Assets held under finance leases are recognized at the lower of the present value of the minimum lease payments or the fair value of the leased asset at the inception of the lease. Depreciation expense associated with finance leases is computed using the straight-line method over the shorter of the estimated useful lives of the assets or the period of the related lease, unless ownership is transferred by the end of the lease or there is a bargain purchase option, in which case the asset is depreciated, normally on a straight-line basis, over the useful life that would be assigned if the asset were owned. 
 Expenditures for maintenance and repairs are charged to expense as incurred, whereas major improvements that increase asset values and extend useful lives are capitalized.

 years. Our lease agreements frequently include options to renew for additional periods or to purchase the leased assets and generally require that we pay taxes, insurance, and maintenance costs. 
 Depending on the specific terms of the leases, our obligations are in two forms: finance leases and operating leases. For both forms of leases, we recognize a related lease liability and right-of-use asset on our consolidated balance sheets. Our lease liabilities are initially measured at the present value of the lease payments not yet paid, discounted using our incremental borrowing rate for a period that is comparable to the remaining lease term. We use our incremental borrowing rate, adjusted for collateralization, because the discount rates implicit in our leases are generally not readily determinable. 
 For finance leases, the consolidated statements of operations include separate recognition of interest on the lease liability and amortization of the right-of-use asset. For operating leases, the consolidated statements of operations include a single lease cost, calculated so that the cost of the lease is allocated over the lease term on a straight-line basis. 
 Net cash flows from operating activities include (1) interest on finance lease liabilities and (2) payments arising from operating leases. Net cash flows from financing activities include repayments of the principal portion of finance lease liabilities.

Share-based compensation awards granted prior to May 27, 2021 were made under the 2010 Equity Plan, with all subsequent awards granted under the 2021 Equity Plan. 
 For option and RSU awards, vesting is typically subject only to service conditions. For PRSU awards, vesting is also subject to service conditions, however the number of awarded units that ultimately vest also depends on the attainment of certain predefined performance criteria. Our awards include continued vesting provisions for retirement-eligible employees.

 The fair value of stock options that vested during the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021, and 2020 was million, million, and million, respectively. 
 Option awards granted to employees generally vest per year over from the grant date. We recognize compensation expense for options on a straight-line basis over the requisite service period, which is generally the same as the vesting period. The options generally expire from the date of grant. 
 For options granted prior to April 2019, except as otherwise provided in specific option award agreements, if a participant ceases to be employed by us, options not yet vested generally expire and are forfeited at the termination date, and options that are fully vested generally expire days after termination of the participant s employment. Exclusions to the general policy for terminated employees include termination for cause (in which case the options expire on the participant s termination date) and termination due to death or disability (in which case any unvested options shall immediately vest and expire after the participant s termination date). For options granted in or after April 2019, the same terms apply, except that in the event of termination due to a qualified retirement, options not yet vested will continue to vest and will expire from the grant date. 
 We did t grant any options in the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021 or 2020. 
 Restricted Securities 
 Starting in April 2020, we grant RSU awards that vest ratably over and PRSU awards that cliff vest after the grant date. Previously, we granted RSU and PRSU awards each of which cliff vested after the grant date. 
 In the event of a qualifying termination, any unvested restricted securities that would have otherwise vested within the next vest in full on the termination date, and in the event of termination by reason of a covered retirement, any unvested restricted securities remain outstanding on the termination date and subject to continued vesting. For PRSU awards, the number of units that ultimately vest depends on the extent to which certain performance criteria, described in the table below, are met.

 Withholding taxes not creditable 
 Withholding taxes may apply to intercompany interest, royalty, management fees, and certain payments to third parties. Such taxes are deducted if they cannot be credited against the recipient s tax liability in its country of residence. Additional consideration has been given to the withholding taxes associated with unremitted earnings and the recipient's ability to obtain a tax credit for such taxes. Earnings are not considered to be indefinitely reinvested in the jurisdictions in which they were earned. In certain jurisdictions we recognize a deferred tax liability on withholding and other taxes on intercompany payments including dividends. 
 Research and development incentives 
 Certain income of our U.K. subsidiaries is eligible for lower tax rates under the "patent box" regime, resulting in certain of our intellectual property income being taxed at a rate lower than the U.K. statutory tax rate. Qualified investments are eligible for a bonus deduction under China s R D super deduction regime. In the U.S., we benefit from R D credit incentives. 
 Dispositions and capital restructuring 
 The increase of million in our effective tax rate for the year ended December 31, 2022 was due to the tax accounting impacts of the divestiture of the Qinex Business, partially offset by separate intangible property transfers. For the year ended December 31, 2020, the decrease in our effective tax rate was due to a net million deferred tax benefit in the fourth quarter of 2020 related to intangible property transfers.

 Valuation allowance and net operating loss carryforwards 
 We recognize deferred tax assets to the extent that we believe these assets are more likely than not to be realized. In measuring our deferred tax assets, we consider all available evidence, both positive and negative, to determine whether, based on the weight of that evidence, a valuation allowance is needed for all or some portion of the deferred tax assets. Significant judgment is required in considering the relative impact of the negative and positive evidence, and weight given to each category of evidence is commensurate with the extent to which it can be objectively verified. The more negative evidence that exists, the more positive evidence is necessary, and the more difficult it is to support a conclusion that a valuation allowance is not needed. Additionally, we utilize the "more likely than not" criteria established in FASB ASC Topic 740 to determine whether the future tax benefit from the deferred tax assets should be recognized. As a result, we have established valuation allowances on the deferred tax assets in jurisdictions that have incurred net operating losses and in which it is more likely than not that such losses will not be utilized in the foreseeable future. 
 As of each reporting date, we consider new evidence, both positive and negative, that could impact our view with regard to future realization of deferred tax assets. Our interest expense carryforwards in certain jurisdictions are subject to limitations. We consider these limitations in our assessment of positive and negative evidence. Our assessment of these limitations has resulted in the conclusion that a portion of our interest carryforwards are subject to a valuation allowance. 
 For tax purposes, certain goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets are generally amortizable over to years. For book purposes, goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets are not amortized but are tested for impairment annually. The tax amortization of goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets will result in a taxable temporary difference, which will not reverse unless the related book goodwill or indefinite-lived intangible asset is impaired or written off. This liability may not be used to support deductible temporary differences, such as net operating loss carryforwards, which may expire within a definite period.

million and million in the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. As a result of changes in interest limitation rules in the Netherlands that became effective in 2021, we recorded a valuation allowance against our interest carryforwards in this jurisdiction in the year ended December 31, 2021. Subsequently reported tax benefits relating to the valuation allowance for deferred tax assets as of December 31, 2022 will be allocated to income tax benefit recognized in the consolidated statements of operations. 
 As of December 31, 2022, we have U.S. federal net operating loss carryforwards of million, of which million will expire from 2028 to 2037, and million do not expire.

 At December 31, 2022, we anticipate that the liability for unrecognized tax benefits could decrease by up to million within the next twelve months due to the expiration of certain statutes of limitation or the settlement of examinations or issues with tax authorities. The amount of unrecognized tax benefits as of December 31, 2022 that if recognized would impact our effective tax rate is million. 
 Our major tax jurisdictions include Belgium, Bulgaria, China, France, Germany, Japan, Malaysia, Malta, Mexico, the Netherlands, South Korea, the U.K., and the U.S. These jurisdictions generally remain open to examination by the relevant tax authority for the tax years 2006 through 2022.

 At each of December 31, 2022, 2021, and 2020, accumulated goodwill impairment related to Performance Sensing and Sensing Solutions was and million, respectively. Refer to Note 21: Acquisitions and Divestitures for additional information related to goodwill acquired and written off as a result of our recent acquisitions and the divestiture of the Qinex Business, respectively. 
 Goodwill attributed to acquisitions reflects our allocation of purchase price to the estimated fair value of certain assets acquired and liabilities assumed. Net assets acquired are comprised of tangible and identifiable intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on their estimated fair values. We apply estimates and assumptions to determine the fair value of the intangible assets and of any contingent consideration obligations. Critical estimates in valuing purchased technology, customer relationships, and other identifiable intangible assets include future cash flows that we expect to generate from the acquired assets. In addition, we estimate the economic lives of these identified intangible assets and these lives are used to calculate amortization expense. Goodwill has been included in our segments based on a methodology using anticipated future earnings of the components of business. 
 We own the Klixon and Airpax tradenames, which are indefinite-lived intangible assets as they have each been in continuous use for almost years and we have no plans to discontinue using either of them. We have recorded million and million, respectively, on our consolidated balance sheets related to these tradenames. In addition, in the year ended December 31, 2020, we recognized indefinite-lived intangible assets of million related to in-process research development acquired in a fiscal year 2020 business combination transaction. 
 Effective July 1, 2021, we reorganized our Sensing Solutions operating segment, which resulted in realignment of our reporting units. As a result of this reorganization, our electrical protection product category that includes high-voltage contactors, inverters, rectifiers, and battery management systems was moved to a new reporting unit, Clean Energy Solutions. The remaining portions of our Electrical Protection, Industrial Sensing, Power Management, and Interconnection reporting units were consolidated into a new reporting unit, Industrial Solutions. This reorganization had no impact on our Aerospace reporting unit. Accordingly, as of October 1, 2021, we had reporting units, Automotive, HVOR, Industrial Solutions, Aerospace, and Clean Energy Solutions. 
 With the acquisition of SmartWitness Holdings, Inc. ("SmartWitness") in the fourth quarter of 2021, we formed Sensata INSIGHTS, a business unit organized under the HVOR operating segment, to drive growth of our smart and connected offerings to the transportation market, including both those developed organically and through the acquisition of Xirgo Technologies, LLC ("Xirgo") and SmartWitness. We concluded that Sensata INSIGHTS was a separate reporting unit from HVOR. There have been no subsequent changes to our reporting units. Accordingly, as of October 1, 2022, we had reporting units, Automotive, HVOR, Sensata INSIGHTS, Industrial Solutions, Aerospace, and Clean Energy Solutions.

million of assets (including allocated goodwill of million) and million of liabilities to the buyer. Refer to Note 21: Acquisitions and Divestitures for additional information on this transaction. 
 We concluded that these reorganizations have not impacted our reportable or operating segment evaluations. We reassigned assets and liabilities, including goodwill, to these new reporting units as required by FASB ASC Topic 350. We evaluated our goodwill and other indefinite-lived intangible assets for impairment before and after the reorganization and formation of these reporting units and determined that they were not impaired. 
 We evaluated our goodwill and other indefinite-lived intangible assets for impairment as of October 1, 2022 using a quantitative analysis for each reporting unit, under which a discounted cash flow analysis is prepared to determine whether the fair value of the reporting unit is less than its carrying value. Based on these analyses, we have determined that as of October 1, 2022, the fair value of each of our reporting units and indefinite-lived intangible assets exceeded their carrying values. 
 We consider a combination of quantitative and qualitative factors to determine whether a reporting unit is at risk of failing the goodwill impairment test, including: the timing of our most recent quantitative impairment tests and the relative amount by which a reporting unit s fair value exceeded its then carrying value, the inputs and assumptions underlying our valuation models and the sensitivity of our fair value measurements to those inputs and assumptions, the impact that adverse economic or market conditions may have on the degree of uncertainty inherent in our long-term operating forecasts, and changes in the carrying value of a reporting unit s net assets from the time of our most recent goodwill impairment test. We also consider the impact of recent acquisitions in our expectations of the reporting units, and how these acquisitions perform against their original expected performance, as these might put pressure on the reporting units' fair value over carrying value in the short term. Based on the results of this analysis, we do not consider any of our reporting units to be at risk of failing the goodwill impairment test.

 Credit Agreement 
 The Credit Agreement contains non-financial restrictive covenants (subject to important exceptions and qualifications set forth in the Credit Agreement) that limit our ability to, among other things: 
 incur indebtedness or liens, prepay subordinated debt, or amend the terms of our subordinated debt; 
 make loans and investments (including acquisitions) or sell assets; 
 change our business or accounting policies, merge, consolidate, dissolve or liquidate, or amend the terms of our organizational documents; 
 enter into affiliate transactions; 
 pay dividends and make other restricted payments; 
 or enter into certain burdensome contractual obligations. 
 In addition, under the Credit Agreement, STBV and its subsidiaries are required to maintain a senior secured net leverage ratio not to exceed :1.0 at the conclusion of certain periods when outstanding loans and letters of credit that are not cash collateralized for the full face amount thereof exceed of the commitments under the Revolving Credit Facility. 
 Senior Notes Indentures 
 The Senior Notes Indentures contain restrictive covenants (subject to important exceptions and qualifications set forth in the Senior Notes Indentures) that limit the ability of STBV and its subsidiaries to, among other things: incur liens; incur or guarantee indebtedness without guaranteeing the Senior Notes; engage in sale and leaseback transactions; or effect mergers or consolidations, or sell, assign, convey, transfer, lease or otherwise dispose of all or substantially all of the assets of STBV and its subsidiaries. 
 Certain of these covenants will be suspended if the Senior Notes are assigned an investment grade rating by Standard Poor's Rating Services or Moody's Investors Service, Inc. and provided no default has occurred and is continuing at such time. The suspended covenants will be reinstated if the Senior Notes are no longer assigned an investment grade rating by either rating agency or an event of default has occurred and is continuing at such time. As of December 31, 2022, none of the Senior Notes were assigned an investment grade rating by either rating agency. 
 Restrictions on Payment of Dividends 
 STBV's subsidiaries are generally not restricted in their ability to pay dividends or otherwise distribute funds to STBV, except for restrictions imposed under applicable corporate law. 
 STBV, however, is limited in its ability to pay dividends or otherwise make distributions to its immediate parent company and, ultimately, to Sensata plc, under the Credit Agreement. Specifically, the Credit Agreement prohibits STBV from paying dividends or making distributions to its parent companies except for purposes that include, but are not limited to, the following: 
 customary and reasonable operating expenses, legal and accounting fees and expenses, and overhead of such parent companies incurred in the ordinary course of business, provided that such amounts, in the aggregate, do not exceed million in any fiscal year; 
 dividends and other distributions in an aggregate amount not to exceed million plus certain amounts, including the retained portion of excess cash flow, but only insofar as no default or event of default exists and the senior secured net leverage ratio is less than :1.0 calculated on a pro forma basis; 
 so long as no default or an event of default exists, dividends and other distributions in an aggregate amount not to exceed million in any calendar year (with the unused portion in any year being carried over to succeeding years) plus

:1.0 calculated on a pro forma basis; and 
 other dividends and other distributions in an aggregate amount not to exceed million, so long as no default or event of default exists. 
 The Senior Notes Indentures generally allow STBV to pay dividends and make other distributions to its parent companies. 
 Compliance with Financial and Non-Financial Covenants 
 We were in compliance with all of the financial and non financial covenants and default provisions associated with our indebtedness as of December 31, 2022 and for the fiscal year then ended. 
 Accounting for Debt Financing Transactions 
 In the year ended December 31, 2022, in connection with the entry into the Eleventh Amendment, we recognized million of deferred financing costs, which are presented as a reduction of long-term debt on our consolidated balance sheets. In connection with the issuance of the 5.875 Senior Notes, we capitalized million of deferred financing costs, which are presented on the consolidated balance sheets as a reduction of long-term debt. In connection with the redemption of the 4.875 Senior Notes, we recognized a loss of million, presented in other, net, related to the write-off of unamortized deferred financing costs and debt discounts. 
 In the year ended December 31, 2021, in connection with the early redemption of the 6.25 Senior Notes, we recognized a loss of million, which primarily reflects payment of million for the early redemption premium, with the remaining loss representing write-off of debt discounts and deferred financing costs. In addition, in connection with the issuance of the 4.0 Senior Notes, we recognized million of deferred financing costs, which are presented as a reduction of long-term debt on our consolidated balance sheets and million of issuance premiums, which are presented as an addition to long-term debt on our consolidated balance sheets. 
 In the year ended December 31, 2020, in connection with the entry into the 3.75 Senior Notes, we incurred million of related third-party costs, which are presented as a reduction of long-term debt on our consolidated balance sheets.

 Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements 
 From time to time, we execute contracts that require us to indemnify the other parties to the contracts. These indemnification obligations generally arise in two contexts. First, in connection with certain transactions, such as the divestiture of a business or the issuance of debt or equity securities, the agreement typically contains standard provisions requiring us to indemnify the purchaser against breaches by us of representations and warranties contained in the agreement. These indemnities are generally subject to time and liability limitations. Second, we enter into agreements in the ordinary course of business, such as customer contracts, that might contain indemnification provisions relating to product quality, intellectual property infringement, governmental regulations and employment related matters, and other typical indemnities. In certain cases, indemnification obligations arise by law. 
 We believe that our indemnification obligations are consistent with other companies in the markets in which we compete. Performance under any of these indemnification obligations would generally be triggered by a breach of the terms of the contract or by a third-party claim. Historically, we have experienced only immaterial and irregular losses associated with these indemnifications. Consequently, any future liabilities brought about by these indemnifications cannot reasonably be estimated or accrued. 
 Indemnifications Provided as Part of Contracts and Agreements 
 We are party to the following types of agreements pursuant to which we may be obligated to indemnify a third party with respect to certain matters. 
 Officers and Directors: Our articles of association provide for indemnification of directors and officers by us to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, as it now exists or may hereinafter be amended (but, in the case of an amendment, only to the extent such amendment permits broader indemnification rights than permitted prior thereto), against any and all liabilities, including all expenses (including attorneys fees), judgments, fines, and amounts paid in settlement actually and reasonably incurred by him or her in connection with such action, suit, or proceeding, provided he or she acted in good faith and in a manner he or she reasonably believed to be in, or not opposed to, our best interests, and, with respect to any criminal action or proceeding, had no reasonable cause to believe his or her conduct was unlawful or outside of his or her mandate. The articles do not provide a limit to the maximum future payments, if any, under the indemnification. No indemnification is provided for in respect of any claim, issue, or matter as to which such person has been adjudged to be liable for gross negligence or willful misconduct in the performance of his or her duty on our behalf. 
 In addition, we have a liability insurance policy that insures directors and officers against the cost of defense, settlement, or payment of claims and judgments under some circumstances. Certain indemnification payments may not be covered under our directors and officers insurance coverage. 
 Initial Purchasers of Senior Notes : Pursuant to the terms of the purchase agreements entered into in connection with our private placement senior note offerings, we are obligated to indemnify the initial purchasers of the Senior Notes against certain liabilities caused by any untrue statement or alleged untrue statement of a material fact in various documents relied upon by such initial purchasers, or to contribute to payments the initial purchasers may be required to make in respect thereof. The purchase agreements do not provide a limit to the maximum future payments, if any, under these indemnifications.

 Refer to Note 2: Significant Accounting Policies for additional information related to the methods used to estimate the fair value of our financial instruments and Note 19: Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities for additional information related to the inputs used to determine these fair value measurements and the nature of the risks that these derivative instruments are intended to mitigate. 
 Although we have determined that the majority of the inputs used to value our derivative instruments fall within Level 2 of the fair value hierarchy, the credit valuation adjustments associated with our derivatives utilize Level 3 inputs, such as estimates of current credit spreads, to appropriately reflect both our own non-performance risk and the respective counterparties' non-performance risk in the fair value measurement. As of December 31, 2022 and 2021, we have assessed the significance of the impact of the credit valuation adjustments on the overall valuation of our derivative positions and have determined that the credit valuation adjustments are not significant to the overall valuation of our derivatives. As a result, we have determined that our derivatives in their entirety are classified in Level 2 in the fair value hierarchy. 
 Quanergy 
 As of December 31, 2021, we held a million investment in Quanergy Series B Preferred Stock (the "Series B Investment"). The Series B Investment did not have a readily determinable fair value and was held using the measurement alternative prescribed in FASB ASC Topic 321. On February 8, 2022, Quanergy merged with CITIC Capital Acquisition Corp, a special purpose acquisition corporation. On February 9, 2022, Quanergy was listed on the NYSE under the ticker symbol QNGY. 
 Upon completion of the merger, our investment in Quanergy was million, consisting of a million investment in common shares converted from the Series B Investment, a million private investment in public equity, and million warrants with a fair value of million, each of which represented the right to purchase common share of Quanergy at a price of per share. We subsequently converted these warrants to common shares. 
 On October 6, 2022, Quanergy executed a 1-to-20 reverse stock split. Upon execution of the reverse stock split, our holdings of Quanergy common stock declined to approximately million shares. As of December 31, 2022, the share price of Quanergy was per share and we have marked the full investment to approximately , resulting in a mark-to-market loss of million in the year ended December 31, 2022, which was recorded in other, net.

 reportable segments, Performance Sensing and Sensing Solutions. The Performance Sensing reportable segment consists of operating segments, Automotive and HVOR, each of which meet the criteria for aggregation in FASB ASC Topic 280, Segment Reporting . The Sensing Solutions reportable segment is also an operating segment. 
 Our operating segments are businesses that we manage as components of an enterprise, for which separate financial information is evaluated regularly by our chief operating decision maker in deciding how to allocate resources and assess performance. 
 An operating segment s performance is primarily evaluated based on segment operating income, which excludes amortization of intangible assets, restructuring and other charges, net, certain costs associated with our strategic megatrend initiatives, and certain corporate costs or credits not associated with the operations of the segment, including share-based compensation expense and a portion of depreciation expense associated with assets recognized in connection with acquisitions. Corporate and other costs excluded from an operating (and reportable) segment s performance are separately stated below and also include costs that are related to functional areas such as finance, IT, legal, and human resources. We believe that segment operating income, as defined above, is an appropriate measure for evaluating the operating performance of our segments. However, this measure should be considered in addition to, and not as a substitute for, or superior to, operating income or other measures of financial performance prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP. The accounting policies of each of our operating and reportable segments are materially consistent with those described in Note 2: Significant Accounting Policies . 
 The Performance Sensing segment serves the automotive and HVOR industries through the development and manufacture of sensors, high-voltage solutions (i.e., electrical protection components), and other solutions that are used in mission-critical systems and applications. Examples include those used in subsystems of automobiles, on-road trucks, and off-road equipment, such as tire pressure monitoring, thermal management, electrical protection, regenerative braking, powertrain (engine/transmission), exhaust management, and operator controls. These products are used in subsystems that, among other things, improve operating performance and efficiency, contribute to environmentally sustainable and safe solutions, and provide data-driven insight, connectivity, and prognostics to commercial fleet operators and asset managers. 
 For fleet transportation and logistics customers and end users, the Performance Sensing Segment provide hardware and services that enable a variety of end-use applications, including vehicle tracking and on-board vehicle diagnostic data to monitor vehicle health; the provision of vehicle data to enable usage-based insurance offerings; cargo capacity data for trailers that increase the operational efficiency of fleets; video telematics offerings that provide event analysis and in-cab monitoring to prevent and lower the cost of incidents; and visibility to where assets are located across the supply chain. 
 The Sensing Solutions segment primarily serves the industrial and aerospace industries through the development and manufacture of a broad portfolio of application-specific sensor and electrical protection products used in a diverse range of industrial markets, including the appliance, HVAC, water management, operator controls, charging infrastructure, renewable energy generation, green hydrogen production, and microgrid applications and markets, as well as the aerospace market, including commercial aircraft, defense, and aftermarket markets. 
 Some of the products and solutions the segment sells include pressure, temperature, and position sensors, motor and compressor protectors, high-voltage contactors, solid state relays, bimetal electromechanical controls, power inverters, charge controllers, battery management systems, operator controls, and power conversion systems. Sensing Solutions products perform many functions, including prevention of damage from excess heat or electrical current, optimization of system performance, low-power circuit control, renewable energy generation, and power conversion from direct current ("DC") power to alternating current ("AC") power.

ITEM 9. CHANGES IN AND DISAGREEMENTS WITH ACCOUNTANTS ON ACCOUNTING AND FINANCIAL DISCLOSURE 
 None. 
 
 ITEM 9A. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES 
 The required certifications of our Chief Executive Officer, Chief Financial Officer, and Chief Accounting Officer are included as Exhibits 31.1, 31.2, and 31.3 to this Annual Report on Form 10-K. The disclosures set forth in this Item 9A contain information concerning the evaluation of our disclosure controls and procedures, management's report on internal control over financial reporting, and changes in internal control over financial reporting referred to in these certifications. These certifications should be read in conjunction with this Item 9A for a more complete understanding of the matters covered by the certifications. 
 Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures 
 With the participation of our Chief Executive Officer, Chief Financial Officer, and Chief Accounting Officer, we have evaluated the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures as of December 31, 2022. The term "disclosure controls and procedures," as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the "Exchange Act"), means controls and other procedures of a company that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by a company in the reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized, and reported within the time periods specified in the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission's rules and forms. Disclosure controls and procedures include, without limitation, controls and procedures designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by a company in the reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to the company's management, including its principal executive and principal financial officers, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. Management recognizes that any controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving their objectives, and management necessarily applies its judgment in evaluating the cost-benefit relationship of possible controls and procedures. Based on the evaluation of our disclosure controls and procedures as of December 31, 2022, our Chief Executive Officer, Chief Financial Officer, and Chief Accounting Officer concluded that, as of such date, our disclosure controls and procedures were effective at the reasonable assurance level. 
 We excluded from our assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2022, the internal control over financial reporting for Elastic M2M, Inc. and DP Acquisition Corp. (Dynapower), which were acquired by us on February 11, 2022 and July 12, 2022, respectively. These exclusions are consistent with guidance issued by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission that an assessment of recently acquired businesses may be omitted from the scope of management's report on internal control over financial reporting in the year of acquisition. Excluded from our assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2022 were total assets and net revenues of approximately 0.7 and 1.3 , respectively, of our consolidated total assets and consolidated net revenues as of and for the year ended December 31, 2022. 
 Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting 
 No change in our internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Exchange Act) occurred during the fourth quarter of the year ended December 31, 2022 that materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.

Management s Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting 
 Management of Sensata Technologies Holding plc (the "Company") is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting as is defined in Exchange Act Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f). The Company s internal control system was designed to provide reasonable assurance to the Company s management, Board of Directors, and shareholders regarding the preparation and fair presentation of the Company s published financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. The Company s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that: 
 pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the Company; 
 provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management of the Company; and 
 provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of our assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements. 
 We excluded from our assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2022, the internal control over financial reporting for Elastic M2M, Inc. and DP Acquisition Corp. (Dynapower), which were acquired by us on February 11, 2022 and July 12, 2022, respectively. These exclusions are consistent with guidance issued by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission that an assessment of recently acquired businesses may be omitted from the scope of management's report on internal control over financial reporting in the year of acquisition. Excluded from our assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2022 were total assets and net revenues of approximately 0.7 and 1.3 , respectively, of our consolidated total assets and consolidated net revenues as of and for the year ended December 31, 2022. 
 There are inherent limitations to the effectiveness of any system of internal control over financial reporting. Accordingly, even an effective system of internal control over financial reporting can only provide reasonable assurance with respect to financial statement preparation and presentation in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. Our internal controls over financial reporting are subject to various inherent limitations, including cost limitations, judgments used in decision making, assumptions about the likelihood of future events, the soundness of our systems, the possibility of human error, and the risk of fraud. Moreover, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may be inadequate because of changes in conditions and the risk that the degree of compliance with policies or procedures may deteriorate over time. 
 Management assessed the effectiveness of the Company s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2022. In making its assessment of internal control over financial reporting, management used the criteria issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations ("COSO") of the Treadway Commission in May 2013. 
 Based on the results of this assessment, management, including our Chief Executive Officer, Chief Financial Officer, and Chief Accounting Officer, has concluded that, as of December 31, 2022, the Company s internal control over financial reporting was effective. 
 The Company s independent registered public accounting firm, Ernst Young LLP, has also issued an audit report on the Company s internal control over financial reporting, which is included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.

Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm 
 To the Shareholders and the Board of Directors of 
 Sensata Technologies Holding plc 
 Opinion on Internal Control over Financial Reporting 
 We have audited Sensata Technologies Holding plc s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2022, based on criteria established in Internal Control Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (2013 framework) (the COSO criteria). In our opinion, Sensata Technologies Holding plc (the Company) maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2022, based on the COSO criteria. As indicated in the accompanying Management's Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting , management's assessment of and conclusion on the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting did not include the internal controls of Elastic M2M, Inc. and DP Acquisition Corp. (Dynapower), which are included in the 2022 consolidated financial statements of the Company and in aggregate constituted 0.7 of total assets as of December 31, 2022 and 1.3 of revenues for the year then ended. Our audit of internal control over financial reporting of the Company also did not include an evaluation of the internal control over financial reporting of Elastic M2M, Inc. and Dynapower. 
 We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the consolidated balance sheets of the Company as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, the related consolidated statements of operations, comprehensive income, cash flows and changes in shareholders' equity for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2022, and the related notes and financial statement schedules listed in the Index at Item 15(a) (collectively referred to as the consolidated financial statements ), and our report dated February 13, 2023 expressed an unqualified opinion thereon. 
 Basis for Opinion 
 The Company s management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting included in the accompanying Management s Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company s internal control over financial reporting based on our audit. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. 
 We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. 
 Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk, and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion. 
 Definition and Limitations of Internal Control Over Financial Reporting 
 A company s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements. 
 Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

 (1) any change in, or amendment to, the laws or treaties (or any regulations, official guidance or rulings promulgated thereunder) of any Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction affecting taxation which becomes effective on or after the Issue Date or, in the case of a Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction that arises after the Issue Date, the date on which such Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction became a Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction under this Indenture (or, in the case of a successor Person, after the date of assumption by the successor person of the obligations thereunder) or 
 (2) any change in the official application, administration, or interpretation of the laws, treaties, regulations, official guidance or rulings of any Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction (including a holding, judgment, or order by a court of competent jurisdiction), on or after the Issue Date or, in the case of a Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction that arises after the Issue Date, the date on which such Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction became a Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction under this Indenture (or, in the case of a successor Person, after the date of assumption by the successor person of the obligations thereunder) (each of the foregoing clauses (1) and (2), a Change in Tax Law ).

 In the case of a Guarantor that becomes a party to this Indenture after the Issue Date or a successor Person (including a surviving entity), the Change in Tax Law must become effective after the date that such entity (or another Person organized or resident in the same jurisdiction) first makes a payment on the Notes. In the case of Additional Amounts required to be paid as a result of the Company conducting business in an Additional Taxing Jurisdiction, the Change in Tax Law must become effective after the date the Company begins to conduct the business giving rise to the withholding or deduction. 
 Notwithstanding the foregoing, no such notice of redemption will be given (a) earlier than 90 days prior to the earliest date on which the Company or any Guarantor, would be obliged to make such payment of Additional Amounts or withholding if a payment in respect of 
 37 

the Notes or the relevant Note Guarantee, as the case may be, were then due and (b) unless at the time such notice is given, the obligation to pay Additional Amounts remains in effect. 
 Prior to the giving of any notice of redemption pursuant to this Section 3.07(e), the Company will deliver to the Trustee 
 (1) an Officers Certificate stating that the Company is entitled to effect such redemption and setting forth a statement of facts showing that the conditions precedent to the right of the Company so to redeem have occurred (including that such obligation to pay such Additional Amounts cannot be avoided by the Company or any Guarantor or surviving entity taking reasonable measures available to it) and 
 (2) a written opinion of independent tax advisers of recognized standing qualified under the laws of the Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction and reasonably satisfactory to the Trustee to the effect that the Company or a Guarantor or surviving entity, as the case may be, is or would be obligated to pay such Additional Amounts as a result of a Change in Tax Law. 
 The foregoing provisions shall apply mutatis mutandis to any successor Person, after such successor Person becomes a party to this Indenture, with respect to a Change in Tax Law occurring after the time such successor Person becomes a party to this Indenture. 
 (f) Any redemption pursuant to this Section 3.07 shall be made pursuant to the provisions of Sections 3.01 through 3.06 hereof.

The Company will pay interest on the Notes (except defaulted interest) to the Persons who are registered Holders of Notes at the close of business on the March 15 or September 15 next preceding the Interest Payment Date (whether or not a Business Day), even if such Notes are canceled after such record date and on or before such Interest Payment Date, except as provided in Section 2.12 of the Indenture with respect to defaulted interest. The Company will pay principal, premium, if any, and interest on Definitive Notes at the office of the Paying Agent. Such payment will be in such coin or currency of the United States of America as at the time of payment is legal tender for payment of public and private debts.

The terms of the Notes include those stated in the Indenture and those made part of the Indenture by reference to the TIA. Terms defined in the Indenture and not defined herein have the meanings ascribed thereto in the Indenture. The Notes are subject to all the terms and provisions of the Indenture, and Holders are referred to the Indenture for a statement of such terms. To the extent any provision of this Note conflicts with the express provisions of the Indenture, the provisions of the Indenture shall govern and be controlling.

The Indenture also imposes limitations on the ability of the Company and each Guarantor to consolidate or merge with or into any other Person or convey, transfer or lease all or substantially all of its property. 
 To Guarantee the due and punctual payment of the principal and interest on the Notes and all other amounts payable by the Company under the Indenture and the Notes when and as the same shall be due and payable, whether at maturity, by acceleration or otherwise, 
 A-5

 (5) OPTIONAL REDEMPTION. 
 (a) Except pursuant to Section 3.07(d) or (e) of the Indenture, the Notes will not be optionally redeemable by the Company provided, however, the Company may acquire the Notes by means other than an optional redemption. 
 (b) At any time and from time to time, upon not less than 30 nor more than 60 days notice to the Holders, the Company may redeem some or all of the Notes at a price calculated by the Company of 100 of the principal amount of the Notes redeemed plus the Applicable Premium, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to, but excluding, the redemption date (subject to the right of Holders of record on the record date to receive interest due on the interest payment date). 
 (c) The Company may, at its option, redeem the Notes, in whole but not in part, at any time upon not less than 15 days nor more than 30 days notice to the Holders (which notice shall be irrevocable and given in accordance with Section 3.03 of the Indenture), at a redemption price equal to 100 of the principal amount thereof, plus accrued and unpaid interest thereon to, but excluding, the redemption date, premium, if any, and all Additional Amounts, if any, then due and which will become due on the date of redemption as a result of the redemption or otherwise, if the Company determines in good faith that the Company or any Guarantor is, or on the next date on which any amount would be payable in respect of the Notes, would be obligated to pay Additional Amounts in respect of the Notes pursuant to the terms and conditions thereof, which the Company or such Guarantor, as the case may be, cannot avoid by the use of reasonable measures available to it (including, without limitation, making payment through a Paying Agent located in another jurisdiction), as a result of 
 (1) any change in, or amendment to, the laws or treaties (or any regulations, official guidance or rulings promulgated thereunder) of any Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction affecting taxation which becomes effective on or after the Issue Date or, in the case of a Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction that arises after the Issue Date, the date on which such Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction became a Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction under the Indenture (or, in the case of a successor Person, after the date of assumption by the successor person of the obligations thereunder) or 
 (2) any change in the official application, administration, or interpretation of the laws, treaties, regulations, official guidance or rulings of any Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction (including a holding, judgment, or order by a court of competent jurisdiction), on or after the Issue Date or, in the case of a Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction that arises after the Issue Date, the date on which such Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction became a Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction under the Indenture (or, in the case of a successor Person, after the date of assumption by the successor person of the obligations thereunder). 
 Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Company may not redeem the Notes under this provision if a Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction changes and the Company is obligated to pay Additional Amounts as a result of a Change in Tax Law of such Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction which was officially announced at the time the latter became a Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction. 
 Notwithstanding the foregoing, no such notice of redemption will be given (a) earlier than 90 days prior to the earliest date on which the Company or any Guarantor, would be obliged to make such payment of Additional Amounts or withholding if a payment in respect

 In determining whether the Holders of the required principal amount of Notes have concurred in any direction, request, waiver or consent in the exercise of any discretion, power or authority (whether contained in this Indenture or vested by operation of law) which the Trustee is required, expressly or impliedly, to exercise in or by reference to the interests of the Holders or any of them, Notes owned by the Issuer or any Guarantor, or by an Affiliate of the Issuer or any Guarantor, will be considered as though not outstanding, except that for the purposes of determining whether the Trustee will be protected in relying on any such direction, waiver or consent, only Notes that a Responsible Officer of the Trustee knows are so owned will be so disregarded. 
 Section 2.10 Temporary Notes. 
 Until certificates representing Notes are ready for delivery, the Issuer may prepare and the Trustee, upon receipt of an Authentication Order, will authenticate temporary Notes. Temporary Notes will be substantially in the form of certificated Notes but may have variations that the Issuer considers appropriate for temporary Notes and as may be reasonably acceptable to the Trustee.

Certification of the destruction of all canceled Notes will be delivered to the Issuer. The Issuer may not issue new Notes to replace Notes that it has redeemed, purchased or paid or that have been delivered to the Trustee for cancellation. 
 Section 2.12 Defaulted Interest. 
 If the Issuer defaults in a payment of interest on the Notes, it will pay the defaulted interest in any lawful manner plus, to the extent lawful, interest payable on the defaulted interest, to the Persons who are Holders on a subsequent special record date, in each case at the rate provided in the Notes and in Section 4.01 hereof. The Issuer will notify the Trustee in writing of the amount of defaulted interest proposed to be paid on each Note and the date of the proposed payment. The Issuer will fix or cause to be fixed each such special record date and payment date provided that no such special record date may be less than 10 days prior to the related payment date for such defaulted interest. At least 15 days before the special record date, the Issuer (or, upon the written request of the Issuer, the Trustee in the name and at the expense of the Issuer) will give or cause to be given to Holders in accordance with Section 12.02

 Section 2.13 CUSIP Numbers and ISIN Numbers. 
 The Issuer in issuing the Notes may use CUSIP numbers and ISINs (if then generally in use), and, if so, the Trustee shall use CUSIP numbers and ISINs in notices of redemption as a convenience to Holders provided that any such notice may state that no representation is made as to the correctness of such numbers, either as printed on the Notes or as contained in any notice of a redemption and that reliance may be placed only on the other identification numbers printed on the Notes, and any such redemption shall not be affected by any defect in or omission of such numbers.

 Section 3.06 Notes Redeemed in Part. 
 Upon surrender of a Note that is redeemed in part, the Issuer will issue and, upon receipt of an Authentication Order, the Trustee will authenticate for the Holder at the expense of the Issuer a new Note equal in principal amount to the unredeemed or unpurchased portion of the Note surrendered. 
 Section 3.07 Optional Redemption. 
 (a) Except pursuant to Sections 3.07(b), 3.07(c) and 4.15(f), the Notes will not be optionally redeemable by the Issuer provided, however , the Issuer may acquire the Notes by means other than an optional redemption. 
 (b) At any time and from time to time, prior to November 15, 2029 (the First Par Call Date ), the Issuer may redeem the Notes, in whole or in part, at a redemption price equal to the greater of 
 (i) 100 of the principal amount of the Notes to be redeemed then outstanding and 
 (ii) as determined by an Independent Investment Banker, the sum of the present values of the remaining scheduled payments of principal and interest on the Notes to be redeemed that would be due if such Notes matured on the First Par Call Date (not including any portion of such payments of interest accrued to the date of redemption) discounted to the redemption date on a semiannual basis (assuming a 360-day year consisting of twelve 30-day months) using a discount rate equal to the Adjusted Treasury Rate for the Notes plus 50 basis points 
 42 

plus, in either of the above cases, accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to, but excluding, the date of redemption of the Notes to be redeemed (subject to the right of Holders of record on the relevant record date to receive interest due on the related interest payment date). 
 At any time and from time to time on or after the First Par Call Date, the Issuer may redeem the Notes, in whole or in part, at a redemption price equal to 100 of the principal amount of the Notes to be redeemed then outstanding, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to, but excluding, the date of redemption of the Notes to be redeemed (subject to the right of Holders of record on the relevant record date to receive interest due on the related interest payment date).

 (1) any change in, or amendment to, the laws or treaties (or any regulations, official guidance or rulings promulgated thereunder) of any Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction affecting taxation which becomes effective on or after the Issue Date or, in the case of a Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction that arises after the Issue Date, the date on which such Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction became a Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction under this Indenture (or, in the case of a successor Person, after the date of assumption by the successor person of the obligations thereunder) or 
 (2) any change in the official application, administration, or interpretation of the laws, treaties, regulations, official guidance or rulings of any Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction (including a holding, judgment, or order by a court of competent jurisdiction), on or after the Issue Date or, in the case of a Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction that arises after the Issue Date, the date on which such Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction became a Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction under this Indenture (or, in the case of a successor Person, after the date of assumption by the successor person of the obligations thereunder) (each of the foregoing clauses (1) and (2), a Change in Tax Law ). 
 Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Issuer may not redeem the Notes under this provision if a Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction changes under this Indenture and the Issuer is obligated to pay Additional Amounts as a result of a Change in Tax Law of such Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction which was officially announced at the time the latter became a Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction. 
 In the case of a Guarantor that becomes a party to this Indenture after the Issue Date or a successor Person (including a surviving entity), the Change in Tax Law must become 
 43 

effective after the date that such entity (or another Person organized or resident in the same jurisdiction) first makes a payment on the Notes. 
 Notwithstanding the foregoing, no such notice of redemption will be given (a) earlier than 90 days prior to the earliest date on which the Issuer or any Guarantor, would be obliged to make such payment of Additional Amounts or withholding if a payment in respect of the Notes or the relevant Note Guarantee, as the case may be, were then due and (b) unless at the time such notice is given, the obligation to pay Additional Amounts remains in effect. 
 Prior to the giving of any notice of redemption pursuant to this Section 3.07(c), the Issuer will deliver to the Trustee 
 (1) an Officers Certificate stating that the Issuer is entitled to effect such redemption and setting forth a statement of facts showing that the conditions precedent to the right of the Issuer so to redeem have occurred (including that such obligation to pay such Additional Amounts cannot be avoided by the Issuer or any Guarantor or surviving entity taking reasonable measures available to it) and 
 (2) a written opinion of independent tax advisers of recognized standing qualified under the laws of the Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction to the effect that the Issuer or a Guarantor or surviving entity, as the case may be, is or would be obligated to pay such Additional Amounts as a result of a Change in Tax Law. 
 The foregoing provisions shall apply mutatis mutandis to any successor Person, after such successor Person becomes a party to this Indenture, with respect to a Change in Tax Law occurring after the time such successor Person becomes a party to this Indenture. 
 (d) Any redemption pursuant to this Section 3.07 shall be made pursuant to the provisions of Sections 3.01 through 3.05 hereof.

 (E) any Tax imposed on or with respect to any payment by the Issuer or a Guarantor to the Holder if such Holder is a fiduciary or partnership or person other than the sole beneficial owner of such payment to the extent that Taxes would not have been imposed on such payment had the beneficiary, partner or other beneficial owner directly held the Note 
 (F) any Tax that is imposed or levied by reason of the presentation (where presentation is required in order to receive payment) of the Notes for payment on a date more than 30 days after the date on which such payment became due and payable or the date on which payment thereof is duly provided for, whichever is later, except to the extent that the Beneficial Owner or Holder thereof would have been entitled to Additional Amounts had the Notes been presented for payment on any date during such 30-day period

 (vii) This Section 4.01(b) shall survive any termination, defeasance or discharge of this Indenture and shall apply mutatis mutandis to any jurisdiction in which any successor Person to the Issuer or any Guarantor is organized, incorporated or otherwise resident for tax purposes and any political subdivision or taxing authority or agency thereof or therein or any jurisdiction from or through which such Person makes any payment on the Notes (or any Note Guarantee) or any political subdivision thereof or therein.

 Holders of temporary Notes will be entitled to all of the benefits of this Indenture. 
 Section 2.11 Cancellation.

 (c) Any notice of Default, notice of acceleration or instruction to the Trustee to provide a notice of Default, notice of acceleration or take any other action (a Noteholder Direction provided by any one or more Holders of the Notes (other than a Regulated Bank) (each a Directing Holder must be accompanied by a written representation from each such Holder to the Issuer and the Trustee that such Holder is not (or, in the case such Holder is DTC or its nominee, that such Holder is being instructed solely by beneficial owners that have represented to such Holder that they are not) Net Short (a Position Representation ), which representation, in the case of a Noteholder Direction relating to a notice of Default shall be deemed repeated at all times until the resulting Event of Default is cured or otherwise ceases to exist or the Notes are accelerated. In addition, each Directing Holder must, at the time of providing a Noteholder Direction, covenant to provide the Issuer with such other information as the Issuer may reasonably request from time to time in order to verify the accuracy of such Holder s Position Representation within five Business Days of request therefor (a Verification Covenant ).

 61 

breach of its Position Representation, and seeking to invalidate any Event of Default that resulted from the applicable Noteholder Direction, the cure period with respect to such Default shall be automatically stayed pending a final and non-appealable determination of a court of competent jurisdiction on such matter.

Any breach of the Position Representation shall result in such Holder s participation in such Noteholder Direction being disregarded and, if, without the participation of such Holder, the percentage of Notes held by the remaining Holders of the Notes that provided such Noteholder Direction would have been insufficient to validly provide such Noteholder Direction, such Noteholder Direction shall be void ab initio, with the effect that such Event of Default shall be deemed never to have occurred, acceleration shall be voided and the Trustee shall be deemed not to have received such Noteholder Direction or any notice of such Default or Event of Default. 
 
 Notwithstanding anything in the preceding two paragraphs to the contrary, any Noteholder Direction delivered to the Trustee during the pendency of an Event of Default as the result of bankruptcy or similar proceedings shall not require compliance with this Section 6.02(c).

 For the avoidance of doubt, the Trustee shall be entitled to conclusively rely on any Noteholder Direction, Position Representation, Verification Covenant, Officers Certificate or other document delivered to it pursuant to this Section 6.02(c), shall have no duty to inquire as to or investigate the accuracy of any Position Representation, enforce compliance with any Verification Covenant, verify any statements in any Officers Certificate delivered to it, or otherwise make calculations, investigations or determinations with respect to Regulated Banks, Derivative Instruments, Net Shorts, Long Derivative Instruments, Short Derivative Instruments or otherwise and shall have no liability for ceasing to take any action or staying any remedy. The Trustee shall have no liability to the Issuer, any Holder or any other Person in acting in good faith on a Noteholder Direction or to determine whether any Holder has delivered a Position Representation or that such Position Representation conforms with this Indenture or any other agreement or whether or not any Holder is a Regulated Bank.

 (i) if the rescission would not conflict with any judgment or decree 
 (ii) if all existing Events of Default have been cured or waived except nonpayment of principal, premium, if any, or accrued interest that has become due solely because of the acceleration 
 (iii) to the extent the payment of such interest is lawful, interest on overdue installments of interest and overdue principal, which has become due otherwise than by such declaration of acceleration, has been paid 
 62 

(iv) if the Issuer has paid the Trustee its reasonable compensation and reimbursed the Trustee for its expenses (including the fees and expenses of its counsel), disbursements and advances and 
 (v) in the event of the cure or waiver of an Event of Default under this Indenture of the type described in clause (v) and (vi) of Section 6.01(a), the Trustee shall have received an Officers Certificate that such Event of Default has been cured or waived.

 (a) If a Default occurs and is continuing, the Trustee may pursue any available remedy by proceeding at law or in equity to collect the payment of principal of or interest on the Notes or to enforce the performance of any provision of the Notes or this Indenture. 
 (b) The Trustee may maintain a proceeding even if it does not possess any of the Notes or does not produce any of them in the proceeding. A delay or omission by the Trustee or any Holder in exercising any right or remedy accruing upon a Default shall not impair the right or remedy or constitute a waiver of or acquiescence in the Default. No remedy is exclusive of any other remedy. All available remedies are cumulative to the extent permitted by law. 
 (c) In the event of any Event of Default specified in clause (iv) of Section 6.01(a), such Event of Default and all consequences thereof (excluding, however, any resulting payment default, other than as a result of the acceleration of the Notes) shall be annulled, waived and rescinded, automatically and without any action by the Trustee or the Holders, if within 20 days after such Event of Default arose (x) the Indebtedness or Guarantee that is the basis for such Event of Default has been discharged or (y) the holders of such Indebtedness or Guarantee have rescinded or waived the acceleration, notice or action (as the case may be) giving rise to such Event of Default or (z) the default that is the basis for such Event of Default is no longer continuing, it being understood that in no event shall an acceleration of the principal amount of, premium, if any, and accrued interest on the Notes, as described above, be automatically annulled, waived or rescinded upon the happening of any such events. 
 (d) Holders may not enforce this Indenture or the Notes, except as provided in this Indenture. The Trustee is under no obligation to exercise any of its rights or powers under this Indenture at the request, order or direction of any of the Holders, unless such Holders have offered to the Trustee indemnity reasonably satisfactory to it. 
 Section 6.04 Waiver of Past Defaults. 
 The Holders of a majority in aggregate principal amount of Notes at the time then outstanding may on behalf of the Holders of all the Notes waive any Default with respect to such Notes and its consequences by providing written notice thereof to the Issuer and the Trustee, except a Default in the payment of the principal of, premium, if any, or interest on the Notes or a covenant or provision of this Indenture which cannot be modified or amended without the consent of the Holder of each outstanding Note affected. In the case of any such waiver, the Issuer, the Trustee and the Holders shall be restored to their former positions and rights under this Indenture, respectively provided that no such waiver shall extend to any subsequent or other Default or impair any right consequent thereto.

The Trustee may refuse to follow any direction that conflicts with any law or this Indenture, that the Trustee determines may be unduly prejudicial to the rights of another Holder, or that may involve the Trustee in personal liability provided that the Trustee may take any other action deemed proper by the Trustee which is not inconsistent with such direction. In the event the Trustee takes any action or follows any direction pursuant to this Indenture, the Trustee shall be entitled to indemnification satisfactory to the Trustee against any loss or expense caused by taking such action or following such direction.

 Section 9.04 Revocation and Effect of Consents.

 (b) The Issuer may, but shall not be obligated to, fix a record date for the purpose of determining the Holders entitled to consent to any amendment, supplement or waiver which record date shall be at least 30 days prior to the first solicitation of such consent. If a record date is fixed, then notwithstanding the last sentence of the immediately preceding paragraph, those Persons who were Holders at such record date (or their duly designated proxies), and only those Persons, shall be entitled to revoke any consent previously given, whether or not such Persons continue to be Holders after such record date. No such consent shall be valid or effective for more than 90 days after such record date. The Issuer shall inform the Trustee in writing of the fixed record date if applicable. 
 (c) After an amendment, supplement or waiver becomes effective, it shall bind every Holder, unless it makes a change described in any of clauses (i) through (xi) of Section 9.02(b), in which case, the amendment, supplement or waiver shall bind only each Holder of a Note who has consented to it and every subsequent Holder of a Note or portion of a Note that evidences the same debt as the consenting Holder s Note provided that any such waiver shall not impair or affect the right of any Holder to bring suit for the enforcement of any such payment on or after such respective dates without the consent of such Holder. 
 Section 9.05 Notation on or Exchange of Notes. 
 If an amendment, supplement or waiver changes the terms of a Note, the Issuer may require the Holder of the Note to deliver it to the Trustee. The Issuer shall provide the Trustee with an appropriate notation on the Note about the changed terms and cause the Trustee to return it to the Holder at the Issuer s expense. Alternatively, if the Issuer or the Trustee so determines, the Issuer in exchange for the Note shall issue and the Trustee shall authenticate a new Note that reflects the changed terms. Failure to make the appropriate notation or issue a new Note shall not affect the validity and effect of such amendment, supplement or waiver. 
 Section 9.06 Trustee to Sign Amendments, Etc. 
 The Trustee shall execute any amendment, supplement or waiver authorized pursuant to this Article 9 provided, that the Trustee may, but shall not be obligated to, execute any such amendment, supplement or waiver which affects the Trustee s own rights, duties or immunities under this Indenture.

Such Opinion of Counsel and Officers Certificate shall be at the expense of the Issuer.

Except as set forth in Section 2.09 hereof, a Note does not cease to be outstanding because the Issuer or an Affiliate of the Issuer holds the Note. 
 If a Note is replaced pursuant to Section 2.07 hereof, it ceases to be outstanding unless the Trustee and the Registrar receive proof satisfactory to each of them that the replaced Note is held by a protected purchaser. 
 If the principal amount of any Note is considered paid under Section 4.01 hereof, it ceases to be outstanding and interest on it ceases to accrue.

 39

 Section 2.10 Temporary Notes. 
 Until certificates representing Notes are ready for delivery, the Issuer may prepare and the Trustee, upon receipt of an Authentication Order, will authenticate temporary Notes.

Without unreasonable delay, the Issuer will prepare and the Trustee will authenticate definitive Notes in exchange for temporary Notes. 
 Holders of temporary Notes will be entitled to all of the benefits of this Indenture. 
 Section 2.11 Cancellation. 
 The Issuer at any time may deliver Notes to the Trustee for cancellation. The Registrar and Paying Agent will forward to the Trustee any Notes surrendered to them for registration of transfer, exchange or payment. The Trustee and no one else will cancel all Notes surrendered for registration of transfer, exchange, payment, replacement or cancellation and will dispose of such canceled Notes in its customary manner (subject to the record retention requirement of the Exchange Act). Certification of the destruction of all canceled Notes will be delivered to the Issuer. The Issuer may not issue new Notes to replace Notes that it has redeemed, purchased or paid or that have been delivered to the Trustee for cancellation. 
 Section 2.12 Defaulted Interest. 
 If the Issuer defaults in a payment of interest on the Notes, it will pay the defaulted interest in any lawful manner plus, to the extent lawful, interest payable on the defaulted interest, to the Persons who are Holders on a subsequent special record date, in each case at the rate provided in the Notes and in Section 4.01 hereof.

 40 

contained in any notice of a redemption and that reliance may be placed only on the other identification numbers printed on the Notes, and any such redemption shall not be affected by any defect in or omission of such numbers. The Issuer will promptly notify the Trustee in writing of any change in the CUSIP numbers or ISINs.

 (d) If any optional redemption or notice is subject to satisfaction of one or more conditions precedent, the notice shall state that, in the Issuer s discretion, the redemption date may be delayed until such time as any or all such conditions shall be satisfied, or such redemption may not occur and such notice may be rescinded in the event that any or all such conditions shall not have been satisfied on or prior to one Business Day prior to the redemption date, or by the redemption date so delayed. 
 Section 3.04 Effect of Notice of Redemption. 
 Once notice of redemption is given in accordance with Section 3.03 hereof, Notes called for redemption become irrevocably due and payable on the redemption date at the redemption price and interest will cease to accrue on the Notes or portions thereof called for redemption on the applicable redemption date unless the Issuer defaults in the payment of the redemption price or accrued interest or any Additional Amounts.

 If the Issuer complies with the provisions of the preceding paragraph, on and after the redemption date, interest will cease to accrue on the Notes or the portions of Notes called for redemption. If a Note is redeemed on or after an interest record date but on or prior to the related interest payment date, then any accrued and unpaid interest shall be paid to the Person in whose 
 42 

name such Note was registered at the close of business on such record date. If any Note called for redemption is not so paid upon surrender for redemption because of the failure of the Issuer to comply with the preceding paragraph, interest shall be paid on the unpaid principal, from the redemption date until such principal is paid, and to the extent lawful on any interest not paid on such unpaid principal, in each case at the rate provided in the Notes and in Section 4.01 hereof.

 43 

any amount would be payable in respect of the Notes, would be obligated to pay Additional Amounts in respect of the Notes pursuant to the terms and conditions thereof (but, in the case of a Guarantor, only if the payment giving rise to such requirement cannot be made by the Issuer or another Guarantor without the obligation to pay Additional Amounts), which the Issuer or such Guarantor, as the case may be, cannot avoid by the use of reasonable measures available to it (including, without limitation, making payment through a Paying Agent located in another jurisdiction), as a result of 
 (1) any change in, or amendment to, the laws or treaties (or any regulations, official guidance or rulings promulgated thereunder) of any Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction affecting taxation which becomes effective on or after the Issue Date or, in the case of a Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction that arises after the Issue Date, the date on which such Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction became a Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction under this Indenture (or, in the case of a successor Person, after the date of assumption by the successor person of the obligations thereunder) or 
 (2) any change in the official application, administration, or interpretation of the laws, treaties, regulations, official guidance or rulings of any Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction (including a holding, judgment, or order by a court of competent jurisdiction), on or after the Issue Date or, in the case of a Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction that arises after the Issue Date, the date on which such Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction became a Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction under this Indenture (or, in the case of a successor Person, after the date of assumption by the successor person of the obligations thereunder) (each of the foregoing clauses (1) and (2), a Change in Tax Law ). 
 Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Issuer may not redeem the Notes under this provision if a Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction changes under this Indenture and the Issuer is obligated to pay Additional Amounts as a result of a Change in Tax Law of such Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction which was officially announced at the time the latter became a Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction. 
 In the case of a Guarantor that becomes a party to this Indenture after the Issue Date or a successor Person (including a surviving entity), the Change in Tax Law must become effective after the date that such entity (or another Person organized or resident in the same jurisdiction) first makes a payment on the Notes. 
 Notwithstanding the foregoing, no such notice of redemption will be given (a) earlier than 90 days prior to the earliest date on which the Issuer or any Guarantor, would be obliged to make such payment of Additional Amounts or withholding if a payment in respect of the Notes or the relevant Note Guarantee, as the case may be, were then due and (b) unless at the time such notice is given, the obligation to pay Additional Amounts remains in effect. 
 Prior to the giving of any notice of redemption pursuant to this Section 3.07(e), the Issuer will deliver to the Trustee 
 (1) an Officers Certificate stating that the Issuer is entitled to effect such redemption and setting forth a statement of facts showing that the conditions precedent to the right of the Issuer so to redeem have occurred (including that such obligation to pay such Additional Amounts cannot be avoided by the Issuer or any Guarantor or surviving entity taking reasonable measures available to it) and 
 44 

(2) a written opinion of independent tax advisers of recognized standing qualified under the laws of the Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction to the effect that the Issuer or a Guarantor or surviving entity, as the case may be, is or would be obligated to pay such Additional Amounts as a result of a Change in Tax Law. 
 The foregoing provisions shall apply mutatis mutandis to any successor Person, after such successor Person becomes a party to this Indenture, with respect to a Change in Tax Law occurring after the time such successor Person becomes a party to this Indenture. 
 (f) Any redemption pursuant to this Section 3.07 shall be made pursuant to the provisions of Sections 3.01 through 3.05 hereof. 
 ARTICLE 4 COVENANTS

If the Issuer or any Guarantor is required (as determined in the good faith discretion of the Issuer or Guarantor) to withhold or deduct any amount on account of Taxes imposed or levied by or on behalf of any jurisdiction (or any department, political subdivision or other governmental authority thereof or therein having the power to tax), the Issuer or Guarantor shall be entitled to make such deduction or withholding from any payment made under or with respect to the Notes, and, to the extent such Tax is imposed by a Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction, the Issuer or such Guarantor, as the case may be, shall pay additional amounts Additional Amounts as may be necessary to ensure that the net amount received by each Holder or beneficial owner of the Notes after such withholding or deduction (including any such deduction or withholding from such Additional Amounts) will be not less than the amount that would have been received by the Holder or beneficial owner if such Taxes had not been required to be withheld or deducted.

 (ix) modify the Note Guarantees in any manner adverse to the Holders 
 (x) amend, change or modify in any material respect the obligation of the Issuer to make and consummate a Change of Control Offer in respect of a Change of Control that has occurred or 
 (xi) make any change in the preceding amendment and waiver provisions. 
 (c) It shall not be necessary for the consent of the Holders under this Section to approve the particular form of any proposed amendment, supplement or waiver but it shall be sufficient if such consent approves the substance thereof. 
 (d) After an amendment, supplement or waiver under this Section 9.02 becomes effective, the Issuer shall give to the Holders affected thereby a notice briefly describing the amendment, supplement or waiver. Any failure of the Issuer to give such notice, or any defect therein, shall not, however, in any way impair or affect the validity of any such amendment, supplement or waiver. 
 Section 9.03 Intentionally Omitted . 
 Section 9.04 Revocation and Effect of Consents. 
 (a) Until an amendment, waiver or supplement becomes effective, a consent to it by a Holder is a continuing consent by the Holder and every subsequent Holder or portion of a Note that evidences the same debt as the consenting Holder s Note, even if notation of the consent is not made on any Note. However, any such Holder or subsequent Holder may revoke the consent as to his Note or portion of his Note by notice to the Trustee or the Issuer received before the date on which the Trustee receives an Officers Certificate certifying that the Holders of the requisite principal amount of Notes have consented (and not theretofore revoked such consent) to the amendment, supplement or waiver. 
 (b) The Issuer may, but shall not be obligated to, fix a record date for the purpose of determining the Holders entitled to consent to any amendment, supplement or waiver which record date shall be at least 30 days prior to the first solicitation of such consent. If a record date is fixed, then notwithstanding the last sentence of the immediately preceding paragraph, those Persons who were Holders at such record date (or their duly designated proxies), and only those Persons, shall be entitled to revoke any consent previously given, whether or not such Persons continue to be Holders after such record date. No such consent shall 
 78 

be valid or effective for more than 90 days after such record date. The Issuer shall inform the Trustee in writing of the fixed record date if applicable. 
 (c) After an amendment, supplement or waiver becomes effective, it shall bind every Holder, unless it makes a change described in any of clauses (i) through (xi) of Section 9.02(b), in which case, the amendment, supplement or waiver shall bind only each Holder of a Note who has consented to it and every subsequent Holder of a Note or portion of a Note that evidences the same debt as the consenting Holder s Note provided that any such waiver shall not impair or affect the right of any Holder to bring suit for the enforcement of any such payment on or after such respective dates without the consent of such Holder. 
 Section 9.05 Notation on or Exchange of Notes. 
 If an amendment, supplement or waiver changes the terms of a Note, the Issuer may require the Holder of the Note to deliver it to the Trustee. The Issuer shall provide the Trustee with an appropriate notation on the Note about the changed terms and cause the Trustee to return it to the Holder at the Issuer s expense. Alternatively, if the Issuer or the Trustee so determines, the Issuer in exchange for the Note shall issue and the Trustee shall authenticate a new Note that reflects the changed terms. Failure to make the appropriate notation or issue a new Note shall not affect the validity and effect of such amendment, supplement or waiver. 
 Section 9.06 Trustee to Sign Amendments, Etc. 
 The Trustee shall execute any amendment, supplement or waiver authorized pursuant to this Article 9 provided, that the Trustee may, but shall not be obligated to, execute any such amendment, supplement or waiver which affects the Trustee s own rights, duties or immunities under this Indenture. The Trustee shall be entitled to receive, and shall be fully protected in relying upon, an Opinion of Counsel and an Officers Certificate each stating that the execution of any amendment, supplement or waiver authorized pursuant to this Article 9 is authorized or permitted by this Indenture and constitutes the legal, valid and binding obligations of the Issuer enforceable in accordance with its terms. Such Opinion of Counsel and Officers Certificate shall be at the expense of the Issuer.

Issuer or such Guarantor, as the case may be, cannot avoid by the use of reasonable measures available to it (including, without limitation, making payment through a Paying Agent located in another jurisdiction), as a result of

 Prior to the giving of any notice of redemption pursuant to this Section 3.07(e), the Issuer will deliver to the Trustee 
 (1) an Officers Certificate stating that the Issuer is entitled to effect such redemption and setting forth a statement of facts showing that the conditions precedent to the right of the Issuer so to redeem have occurred (including that such obligation to pay such Additional Amounts
