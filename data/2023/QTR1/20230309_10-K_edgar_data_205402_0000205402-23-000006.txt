PART I CAUTION REGARDING FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS The following discussion should be read in conjunction with the accompanying audited consolidated financial statements of Graybar Electric Company, Inc. and its subsidiaries (collectively referred to as Graybar or the Company and sometimes referred to as we , our , or us ), the notes thereto, and Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations as of and for the year ended December 31, 2022, included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. The results shown herein are not necessarily indicative of the results to be expected in any future periods. Certain statements, other than purely historical information, including estimates, projections, statements relating to our business plans, objectives, and expected operating results, and the assumptions upon which those statements are based, are forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 (the PSLRA ), Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. These forward-looking statements generally are identified by the words believes , projects , expects , anticipates , estimates , intends , strategy , plan , may , will , would , will be , will continue , will likely result , and other similar expressions. We intend such forward-looking statements to be covered by the safe-harbor provisions for forward-looking statements contained in the PSLRA. Forward-looking statements are based on current expectations and assumptions that are subject to risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results to differ materially from the forward-looking statements. Our ability to predict results or the actual effect of future plans or strategies is inherently uncertain. Factors which could have a material adverse impact on our operations and future prospects on a consolidated basis include, but are not limited to: general economic conditions, particularly in the residential, commercial, and industrial building construction industries; a sustained interruption in the operation of our information systems; volatility in the prices of industrial commodities; cyber-attacks; increased funding requirements and expenses related to our pension plan; disruptions in our sources of supply; a pandemic, epidemic, or other public health emergency similar to the recent COVID-19 pandemic; the inability, or limitations on our ability to borrow under our existing credit facilities or any replacements thereof; adverse legal proceedings or other claims; compliance with changing governmental regulations; and the inability, or limitations on our ability, to raise debt or equity capital. These risks and uncertainties should also be considered in evaluating forward-looking statements and undue reliance should not be placed on such statements. We undertake no obligation to update or revise publicly any forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise, unless otherwise required by applicable securities law. Further information concerning our business, including additional factors that could materially impact our financial results, is included herein and in our other filings with the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (the SEC or Commission ). Actual results and the timing of events could differ materially from the forward-looking statements as a result of certain factors, a number of which are outlined in Item 1A., Risk Factors , of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. All dollar amounts in this Annual Report on Form 10-K are stated in millions except for share and per share data. Item 1. Business The Company Graybar is a leading North American distributor of electrical and communications and data networking products and is a provider of related supply chain management and logistics services. We primarily serve customers in the construction, commercial, institutional and government CIG ), and industrial utility vertical markets vertical or verticals ), with products and services that support new construction, infrastructure updates, building renovation, facility maintenance, repair and operations MRO ), and original equipment manufacturers OEM ). Through a network of over 325 locations across the United States and Canada, we serve approximately 146,000 customers. Our business is primarily based in the United States U.S. ). We also have subsidiary operations with distribution facilities in Canada and Puerto Rico. We distribute over one million products purchased from approximately 4,200 manufacturers and suppliers. In our primary role as third-party wholesale distributor, we neither manufacture nor contract to manufacture the products that we sell; however, one of our subsidiaries may contract to manufacture some of its private label lighting fixtures. We generally finance our inventory through the collection of trade receivables and trade accounts payable terms with our suppliers. We use short-term borrowing facilities to finance inventory purchases and other operating expenses when necessary, and we have not historically used long-term borrowings for this purpose. 

 3 

In addition to our extensive product offering, we provide a wide range of supply chain management services that when combined with our network of locations are designed to deliver convenience, cost savings and improved efficiency for our customers. We were incorporated in 1925 under the laws of the State of New York. Our active and retired employees own 100 of our common stock. There is no public trading market for our common stock. Our internet address is www.graybar.com . Information on our website does not constitute a part of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Competition Our industry is comprised of thousands of local and regional distributors, along with several large national and global distributors. Graybar is among the largest distributors of electrical and communications and data networking products to the construction, CIG, and industrial utility verticals in North America. Our industry is highly competitive, and we estimate that the top five distributors account for approximately 35 of the total U.S. market. Some of our largest competitors have greater global geographic scope, which may provide them an advantage, particularly with certain multi-national customers. Our industry is influenced by economic and regulatory factors that impact rates of new construction, as well as customers or end users decisions to invest in renovation and expansion of facilities and infrastructure. The industry is also affected by changes in technology, both in the products that are typically sold through distribution and in the ways customers choose to transact business with distributors. Driven by customers omnichannel buying preferences and their desire to increase efficiency and productivity, digitalization is becoming increasingly important to both manufacturers and distributors in our industry. Our pricing reflects the value associated with the products and services that we provide. We consider our prices to be generally competitive. We believe that, while price is an important customer consideration, the services we provide distinguish us from many of our competitors, whether they are distributors or manufacturers selling directly to our customer base. We view our ability to quickly supply our customers with a broad range of products through conveniently located distribution facilities as a competitive advantage that customers value. Markets Served Graybar serves a wide range of customers within certain primary verticals. The largest of these verticals is construction, which accounted for more than half of our sales in 2022. Customers within this vertical include various types of contractors and installers that perform new construction and renovation of commercial and industrial facilities and utility infrastructure. The other verticals we serve are CIG and industrial utility. The CIG vertical includes a broad range of commercial office, warehouse, and retail facilities, federal, state, and local governmental agencies, and the education and health care sectors. The industrial utility vertical includes customers and products for MRO, OEM, broadband utility and electrical transmission and distribution infrastructure. Products and Suppliers We distribute over one million products purchased from approximately 4,200 manufacturers and suppliers. Approximately 100,000 of these products are stocked in our warehouses, allowing us in most cases to provide customers with convenient, local access to the items they need every day. When the specialized nature or size of a particular shipment warrants, we arrange to ship products directly from our suppliers; otherwise, orders are filled from our own on-hand inventory. On a dollar volume basis, we filled approximately 65 of customer orders from this on-hand inventory in 2022, compared to 60 in 2021.

Approximately 50 of the products we sold during 2022 were purchased from our top 25 suppliers. However, we generally have the ability to purchase from more than one supplier for any product type, which allows us to offer alternative sources of comparable products for nearly all products. The products we distribute can be generally identified as follows: Building and Industrial Wire and Cable Automation and Controls Lighting Fixtures Fittings Distribution Equipment Fasteners Conduit and Tray Wiring Devices Telecommunications Materials Enclosures Communication Wire and Cable LED, Incandescent and Fluorescent Lamps Data Cables and Data Cords Electronic Equipment Data Connectivity Miscellaneous MRO Products 
 These products may be sold into any of the verticals we target, depending on a customer s or end user s needs. Our salesforce is empowered to sell any of these products or related services to any customer, in some cases with the support of specialists who are trained in specific industries and/or new technologies. Maintaining strong relationships with our suppliers is important to our business, and we enjoy longstanding relationships with several of our suppliers (or their predecessors). However, most of our supplier agreements are nonexclusive national or regional distributorships, terminable upon 30 to 90 days notice by either party. Sales and Distribution We sell products and services manufactured or provided by others primarily through a network of sales offices and distribution facilities located throughout the U.S. We operate multiple distribution facilities in each geographic district, each of which carries an inventory of products and operates as a wholesale distributor for the territory in which it is located. Some geographic districts have sales offices that do not carry inventory. In addition, we have twenty-one regional distribution centers containing inventories of both standard and specialized products. The regional distribution centers replenish inventories carried at our other U.S. distribution facilities and make shipments directly to customers. We also have subsidiary operations with distribution facilities located in the U.S. and Canada and a single distribution facility in Puerto Rico. Human Capital Employees As of December 31, 2022, Graybar had approximately 9,400 employees across the U.S., Canada, and Puerto Rico. Approximately 5,100 employees were employed in sales and service positions, 2,500 in supply chain positions, and the remainder in operations and other business functions. Approximately 1 of our employees are covered by collective bargaining agreements. Culture and Values Graybar s culture is defined by the core values of integrity, a long-term view, employee ownership, and customer focus. With these values as the foundation, Graybar strives to achieve profitable long-term growth, deliver an exceptional customer experience, and create a positive work environment that brings out the best in our employees. Inclusion, Diversity, Equity, and Belonging Consistent with Graybar s core values, we welcome people from all backgrounds, cultures, and experiences into our company. We want each of our employees to know that they matter and to feel a sense of belonging, ownership, and inclusion at Graybar. We believe that everyone should be treated with dignity and respect, and we work to build a collaborative environment where our employees can grow, learn, and make a difference, both as individuals and as part of the team. We hold regular reviews of employee pay with a focus on equity and conduct quarterly employee surveys asking for feedback on the Company. Our women s networking program is open to everyone and is designed to foster deeper connections and encourage professional development. We also encourage our employees to give back to their communities by providing community time off and matching employee donations to select charities. Additional information can be found in our Corporate Social Responsibility Report at https://graybar.widen.net/s/raae2vrc1c .

Safety The safety of our employees is a top priority, and our locations follow consistent safety protocols to prevent injuries and accidents. Our safety program includes ongoing training, hazard communications, and supplying personal protective equipment to employees. We also use technology in our fleet of vehicles to improve safety on the road. Compensation and Benefits Graybar s comprehensive compensation and benefits programs are designed to attract, retain, and reward employees. We offer multiple benefit plan options for medical, prescription, and dental insurance. We also provide short and long-term disability benefits at no cost. The Company offers other benefits such as life insurance, well-being programs and resources, paid vacation and holidays, profit sharing and 401(k) plans, and employee discounts. Talent Acquisition, Learning, and Development Graybar has a long track record of hiring talented employees, investing in employee development, and providing opportunities for employees to advance within the company. All employees are assigned core training requirements based on their role and have access to a large library of online courses from which they can expand their knowledge. In addition to online learning, when public health concerns and related considerations allow, we host training conferences for employees and offer development programs for interns, early-career employees, sales employees, managers, and leaders. We also offer tuition reimbursement and student loan repayment programs. Item 1A. Risk Factors Our liquidity, financial condition, and results of operations are subject to various risks, including, but not limited to, those discussed below. The risks outlined below are those that we believe are currently the most significant, although additional risks not presently known to us or that we currently deem less significant may also impact our liquidity, financial condition, and results of operations. Our sales fluctuate with general economic conditions, particularly in the residential, commercial, and industrial building construction industries. Our operating locations are widely distributed geographically across the U.S. and, to a lesser extent, Canada. Customers for our products and services are similarly diverse we have approximately 146,000 customers, and our largest customer accounts for approximately 1 of our total sales. While our geographic and customer concentrations are relatively low, our results of operations are nonetheless dependent on favorable conditions in both the general economy and the construction industry. In addition, conditions in the construction industry are greatly influenced by the availability of project financing and the cost of borrowing. Our daily activities are highly dependent on the uninterrupted operation of information systems. We are a recognized industry leader for our use of information technology in all areas of our business sales, customer service, inventory management, finance, accounting, and human resources. We maintain redundant information systems as part of our disaster recovery program and, if necessary, are able to operate in many respects using a paper-based system to help mitigate a complete interruption in our information processing capabilities. We also rely on the information systems of third parties to achieve some of our business objectives. Nonetheless, our information systems and those of third parties, including cloud service providers, remain vulnerable to natural disasters, wide-area telecommunications or power utility outages, terrorist or cyber-attacks, or other major disruptions. A sustained interruption in the functioning of information systems, however unlikely, could lower operating income by negatively impacting sales, expenses, or both. Our results of operations are impacted by changes in industrial commodity and other prices. Many of the products we sell are subject to wide and frequent price fluctuations. For example, some of the products we sell are composed primarily of copper, steel, or petroleum-based resins, including poly-vinyl chlorides PVC ), or other industrial commodities that have been subject to price volatility during the past several years. Examples of such products include wire and cable, conduit, enclosures, and fittings. Our gross margin rate on these products is relatively constant over time, though not necessarily in the short term. Therefore, if the cost of these products to us declined, pricing to our customers may decrease. Alternatively, if the cost of these products to us increased, demand from our customers may decrease. This impacts our results of operations by lowering both overall sales and gross margin. Our business and our reputation could be adversely affected by cyber-attacks against our information systems, breaches of sensitive data or changes in regulations relating to obligations to protect systems, assets, and data from the threat of cyber-attacks. Cyber-attacks designed to gain access to sensitive information and/or compromise mission-critical systems of large organizations are constantly evolving. High profile cyber-security incidents leading to unauthorized release of confidential 

 6 

information or ransoming of information systems have occurred at a number of major U.S. companies, despite widespread recognition of the cyber-attack threat and generally improved cyber-security protections. While we have invested in the protection of our information technology and maintain what we believe are adequate security procedures and controls over information systems and financial and other sensitive data, the risks to our information systems and data are evolving rapidly. These risks are also applicable where we rely on outside vendors to provide services, which may operate in a cloud environment. We are dependent on these third-party vendors to operate secure and reliable systems. A breach in our systems or those of our third party providers that results in system compromise or the unauthorized release of sensitive data, including without limitation, personally identifiable information, could have a material adverse effect on our reputation and lead to financial losses from remedial actions, loss of business, or potential liability. A cyber-security incident resulting in the unauthorized release of sensitive data or compromise of our information systems or those of third parties could also materially increase the costs we already incur to protect against such risks. While we also seek to obtain assurances that third parties we interact with will protect sensitive information, there is a risk that such data may be compromised. In addition, as the regulatory environment relating to a company s obligation to protect information systems and sensitive data becomes more strict, a material failure on our part to comply with applicable regulations could subject us to fines, regulatory sanctions and lawsuits. We may experience losses or be subject to increased funding and expenses related to our pension plan. A decline in the market value of plan assets or a change in the interest rates used to measure the required minimum funding levels and the pension obligation may increase the funding requirements of our defined benefit pension plan, the pension obligation itself, and pension expenses. Government regulations may accelerate the timing and amounts required to fund the plan. Demographic changes in our workforce, including longer life expectancies, increased numbers of retirements, and age at retirement may also cause funding requirements, pension expenses, and the pension obligation to be higher than expected. Any or all of these factors could have a negative impact on our liquidity, financial position, and/or our results of operations. We purchase all of the products we sell to our customers from other parties. As a wholesale distributor, our business and financial results are dependent on our ability to purchase products from manufacturers not controlled by us that we, in turn, sell to our customers. Approximately 50 of our purchases are made from only 25 manufacturers. A sustained disruption in our ability to source products from one or more of the largest of these vendors might have a material impact on our ability to fulfill customer orders, resulting in lost sales and, in rare cases, damages for late or non-delivery. A pandemic, epidemic or other public health emergency similar to the recent COVID-19 pandemic could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows. The impacts relating to the potential effect of a pandemic, epidemic, or other public health emergency similar to the recent COVID-19 pandemic on our business and the costs that we may incur as a result cannot be reasonably estimated but could be material. These events can put pressure on our supply chain due to several factors, including, but not limited to, global logistics and raw material and labor availability. Depending on the scope and duration of supply chain disruptions, we may experience further increases in product and related costs which we may not be able to pass on to our customers. This could result in a reduction in gross margin dollars and loss of net sales due to product unavailability or delay. In addition, if our customers are directly impacted by business curtailments or weak market conditions, this may result in lower net sales and higher than expected bad debt losses, which could impact our results of operations and our cash flows from operating activities. In the event that our operating performance or that of our suppliers were to decline, our vendor allowances could also be reduced, which could negatively impact our results of operations. Our borrowing agreements contain financial covenants and certain other restrictions on our activities and those of our subsidiaries. Our amended revolving credit facility and private placement shelf agreements impose contractual limits on, among other things, indebtedness, liens, changes in the nature of business, investments, mergers and acquisitions, the issuance of equity securities, the disposition of assets and the dissolution of certain subsidiaries, transactions with affiliates, as well as securitizations, factoring transactions, and transactions with sanctioned parties or parties in violation of certain U.S. or Canadian anti-corruption and anti-money laundering laws. In addition, we are required to maintain acceptable financial ratios relating to debt leverage and interest coverage. Our failure to comply with these obligations may cause an event of default and may trigger an acceleration of the debt owed to our creditors or limit our ability to obtain additional credit under these facilities. While we expect to remain in compliance with the terms of our amended revolving credit facility and private placement shelf agreements, our failure to do so could have a negative impact on our ability to borrow funds and maintain acceptable levels of cash flow from financing activities. We are subject to legal proceedings and other claims arising out of the conduct of our business. These proceedings and claims relate to public and private sector transactions, product liability, contract performance, and employment matters. On the basis of information currently available to us, we do not believe that existing proceedings and claims will have a material impact on our financial position or results of operations. However, litigation is unpredictable, and we could incur judgments or enter into settlements for current or future claims that could adversely affect our financial position or our results of operations in a particular period.

More specifically with respect to asbestos litigation, as of December 31, 2022, 3,383 individual cases and 56 multiple-plaintiff cases are pending that allege actual or potential asbestos-related injuries resulting from the use of or exposure to products allegedly sold by us. Additional claims will likely be filed against us in the future. Our insurance carriers have historically borne virtually all costs and liability with respect to this litigation and are continuing to do so. Accordingly, our future liability with respect to pending and unasserted claims is dependent on the continued solvency of our insurance carriers. Other factors that could impact this liability are: the number of future claims filed against us; the defense and settlement costs associated with these claims; changes in the litigation environment, including changes in federal or state law governing the compensation of asbestos claimants; adverse jury verdicts in excess of historic settlement amounts; and bankruptcies of other asbestos defendants. Moreover, any predictions with respect to these variables are subject to even greater uncertainty as the projection period lengthens. In light of these uncertainties, we believe that our asbestos reserves represent the best estimate within a range of possible outcomes, over an extended period of time, less than or equal to recorded corresponding anticipated recoverable insurance proceeds. As part of the process to develop these off-setting estimates of future asbestos costs and insurance proceeds, a range of long-term cost and recovery models of future asbestos costs was developed. These models are based on national studies that predict the number of people likely to develop asbestos related diseases and are influenced by assumptions regarding long-term inflation rates for indemnity payments and defense costs, as well as other variables previously mentioned. Because any of these factors may change, our future exposure is unpredictable, and it is possible that we may incur costs that would have a material adverse impact on our liquidity, financial position, or results of operations in future periods. Compliance with changing government regulations may result in increased costs and risks to the company. Our public company and multi-national customers are increasingly subject to governmental regulation globally. Existing and future laws and regulations may impede our growth. These regulations and laws may cover, among other things, public health, taxation, privacy, data protection, pricing, content, copyrights, distribution, energy consumption, environmental regulation, electronic contracts, communications and marketing, consumer protection, the design and operation of websites, and the characteristics and quality of products and services. Unfavorable regulations and laws could diminish the demand for our products and services and increase our cost of doing business. If we are not able to obtain for certain customers the information that they require in part as a result of these regulations, they may limit their business with us. These regulatory and customer-driven requirements may increase our operating costs, and, due to competitive pressures, we may not be able to increase our prices sufficiently to avoid a reduction in our income from operations. The value to our shareholders of our common stock depends on the regular payment of dividends, which are paid at the discretion of our Board of Directors. The purchase price for our common stock under our purchase option is the same as the issue price. Accordingly, as long as we exercise our option to purchase, appreciation in the value of an investment in our common stock is dependent primarily on our ability and our Board of Directors willingness to declare dividends. Although cash dividends have been paid on the common stock each year since 1929, as with any corporation s common stock, payment of dividends is subject to the discretion of our Board of Directors. There is no public trading market for our common stock. Our common stock is 100 owned by active and retired employees. Common stock may not be sold by the holder thereof, except after first offering it to us. We have always exercised this purchase option in the past and expect to continue to do so. As a result, no public trading market for our common stock exists, nor is one expected to develop. This lack of a public trading market for our common stock may limit our ability to raise large amounts of equity capital, which could constrain our long-term business growth. Item 1B. Unresolved Staff Comments Not applicable. Item 2. Properties We operate in thirteen geographical districts in the U.S., each of which maintains multiple distribution facilities that consist primarily of warehouse space. A small portion of each distribution facility is used for offices. Some districts have sales offices that do not carry an inventory of products. Facilities range in size from 800 to 211,000 square feet, with the average being approximately 33,000 square feet. We also have regional distribution centers ranging in size from 130,000 to 324,000 square feet. Our subsidiaries have sales and distribution facilities ranging in size from 1,500 to 95,000 square feet. Our headquarters are located in St. Louis, Missouri in an 83,000 square foot building owned by us. We also own a 200,000 square foot operations and administration center in St. Louis.

PART II Item 5. Market for the Registrant s Common Equity, Related Stockholder Matters and Issuer Purchases of Equity Securities Our common stock is 100 owned by active and retired employees, and there is no public trading market for our common stock. Since 1928, substantially all of the issued and outstanding shares of common stock have been held of record by voting trustees under successive voting trust agreements. A new Voting Trust Agreement was established effective March 3, 2017, which expires by its terms on March 1, 2027 because under applicable New York law, a voting trust may not have a term greater than ten years. At December 31, 2022, approximately 83 of our outstanding common stock was held in the voting trust. The participation of shareholders in the voting trust is voluntary at the time the voting trust is created, but is irrevocable during its term. Shareholders who elect not to participate in the voting trust hold their common stock as shareholders of record. Shareholders may elect to participate in the voting trust at any time during the term of the voting trust. No holder of our common stock or voting trust interests representing our common stock common stock , common shares , or shares may sell, transfer or otherwise dispose of any shares without first offering us the option to purchase those shares at the price at which they were issued. We also have the option to purchase at the issue price the common shares of any shareholder who ceases to be an employee for any reason other than death or retirement (as defined in our amended restated certificate of incorporation), and on the first anniversary of any holder s death. In the past, we have always exercised these purchase options, and we expect to continue to do so in the foreseeable future. However, we can make no assurance that we will continue to exercise our purchase option in the future. All outstanding shares have been issued at 20.00 per share. The following table sets forth information regarding purchases of common stock by the Company for the three months ended December 31, 2022, all of which were made pursuant to the foregoing provisions: Issuer Purchases of Equity Securities Period Total Number of Shares Purchased Average Price Paid Per Share Total Number of Shares Purchased as Part of Publicly Announced Plans or Programs October 1 to October 31, 2022 53,513 20.00 N/A November 1 to November 30, 2022 37,466 20.00 N/A December 1 to December 31, 2022 63,563 20.00 N/A Total 154,542 20.00 N/A

Item 7. Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Management s Discussion and Analysis provides a narrative description of the Company s results of operations, financial condition, liquidity, and cash flows for the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021. This discussion should be read in conjunction with the accompanying consolidated financial statements and the notes to the consolidated financial statements included in Item 8., Financial Statements and Supplementary Data , of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. For comparison of the results of operations relating to the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, refer to our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2021, Part II., Item 7., filed with the SEC on March 10, 2022. Business Overview For the fiscal year ended December 31, 2022, Graybar surpassed 10.0 billion in net sales for the first time in company history. In addition to achieving record net sales, we also set new records for income from operations and net income attributable to the Company. Our sustained focus on profitable growth led to the increase in net sales and gross margin. Several other factors also contributed to our results, including price inflation, a favorable sales mix, and favorable vendor allowances. Net sales for the year ended December 31, 2022 totaled 10,534.4 million, an increase of 1,767.1 million, or 20.2 , from net sales of 8,767.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2021. Gross margin for the year ended December 31, 2022 increased 457.9 million, or 27.1 , to 2,147.1 million, compared to gross margin of 1,689.2 million for last year. Our gross margin rate was 20.4 for the year ended December 31, 2022, compared to 19.3 for the year ended December 31, 2021. Selling, general and administrative SG A expenses increased 202.3 million, or 16.3 , to 1,442.8 million for the twelve months ended December 31, 2022, from 1,240.5 million for the twelve months ended December 31, 2021, primarily due to higher compensation and benefit-related expenses and higher outgoing freight expenses. SG A as a percentage of net sales decreased to 13.7 for the year ended 2022, compared to 14.1 for 2021. Income from operations increased 243.4 million, or 59.3 , to 653.8 million for the twelve months ended December 31, 2022, from 410.4 million for the same twelve-month period last year. Our increase in gross margin, partially offset by the increase in SG A expenses, contributed to this improvement. As a result, the total provision for income taxes increased 67.9 million, or 77.2 , to 155.8 million for the twelve months ended December 31, 2022, from 87.9 million for the same twelve-month period last year. Our non-operating expenses for the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021 contained non-cash pension settlement charges of 27.0 million and 30.4 million, respectively. These charges were recognized because the cost of all pension settlements during the respective year were greater than the sum of the service and interest cost components of the annual net periodic pension cost. Net income attributable to Graybar for the year ended December 31, 2022 was 452.9 million, an increase of 190.5 million, or 72.6 , compared to 262.4 million for the same twelve-month period last year. We continue to see steady demand for our products and services, but rising interest rates, inflation, and employment issues are having an impact on the markets we serve. While supply chain conditions are showing signs of improvement, ongoing challenges remain for certain product categories. As we monitor and adapt to changing economic conditions, we remain focused on providing exceptional service to our customers, minimizing potential risks, and managing our business wisely. We also continue to invest in people, process improvement, and technology to support profitable growth, while we pursue new opportunities to broaden our reach and strengthen our long-term position as a leader in supply chain innovation.

Consolidated Results of Operations The following table sets forth certain information relating to our operations stated in millions of dollars and as a percentage of net sales for the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021, and 2020: 2022 2021 2020 Dollars Percent of Net Sales Dollars Percent of Net Sales Dollars Percent of Net Sales Net Sales 10,534.4 100.0 8,767.3 100.0 7,265.7 100.0 Cost of merchandise sold (8,387.3) (79.6) (7,078.1) (80.7) (5,896.2) (81.2) Gross Margin 2,147.1 20.4 1,689.2 19.3 1,369.5 18.8 Selling, general and administrative expenses (1,442.8) (13.7) (1,240.5) (14.1) (1,098.9) (15.1) Depreciation and amortization (53.4) (0.5) (49.8) (0.6) (52.8) (0.7) Other income, net 2.9 11.5 0.1 7.0 0.1 Income from Operations 653.8 6.2 410.4 4.7 224.8 3.1 Non-operating expenses (44.3) (0.4) (59.5) (0.7) (58.5) (0.8) Income before Provision for Income Taxes 609.5 5.8 350.9 4.0 166.3 2.3 Provision for income taxes (155.8) (1.5) (87.9) (1.0) (44.2) (0.6) Net Income 453.7 4.3 263.0 3.0 122.1 1.7 Net income attributable to noncontrolling interests (0.8) (0.6) (0.3) Net Income attributable to Graybar Electric Company, Inc. 452.9 4.3 262.4 3.0 121.8 1.7 
 2022 Compared to 2021 Net sales totaled 10,534.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2022, compared to 8,767.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2021, an increase of 1,767.1 million, or 20.2 . For the year ended December 31, 2022, net sales in our construction, CIG, and industrial utility verticals increased by 16.6 , 21.8 , and 30.5 , respectively, compared to the year ended December 31, 2021. Gross margin increased 457.9 million, or 27.1 , to 2,147.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2022, from 1,689.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2021. Our gross margin rate was 20.4 for the year ended December 31, 2022, compared to 19.3 for the year ended December 31, 2021. The increases in gross margin and gross margin rate were primarily due to a favorable sales mix and gross margin initiatives. SG A expenses increased 202.3 million, or 16.3 , to 1,442.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2022, compared to 1,240.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2021, mainly due to higher compensation and benefit-related expenses and higher outgoing freight expenses. SG A expenses as a percentage of net sales were 13.7 for the year ended December 31, 2022, compared to 14.1 for the year ended December 31, 2021. Depreciation and amortization for the year ended December 31, 2022 increased 3.6 million, or 7.2 , to 53.4 million from 49.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2021, primarily due to higher amortization expense of intangible assets and an increase in property, at cost. Total property, at cost, at December 31, 2022 was 1,103.1 million, an increase of 44.3 million, or 4.2 , when compared to total property, at cost, at December 31, 2021 of 1,058.8 million. Depreciation as a percentage of net sales totaled 0.5 for the year ended December 31, 2022, down from 0.6 for the year ended December 31, 2021. Other income, net totaled 2.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2022, compared to 11.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2021. Other income, net consists primarily of gains or losses on the disposal of property, trade receivable interest charges to customers, and other miscellaneous income items related to our business activities. The decrease in other income, net was primarily due to gains on sales of property classified as assets held for sale in 2021, compared to no sales of property classified as assets held for sale in 2022. Non-operating expenses decreased 15.2 million, or 25.5 , to 44.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2022, from 59.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2021. This was due to decreases in the non-service cost components of the pension net periodic benefit costs of 16.3 million, partially offset by an increase in interest expense, net of 1.0 million. We recognized a non- 

 12 

cash pension settlement charge of 27.0 million during the year ended December 31, 2022, compared to a non-cash pension settlement charge of 30.4 million during the year ended December 31, 2021. The increase in interest expense, net was primarily due to higher levels of average outstanding short-term borrowings and higher interest rates for the year ended December 31, 2022, compared to the year ended December 31, 2021. Income before provision for income taxes increased 258.6 million, or 73.7 , to 609.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2022, compared to 350.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2021. The increase was primarily due to our increase in gross margin partially offset by an increase in SG A expenses. Our provision for income taxes increased 67.9 million, or 77.2 , to 155.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2022 from 87.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2021. Our effective tax rate was 25.6 for the year ended December 31, 2022, up from 25.0 for the year ended December 31, 2021. The increase in the effective tax rate is largely due to reductions in federal tax credits and increased state expense. Net income attributable to Graybar Electric Company, Inc. for the year ended December 31, 2022 increased 190.5 million, or 72.6 , to 452.9 million from 262.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2021. Financial Condition and Liquidity Summary We manage our liquidity and capital levels so that we have the capability to invest in the growth of our business, meet debt service obligations, finance anticipated capital expenditures, pay dividends, make benefit payments, finance information technology needs, fund acquisitions, and finance other miscellaneous cash outlays. We believe that maintaining a strong company financial condition enables us to competitively access multiple financing channels and invest in strategic long-term growth plans. We have historically funded our working capital requirements using cash flows generated by the collection of trade receivables and trade accounts payable terms with our suppliers, supplemented by short-term bank lines of credit, if necessary. Capital expenditures have been financed primarily with cash from working capital management and short-term bank lines of credit. Cash Flows The following table summarizes our cash flows from operating, investing and financing activities for each of the past three years: Total cash provided by (used by): 2022 2021 2020 Operating Activities 352.9 127.5 301.7 Investing Activities (150.8) (149.7) (50.4) Financing Activities (181.2) (60.5) (180.9) Net Increase (Decrease) in Cash 20.9 (82.7) 70.4 
 Our cash and cash equivalents were 69.4 million at December 31, 2022, an increase of 20.9 million, or 43.1 , from 48.5 million at December 31, 2021. The increase in cash on hand at December 31, 2022 from December 31, 2021 is reflective of strong cash flows from operating activities as a result of increased net income and effective working capital management. As a result, short-term borrowings decreased by 92.6 million, or 74.6 , to 31.6 million at December 31, 2022 from 124.2 million at December 31, 2021. Current assets exceeded current liabilities by 1,031.5 million at December 31, 2022, an increase of 301.2 million, or 41.2 , from 730.3 million at December 31, 2021. Operating Activities Net cash flows provided by operating activities for the year ended December 31, 2022 was 352.9 million, compared to cash flows provided by operating activities of 127.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2021. Cash provided by operating activities for the year ended December 31, 2022 was attributable to net income of 453.7 million, adjusted for non-cash depreciation and amortization expenses of 53.4 million, non-cash operating lease expense of 39.5 million, non-cash pension settlement charge of 27.0 million, and an increase in trade accounts payable of 213.6 million, partially offset by an increase in trade receivables of 235.7 million and an increase in merchandise inventory levels of 201.0 million.

The average number of days of sales in trade receivables for the year ended December 31, 2022 increased modestly compared to the same twelve-month period in 2021. The days in inventory increased significantly for the year ended December 31, 2022 compared to the year ended December 31, 2021. Investing Activities Net cash used by investing activities was 150.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2022, compared to 149.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2021, an increase of 1.1 million. Cash used by investing activities for the year ended December 31, 2022 was primarily a result of the 2022 acquisitions for a combined preliminary purchase price, net of cash acquired of 83.7 million and capital expenditures of 67.7 million, compared to the 2021 acquisitions for a preliminary purchase price, net of cash acquired of 88.7 million, capital expenditures of 70.9 million, and proceeds from disposal of property of 9.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2021. For further discussion of our acquisitions, refer to Note 17, Acquisitions , of the notes to the consolidated financial statements included in Item 8., Financial Statements and Supplementary Data of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Financing Activities Net cash used by financing activities totaled 181.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2022, compared to net cash used by financing activities of 60.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2021, an increase in cash used of 120.7 million. The increase in cash used was primarily due to net payments on short-term borrowings of 92.6 million during the year ended December 31, 2022, compared to an increase in short-term borrowings of 74.2 million during the year ended December 31, 2021, partially offset by a decrease in dividends paid during the year ended December 31, 2022, compared to the same period in 2021. Cash dividends paid totaled 92.8 million, or 4.00 per share, for the year ended December 31, 2022, compared to 137.2 million, or 6.00 per share, for the year ended December 31, 2021. Liquidity Our cash and cash equivalents were 69.4 million at December 31, 2022, compared to 48.5 million at December 31, 2021. We also had a 750.0 million amended, unsecured, committed revolving credit facility Amended Credit Agreement with 718.1 million in available capacity at December 31, 2022, compared to available capacity of 625.4 million at December 31, 2021. We had short-term borrowings of 31.6 million at December 31, 2022, of which 30.0 million were under the Amended Credit Agreement. We had short-term borrowings of 124.2 million at December 31, 2021, all of which were under the Amended Credit Agreement. At December 31, 2022 and 2021, we also had two uncommitted, unsecured private placement shelf agreements Shelf Agreements ). One of the Shelf Agreements is expected to allow us to issue senior promissory notes up to 100.0 million to PGIM, Inc., at fixed rate terms to be agreed upon at the time of any issuance during a three-year issuance period ending in August 2023. Our other Shelf Agreement is expected to allow us to issue senior promissory notes up to 150.0 million to MetLife Investment Management, LLC (formerly known as MetLife Investment Advisors, LLC), and MetLife Investment Management Limited (collectively, MetLife and each other MetLife affiliate that becomes party to the agreement at fixed or floating rate economic terms to be agreed upon at the time of any issuance during a three-year issuance period ending in June 2024. We have not issued any notes under the Shelf Agreements as of December 31, 2022 and 2021. For further discussion related to our Amended Credit Agreement and our Shelf Agreements, refer to Note 12, Debt , of the notes to the consolidated financial statements located in Item 8., Financial Statements and Supplementary Data , of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. We had total letters of credit of 7.8 million outstanding at December 31, 2022, of which 1.9 million were issued under the Amended Credit Agreement. We had total letters of credit of 6.1 million outstanding at December 31, 2021, of which 0.4 million were issued under the Amended Credit Agreement. The letters of credit are issued primarily to support certain workers compensation insurance policies and support performance under certain customer contracts.

Inflation The industry experienced rising product costs in 2022 and 2021. In addition, given supply chain constraints, freight and shipping costs were elevated as well. Inflation impacted many of the products we purchase and transport. We were able to mitigate the adverse effects of higher costs on our gross margin rate in both 2022 and 2021 by increasing prices and consolidating shipments for the products and services that we offer. Contractual Obligations and Commitments As of December 31, 2022, we had contractual obligations consisting of 209.4 million in operating lease obligations and 2,804.8 million in purchase obligations. Operating lease obligations consist of both principal and interest payments. Purchase obligations consist of open purchase orders issued in the normal course of business. Many of these purchase obligations may be cancelled with limited or no financial penalties. Additionally at December 31, 2022, we had 144.8 million of accrued, unfunded pension obligations, and 71.2 million of accrued, unfunded employment-related benefit obligations, of which 62.3 million is related to our postretirement benefit plan. We expect to make contributions totaling 40.0 million to our defined benefit pension plan during 2023; however, additional contributions may be made at our discretion. In addition, we expect to fund 3.9 million for nonqualified pension benefits during 2023. We contributed 42.8 million to our defined benefit pension plan and funded 2.0 million for nonqualified benefits in 2022. Critical Accounting Estimates Our consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the U.S. GAAP ). In connection with the preparation of our financial statements we are required to make estimates and assumptions about future events and apply judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue, expenses and the related disclosures. We base our estimates, assumptions and judgments on historical experience, current trends and other factors that management believes to be relevant at the time our consolidated financial statements are prepared. On a regular basis, we review the accounting policies, estimates, assumptions, and judgments to ensure that our financial statements are presented fairly and in accordance with GAAP. However, because future events and their effects cannot be determined with certainty, actual results could differ from our estimates and assumptions, and such differences could be material. Our significant accounting policies are discussed in Note 2, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies , of the notes to the consolidated financial statements located in Item 8., Financial Statements and Supplementary Data , of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. We believe that the following accounting estimates are the most critical to aid in fully understanding and evaluating our reported financial results, and they require our most difficult, subjective or complex judgments, resulting from the need to make estimates about the effect of matters inherently uncertain. We have reviewed these critical accounting estimates and related disclosures with the Audit Committee of our Board. Pension and Postretirement Benefits Plans We account for our pension and postretirement benefit obligations in accordance with the accounting standards for defined benefit pension and other postretirement plans. These standards require the use of several important assumptions, including the discount rate and expected long-term rate of return on plan assets, among others, in determining our obligations and the annual cost of our pension and postretirement benefits. These assumptions are assessed annually, or more frequently when warranted, in consultation with independent actuaries and investment advisors as of December 31 and adjustments are made as needed. The following table presents key assumptions used to measure the pension and postretirement benefits obligations at December 31: Pension Benefits Postretirement Benefits 2022 2021 2022 2021 Discount rate 5.55 2.86 5.70 2.71 Expected return on plan assets 5.00 5.00 
 To determine the long-term expected rate of return, we consider macroeconomic conditions, the historical experience and expected future long-term performance of the plan assets, as well as the current and expected allocation of the plan assets. The pension plan s asset allocation as of December 31, 2022, was approximately 50 fixed income investments, 12 equity securities and 

 15 

38 other investments, in line with our policy ranges. We periodically evaluate the allocation of plan assets among the different investment classes to ensure that they are within policy guidelines and ranges. Holding all other assumptions constant, we estimate that a one percentage point decrease in the expected return on plan assets would have increased our 2022 pension expense by approximately 6.1 million. Our expected long-term rate of return on plan assets assumption will increase to 5.25 for fiscal year 2023. In determining the discount rate, we use yields on high-quality fixed-income investments (including among other things, Moody s Aa corporate bond yields) that match the duration and expected cash flows of the future pension obligations. To the extent the discount rate increases or decreases, our pension and postretirement obligations are decreased or increased accordingly. Holding all other assumptions constant, we estimate that a one percentage point decrease in the discount rate used to calculate both pension expense for 2022 and the pension liability as of December 31, 2022 would have increased pension expense by 14.7 million in 2022 and the pension liability by 59.5 million at December 31, 2022. Similarly, a one percentage point decrease in the discount rate would have increased postretirement benefits expense by 0.1 million in 2022 and the postretirement benefits liability by 3.7 million at December 31, 2022. Merchandise Inventory We value our inventories at the lower of cost (generally determined using the last-in, first-out LIFO cost method) or market. LIFO accounting is a method of accounting that, compared with other inventory accounting methods, generally provides better matching of current costs with current sales. In assessing the ultimate realization of inventories, we make judgments as to our return rights to suppliers and future demand requirements and record an inventory reserve for obsolete inventory. If actual future demand, market conditions, or supplier return provisions are less favorable than those projected by management, additional inventory write-downs may be required. For the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021, and 2020, there were no material differences between our estimated reserve levels and actual write-offs. Income Taxes We recognize deferred tax assets and liabilities to reflect the future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in the financial statements or tax returns. A deferred tax asset or liability results from the temporary difference between an item s carrying value as reflected in the financial statements and its tax basis, and is calculated using enacted applicable tax rates. We assess the likelihood that our deferred tax assets will be recovered from future taxable income and, to the extent we believe that recovery is not likely, a valuation allowance is established. Changes in the valuation allowance, when recorded, are included in the provision for income taxes in the consolidated financial statements. We classify interest expense and penalties as part of our provision for income taxes based upon applicable federal and state interest/underpayment percentages. We assess uncertainty regarding tax positions taken in previously filed returns and record reserves in accordance with the guidance under Accounting Standards Codification 740-10, Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes . New Accounting Standards New accounting standards are discussed in Note 2, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies , of the notes to the consolidated financial statements located in Item 8., Financial Statements and Supplementary Data , of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk Market risk is the risk of loss arising from adverse changes in market rates and prices, including commodity prices, foreign currency exchange rates, interest rates, and equity prices. Our primary exposures to market risk are commodity price risk, foreign currency exchange rate risk, and interest rate risk associated with debt obligations. Commodity Price Risk We have exposure to commodity price risk on products we purchase for resale. Examples of such products include wire and cable, conduit, enclosures, and fittings. Foreign Currency Exchange Rate Risk The functional currency for our Canadian subsidiary is the Canadian dollar. Accordingly, its balance sheet amounts are translated at the exchange rates in effect at year-end and its income and expenses are translated using average exchange rates prevailing during 

 16 

the year. Currency translation adjustments are included in accumulated other comprehensive loss. Exposure to foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations is not material. Interest Rate Risk Our interest expense is sensitive to changes in the general level of market interest rates. Changes in interest rates have different impacts on the fixed-rate and variable-rate portions of our debt portfolio. A change in market interest rates on the fixed-rate portion of our debt portfolio impacts the fair value of the financial instrument, but has no impact on interest incurred or cash flows. A change in market interest rates on the variable-rate portion of our debt portfolio impacts the interest incurred and cash flows, but does not impact the fair value of the financial instrument. Based on 31.6 million in variable-rate debt outstanding at December 31, 2022, a one percentage point increase in interest rates would increase our interest expense by 0.3 million per year. The following table provides information about financial instruments that are sensitive to changes in interest rates. The table presents principal payments on debt and related weighted-average interest rates by expected maturity dates: December 31, 2022 Debt Instruments 2023 2024 2025 2026 2027 After 2027 Total Fair Value Long-term, fixed-rate debt 1.6 1.6 1.2 0.5 0.3 0.3 5.5 5.2 Weighted-average interest rate 5.72 6.10 6.21 7.87 12.58 12.88 Short-term, variable-rate borrowings 31.6 31.6 31.6 Weighted-average interest rate 5.39

Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm To the Shareholders and the Board of Directors of Graybar Electric Company, Inc. Opinion on the Financial Statements We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Graybar Electric Company, Inc. and Subsidiaries (the Company) as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, the related consolidated statements of income, comprehensive income, changes in shareholders equity and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2022, and the related notes (collectively referred to as the consolidated financial statements ). In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company at December 31, 2022 and 2021, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2022, in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. Basis for Opinion These financial statements are the responsibility of the Company s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company s financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB) and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. The Company is not required to have, nor were we engaged to perform, an audit of its internal control over financial reporting. As part of our audits we are required to obtain an understanding of internal control over financial reporting but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Company s internal control over financial reporting. Accordingly, we express no such opinion. Our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion. Critical Audit Matter The critical audit matter communicated below is a matter arising from the current period audit of the financial statements that was communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that: (1) relates to accounts or disclosures that are material to the financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective or complex judgments. The communication of the critical audit matter does not alter in any way our opinion on the consolidated financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matter below, providing a separate opinion on the critical audit matter or on the account or disclosure to which it relates.

Defined Benefit Pension Obligation Description of the Matter At December 31, 2022, the Company s aggregate defined benefit pension obligation was 577.9 million and exceeded the fair value of pension plan assets of 433.1 million, resulting in an unfunded defined benefit pension obligation of 144.8 million. As discussed in Note 13 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company updates the estimates used to measure the defined benefit pension obligation and plan assets at December 31 or upon a remeasurement event. Auditing the defined benefit pension obligation was complex and required the involvement of actuarial specialists due to the judgmental nature of certain actuarial assumptions (e.g., discount rate and expected return on plan assets) used in the Company s measurement process. The discount rate and expected return on plan assets assumptions have a significant effect on the projected benefit obligation. How We Addressed the Matter in Our Audit To test the defined benefit pension obligation, we performed audit procedures that included, among others, evaluating the methodology used, the significant actuarial assumptions described above, and the underlying data used by the Company. We evaluated the actuarial assumptions used by management and the change in the defined benefit pension obligation from the prior year. In addition, we involved an actuarial specialist to assist in evaluating management s methodology for determining the projected benefit obligation, including the actuarial assumptions utilized. For example, we evaluated management s methodology for determining the discount rate that reflects the maturity and duration of the benefit payments used to measure the defined benefit pension obligation. To evaluate the expected return on plan assets, we assessed whether management s assumptions were consistent with a range of returns for a portfolio of comparative investments. We also tested the completeness and accuracy of the underlying data, including the participant data used in the actuarial calculations.

During the year ended December 31, 2020, we sold assets classified as held for sale with a net book value of million, and recorded a net gain of million in other income, net . We review long-lived assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the asset may not be recoverable. For assets classified as held and used, impairment may occur if projected undiscounted cash flows are not adequate to cover the carrying value of the assets. In such cases, additional analysis is conducted to determine the amount of the loss to be recognized. The impairment loss is calculated as the difference between the carrying amount of the asset and its estimated fair value. The analysis requires estimates of the amount and timing of projected cash flows and, where applicable, selection of an appropriate discount rate. Such estimates are critical in determining whether any impairment charge should be recorded and the amount of such charge if an impairment loss is deemed necessary. , some of which may include options to extend the leases for up to , and some of which may include options to terminate the leases within . In addition to fixed lease payments, we incur variable lease charges that are recognized as incurred. These charges are primarily for maintenance and real estate taxes on leased facilities.

The Amended Credit Agreement includes a million sublimit (in U.S. or Canadian dollars) for borrowings by Graybar Canada. Our borrowing availability under the facility is reduced by the amount of borrowings by Graybar Canada, but we may use the sublimit amount to increase our borrowings, to the extent available. If we were to use available borrowings under the Amended Credit Agreement that included the sublimit amount, then Graybar Canada s available capacity would be reduced by our use of such amount. The Amended Credit Agreement contains an accordion feature, which allowed us to request increases in the aggregate borrowing commitments of up to million. Interest on our borrowings under the Amended Credit Agreement will be based on, at the borrower s election, either (A) (i) the base rate (as defined in the agreement) or (ii) LIBOR (in the case U.S. dollar-denominated borrowings) or (B) (i) the base rate (as defined in the agreement) or (ii) CDOR (in the case of Graybar Canada as borrower with respect to Canadian dollar-denominated borrowings), in each case plus an applicable margin, as determined by the pricing grid set forth in the Amended Credit Agreement. The Amended Credit Agreement added LIBOR fallback language to address the announced future cessation of specified dollar LIBOR tenor settings. In connection with such a borrowing, the applicable borrower will also select the term of the loan from available tenors, up to six months, or automatically renew with the consent of the lenders. Swing line loans, which are daily loans, will bear interest at a rate based on, at the borrower s election, either (i) the base rate or (ii) the daily floating Eurodollar rate (or CDOR, in the case of Graybar Canada with respect to Canadian dollar-denominated borrowings). In addition to interest payments, there are certain fees and obligations associated with borrowings, swing-line loans, letters of credit and other administrative matters. Borrowings of Graybar Canada may be in U.S. dollars or Canadian dollars. The obligations of Graybar Canada are secured by the guaranty of Graybar and any material domestic subsidiaries of Graybar (as defined). Under no circumstances will Graybar Canada use its borrowings to benefit Graybar or its operations, including without limitation to repay any of Graybar s obligations under the facility. The Amended Credit Agreement provides for a quarterly commitment fee ranging from to per annum, subject to adjustment based upon the consolidated leverage ratio for a fiscal quarter, and letter of credit fees ranging from to per annum payable quarterly, subject to such adjustment. Borrowings can be either base rate loans plus a margin ranging from to , or LIBOR loans plus a margin ranging from to , both subject to adjustment based upon the consolidated leverage ratio, or an alternative benchmark rate. Availability under the Amended Credit Agreement is subject to the accuracy of representations and warranties and absence of a default and, in the case of Canadian borrowings denominated in Canadian dollars, the absence of a material adverse change in the national or international financial markets, which would make it impracticable to lend Canadian dollars. The Amended Credit Agreement contains customary affirmative and negative covenants for credit facilities of this type, including limitations on us and all but certain of our subsidiaries with respect to indebtedness (with specified, limited exceptions), liens, changes in the nature of our business, investments, mergers and acquisitions, issuance of equity securities, dispositions of assets and dissolution of certain subsidiaries, transactions with affiliates, as well as securitizations, factoring transactions, and transactions with sanctioned parties or in violation of certain US or Canadian anti-corruption and anti-money laundering laws. There are also maximum leverage ratio and minimum interest coverage ratio financial covenants to which we will be subject during the term of the Amended Credit Agreement. The Amended Credit Agreement also provides for customary events of default, including a failure to pay principal, interest or fees when due, failure to comply with covenants, the fact that any representation or warranty made by any of the credit parties is materially incorrect, the occurrence of an event of default under certain other indebtedness by us and our subsidiaries, the commencement of certain insolvency or receivership events affecting any of the credit parties, certain actions under the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 ERISA and the occurrence of a change in control of any of the credit parties (subject to certain permitted transactions as described in the Amended Credit Agreement). Upon the occurrence of an event of default, the commitments of the lenders may be terminated and all outstanding obligations of the credit parties under the Amended Credit Agreement may be declared immediately due and payable.

 The actuarial gain for the Pension Plan in 2022 was primarily related to increases in the discount rate and increases in the lump sum interest rate assumption compared to 2021. The actuarial gain for the Pension Plan in 2021 was primarily related to increases in the discount rate compared to 2020. Weighted-average assumptions used to determine the actuarial present value of the pension and postretirement benefit obligations as of December 31 are: Rate of compensation increase Healthcare cost trend on covered charges 
 Total selling, general and administrative expenses Non-operating expenses: Interest cost Expected return on plan assets Amortization of: Net actuarial loss Settlement charge Total non-operating expenses Net periodic benefit cost

million, million, and million in non-operating expenses on our consolidated statements of income for the year ended December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively. These settlement charges represented the immediate recognition into expense of a portion of the unrecognized loss within accumulated other comprehensive loss in proportion to the share of the projected benefit obligation that was settled by the lump-sum pension benefit distributions and purchases of the nonparticipating annuity contracts. Weighted-average assumptions used to determine net periodic benefit cost for the years ended December 31 were: Pension Benefits Postretirement Benefits 2022 2021 2020 2022 2021 2020 Discount rate / / / Expected return on plan assets Rate of compensation increase Healthcare cost trend on covered charges 
 A discount rate of was used as of January 1, 2022 to determine the net periodic benefit cost for the Pension Plan, which was increased to effective September 30, 2022 for the remeasurement of the plan liability upon triggering settlement accounting. A discount rate of was used as of January 1, 2021 to determine the net periodic benefit cost for the Pension Plan, which was increased to effective September 30, 2021 for the remeasurement of the plan liability upon triggering settlement accounting. A discount rate of was used as of January 1, 2020 to determine the net periodic benefit cost for the Pension Plan, which was lowered to effective September 30, 2020 for the remeasurement of the plan liability upon triggering settlement accounting. The expected return on plan assets assumption for the Pension Plan is a long-term assumption and was determined after evaluating input from both the plan s actuary and pension fund investment advisors, consideration of macroeconomic conditions, historical rates of return on plan assets, and anticipated current and long-term rates of return on the various classes of assets in which the plan invests. For measurement of the postretirement benefits net periodic cost, a annual rate of increase in per capita cost of covered healthcare benefits was assumed for 2022. The rate was assumed to remain at in 2023 and to remain at that level thereafter. We expect to fund million for nonqualified pension benefits during 2023. Pension contributions are expected to be million in 2023; however, additional contributions may be made at our discretion. Estimated future defined benefit pension and other postretirement benefit plan payments to plan participants for the years ending December 31 are as follows: 2024 2025 2026 2027 2028-2032 
 The investment objective of our Pension Plan is to ensure that there are sufficient assets to fund regular pension benefits payable to employees over the long-term life of the plan. Our Pension Plan seeks to allocate plan assets in a manner that is closely duration-matched with the actuarial projected cash flow liabilities, consistent with prudent standards for preservation of capital, tolerance of investment risk, and maintenance of liquidity. Assets of the qualified pension plan are held by Comerica Bank (the Trustee ). Our Pension Plan utilizes a liability-driven investment LDI approach to help meet these objectives. The LDI strategy employs a structured fixed-income portfolio designed to reduce volatility in the plan s future funding requirements and funding status. This is accomplished by using a blend of long duration government, quasi-governmental and corporate fixed-income securities, as well as appropriate levels of equity and alternative investments designed to optimize the plan s liability hedge ratio.

 Actual asset allocation may occasionally fall outside of the target allocation range until rebalancing occurs. The following is a description of the valuation methodologies used for assets held by the Pension Plan measured at fair value: Equity securities - U.S. Equity securities - U.S. consist of investments in U.S. corporate stocks and U.S. equity mutual funds. U.S. equity mutual funds include publicly traded mutual funds and a bank collective fund for ERISA plans. U.S. corporate stocks and U.S. equity mutual funds are primarily large-capitalization stocks (defined as companies with market capitalization of more than 10 billion). U.S. corporate stocks and publicly traded mutual funds are valued at the closing price reported on the active public market in which the individual securities are traded and are classified as Level 1. The bank collective fund for ERISA plans is valued at the net asset value NAV of units of the fund. The NAV, as provided by the Trustee, is used as a practical expedient to estimate fair value. The NAV is based on the fair value of the underlying investments held by the fund. Equity securities International Equity securities - International consist of investments in international corporate stocks, publicly traded mutual funds, and a collective investment trust, and are primarily investments within developed and emerging markets. Investments other than the collective investment trust are valued at the closing price reported on the active public market in which the individual securities are traded and are classified as Level 1. The collective investment trust is valued at the NAV of units of the fund. The NAV, as provided by the Trustee, is used as a practical expedient to estimate fair value. The NAV is based on the fair value of the underlying investments held by the fund. Audited financial statements are produced on an annual basis for the collective investment trust. Fixed income investments Fixed income investments consist of U.S. and international corporate bonds, government and government agency bonds, derivatives, as well as a collective trust that invests in U.S. government debt securities. U.S. and international corporate bonds and government and government agency bonds are valued by independent pricing services using market-based cash flow generators and pricing spread models on both primary and secondary market transactions. As the significant inputs used are observable market inputs, these investments are classified as Level 2. Derivatives could include, but are not limited to, instruments such as U.S. Treasury futures, total returns swaps, and credit default swaps. Derivatives are valued by independent pricing services using direct and observable market inputs and are thus classified as Level 2. The collective trust is valued at the NAV of units of the fund. The NAV, as provided by the Trustee, is used as a practical expedient to estimate fair value. The NAV is based on the fair value of the underlying investments held by the fund. Hedge funds Hedge funds consist of investments in various hedge funds structured as fund-of-funds (defined as a single fund that invests in multiple funds). The hedge funds use various investment strategies in an attempt to generate non-correlated returns. A fund-of-funds

Substantially all employees hired or rehired after July 1, 2015 are eligible to receive a Company matching contribution beginning the first month after the completion of one year of service and 1,000 hours of service . During 2020, eligible employees receive Company matching contributions beginning the first month after the completion of six months of service and 500 hours of service . Effective January 1, 2021, eligible employees receive Company matching contributions beginning the first pay period after the completion of six months of service and 500 hours of service .

The matching contribution expense recognized by us was million, million, and million for the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively. Annual contributions made by us to the profit-sharing portion of the Plan are determined by the Board of Directors at its discretion, and are generally based on the profitability of the Company. Expense recognized by us under the profit-sharing portion of the Plan was million, million, and million for the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021, and 2020, respectively. million, million, and million in 2022, 2021, and 2020, respectively. For future minimum rental payments required under operating leases that have either initial or remaining noncancelable lease terms in excess of one year as of December 31, 2022, refer to Note 7, Leases . We are subject to various claims, disputes, and administrative and legal matters incidental to our past and current business activities. As a result, contingencies can arise resulting from an existing condition, situation, or set of circumstances involving an uncertainty as to the realization of a possible loss. We have in place insurance coverage for litigation defense and claim settlement costs incurred in connection with our asbestos claims. We estimate the value of probable insurance recoveries associated with our asbestos reserve based on management s interpretations and estimates surrounding the available or applicable insurance coverage. We estimate the future payments for litigation defense and claim settlement costs based on our historical liabilities and current and projected caseloads. At December 31, 2022, Graybar had million and million of insurance receivables recorded in other current assets and other non-current assets, respectively, and million and million recorded in other current liabilities and other non-current liabilities, respectively, related to our asbestos litigation defense and claims settlement reserve. Estimated loss contingencies are accrued only if the loss is probable and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated. With respect to a particular loss contingency, it may be probable that a loss has occurred but the estimate of the loss is a wide range. If we deem an amount within the range to be a better estimate than any other amount within the range, that amount will be accrued. However, if no amount within the range is a better estimate than any other amount, the minimum amount of the range is accrued. While we believe that none of these claims, disputes or administrative and legal matters will have a material adverse effect on our financial position, these matters are uncertain and we cannot at this time determine whether the financial impact, if any, of these matters will be material to our results of operations in the period in which such matters are resolved or a better estimate becomes available.

Item 9. Changes in and Disagreements With Accountants on Accounting and Financial Disclosure None. Item 9A. Controls and Procedures Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures Our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Exchange Act Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e)) are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in the reports that we file and submit under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to Company management, including our Principal Executive Officer and Principal Financial Officer, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. An evaluation of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures as of December 31, 2022 was performed under the supervision and with the participation of management. Based on that evaluation, our management, including the Principal Executive Officer and Principal Financial Officer, concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of December 31, 2022 to ensure that information required to be disclosed in the reports filed or submitted by us under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the Securities and Exchange Commission s rules and forms. Management of the Company, including its Principal Executive Officer and Principal Financial Officer, does not expect that our disclosure controls will prevent or detect all errors. A control system, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable, and not absolute, assurance that the control system s objective will be met. Because of the inherent limitations in all control systems, no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues, if any, have been detected. These inherent limitations include the realities that disclosure requirements may be misinterpreted and judgments in decision-making may be inexact. Management s Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting Management of the Company is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting, as such term is defined in Exchange Act Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f). All internal control systems, no matter how well designed, have inherent limitations. Therefore, even those systems determined to be effective can provide only reasonable assurance with respect to financial statement preparation and presentation. Management of the Company conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting based on the framework in Internal Control Integrated Framework (2013), issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission COSO issued in May 2013. Based on that evaluation, management of the Company concluded that our internal control over financial reporting was effective as of December 31, 2022. Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting There were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting that have occurred during our last fiscal quarter that have materially affected, or are likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting. Item 9B. Other Information On March 8, 2023, the Board of Directors of the Company amended its by-laws to change the mandatory retirement age for directors and officers from the social security full retirement age to age 70. Item 9C. Disclosure Regarding Foreign Jurisdictions that Prevent Inspections Not applicable.

1.2 The manner in which MIP is determined and distributed to participants is set forth in this Instruction. 

1.3 This plan shall be referred to as the Management Incentive Plan or MIP; however, since it covers Corporate, district and branch participants, it may be helpful to refer to the Corporate , district or branch incentive portion of the plan when discussing specific units or report measurements. 

2. PARTICIPATION IN THE PLAN 

2.1 Employees who are in positions that have MIP Guideline Incentives (as defined in the Company compensation structure) are eligible to participate in the plan and to receive an annual Incentive Award payment, with the following exceptions and limitations: 

2.1.1 To qualify for an Incentive Award for any calendar year, the employee must remain in the service of the Company through the last business day of December of that calendar year. If an employee terminates before the last business day of December, that employee will forfeit his/her MIP payment for that year. Payment of the employee's salary through the last day of employment with the Company fully discharges the Company's obligation with respect to compensation. Exceptions will be made in the event of death or Retirement (as defined in the amended Restated Certificate of Incorporation of the Company). 

2.1.2 An employee on an unpaid leave of absence will cease to be a participant during the leave. An employee who returns from the leave to an eligible position outlined in paragraph 2.1 above will continue participation upon their return. Applicable legal regulations and requirements will be followed. 

2.1.3 An employee who ceases to be a participant because of demotion or leaves of absence during the calendar year will have no claim to an Incentive Award, except for the period of active participation during the incentive year, or as granted in accordance with paragraph 2.1.2 above. 

2.1.4 Participants in MIP are eligible to earn an Incentive Award beginning with the first day of assignment. 

2.1.4.1 Employees who participate in MIP and whose job/position assignment changes will continue participation in their former position through the last day of assignment and begin MIP participation in the new position on the first day of reassignment. 

2.1.5 In cases of death or Retirement, MIP will be based on eligible compensation earned prior to the effective date of the applicable event. 

3. DETERMINATION OF INCENTIVE AWARDS 

3.1 Each member's Guideline Incentive will be expressed in dollars computed by multiplying the member's guideline percentage (indicated in the Company compensation structure) by the member's eligible annual base salary earnings for the incentive year. MIP employees receiving overtime will have MIP based on eligible base pay and overtime earnings. Actual incentives paid may vary from Guideline Incentive amounts based on the performance of the branch, district, or corporation. 

3.2 Incentive Awards described in Section 5 will be based on individual guideline incentives and the performance of the employee's organizational unit. For branch participants, the organizational unit will be the branch including its sub- branch( es or branch group. Branch, district and Corporate participants will be compensated under the Management Incentive Plan as outlined in the following paragraphs. 

3.3 Participants having responsibility in more than one district or branch will have their Guideline Incentive allocated to d istricts or branches based on either budgeted sales or as directed by the District Vice President or appropriate Senior Vice President. (See paragraph 5.5 .) 

3.4 Upon the recommendation of the District Vice President and approval by the Senior Vice President and General Manager and the President, certain expenses related to specific customer market expansion may be adjusted from a location's actual net profit when making incentive award calculations. 

3.4.1 Such expenses shall be submitted in writing by the District Vice President to the Senior Vice President and General Manager along with the market expansion plan for the applicable location. 

3.4.2 No expenditure to be considered for adjustment shall be made by the district until the plan has been approved by the Senior Vice President and General Manager and the President. 

3.4.3 Expenses eligible for adjustment shall be limited to the current year. Expenses associated with multi-year initiatives are reviewed and approved annually by the Senior Vice President and General Manager for the current year. 

3.4.4 The Manager Accounting Financial Analysis shall keep complete details of eligible expenses and submit them to the Controller with a copy to the Senior Vice President and General Manager as part of the year-end closing work. The Company reserves the right to reject any or all expenses submitted by the district, if it is determined by the Senior Vice President and General Manager that the district has failed to adequately implement the approved market expansion plan(s). 

3.4.5 The amount of the MIP adjustment shall be limited to the total amount approved. 

3.4.6 After review by the Controller, details outlining the adjustment shall be forwarded to the Employee Resources Center for adjustment to the applicable location's actual net profit for MIP calculation purposes. Approved adjustments may be included in branch, district and Corporate MIP calculations. 

3.5 Upon the recommendation of the District Vice President and approval by the Senior Vice President and General Manager and the President, net profits for Districts opening a new branch( es may be adjusted to exclude the net profits of the new branch house(s) if they have an adverse effect on MIP awards. 

4. FINAL PERFORMANCE INDEX FOR NET PROFIT, GROSS MARGIN, AND SALES PERFORMANCE 

4.1 For all participants, the Final Performance Index shall be calculated as determined from time to time by the Board of Directors (see G. I. 16.3 Supplement 1 ), provided that such calculations are communicated in accordance with Section 8 when applicable. 

5. DETERMINATION OF INDIVIDUAL INCENTIVE AWARDS 

5.1 Corporate 

5.1.1 Awards to Corporate participants will be based on their Guideline Incentive (eligible salary multiplied by the applicable guideline percentage) multiplied by the Corporate Final Performance Index. The Corporate Final Performance Index shall be based on the consolidated financial performance of the Company including Graybar Corporate, districts, zones and all subsidiaries as determined from time to time in accordance with guidelines adopted by the Board. 

5. 2 District 

5. 2 .1 Awards to district participants will be based on their Guideline Incentive (eligible salary multiplied by guideline percentage) multiplied by the Final Performance Index for their respective district(s). 

5. 3 Branch 

5. 3 .1 Awards to branch participants will be based on their Guideline Incentive (eligible salary multiplied by guideline percentage) multiplied by the Branch Final Performance Index for their respective branch( es ). MIP 

eligible earnings include overtime for MIP participants who receive overtime. 

5. 4 P articipants who transfer between branches or districts will be paid the greater of the actual MIP earned or the MIP that would have been earned had they remained in the old unit for the entire year. 

5. 5 In exceptional circumstances a participant may receive a guaranteed MIP for the year , upon recommendation to and pre-approval by the Senior Vice President HR . Such participant will receive the greater of their MIP guarantee or their incentive earned under the terms of the plan . In all cases, participants must meet eligibility requirements of the MIP for payment. 

5. 6 A district or branch participant who has responsibility in more than one district or branch will have his/her Guideline Incentive allocated to the district or branch on the basis of either budgeted sales or as directed by the District Vice President or Senior Vice President and General Manager . (See paragraph 3.3 .) 

5. 7 No participant will receive an award in excess of the maximum of applicable total points multiplied by his/her Guideline Incentive. 

5. 8 Awards for each year, subject to the provisions of this Plan, will be paid no later than March 15 of the following year. 

5. 9 A District Vice President and the Senior Vice President and General Manager or appropriate Senior Vice President will approve all individual awards. The President will also approve all awards and may make any adjustments deemed appropriate. 

6. PRESIDENT'S DISCRETIONARY FUNDS 

6.1 The President will have an MIP Discretionary Fund equivalent to a set percentage of the total Guideline Incentives for all participants. 

6.2 The President shall annually request of the Senior Vice President and General Manager and the Senior Vice President s recommendations for discretionary payments to any MIP participant or group of MIP participants. 

6.3 The Senior Vice President and General Manager or appropriate Senior Vice President may recommend discretionary payments to any participant or group of participants. Such awards shall not cause any individual to exceed the maximum of applicable total points multiplied by his/her Guideline Incentive. 

6.4 The Senior Vice President and General Manager may recommend that a discretionary award, subject to limitations, be awarded to a Branch to cover unusual situations or exceptional performance. 

6.5 It is not required that any or all Discretionary Funds be awarded. The total amount disbursed by the President will be reported to the Board of Directors. 

7. MODIFICATION OF THE PLAN 

7.1 The Company reserves the right to withdraw from this Plan, at any time, any line of merchandise that it sees fit for any reason. In case of the withdrawal of any line as provided for above, sales and profits will be adjusted to eliminate the line or lines of merchandise withdrawn and the adjusted sales and profits as approved by the Controller will be the sales and profits on which compensation will be based. 

7.2 The Company reserves the right to establish different incentive targets for districts and branches that budget to produce negative or marginal net profit. Such special arrangements will be recommended by the Compensation Committee for approval by the President. Affected personnel will be notified in writing of the revised plan by January 31 of the incentive year. 

7.3 The awards as computed under this Plan will be reviewed by the appropriate District Vice President, Senior Vice President and General Manager and Senior Vice Presidents, who may recommend adjustments to the President. The President is authorized to make any adjustments necessary to correct distortions in unit or individual awards. 

7.4 Notwithstanding any of the provisions of this Plan, the Company reserves the right to withdraw or to modify in whole or in part this Management Incentive Plan at any time. Notice of such modification or withdrawal would be given in writing to the employees covered by the Plan. 

8. COMMUNICATION OF THE PLAN 

8.1 District Vice Presidents will communicate this Plan to all employees who come under its provisions. As soon as the Plan has been read to or by an employee, the employee will sign a statement acknowledging that he/she fully understands the Management Incentive Plan and agrees to its provisions. Such statements will be signed on G. I. 16.3 Attachment A and will be retained in the District Vice President's files for review by Internal Auditors. 

8.2 It is important that all participants fully understand both how their incentive pay is determined and how their performance can affect the performance of the unit. Whether understanding is achieved through group or individual meetings is at the discretion of the District Vice President. 

9. TERM OF PLAN 

9.1 This Plan supersedes and replaces all Management Incentive Plans previously issued. It will remain effective for each succeeding year until terminated. The procedure outlined in Section 8 above will be followed with the issuance of this Instruction and whenever a new member comes under its provisions. 

9.2 Questions regarding interpretation or application of these instructions should be referred to the Senior Vice President-Human Resources.
