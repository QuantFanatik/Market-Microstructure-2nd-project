 EXPLANATORY NOTE 
 This report combines the annual reports on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2022 of Equity Residential and ERP Operating Limited Partnership. Unless stated otherwise or the context otherwise requires, references to EQR mean Equity Residential, a Maryland real estate investment trust REIT ), and references to ERPOP mean ERP Operating Limited Partnership, an Illinois limited partnership. References to the Company, we, us or our mean collectively EQR, ERPOP and those entities/subsidiaries owned or controlled by EQR and/or ERPOP. References to the Operating Partnership mean collectively ERPOP and those entities/subsidiaries owned or controlled by ERPOP. The following chart illustrates the Company s and the Operating Partnership s corporate structure: 

EQR is the general partner of, and as of December 31, 2022 owned an approximate 96.8 ownership interest in, ERPOP. The remaining 3.2 interest is owned by limited partners. As the sole general partner of ERPOP, EQR has exclusive control of ERPOP s day-to-day management. Management operates the Company and the Operating Partnership as one business. The management of EQR consists of the same members as the management of ERPOP. 
 The Company is structured as an umbrella partnership REIT UPREIT and EQR contributes all net proceeds from its various equity offerings to ERPOP. In return for those contributions, EQR receives a number of OP Units (see definition below) in ERPOP equal to the number of Common Shares it has issued in the equity offering. The Company may acquire properties in transactions that include the issuance of OP Units as consideration for the acquired properties. Such transactions may, in certain circumstances, enable the sellers to defer in whole or in part, the recognition of taxable income or gain that might otherwise result from the sales. This is one of the reasons why the Company is structured in the manner shown above. Based on the terms of ERPOP s partnership agreement, OP Units can be exchanged with Common Shares on a one-for-one basis because the Company maintains a one-for-one relationship between the OP Units of ERPOP issued to EQR and the outstanding Common Shares. 
 The Company believes that combining the reports on Form 10-K of EQR and ERPOP into this single report provides the following benefits: 
 enhances investors understanding of the Company and the Operating Partnership by enabling investors to view the business as a whole in the same manner as management views and operates the business; 

eliminates duplicative disclosure and provides a more streamlined and readable presentation since a substantial portion of the disclosure applies to both the Company and the Operating Partnership; and 

creates time and cost efficiencies through the preparation of one combined report instead of two separate reports.

 The Company believes it is important to understand the few differences between EQR and ERPOP in the context of how EQR and ERPOP operate as a consolidated company. All of the Company s property ownership, development and related business operations are conducted through the Operating Partnership and EQR has no material assets or liabilities other than its investment in ERPOP. EQR s primary function is acting as the general partner of ERPOP. EQR also issues equity from time to time, the net proceeds of which it is obligated to contribute to ERPOP. EQR does not have any indebtedness as all debt is incurred by the Operating Partnership. The Operating Partnership holds substantially all of the assets of the Company, including the Company s ownership interests in its joint ventures. The Operating Partnership conducts the operations of the business and is structured as a partnership with no publicly traded equity. Except for the net proceeds from equity offerings by EQR (which are contributed to the capital of ERPOP in exchange for additional partnership interests in ERPOP OP Units (on a one-for-one Common Share per OP Unit basis) or additional preference units in ERPOP (on a one-for-one preferred share per preference unit basis)), the Operating Partnership generates all remaining capital required by the Company s business. These sources include the Operating Partnership s working capital, net cash provided by operating activities, borrowings under its revolving credit facility and/or commercial paper program, the issuance of secured and unsecured debt and partnership interests, and proceeds received from disposition of certain properties and joint venture interests. 
 Shareholders equity, partners capital and noncontrolling interests are the main areas of difference between the consolidated financial statements of the Company and those of the Operating Partnership. The limited partners of the Operating Partnership are accounted for as partners capital in the Operating Partnership s financial statements and as noncontrolling interests in the Company s financial statements. The noncontrolling interests in the Operating Partnership s financial statements include the interests of unaffiliated partners in various consolidated partnerships. The noncontrolling interests in the Company s financial statements include the same noncontrolling interests at the Operating Partnership level and limited partner OP Unit holders of the Operating Partnership. The differences between shareholders equity and partners capital result from differences in the equity issued at the Company and Operating Partnership levels. 
 To help investors understand the differences between the Company and the Operating Partnership, this report provides separate consolidated financial statements for the Company and the Operating Partnership; a single set of consolidated notes to such financial statements that includes separate discussions of each entity s debt, noncontrolling interests and shareholders equity or partners capital, as applicable; and a combined Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations section that includes discrete information related to each entity. 
 This report also includes separate Part II, Item 9A, Controls and Procedures , sections and separate Exhibits 31 and 32 certifications for each of the Company and the Operating Partnership in order to establish that the requisite certifications have been made and that the Company and the Operating Partnership are compliant with Rule 13a-15 or Rule 15d-15 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the Exchange Act ), and 18 U.S.C. 1350. 
 
 In order to highlight the differences between the Company and the Operating Partnership, the separate sections in this report for the Company and the Operating Partnership specifically refer to the Company and the Operating Partnership. In the sections that combine disclosure of the Company and the Operating Partnership, this report refers to actions or holdings as being actions or holdings of the Company. Although the Operating Partnership is generally the entity that directly or indirectly enters into contracts and joint ventures and holds assets and debt, reference to the Company is appropriate because the Company is one business and the Company operates that business through the Operating Partnership. 
 
 As general partner with control of ERPOP, EQR consolidates ERPOP for financial reporting purposes, and EQR essentially has no assets or liabilities other than its investment in ERPOP. Therefore, the assets and liabilities of the Company and the Operating Partnership are the same on their respective financial statements. The separate discussions of the Company and the Operating Partnership in this report should be read in conjunction with each other to understand the results of the Company on a consolidated basis and how management operates the Company.

 Business Objectives and Operating and Investing Strategies 
 Overview 
 The Company is one of the largest U.S. publicly-traded owners and operators of high quality rental apartment properties, with an established presence in Boston, New York, Washington, D.C., Southern California (including Los Angeles, Orange County and San Diego), San Francisco and Seattle, and an expanding presence in Denver, Atlanta, Dallas/Ft. Worth and Austin. We believe our markets are knowledge centers of the U.S. economy that draw talented workers and employers that drive economic growth in the United States. We believe the locations of our properties in these markets are attractive to these knowledge workers (who often choose to rent for lifestyle reasons) that we hope to convert into satisfied long-term residents. 
 Equity Residential is committed to creating communities where people thrive. We carry this, our corporate purpose, through our relationships with our customers, our employees, our shareholders and the communities in which we operate. It drives our commitments to sustainability, diversity and inclusion, the total wellbeing of our employees and being a responsible corporate citizen in the communities in which we operate. 
 We believe we have created an industry leading operating platform and balance sheet to run our properties. Our employees are focused on delivering remarkable customer service to our residents so they will stay with us longer, be willing to pay higher rent for a great experience and will tell others about how much they love living in an Equity Residential property. We utilize technology and other innovative methods of engagement with our residents to foster relationships and community, improve the resident experience and operate our business more efficiently. We pair that with disciplined balance sheet management that enhances returns and value creation while maintaining flexibility to take advantage of future opportunities. We believe that our stakeholders value stability, liquidity, predictability and accountability and that is the mission to which we remain unwaveringly committed.

 Despite geopolitical and economic uncertainties, demand to live in our apartment communities remains robust and we believe that the long-term prospects for our business remain strong. Our business benefits from a shortage in housing across the country, especially in the areas in which we are investing. Our well-located communities provide an exceptional experience for our residents around dynamic cities that we believe will continue to attract affluent long-term renters. 
 Investment Strategy 
 The Company s long-term strategy is to invest in apartment communities located in strategically targeted markets with the goal of maximizing our risk-adjusted total returns and balancing current cash flow generation with long-term capital appreciation. We seek to meet this goal by investing in markets that are characterized by conditions favorable to multifamily property operations over the long-term. Our multi-pronged investment strategy featuring acquisitions, new stand-alone and expansion developments, densifying developments and accretive renovations of existing properties is focused on optimizing our portfolio in terms of quality and location. The markets we focus on generally feature one or more of the following characteristics that allow us to drive performance: 
 Large and diverse economic drivers . Our markets are some of the largest cities in the United States. They are markets that generally attract a variety of large and diverse industries and businesses. They include a number of submarkets that are attractive for long-term multifamily ownership. 

Strong high quality job growth. Our markets attract and create high quality jobs that are often focused in growing areas of the knowledge-based economy. These jobs result in the significant presence and growth in renters that work in the highest earning sectors of the economy, are not rent burdened and are attracted to our type of properties. This creates the ability to raise rents more readily in good economic times and reduces risk during downturns. Many of these workers are employed in the fields of Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics, or STEM jobs, as well as financial services, medical, legal and other higher-earning professions. 

Significant apartment demand that meets new apartment supply. We remain focused on owning and operating properties in markets or submarkets where the supply of apartments is balanced with strong demand that supports superior long-term returns. 

Other favorable performance drivers including high single-family housing prices that support longer term rentership and manageable resiliency/environmental risk. 

We believe our strategy capitalizes on the preference of renters of all ages to live in the locations where we operate which typically are near transportation (both public transit and convenient highway access), entertainment, employment centers/universities and cultural and outdoor amenities. Furthermore, we believe that demand for rental housing will continue to be driven primarily through household formations from the younger segments of our population, particularly Generation Z, while retaining Millennials for longer and to a lesser extent capturing the aging Baby Boomer generation. 
 Millennials are comprised of those individuals born between 1981 and 1996, total approximately 72 million people and continue to be a significant portion of the renter population. They also tend to remain renters longer due to the cost of single family home ownership and societal trends favoring delays in marriage and having children. 

Generation Z is comprised of the approximately 67 million people born between 1997 and 2012. This cohort is entering prime renter age and is expected to continue to be an important source of demand. 

Baby Boomers, a demographic of more than 71 million people born between 1946 and 1964, also trend toward apartment rentals. 

The Company continues to allocate capital in order to optimize performance by balancing current cash flow growth with long-term capital appreciation. We have done so by adding expansion markets to our portfolio when those markets meet many of the same characteristics listed above. Expansion into these markets of Denver, Atlanta, Dallas/Ft. Worth and Austin includes investments in both urban and suburban properties and is generally being funded by reducing exposure in selective established markets. Development also plays an important role in our capital allocation. Development activity is focused on our in-house pipeline, our strategic partnership with Toll Brothers, Inc. Toll and joint ventures with other third-party developers in both established and expansion markets. The Company remains committed to development as a driver of external growth but acknowledges its incremental risk, particularly in higher inflationary cost environments, when evaluating it as a method of expansion.

 Competition 
 All of the Company s properties are located in developed areas with multiple housing choices, including other multifamily properties. The number of competitive housing choices or multifamily properties in a particular area could have a material effect on the Company s ability to lease apartment units at its properties and on the rents charged. The Company may be competing with other housing providers that have greater resources than the Company and whose managers have more experience than the Company s managers. In addition, other forms of rental properties and single-family housing provide housing alternatives to potential residents of multifamily properties. See Item 1A, Risk Factors , for additional information with respect to competition. 
 Operations and Innovation 
 We attempt to balance occupancy and rental rates to maximize our revenue while exercising tight cost control to generate the highest possible return to our shareholders. We focus on the resident experience and leveraging operating efficiency which we believe drives our success in renewing our residents. This focus has driven strong occupancy and a high percentage of residents renewing while achieving strong renewal rate growth. 
 Rapidly evolving technology continues to drive innovation in the rental industry. We have been and continue to be a leader in deploying and investing in property technology to serve our customers better and operate more efficiently. Having a history as a first mover in such important areas as online leasing, we are focused on technology that drives superior margins and improves customer experience. We use a standardized purchasing system to control our operating expenses and a business intelligence platform that allows all our team members to quickly identify and address issues and opportunities. Many of these initiatives allow us to interact with our customers in a safe, responsible and convenient manner, including self-guided tours, automated responses to customer inquiries and enhanced service and maintenance management. While we believe areas such as smart home technology and others will provide the foundation for current and future improvements to how we do business, we will continue to consider the cost and longevity of technology capital investments and their benefits. 
 Our Commitment to Environmental, Social and Governance ESG 
 At Equity Residential, we believe a focus on ESG is a key way to programmatically address stakeholder concerns as part of our corporate purpose. This needs to be a continuous endeavor, in which we invest in resilient properties that will stand the test of time and remain attractive to our customers and the community without negatively impacting the environment. We have a dedicated in-house team that initiates and applies sustainable practices in all aspects of our business, including investment activities, development, property operations and property management activities. Multifamily housing is one of the most environmentally-friendly uses of real estate, as each property provides homes for hundreds of families in a denser shared environment. We consider building locations based on walkability, accessibility, neighborhoods and parks. We also design our communities to support amenities such as fitness centers and we select locations near shops, restaurants, outdoor amenities such as bike/running paths and health clubs, enabling a low carbon footprint lifestyle for our residents to live, work and play. 
 Equity Residential s sustainability program actively manages environmental impacts and climate-related risks and opportunities through optimized, financially responsible capital investments and technologies. We methodically focus on energy, water, waste and emissions to advance the program s policies, targets and resilience outcomes. Together, we believe our program drives long-term asset value, responsibly manages risks and engages our communities, residents, employees and shareholders as part of our broader ESG strategy and commitment to good corporate citizenship and maximizing investment performance. 
 To further strengthen our commitments to ESG initiatives, we issued two sustainable fixed-income instruments (each a green bond designed to support projects that contribute to environmental sustainability. In 2018, the Company became the first multifamily REIT ever to issue a green bond. In 2021, the Company issued a second green bond, and the net proceeds of approximately 494.2 million from this offering were fully allocated to the development of one property in Seattle certified as LEED Platinum, one property in Boston certified as LEED Gold and one property in Washington, D.C. certified as LEED Silver. In 2021, the Company began funding its 10.0 million investment in a new fund focused on early stage sustainability and climate change mitigation technology relevant to the built environment. 
 We are also intensely focused on the Social and Governance aspects of ESG. As detailed below, we have a commitment to our employees engagement, diversity and inclusion and wellness that is the foundation of our corporate purpose. We also recognize that a successful company must incorporate the best corporate governance practices in order to better serve its stakeholders. 
 Executive compensation includes an ESG goal and our Board of Trustees, primarily through its Compensation Committee, takes an active role in overseeing our efforts in this regard. For additional information regarding our ESG efforts, see our 2022 Environmental, Social and Governance Report at our website, www.equityapartments.com. This report, which includes Sustainability Accounting Standards Board disclosures and incorporates recommendations from the Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures, was

 Human Capital 
 At Equity Residential, our team of approximately 2,400 employees is the driving force behind our success. We believe that our richly diverse work environment captures top talent, cultivates the best ideas and creates the widest possible platform for this success in line with our corporate purpose of Creating communities where people thrive . Our core principles, affectionately named Ten Ways to Be a Winner , guide our behavior as individuals and collectively as a team, helping us in our goal to deliver market-leading performance. As part of our Ten Ways to Be a Winner, we encourage our team members to raise questions, take educated risks, offer new ideas and help us make the right decisions. One way we live the Ten Ways is by enriching our culture through our core Equity Values, which include Diversity Inclusion, Social Responsibility, Sustainability and Total Wellbeing. We have assembled a cross-functional employee-led Equity Values Council to lead our efforts on these values by acting as change agents to drive initiatives, create goals and awareness, and encourage colleagues to participate in community service activities and wellness initiatives. 
 Diversity and Inclusion 
 Our commitment to diversity and inclusion starts with a highly skilled and diverse Board of Trustees. 

We are committed to hiring a diverse workforce and also fostering a safe, inclusive and productive workplace for all employees. We believe providing a work environment based on respect, trust and collaboration creates an exceptional employee experience where employees can bring their whole selves to work and thrive in their careers. In recent years, we have created dedicated Diversity and Inclusion staffing to oversee this crucial work. 

To further prioritize the importance of our diversity and inclusion efforts, our executives annual compensation goals include an evaluation of objective metrics measuring our Company s progress in this regard. 

We have the benefit of a diverse workforce, of which 63.0 currently identify as ethnically diverse. We also continue to focus on improving our female representation, which is now 36.0 of our workforce. 

A diversity and inclusion lens is embedded in our talent review process. This includes the development of our Overcoming Bias in Performance Review Toolkit designed to provide practical bias interrupters and guidelines in the performance evaluation process that interrupt and correct unconscious bias. 

We strategically identify opportunities to increase the diversity of our talent pipeline at all levels, including by actively seeking to source a pool of diverse candidates for mid-management and above positions in the communities where we serve, such as from Project Destined, Fannie Mae s Future Housing Leaders, Howard University, Roosevelt University and Evanston Scholars. 

We employ interns from universities across the nation and local colleges to provide pathways for students of various backgrounds interested in real estate. 

The Company was named the Gold Nareit 2021 Diversity, Equity and Inclusion award recipient in recognition of the Company s demonstration of a strong commitment to the advancement of diversity and inclusion both within the Company and in the REIT and publicly traded real estate industry. 

Pay Equity 
 In order to develop, attract and retain the best employees, we are committed to providing a total compensation package which is market-based, performance driven, fair and internally equitable. 

Our goal is to be competitive both within the general employment market as well as with our competitors in the real estate industry, with our strongest performers being paid more. 

Base pay is reviewed annually, as is Equity Residential s compensation framework, by partnering with managers to create and update job descriptions that reflect the duties, skills, experience and education required to perform the role, and then benchmarking the Company s pay practices and budget as well as our jobs against third-party compensation surveys to determine the market value of the job. 

During the year-end performance evaluation process, managers review and calibrate compensation for all employees on their team, in an effort to ensure equity around our pay practices and allow us to reward and motivate our top talent.

 Employee Engagement 
 Employee engagement and experience are extremely important at Equity Residential. Our Employee Experience (EX) Survey measures employee engagement and diversity and inclusion, among other components of the employee experience. 

Our 2022 engagement score of 78 favorability is very strong, especially given changes in employee expectations in the wake of the pandemic. Our Diversity Inclusion Index score of 85 demonstrated an increase in employee favorability for the initiatives taking place and a greater sense of belonging. 

Executive leaders are assessed annually on their leadership results for diversity and inclusion, engagement and manager completion of Ethics and Positive Workplace training, which for 2022 were measured by an employee experience survey and course completion rates. 

Training and Development 
 We believe a successful workplace is one where employees constantly learn and grow. Our HR Transformation Learning Development L D team is interspersed throughout our markets and works regularly with employees to expand their knowledge and skills. L D develops and delivers a wide range of training and development opportunities, from tactical to strategic, face-to-face to virtual, social learning to self-directed learning, and more. 

Health, Safety and Wellness 
 Equity Residential is committed to providing the tools and resources to help our employees achieve total wellbeing. Thriving employees are the pinnacle of our efforts throughout all our business functions. When employees bring their whole self to work, perform their best and are well supported in their wellbeing, they can make powerful contributions to the business, culture and our communities. Whether physical, mental, financial, career, social or community wellbeing, Equity Residential offers benefits to help meet our employee needs. 

Physical Wellbeing: Equity Residential is focused on providing benefits that help our employees achieve balance and address good health proactively, with coverage for emergencies and ongoing needs that can arise as well. Long before healthcare reform, Equity Residential made a commitment to cover 100 of employee preventive care. This commitment and our robust and highly popular wellness program has made proactive personal healthcare more accessible and manageable for employees, while encouraging ongoing healthy behaviors and rewarding employees for taking a proactive approach to their health. 

Mental Wellbeing: We strive to make mental healthcare accessible. Our communications are designed to highlight awareness-building and our resources are centered around culturally competent care that scales toward employees needs. This includes educational resources for maintaining mental health, online mobile apps to address or discuss ways to improve, and partnerships with virtual care providers and support networks for those who need immediate and critical support. These resources are in addition to up to five free counseling sessions for all employees and their family members (per year per presenting matter) through our Employee Assistance Program. 

Financial Wellbeing: These benefits and resources help our employees manage their money better today, while preparing for financial milestones and retirement in the future. Financial peace of mind is at the core of these offerings, whether it s our generous 401(k) match, basic and supplemental insurance to ensure our loved ones and possessions are cared for, rent discounts at our properties or additional savings and investment options like our employee share purchase plan. 

Career Wellbeing: When employees move up in skill and experience, so does Equity Residential. We encourage our employees to Test their Limits, push the boundaries of their comfort zones and seek new challenges through several learning resources and courses, in addition to tuition reimbursement. We actively promote from within, and many senior corporate and property leaders have risen from entry level or junior positions. 

Social and Community Wellbeing: We offer a number of benefits that foster social and community wellbeing, including paid time off to volunteer in our communities. 

Equity Residential continues to partner with Employees1st to provide financial relief via a crisis fund for employees struck by personal hardships or unforeseen disasters. The Company contributes funds to further support employees who experience unforeseen or catastrophic hardship. We are proud that this program allows yet another avenue for us to tangibly demonstrate our One Team culture by ensuring that employees feel safe and supported during extreme circumstances.

 See Item 1A, Risk Factors , for information concerning the potential effects of governmental regulations, including environmental regulations, on our operations.

 Item 1A. Ri sk Factors 
 General 
 This Item 1A includes forward-looking statements. You should refer to our discussion of the qualifications and limitations on forward-looking statements included in Item 7, Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. 
 The occurrence of the events discussed in the following risk factors could adversely affect, possibly in a material manner, our business, financial condition or results of operations, which could affect the value of our common shares of beneficial interest or preferred shares of beneficial interest (which we refer to collectively as Shares ), Preference Units, OP Units, restricted units and our public unsecured debt. In this section, we refer to the Shares, Preference Units, OP Units, restricted units and public unsecured debt together as our securities and the investors who own such securities as our security holders. 
 Risks Related to our Business Strategy 
 Investing in real estate is inherently subject to risks that could negatively impact our business. 
 Investing in real estate is subject to varying degrees and types of risk. While we seek to mitigate these risks through various strategies, including geographic diversification, market research and proactive asset management, among other techniques, these risks cannot be eliminated. Factors that may impact cash flows and real estate values include, but are not limited to: 
 Local economic conditions, particularly oversupply or reductions in demand; 

National, regional and local political and regulatory climates, governmental fiscal health and governmental policies; 

The inability or unwillingness of residents to pay rent increases; 

Increases in our operating expenses due to inflationary or other pressures; 

Cost and availability of labor and materials required to maintain our properties at acceptable standards; 

Availability of attractive financing opportunities; 

Changes in social preferences; and 

Additional risks that are discussed below. 

The geographic concentration of our properties could have an adverse effect on our operations. 
 While the Company continues to diversify its portfolio with the addition of the expansion markets, the Company s properties are still predominantly concentrated in our established coastal markets (generally within certain dense urban and suburban submarkets). If one or more of these markets is unfavorably impacted by specific geopolitical and/or economic conditions, local real estate conditions, increases in social unrest, increases in real estate and other taxes, reduced quality of life, deterioration of local or state government health, rent control or stabilization laws or localized environmental and climate issues, the impact of such conditions may have a more negative impact on our results of operations than if our properties were more geographically diverse. Additionally, to the extent that these markets or submarkets become less desirable to operate in, including changes in multifamily housing supply and demand, our results of operations could be more negatively impacted than if we were more diversified within our markets or invested in a greater number of markets. 
 Competition for housing may negatively affect operations and demand for the Company s properties or residents. 
 Our properties face competition for residents from other existing or new multifamily properties, condominiums, single family homes and other living arrangements, whether owned or rental, that may attract residents from our properties or prospective residents that would otherwise choose to live with us. As a result, we may not be able to renew existing resident leases or enter into new resident leases, or if we are able to renew or enter into new leases, they may be at rates or terms that are less favorable than our current rates or terms, resulting in a material impact on our results of operations. 
 Additionally, our properties face competition for residents as a result of technological innovation. Therefore, we may not be able to retain residents or attract new residents if we are unable to identify and cost effectively implement new, relevant technologies and keep up with constantly changing resident demand for the latest innovations.

 The short-term nature of apartment leases exposes us more quickly to the effects of declining market rents, potentially making our results of operations and cash flows more volatile. 
 Generally, our residential apartment leases are for twelve months or less. If the terms of the renewal or releasing are less favorable than current terms, then the Company s results of operations and financial condition could be negatively affected. Given our generally shorter-term lease structure, our rental revenues are impacted by declines in market rents more quickly than if our leases were for longer terms. In addition, operating expenses associated with each property, such as real estate taxes, insurance, utilities, maintenance costs and employee wages and benefits, may not decline as quickly or at the same rate as revenues when circumstances might cause a reduction of those revenues at our properties. 
 Because real estate investments are illiquid, we may not be able to sell properties when appropriate. 
 Real estate investments often cannot be sold quickly due to regulatory constraints, market conditions or otherwise. As a result, we may not be able to reconfigure our portfolio, including the diversification of our portfolio into the expansion markets, as promptly as desired or as quickly in response to changing economic or other conditions. We may also be unable to consummate dispositions in a timely manner, on attractive terms, or at all. The capitalization rates/disposition yields at which properties may be sold could also be higher than historic rates, thereby reducing our potential proceeds from sale. In some cases, we may also determine that we will not recover the carrying amount of the property upon disposition, potentially causing an impairment charge. This inability to reallocate our capital promptly could negatively affect our financial condition, including our ability to make distributions to our security holders. 
 Competition for acquisitions may prevent us from acquiring properties on favorable terms. 
 We may not be successful in pursuing acquisition and development opportunities. We expect that other real estate investors will compete with us for attractive investment opportunities or may also develop properties in markets where we focus our development and acquisition efforts. We may not be in a position or have the opportunity in the future to make suitable property acquisitions on favorable terms. 
 Operations from new acquisitions, development projects and renovations may fail to perform as expected. 
 We intend to actively acquire, develop and renovate multifamily operating properties as part of our business strategy. Newly acquired, developed or renovated properties may not perform as we expect. We may overestimate the revenue (or underestimate the expenses) that these new or repositioned properties may generate. The occupancy and rental rates at these properties may also fail to meet our expectations for these investments. We may also underestimate the costs necessary to operate an acquired or developed property to the standards established for its intended market position. Land parcels acquired for development may lose significant value prior to the start of construction. Development and renovations are subject to even greater uncertainties and risks due to the complexities and lead time to build or complete these projects. We may also underestimate the costs to complete a development property or to complete a renovation. 
 Additionally, we have and may in the future acquire large portfolios of properties or companies that could increase our size and result in alterations to our capital structure. We may be unable to integrate the operations of newly acquired large portfolios or companies and realize the anticipated synergies and other benefits or do so within the anticipated time frame. 
 Construction risks on our development projects could affect our profitability. 
 We intend to continue to develop multifamily properties through both wholly owned and joint venture arrangements as part of our business strategy. Development often includes long planning and entitlement timelines, subjecting the projects to changes in market conditions. It can involve complex and costly activities, including significant environmental remediation or construction work in our markets. We may also experience an increase in costs due to general disruptions that affect the cost of labor and/or materials, such as supply chain disruptions, trade disputes, tariffs, labor unrest, geopolitical conflicts or other factors that create inflationary pressures. We may abandon opportunities that we have already begun to explore for a number of reasons, and as a result, we may fail to recover expenses already incurred in exploring those opportunities. We may also be unable to obtain, or experience delays in obtaining, necessary zoning, occupancy, or other required governmental or third-party permits and authorizations. These and other risks inherent in development projects, including the joint venture risks noted below, could result in increased costs or the delay or abandonment of opportunities.

 We are subject to risks involved in real estate activity through joint ventures. 
 We currently, and may continue to in the future, develop and acquire properties in joint ventures with unrelated third parties. Joint ventures create risks including the following: 
 The possibility that our partners might refuse or be financially unable to make capital contributions when due or may fail to meet contractual obligations to cover development cost overruns and therefore we may be forced to make contributions to protect our investments; 

These projects generally use mortgage debt (including variable rate constructions loans) to finance their activities at a higher leverage level than how we finance the Company as a whole; 

We may be responsible to our partners for indemnifiable losses; 

Our partners might at any time have business, tax planning or economic goals that are inconsistent with ours; and 

Our partners may be in a position to take action or withhold consent contrary to our recommendations, instructions or requests. 

At times we have entered into agreements providing for joint and several liability with our partners. We also have in the past and could choose in the future to guarantee part of or all of certain joint venture debt. We and our respective joint venture partners may each have the right to trigger a buy-sell arrangement that could cause us to sell our interest, or acquire our partner's interest, at a time or price that is unfavorable to us. Each joint venture agreement is individually negotiated and our ability to operate, finance or dispose of properties and interests in such joint ventures in our sole discretion may be limited to varying degrees depending on the terms of the applicable joint venture agreement. To the extent we have commitments to, on behalf of or are dependent on any such off-balance sheet commitments, or if those commitments or their properties or leases are subject to material contingencies, our liquidity and financial condition could be adversely affected. 
 In some instances, our joint venture partners may also have competing interests or objectives that could create conflicts of interest similar to those noted above. These objectives may be contrary to our compliance with the REIT requirements, and our REIT status could be jeopardized if any of our joint ventures do not operate in compliance with those requirements. To the extent our partners do not meet their obligations to us or our joint ventures, or they take actions inconsistent with the interests of the joint venture, it could have a negative effect on our results of operations and financial condition, including distributions to our security holders. 
 The Company s real estate assets may be subject to impairment charges. 
 A decline in the fair value of our assets may require us to recognize an impairment against our assets under accounting principles generally accepted in the United States GAAP if we were to determine that, with respect to any assets in unrealized loss positions, we do not have the ability and intent to hold such assets for a period of time sufficient to allow for recovery of the depreciated cost of such assets. If such a determination were to be made, we would recognize unrealized losses through earnings and write-down the depreciated cost of such assets to a new cost basis, based on the fair value of such assets on the date they are considered to be impaired. Such impairment charges reflect non-cash losses at the time of recognition; subsequent disposition or sale of such assets could further affect our future losses or gains, as they are based on the difference between the sale price received and adjusted amortized cost of such assets at the time of sale. If we are required to recognize material asset impairment charges, these charges could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations. 
 Corporate social responsibility, specifically related to ESG, may impose additional costs and expose us to new risks. 
 Environmental sustainability, social and governance evaluations remain highly important to some investors and other stakeholders. Certain organizations that provide corporate governance and other corporate risk advisory services to investors have developed scores and ratings to evaluate companies and investment funds based upon ESG metrics. Many investors focus on positive ESG-related business practices and scores when choosing to allocate their capital and may consider a company's score as a reputational or other factor in making an investment decision. Government regulators' and investors' increased focus and activism related to ESG and similar matters may constrain our business operations or increase expenses or capital expenditures. In addition, investors may decide to refrain from investing in us as a result of their assessment of our approach to and consideration of ESG factors. We may face reputational damage in the event our corporate responsibility procedures or standards do not meet the standards set by various constituencies. In addition, the criteria by which companies are rated for ESG efforts may change, which could cause us to receive lower scores than in previous years. A low ESG score could result in a negative perception of the Company, exclusion of our securities from consideration by certain investors who may elect to invest with our competition instead and/or cause investors to reallocate their capital away from the Company, all of which could have an adverse impact on the price of our securities.

 Our various technology-related initiatives to improve our operating margins and customer experience may fail to perform as expected. 
 We have developed and may continue to develop initiatives that are intended to serve our customers better and operate more efficiently, including smart home technology and self-service options that are accessible to residents through smart devices or otherwise. Such initiatives have involved and may involve our employees having new or different responsibilities and processes. We may incur significant costs and divert resources in connection with such initiatives, and these initiatives may not perform as expected, which could adversely affect our business, results of operations, cash flows and financial condition. 
 Risks Related to our Financing Strategy and Capital Structure 
 Disruptions in the financial markets could hinder our ability to obtain debt and equity financing and impact our acquisitions and dispositions. 
 Dislocations and disruptions in capital markets could result in increased costs or lack of availability of debt financing (including under our commercial paper program) and equity financing. Such events may affect our ability to refinance existing debt, require us to utilize higher cost alternatives and/or impair our ability to adjust to changing economic and business conditions. Capital market disruptions have and could continue to negatively impact our ability to make acquisitions or make it more difficult or not possible for us to sell properties or may unfavorably affect the price we receive for properties that we do sell. Such disruptions could cause the price of our securities to decline. 
 Changes in market conditions and volatility of share prices could decrease the market price of our Common Shares. 
 The stock markets, including the New York Stock Exchange on which we list our Common Shares, have experienced significant price and volume fluctuations over time, including in recent years. As a result, the market price of our Common Shares has been and could continue to be similarly volatile. Investors in our Common Shares consequently may experience a decrease in the value of their shares, including decreases due to this volatility and not necessarily related to our operating performance or prospects. Additionally, the market price of our Common Shares may decline or fluctuate significantly in response to the sale of substantial amounts of our Common Shares, or the anticipation of the sale of such shares, by large holders of our securities, as well as our inclusion or exclusion from stock indices. The issuance of additional Common Shares by the Company, or the perception that such issuances might occur, could also cause significant volatility and decreases in the value of our shares. 
 Our financial counterparties may not perform their obligations. 
 Disruptions in financial and credit markets or other events could impair the ability of our counterparties to perform under their contractual obligations to us. There are multiple financial institutions that are individually committed to provide borrowings under our revolving credit facility and to pay us amounts due under various interest rate derivative agreements. Should any of these institutions fail to perform their obligations when contractually required, our financial condition could be adversely affected. 
 Rising interest rates can increase costs and impact the value of the Company s assets. 
 The Company is exposed to market risk from financial instruments primarily from changes in market interest rates. Such risks derive from the refinancing of debt at or prior to maturity, from exposure to interest rate fluctuations on floating rate debt and from derivative instruments utilized to swap fixed rate debt to floating rates or to hedge rates in anticipation of future debt issuances. Rising interest rates increased and may continue to increase our interest expense and the costs of refinancing existing debt. Higher interest rates also increased and could continue to increase capitalization rates, which may lead to reduced valuations of the Company s assets. 
 Insufficient cash flow could affect our ability to service existing debt and create refinancing risk. 
 We are subject to risks normally associated with debt financing, including the risk that our cash flow will be insufficient to meet required payments. We may not be able to refinance existing debt and if we can, the terms of such refinancing may be less favorable than the terms of existing indebtedness. Our inability to refinance, extend or repay debt with proceeds from other capital market transactions would negatively impact our financial condition. If the debt is secured, the mortgage holder may also foreclose on the property. 
 A significant downgrade in our credit ratings could adversely affect our performance. 
 A significant downgrade in our credit ratings, while not affecting our ability to draw proceeds under the Company s revolving credit facility, would cause the corresponding borrowing costs to increase, impact our ability to borrow secured and unsecured debt, and 
 14 
 
 Table of Contents 
 
 potentially impair our ability to access the commercial paper market or otherwise limit our access to capital. In addition, a downgrade below investment grade would likely cause us to lose access to the commercial paper markets and would require us to post cash collateral and/or letters of credit in favor of some of our secured lenders to cover our self-insured property and liability insurance deductibles or to obtain lower deductible insurance compliant with the lenders requirements at the lower ratings level. 
 Financial covenants could limit operational flexibility and affect our overall financial position. 
 The terms of our credit agreements, including our revolving credit facility and the indentures under which a substantial portion of our unsecured debt was issued, require us to comply with a number of financial covenants. These covenants may limit our flexibility to run our business and breaches of these covenants could result in defaults under the instruments governing the applicable indebtedness and trigger a cross default of other debt. 
 Some of our properties are financed with tax-exempt bonds or otherwise contain restrictive covenants or deed restrictions, including affordability requirements, which limit income from certain properties. The Company monitors compliance with the restrictive covenants and deed restrictions that affect these properties. While we generally believe that the interest rate benefit from financing properties with tax-exempt bonds more than outweighs any loss of income due to restrictive covenants or deed restrictions, this may not always be the case. Some of these requirements are complex, and our failure to comply with them may subject us to material fines or liabilities. 
 We may change the dividend policy for our securities in the future. 
 The decision to declare and pay dividends on our securities, as well as the timing, amount and composition of any such future dividends, is at the discretion of the Board of Trustees and will depend on actual and projected financial conditions, the Company s actual and projected liquidity and operating results, the Company s projected cash needs for capital expenditures and other investment activities and such other factors as the Company s Board of Trustees deems relevant. The Board of Trustees may modify our dividend policy from time to time and any change in our dividend policy could negatively impact the market price of our securities. 
 Issuances or sales of our Common Shares or Units may be dilutive. 
 Any additional issuance of Common Shares (including those issued under our At-The-Market ATM program) or Units would reduce the percentage of our Common Shares and Units owned by existing investors. In most circumstances, shareholders and unitholders will not be entitled to vote on whether or not we issue additional Common Shares or Units. In addition, depending on the terms and pricing of additional offerings of our Common Shares or Units along with the value of our properties, our shareholders and unitholders could experience dilution in both the book value and fair value of their Common Shares or Units, as well as dilution in our actual and expected earnings per share, funds from operations FFO per share and Normalized FFO per share. 
 Regulatory and Tax Risks 
 The adoption of, or changes in, rent control or rent stabilization regulations and eviction restrictions could have an adverse effect on our operations and property values. 
 In part due to increasing pressure from advocacy groups, a growing number of state and local governments have enacted and may continue to consider enacting and/or expanding rent control, rent stabilization, eviction moratoriums or other similar regulations. In addition, the federal government has recently considered imposing rent regulations on multifamily properties secured by government-sponsored debt. These regulations limit or could continue to limit our ability to raise rents or charge certain fees (either of which could have a retroactive effect), enforce residents or tenants contractual rent obligations or pursue collections, all of which could have an adverse impact on our operations and property values. 
 Compliance or failure to comply with regulatory requirements could result in substantial costs. 
 Our properties are subject to various federal, state and local regulatory requirements, such as state and local fire and life safety requirements, building and zoning codes, environmental and other ESG regulations, and federal, state and local accessibility requirements, including and in addition to those imposed by the Americans with Disabilities Act and the Fair Housing Act. Noncompliance could result in fines, subject us to lawsuits and require us to remediate or repair the noncompliance. Existing requirements could change and compliance with future requirements may require significant unanticipated expenditures that could adversely affect our financial condition or results of operations.

 Environmental problems are possible and can be costly. 
 Federal, state and local laws and regulations relating to the protection of the environment may require current or previous owners or operators of real estate to investigate and clean up hazardous or toxic substances at such properties. The owner or operator may have to pay a governmental entity or third parties for property damage and for investigation and clean-up costs incurred by such parties in connection with the contamination. These laws typically impose clean-up responsibility and liability without regard to whether the owner or operator knew of or caused the presence of the contaminants. Even if more than one person may have been responsible for the contamination, each person covered by the environmental laws may be held responsible for all of the clean-up costs incurred. Third parties may also sue the owner or operator of a site for damages and costs resulting from environmental contamination emanating from that site. We cannot be assured that existing environmental assessments of our properties reveal all environmental liabilities, that any prior owner of any of our properties did not create a material environmental condition not known to us, or that a material environmental condition does not otherwise exist as to any of our properties. 
 Changes in U.S. accounting standards may materially and adversely affect the reporting of our operations. 
 The Company follows GAAP, which is established by the Financial Accounting Standards Board FASB ), an independent body whose standards are recognized by the Securities and Exchange Commission SEC as authoritative for publicly held companies. The FASB and the SEC create and interpret accounting standards and may issue new accounting pronouncements or change the interpretation and application of these standards that govern the preparation of our financial statements. These changes could have a material impact on our reported consolidated results of operations and financial position. 
 Any weaknesses identified in our internal control over financial reporting could result in a decrease of our share price. 
 Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 requires us to evaluate and report on our internal control over financial reporting. If we identify one or more material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting, we could lose investor confidence in the accuracy and completeness of our financial reports, which in turn could have a negative impact on our share price. 
 Our failure to qualify as a REIT would have serious adverse consequences to our security holders. 
 We plan to continue to meet the requirements for taxation as a REIT. Many of these requirements, for which there is limited judicial and administrative interpretation, however, are highly technical and complex. Therefore, we cannot guarantee that we have qualified or will qualify as a REIT in the future. The determination that we are a REIT requires an analysis of various factual matters that may not be totally within our control. To qualify as a REIT, our assets must be substantially comprised of real estate assets as defined in the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the Code ), and related guidance and our gross income must generally come from rental and other real estate or passive related sources that are itemized in the REIT tax laws. We are also required to distribute to security holders at least 90 of our REIT taxable income excluding net capital gains. 
 If we fail to qualify as a REIT, we would be subject to U.S. federal income tax at regular corporate rates and would have to pay significant income taxes unless the Internal Revenue Service IRS granted us relief under certain statutory provisions. In addition, we would remain disqualified from taxation as a REIT for four years following the year in which we failed to qualify as a REIT. We would therefore have less money available for investments or for distributions to security holders and would no longer be required to make distributions to security holders. This would likely have a significant negative impact on the value of our securities. 
 In addition, certain of our subsidiary entities have elected to be taxed as REITs. As such, each must separately satisfy all of the requirements to qualify for REIT status. If a subsidiary REIT did not satisfy such requirements, and certain relief provisions did not apply, it would be taxed as a regular corporation and its income would be subject to U.S. federal income taxation. Failure to comply with these complex REIT rules at the subsidiary REIT level can have a material and detrimental impact to EQR s REIT status. 
 
 Gain on disposition of assets held for sale in the ordinary course of business is subject to 100 tax. 
 Any gain resulting from transfers of properties we hold as inventory or primarily for sale to customers in the ordinary course of business is treated as income from a prohibited transaction subject to a 100 penalty tax unless certain safe harbor exceptions set forth in the Code apply. We do not believe that our transfers or disposals of property are prohibited transactions. However, whether property is held for investment purposes is a question that depends on all the facts and circumstances surrounding the particular transaction. The IRS may contend that certain transfers or dispositions of properties by us or contributions of properties are prohibited transactions. While we believe the IRS would not prevail in any such dispute, if the IRS were to argue successfully that a transfer or disposition of property constituted a prohibited transaction, we would be required to pay a 100 penalty tax on any gain allocable to us from the prohibited transaction. In addition, income from a prohibited transaction might adversely affect our ability to satisfy the income tests for qualification as a REIT. 
 16 
 
 Table of Contents 
 
 We may be subject to legislative or regulatory tax changes that could negatively impact our financial condition. 
 At any time, U.S. federal income tax laws governing REITs or impacting real estate or the administrative interpretations of those laws may be enacted or amended. We cannot predict if or when any new U.S. federal income tax law, regulation or administrative interpretation, or any amendment to any existing U.S. federal income tax law, IRS and U.S. Department of Treasury regulations or other administrative guidance, will be adopted or become effective and any such law, regulation or interpretation may take effect retroactively. The Company and our shareholders could be negatively impacted by any such change in, or any new, U.S. federal income tax law, regulations or administrative guidance. 
 Distribution requirements may limit our flexibility to manage our portfolio. 
 In order to maintain qualification as a REIT under the Code, a REIT must annually distribute to its shareholders at least 90 of its REIT taxable income, excluding the dividends paid deduction and net capital gains. To the extent the REIT does not distribute all of its net capital gain, or distributes at least 90 , but less than 100 of its REIT taxable income, it will be required to pay regular U.S. federal income tax on the undistributed amount at corporate rates. In addition, we will be subject to a 4 nondeductible excise tax on amounts, if any, by which distributions we pay in any calendar year are less than the sum of 85 of our ordinary income, 95 of our net capital gains and 100 of our undistributed income from prior years. We may not have sufficient cash or other liquid assets to meet the 90 distribution requirement. We may be required from time to time, under certain circumstances, to accrue as income for tax purposes interest and rent earned but not yet received. We may incur a reduction in tax depreciation without a reduction in capital expenditures. Difficulties in meeting the 90 distribution requirement might arise due to competing demands for our funds or due to timing differences between tax reporting and cash distributions, because deductions may be disallowed, income may be reported before cash is received, expenses may have to be paid before a deduction is allowed or because the IRS may make a determination that adjusts reported income. In addition, gain from the sale of property may exceed the amount of cash received on a leverage-neutral basis. A substantial increase to our taxable income may reduce the flexibility of the Company to manage its portfolio through dispositions of properties other than through tax deferred transactions, such as Section 1031 exchanges, or cause the Company to borrow funds or liquidate investments on unfavorable terms in order to meet these distribution requirements. If we do not dispose of our properties through tax deferred transactions, we may be required to distribute the gain proceeds to shareholders or pay income tax. If we fail to satisfy the 90 distribution requirement and are unable to cure the deficiency, we would cease to be taxed as a REIT, resulting in substantial tax-related liabilities. 
 We have a share ownership limit for REIT tax purposes. 
 To remain qualified as a REIT for U.S. federal income tax purposes, not more than 50 in value of our outstanding Shares may be owned, directly or indirectly, by five or fewer individuals at any time during the last half of any year. To facilitate maintenance of our REIT qualification, our Declaration of Trust, subject to certain exceptions, prohibits ownership by any single shareholder of more than five percent of the lesser of the number or value of any outstanding class of common or preferred shares (the Ownership Limit ). Absent an exemption or waiver granted by our Board of Trustees, securities acquired or held in violation of the Ownership Limit will be transferred to a trust for the exclusive benefit of a designated charitable beneficiary, and the security holder s rights to distributions and to vote would terminate. A transfer of Shares may automatically be deemed void if it causes a person to violate the Ownership Limit. The Ownership Limit could delay or prevent a change in control and, therefore, could affect our security holders ability to realize a premium over the then-prevailing market price for their Shares. To reduce the ability of the Board to use the Ownership Limit as an anti-takeover device, the Company s Ownership Limit requires, rather than permits, the Board to grant a waiver of the Ownership Limit if the individual seeking a waiver demonstrates that such ownership would not jeopardize the Company s status as a REIT. 
 Tax elections regarding distributions may impact future liquidity of the Company or our shareholders. 
 Under certain circumstances we have made and/or may consider making in the future, a tax election to treat certain distributions to shareholders made after the close of a taxable year as having been distributed during such closed taxable year. This election, which is provided for in the Code, may allow us to avoid increasing our dividends or paying additional income taxes in the current year. However, this could result in a constraint on our ability to decrease our dividends in future years without creating risk of either violating the REIT distribution requirements or generating additional income tax liability. In addition, the Company may be required to pay interest to the IRS based on such a distribution. 
 In order to retain liquidity and continue to satisfy the REIT distribution requirements, the Company could issue shares rather than pay a dividend entirely in cash to shareholders. The IRS has published several rulings which have allowed REITs to offer shareholders the choice between shares or cash as a form of payment of a dividend (an elective stock dividend ). However, REITs are generally required to structure the cash component to be no less than 20 of the total dividend paid. Therefore, it is possible that the total tax burden to shareholders resulting from an elective stock dividend may exceed the amount of cash received by the shareholder. 
 Inapplicability of Maryland law limiting certain changes in control. 
 Certain provisions of Maryland law applicable to REITs prohibit business combinations (including certain issuances of equity securities) with any person who beneficially owns ten percent or more of the voting power of outstanding securities, or with an affiliate 
 17 
 
 Table of Contents 
 
 who, at any time within the two-year period prior to the date in question, was the beneficial owner of ten percent or more of the voting power of the Company s outstanding voting securities (an Interested Shareholder ), or with an affiliate of an Interested Shareholder. These prohibitions last for five years after the most recent date on which the Interested Shareholder became an Interested Shareholder. After the five-year period, a business combination with an Interested Shareholder must be approved by two super-majority shareholder votes unless, among other conditions, holders of common shares receive a minimum price for their shares and the consideration is received in cash or in the same form as previously paid by the Interested Shareholder for its common shares. As permitted by Maryland law, however, the Board of Trustees of the Company has opted out of these restrictions with respect to any business combination involving Samuel Zell and certain of his affiliates and persons acting in concert with them. Consequently, the five-year prohibition and the super-majority vote requirements will not apply to a business combination involving us and/or any of them. Such business combinations may not be in the best interest of our security holders. 
 General Risk Factors 
 Risk of Pandemics or Other Health Crises. 
 Pandemics, epidemics or other health crises, including the novel coronavirus COVID-19 ), have and could in the future disrupt our business. Both global and locally targeted health events could materially affect areas where our properties, corporate/regional offices or major service providers are located. These events have and could in the future have an adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition and liquidity in a number of ways, including, but not limited to: 
 The deterioration of global economic conditions as a result of such a crisis could ultimately decrease occupancy levels and pricing across our portfolio and/or increase concessions, reduce or defer our residents spending, result in changes in resident preferences (including changes resulting from increased employer flexibility to work from home) or negatively impact our residents and tenants ability to pay their rent on time or at all; 

Local and national authorities expanding or extending certain measures that impose restrictions on our ability to enforce residents or tenants contractual rental obligations (such as eviction moratoriums or rental forgiveness) and limit our ability to raise rents or charge certain fees; 

The risk of a prolonged outbreak and/or multiple waves of an outbreak could cause long-term damage to economic conditions, which in turn could diminish our access to capital at attractive terms and/or cause material declines in the fair value of our assets, leading to asset impairment charges; and 

The potential inability to maintain adequate staffing at our properties and corporate/regional offices due to an outbreak and/or changes in employee preferences causing them to leave their jobs. 

To the extent a pandemic, epidemic or other health crisis adversely affects our business, results of operations, cash flows and financial condition, it may also continue to heighten many of the other risks described elsewhere in this Item 1A, Risk Factors . 
 Significant inflation could negatively impact our business. 
 Substantial inflationary pressures can adversely affect us by increasing the costs of land, materials, labor and other costs needed to operate our business. In a highly inflationary environment, we may not be able to raise rental rates at or above the rate of inflation, which could reduce our profit margins. If we are unable to increase our rental prices to offset the effects of inflation, our business, results of operations, cash flows and financial condition could be adversely affected. In addition, interest rate increases enacted to combat inflation have caused market disruption and could continue to prevent us from acquiring or disposing of assets on favorable terms. 
 The occurrence of cyber incidents, or a deficiency in our cybersecurity, could negatively impact our business by causing a disruption to our operations, a compromise or corruption of our confidential information, and/or damage to our reputation and business relationships, all of which could negatively impact our financial results. 
 A cyber incident is an intentional attack or an unintentional event that can include gaining unauthorized access to systems to disrupt payment collections and operations, corrupt data or steal confidential information, including information regarding our residents, prospective residents, employees and employees dependents.

 Despite system redundancy, the implementation of security measures, required employee awareness training and the existence of a disaster recovery plan for our internal information technology systems, our systems and systems maintained by third-party vendors with which we do business are vulnerable to damage from any number of sources. We face risks associated with security breaches, whether through cyber attacks or cyber intrusions over the Internet, malware, computer viruses, attachments to emails, phishing attempts, ransomware or other scams, persons inside our organization or persons/vendors with access to our systems and other significant disruptions of our information technology networks and related systems, including property infrastructure. These risks have increased due to increased reliance on remote working and other electronic interactions with our current and prospective residents. Our information technology networks and related systems are essential to the operation of our business and our ability to perform day-to-day operations. Even the most well-protected information, networks, systems and facilities remain potentially vulnerable because the techniques used in such attempted security breaches evolve and generally are not recognized until launched against a target, and in some cases are designed not to be detected and, in fact, may not be detected. Accordingly, we may be unable to anticipate these techniques or to implement adequate security barriers or other preventative measures, and thus it is impossible for us to entirely mitigate this risk. 
 We may periodically collect and store personally identifiable information of our residents and prospective residents in connection with our leasing activities, and we may collect and store personally identifiable information of our employees and their dependents. In addition, we often engage third-party service providers that may have access to such personally identifiable information in connection with providing necessary information technology, security and other business services to us. The systems of these third-party service providers may contain defects in design or other problems that could unexpectedly compromise personally identifiable information. Although we make efforts to maintain the security and integrity of our information technology networks and those of our third-party providers and we have implemented various measures to manage the risk of a security breach or disruption, there can be no assurance that our security efforts and measures will be effective or that attempted security breaches or disruptions would not be successful or damaging. 
 We address potential breaches or disclosure of this confidential personally identifiable information by implementing a variety of security measures intended to protect the confidentiality and security of this information including (among others): (a) engaging reputable, recognized firms to help us design and maintain our information technology and data security systems; (b) conducting periodic testing and verification of information and data security systems, including performing ethical hacks of our systems to discover where any vulnerabilities may exist; (c) providing periodic employee awareness training around phishing and other scams, malware and other cyber risks; (d) implementing a corrective cybersecurity awareness policy that impacts an employee s performance and compensation to articulate the potential implications of failed phishing tests; and (e) systematically deleting personally identifiable information that no longer is required. The Company also has a cyber liability insurance policy to provide some coverage for certain risks arising out of data and network breaches and data privacy regulations which provides a policy aggregate limit and a per occurrence deductible. Cyber liability insurance generally covers, among other things, costs associated with the wrongful release, through inadvertent breach or network attack, of personally identifiable information. However, there can be no assurance that these measures will prevent a cyber incident or that our cyber liability insurance coverage will be sufficient to cover our losses in the event of a cyber incident. 
 A breach or significant and extended disruption in the function of our systems, including our primary website, could damage our reputation and cause us to lose residents and revenues, result in a violation of applicable privacy and other laws, generate third-party claims, result in the unintended and/or unauthorized public disclosure or the misappropriation of proprietary, personally identifiable and confidential information and require us to incur significant expenses to address and remediate or otherwise resolve these kinds of issues. We may not be able to recover these expenses in whole or in any part from our service providers, our insurers or any other responsible parties. As a result, there can be no assurance that our financial results would not be negatively impacted. 
 We are also subject to laws, rules, and regulations in the United States, such as the California Consumer Privacy Act CCPA ), relating to the collection, use, and security of resident, customer, employee and other data. Evolving compliance and operational requirements under the CCPA and the privacy laws of other jurisdictions in which we operate may impose significant costs that are likely to increase over time. Our failure to comply with laws, rules, and regulations related to privacy and data protection could harm our business or reputation or subject us to fines and penalties. 
 Our business and operations rely on specialized information technology systems, the failure of or inadequacy of which could impact our business. 
 Our ability to identify, implement and maintain appropriate information technology systems differentiates and creates competitive advantages for us in the operations of our business. These systems often are developed and hosted by third-party vendors whom we rely upon for ongoing maintenance, upgrades and enhancements. While we maintain a rigorous process around selecting appropriate information technology systems and partnering with vendors, our failure to adequately do so could negatively impact our operations and competitive position.

 We depend on our key personnel. 
 We depend on the efforts of our trustees and executive officers. If one or more of them resign or otherwise cease to be employed by us, our business and results of operations and financial condition could be adversely affected. 
 Litigation risk could affect our business. 
 We are involved and may continue to be involved in legal proceedings, claims, class actions, inquiries and investigations in the ordinary course of business. These legal proceedings may include, but are not limited to, proceedings related to consumer, shareholder, securities, antitrust, employment, environmental, development, condominium conversion, tort, eviction and commercial legal issues. Litigation can be lengthy and expensive, and it can divert management's attention and resources. Results cannot be predicted with certainty, and an unfavorable outcome in litigation could result in liability material to our financial condition or results of operations. 
 Insurance policies can be costly and may not cover all losses, which may adversely affect our financial condition or results of operations. 
 The Company s property, general liability and workers compensation insurance policies provide coverage with substantial per occurrence deductibles and/or self-insured retentions. These self-insurance retentions can be a material portion of insurance losses in excess of the base deductibles. While the Company has previously purchased incremental insurance coverage in the event of multiple non-catastrophic occurrences within the same policy year, these substantial deductible and self-insured retention amounts do expose the Company to greater potential for uninsured losses and this additional multiple occurrences coverage may not be available at all or on commercially reasonable terms in the future. We believe the policy specifications and insured limits of these policies are adequate and appropriate; however, there are certain types of extraordinary losses which may not be adequately covered under our insurance program. As a result, our financial results could be adversely affected and may vary significantly from period to period. 
 The Company relies on third-party insurance providers for its property, general liability, workers compensation and other insurance, and should any of them experience liquidity issues or other financial distress, it could negatively impact their ability to pay claims under the Company s policies. 
 Earthquake risk: Our policies insuring against earthquake losses have substantial deductibles which are applied to the values of the buildings involved in the loss. With the geographic concentration of our properties, a single earthquake affecting a market may have a significant negative effect on our financial condition and results of operations. We cannot assure that an earthquake would not cause damage or losses greater than insured levels. In the event of a loss in excess of insured limits, we could lose our capital invested in the affected property or market, as well as anticipated future revenue. 
 Terrorism risk: The Company has terrorism insurance coverage which excludes losses from nuclear, biological and chemical attacks. In the event of a terrorist attack impacting one or more of our properties, we could lose the revenues from the property, our capital investment in the property and possibly face liability claims from residents or others suffering injuries or losses. 
 Catastrophic weather and natural disaster risk: Our properties may be located in areas that could experience catastrophic weather and other natural disasters from time to time, including wildfires, snow or ice storms, hail, windstorms or hurricanes, drought, flooding or other severe disasters. These severe weather and natural disasters could cause substantial damages or losses to our properties which may not be covered or could exceed our insurance coverage. Exposure to this risk could also result in a decrease in demand for properties located in these areas or affected by these conditions. 
 Climate change risk: To the extent that significant changes in the climate occur in areas where our properties are located, we may experience severe weather, which may result in physical damage to or decrease the demand for properties located in these areas or affected by these conditions. Should the impact of climate change be material in nature, significant property damage or destruction of our properties could result. In addition, climate change could cause a significant increase in insurance premiums and deductibles or a decrease in the availability of coverage, either of which could expose the Company to even greater uninsured losses. Our financial condition or results of operations may be adversely affected. In addition, changes in federal, state and local legislation and regulation based on concerns about climate change could adversely impact the value of our properties or result in increased capital expenditures or operating expenses on our existing properties and our new development properties. 
 Provisions of our Declaration of Trust and Bylaws could inhibit changes in control. 
 Certain provisions of our Declaration of Trust and Bylaws may delay or prevent a change in control of the Company or other transactions that could provide the security holders with a premium over the then-prevailing market price of their securities or which might otherwise be in the best interest of our security holders. This includes the Ownership Limit described above. While our existing preferred shares/preference units do not have all of these provisions, any future series of preferred shares/preference units may have certain voting provisions that could delay or prevent a change in control or other transactions that might otherwise be in the interest of 
 20

 our security holders. Our Bylaws require certain information to be provided by any security holder, or persons acting in concert with such security holder, who proposes business or a nominee at an annual meeting of shareholders, including disclosure of information related to hedging activities and investment strategies with respect to our securities. These requirements could delay or prevent a change in control or other transactions that might otherwise be in the interest of our security holders. The Board of Trustees may use its powers to issue preferred shares and to set the terms of such securities to delay or prevent a change in control of the Company even if a change in control were in the interest of the security holders.

 The Company s Common Shares trade on the New York Stock Exchange under the trading symbol EQR. There is no established public market for the Operating Partnership s Units (OP Units and restricted units). At February 10, 2023, the number of record holders of Common Shares was approximately 1,790 and 378,602,684 Common Shares were outstanding. At February 10, 2023, the number of record holders of Units in the Operating Partnership was approximately 465 and 391,169,119 Units were outstanding.

 During the quarter ended December 31, 2022, EQR issued 414,871 Common Shares in exchange for 414,871 OP Units held by various limited partners of ERPOP. OP Units are generally exchangeable into Common Shares on a one-for-one basis or, at the option of ERPOP, the cash equivalent thereof, at any time one year after the date of issuance. These shares were either registered under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the Securities Act ), or issued in reliance on an exemption from registration under Section 4(a)(2) of the Securities Act and the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder, as these were transactions by an issuer not involving a public offering.

(1) Corporate overhead includes property management and general and administrative expenses. 

The Company s primary financial measure for evaluating each of its apartment communities is net operating income NOI ). NOI represents rental income less direct property operating expenses (including real estate taxes and insurance). The Company believes that NOI is helpful to investors as a supplemental measure of its operating performance because it is a direct measure of the actual operating results of the Company s apartment properties.

Note: See Note 17 in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for detail by reportable segment/market. Non-same store/other NOI results consist primarily of properties acquired in calendar years 2021 and 2022, operations from the Company s development properties and operations prior to disposition from 2021 and 2022 sold properties. 
 The increase in same store rental income is primarily driven by strong Physical Occupancy and continued growth in pricing. 

The increase in same store operating expenses is due primarily to: 

Utilities A 13.9 million increase from gas and electric, primarily driven by higher commodity prices; and 

Repairs and maintenance A 9.8 million increase primarily driven by volume and timing of maintenance and repairs along with increases in minimum wage on contracted services. 

The increase in non-same store/other NOI is due primarily to a positive impact of higher NOI from properties acquired during 2021 and 2022 of 54.5 million and higher NOI from development properties in lease-up of 20.6 million, partially offset by a negative impact of lost NOI from 2021 and 2022 dispositions of 52.2 million and a negative impact of 1.2 million in lower NOI from one former master-leased property and two properties that have been removed from same store while undergoing major renovations. 

The increase in consolidated total NOI is primarily a result of the Company s higher NOI from same store properties, largely due to improvement in same store revenues as noted above. Operating expense growth remains modest due to a combination of continued success in managing controllable expenses, favorable growth in real estate tax expense (increased by only 3.2 million) and declines in payroll expense (decreased by 3.1 million) primarily due to the Company's various innovation and centralization initiatives, leading to 14.1 same store NOI growth for the year ended December 31, 2022 as compared to the prior year period. 

See the Same Store Results section below for additional discussion of those results.

 Table of Contents 
 
 Property management expenses include off-site expenses associated with the self-management of the Company s properties as well as management fees paid to any third-party management companies. These expenses increased approximately 12.1 million or 12.4 during the year ended December 31, 2022 as compared to 2021. This increase is primarily attributable to increases in payroll-related costs, training/conference costs, temporary help/contractors costs and third-party management fees. 
 General and administrative expenses, which include corporate operating expenses, increased approximately 2.2 million or 3.9 during the year ended December 31, 2022 as compared to 2021, primarily due to increases in payroll-related costs, legal and professional fees and training/conference costs. 
 Depreciation expense, which includes depreciation on non-real estate assets, increased approximately 43.9 million or 5.2 during the year ended December 31, 2022 as compared to 2021, primarily as a result of additional depreciation expense on properties acquired in 2021 and 2022 and development properties placed in service during 2021, partially offset by lower depreciation from properties sold in 2021 and 2022. 
 Net gain on sales of real estate properties decreased approximately 767.9 million or 71.6 during the year ended December 31, 2022 as compared to 2021, primarily as a result of a lower sales volume with the sale of three consolidated apartment properties in 2022 as compared to the sale of fourteen consolidated apartment properties in the same period in 2021. 
 Impairment decreased approximately 16.8 million during the year ended December 31, 2022 as compared to 2021, due to an impairment charge in 2021 on one land parcel held for development compared to no impairment charges taken during 2022. 
 Interest and other income decreased approximately 23.5 million or 91.5 during the year ended December 31, 2022 as compared to 2021. The decrease is primarily due to a gain of 23.6 million on the sale of various investment securities that occurred during 2021 but not during 2022. 
 Other expenses decreased approximately 5.6 million or 29.1 during the year ended December 31, 2022 as compared to 2021, primarily due to a decline in construction defect and litigation reserves and pursuit costs recorded between 2022 and 2021, partially offset by increases in advocacy contributions, demolition/abatement costs and data transformation project costs. 
 Interest expense, including amortization of deferred financing costs, increased approximately 10.4 million or 3.7 during the year ended December 31, 2022 as compared to 2021. The increase is primarily due to higher overall interest rates and lower capitalized interest. The effective interest cost on all indebtedness, excluding debt extinguishment costs/prepayment penalties, for the year ended December 31, 2022 was 3.68 as compared to 3.52 in 2021. The Company capitalized interest of approximately 7.1 million and 15.9 million during the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. 
 Net (income) loss attributable to Noncontrolling Interests in partially owned properties decreased approximately 14.2 million or 79.0 during the year ended December 31, 2022 as compared to 2021, primarily as a result of noncontrolling interest allocations related to the sale of one partially owned apartment property in 2021 as compared to no sales in 2022. 
 For comparison of the year ended December 31, 2021 to the year ended December 31, 2020, refer to Item 7, Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations , included in the Company s and the Operating Partnership s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2021. 
 Same Store Results 
 Properties that the Company owned and were stabilized for all of both 2022 and 2021 (the 2022 Same Store Properties ), which represented 72,872 apartment units, drove the Company s results of operations. Properties are considered stabilized when they have achieved 90 occupancy for three consecutive months. Properties are included in same store when they are stabilized for all of the current and comparable periods presented.

Note: The above table reflects Residential same store results only. Residential operations account for approximately 96.3 of total revenues for the year ended December 31, 2022. 
 Despite geopolitical and economic uncertainties, demand to live in our apartment communities remained healthy, which our financial results reflected, as we continued to capture the gap between in-place rent levels and market rent levels. Demand for our apartments continues to support strong Physical Occupancy with pricing that is largely in-line with expectations, including modest use of Leasing Concessions. Key operating drivers for this performance during 2022 include: 
 Pricing Pricing (net of Leasing Concessions) in 2022 was strong, driven by continued improvement across the portfolio, especially in New York. After unprecedented growth earlier in the year, pricing began to moderate in late August 2022, which is typical, but slightly more pronounced than we had expected. Regardless, pricing remained positive during the fourth quarter of 2022 which is stronger than historical trends. 

Physical Occupancy Physical Occupancy of 96.4 for the year ended December 31, 2022 remained strong, contributing to growth in Same Store Residential Revenues.

 Percentage of Residents Renewing and Turnover We continue to see a high Percentage of Residents Renewing in our portfolio, which we believe reflects both the strength of demand and quality of our product. The Percentage of Residents Renewing has been strong at 56.5 for the fourth quarter of 2022. Turnover has been the lowest in the Company s history at 42.8 for the full year of 2022, reflecting a healthy and consistent trend of historically high resident retention. 

In addition to these stronger fundamentals, bad debt, net moderated during the first half of 2022 with improvement in resident collections primarily driven by receipt of governmental rental assistance payments on behalf of our residents. Bad debt, net increased in the second half of 2022 primarily due to the governmental rental assistance programs winding down. 
 Transaction activity has slowed as buyers and sellers adjust their expectations to a volatile economic climate and rising interest rates. While this type of environment can be challenging, the Company has traditionally found investment opportunities during periods of market dislocation as our ability to move quickly and our relatively low cost of capital creates flexibility that can provide us a competitive advantage. 
 Overall, the fundamentals of our business remain strong. Long-term, we expect elevated single family home ownership costs, positive household formation trends and the overall deficit in housing across the country to buffer the impact on our business from the risks of potential economic weakness. We also see our affluent resident base as being more resilient to rising inflation due to higher levels of disposable income and lower relative rent-to-income ratios. 
 Liquidity and Capital Resources 
 
 With approximately 2.4 billion in readily available liquidity, a strong balance sheet, limited near-term maturities, very strong credit metrics and ample access to capital markets, the Company believes it is well positioned to meet its future obligations and opportunities. See further discussion below.

The following provides information regarding the Company s cash flows from operating, investing and financing activities for the year ended December 31, 2022. 
 Operating Activities 
 Our operating cash flows are primarily impacted by NOI and its components, such as Average Rental Rates, Physical Occupancy levels and operating expenses related to our properties. Cash provided by operating activities for the year ended December 31, 2022 as compared to 2021, increased by approximately 194.6 million as a direct result of the NOI and other changes discussed above in Results of Operations . 
 Investing Activities 
 Our investing cash flows are primarily impacted by our transaction activity (acquisitions/dispositions), development spend and capital expenditures. For 2022, key drivers were: 
 Acquired one consolidated rental property for approximately 113.0 million in cash; 

Disposed of three consolidated rental properties, receiving net proceeds of approximately 720.3 million; 

Invested 109.3 million primarily in development projects;

The renovations are expected to continue through at least the end of 2023 at both properties. 

Financing Activities 
 Our financing cash flows primarily relate to our borrowing activity (debt proceeds or repayment), distributions/dividends to shareholders and other Common Share activity. For 2022, key drivers were: 
 Obtained 48.1 million in variable rate construction mortgage debt that is non-recourse to the Company; 

Repaid 289.9 million of mortgage loans (inclusive of scheduled principal repayments); 

Repaid 500.0 million of unsecured notes by using disposition proceeds; 

Settled all 1.7 million Common Shares under the ATM forward sale agreements for cash proceeds of 139.6 million; 

Acquired our joint venture partner s 25 interest in an apartment property for 32.2 million; 

Issued Common Shares related to share option exercises and ESPP purchases and received net proceeds of 29.2 million; and 

Paid dividends/distributions on Common Shares, Preferred Shares, Units (including OP Units and restricted units) and noncontrolling interests in partially owned properties totaling approximately 982.8 million. 

Short-Term Liquidity and Cash Proceeds 
 The Company generally expects to meet its short-term liquidity requirements, including capital expenditures related to maintaining its existing properties and scheduled unsecured note and mortgage note repayments, through its working capital, net cash provided by operating activities and borrowings under the Company s revolving credit facility and commercial paper program. Currently, the Company considers its cash provided by operating activities to be adequate to meet operating requirements and payments of distributions.

Credit Facility and Commercial Paper Program 
 The Company has a 2.5 billion unsecured revolving credit facility maturing October 26, 2027. The Company has the ability to increase available borrowings by an additional 750.0 million by adding lenders to the facility, obtaining the agreement of existing lenders to increase their commitments or incurring one or more term loans. The interest rate on advances under the facility will generally be the Secured Overnight Financing Rate SOFR plus a spread (currently 0.725 ), or based on bids received from the lending group, and the Company pays an annual facility fee (currently 0.125 ). Both the spread and the facility fee are dependent on the Company s senior unsecured credit rating. The Revolving Credit Agreement also contains a sustainability-linked pricing component which provides for interest rate margin reductions upon achieving certain sustainability ratings. See Note 9 in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional discussion of the Company s credit facility. 
 The Company may borrow up to a maximum of 1.0 billion under its commercial paper program subject to market conditions. The notes will be sold under customary terms in the United States commercial paper note market and will rank pari passu with all of the Company s other unsecured senior indebtedness. 
 The Company limits its utilization of the revolving credit facility in order to maintain liquidity to support its 1.0 billion commercial paper program along with certain other obligations. The following table presents the availability on the Company s unsecured revolving credit facility as of February 10, 2023 (amounts in thousands):

Dividend Policy 
 The Company declared a dividend/distribution for each quarter in 2022 of 0.625 per share/unit, an annualized increase of 3.7 over the amount paid in 2021. All future dividends/distributions remain subject to the discretion of the Company s Board of Trustees. 
 Total dividends/distributions paid in January 2023 amounted to 244.6 million (excluding distributions on Partially Owned Properties), which consisted of certain distributions declared during the quarter ended December 31, 2022. 
 Long-Term Financing and Capital Needs 
 The Company expects to meet its long-term liquidity requirements, such as lump sum unsecured note and mortgage debt maturities, property acquisitions and financing of development activities, through the issuance of secured and unsecured debt and equity securities (including additional OP Units), proceeds received from the disposition of certain properties and joint ventures, along with cash generated from operations after all distributions. The Company has a significant number of unencumbered properties available to secure additional mortgage borrowings should unsecured capital be unavailable or the cost of alternative sources of capital be too high. The value of and cash flow from these unencumbered properties are in excess of the requirements the Company must maintain in order to comply with covenants under its unsecured notes and line of credit. Of the 28.1 billion in investment in real estate on the Company s balance sheet at December 31, 2022, 24.5 billion or 87.1 was unencumbered. However, there can be no assurances that these sources of capital will be available to the Company in the future on acceptable terms or otherwise. For additional details, see Item 1A, Risk Factors . 
 EQR issues equity and guarantees certain debt of the Operating Partnership from time to time. EQR does not have any indebtedness as all debt is incurred by the Operating Partnership.

Financial Flexibility 
 EQR and ERPOP currently have an active universal shelf registration statement for the issuance of equity and debt securities that automatically became effective upon filing with the SEC in May 2022 and expires in May 2025. Per the terms of ERPOP s partnership agreement, EQR contributes the net proceeds of all equity offerings to the capital of ERPOP in exchange for additional OP Units (on a one-for-one Common Share per OP Unit basis) or preference units (on a one-for-one preferred share per preference unit basis). 
 The Company has an ATM share offering program which allows EQR to issue Common Shares from time to time into the existing trading market at current market prices or through negotiated transactions, including under forward sale arrangements. In May 2022, the Company replaced the prior program with a new program which extended the maturity to May 2025 and gives us the authority to issue up to 13.0 million shares, all of which remain available for issuance as of December 31, 2022. 
 Forward sale agreements under the ATM program allow the Company, at its election, to settle the agreements by issuing Common Shares in exchange for net proceeds at the then-applicable forward sale price specified by the agreement or, alternatively, to settle the 
 35 
 
 Table of Contents 
 
 agreements in whole or in part through the delivery or receipt of Common Shares or cash. Issuances of shares under these forward sale agreements are classified as equity transactions. Accordingly, no amounts relating to the forward sale agreements are recorded in the consolidated financial statements until settlement occurs. Prior to any settlements, the only impact to the consolidated financial statements is the inclusion of incremental shares, if any, within the calculation of diluted net income per share using the treasury stock method (see Note 11 in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional discussion). The actual forward price per share to be received by the Company upon settlement will be determined on the applicable settlement date based on adjustments made to the initial forward price to reflect the then-current overnight federal funds rate and the amount of dividends paid to holders of the Company s Common Shares over the term of the forward sale agreement. 
 During the quarter ended September 30, 2021, the Company entered into forward sale agreements under the prior program for a total of approximately 1.7 million Common Shares at a weighted average initial forward price per share of 83.25. During the quarter ended December 31, 2022, the Company settled all of the outstanding forward sale agreements, at a weighted average forward price per share of 80.22, which is inclusive of adjustments made to reflect the then-current federal funds rate and the amount of dividends paid to holders of the Company's Common Shares, for net proceeds of approximately 139.6 million. Concurrent with this transaction, ERPOP issued the same amount of OP Units to EQR in exchange for the net proceeds. 
 The Company may repurchase up to 13.0 million Common Shares under its share repurchase program. No open market repurchases have occurred since 2008. As of February 10, 2023, EQR has remaining authorization to repurchase up to 13.0 million of its shares. 
 We believe our ability to access capital markets is enhanced by ERPOP s long-term senior debt ratings and short-term commercial paper ratings, as well as EQR s long-term preferred equity ratings. As of February 10, 2023, the ratings are as follows: 

Standard Poor s 
 
 Moody's

 Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates 
 The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States requires management to use judgment in the application of accounting policies, including making estimates and assumptions. If our judgment or interpretation of the facts and circumstances relating to various transactions had been different or different assumptions were made, it is possible that different accounting policies would have been applied, resulting in different financial results or different presentation of our financial statements. 
 The Company s significant accounting policies are described in Note 2 in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. These policies were followed in preparing the consolidated financial statements at and for the year ended December 31, 2022. 
 The Company has identified the significant accounting policies below as critical accounting policies. These critical accounting policies are those that have the most impact on the reporting of our financial condition and those requiring significant judgments and estimates. With respect to these critical accounting policies, management believes that the application of judgments and estimates is consistently applied and produces financial information that fairly presents the results of operations for all periods presented. 
 Impairment of Long-Lived Assets 
 The Company evaluates its long-lived assets, including its investment in real estate, for indicators of impairment at least quarterly. The judgments regarding the existence of impairment indicators are based on factors such as operational performance, market conditions, legal, regulatory and environmental concerns, the Company s intent and ability to hold the related asset, as well as any significant cost overruns on development properties. Future events could occur which would cause the Company to conclude that impairment indicators exist and an impairment loss is warranted. Assessing impairment can be complex and involves a high degree of subjectivity in determining if indicators are present and in estimating the future undiscounted cash flows or the fair value of an asset. In particular, these estimates are sensitive to significant assumptions, including the estimation of future rental revenues, operating expenses, discount and capitalization rates and our intent and ability to hold the related asset, all of which could be affected by our expectations about future market or economic conditions. Assumptions are primarily subject to property-specific characteristics, especially with respect to our intent and ability to hold the related asset. While these property-specific assumptions can have a significant impact on the undiscounted cash flows or estimated fair value of a particular asset, our evaluation of the reported carrying values of long-lived assets during the current year were not particularly sensitive to external or market assumptions. 
 Acquisition of Investment Properties 
 The Company allocates the purchase price of properties that meet the definition of an asset acquisition to net tangible and identified intangible assets acquired based on their relative fair values using assumptions primarily based upon property-specific characteristics. In making estimates of relative fair values for purposes of allocating purchase price, the Company utilizes a number of sources, including independent appraisals that may be obtained in connection with the acquisition or financing of the respective property, our own analysis of recently acquired or developed and existing comparable properties in our portfolio and other market data. The Company also considers information obtained about each property as a result of its pre-acquisition due diligence, marketing and leasing activities in estimating the relative fair value of the tangible and intangible assets/liabilities acquired.

(1) The National Association of Real Estate Investment Trusts Nareit defines funds from operations FFO (December 2018 White Paper) as net income (computed in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States GAAP )), excluding gains or losses from sales and impairment write-downs of depreciable real estate and land when connected to the main business of a REIT, impairment write-downs of investments in entities when the impairment is directly attributable to decreases in the value of depreciable real estate held by the entity and depreciation and amortization related to real estate. Adjustments for partially owned consolidated and unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures are calculated to reflect funds from operations on the same basis. 

(2) Normalized funds from operations Normalized FFO begins with FFO and excludes: 

the impact of any expenses relating to non-operating real estate asset impairment; 

pursuit cost write-offs; 

gains and losses from early debt extinguishment and preferred share redemptions; 

gains and losses from non-operating assets; and 

other miscellaneous items.

 (3) The Company believes that FFO and FFO available to Common Shares and Units / Units are helpful to investors as supplemental measures of the operating performance of a real estate company, because they are recognized measures of performance by the real estate industry and by excluding gains or losses from sales and impairment write-downs of depreciable real estate and excluding depreciation related to real estate (which can vary among owners of identical assets in similar condition based on historical cost accounting and useful life estimates), FFO and FFO available to Common Shares and Units / Units can help compare the operating performance of a company s real estate between periods or as compared to different companies. The Company also believes that Normalized FFO and Normalized FFO available to Common Shares and Units / Units are helpful to investors as supplemental measures of the operating performance of a real estate company because they allow investors to compare the Company s operating performance to its performance in prior reporting periods and to the operating performance of other real estate companies without the effect of items that by their nature are not comparable from period to period and tend to obscure the Company s actual operating results. FFO, FFO available to Common Shares and Units / Units, Normalized FFO and Normalized FFO available to Common Shares and Units / Units do not represent net income, net income available to Common Shares / Units or net cash flows from operating activities in accordance with GAAP. Therefore, FFO, FFO available to Common Shares and Units / Units, Normalized FFO and Normalized FFO available to Common Shares and Units / Units should not be exclusively considered as alternatives to net income, net income available to Common Shares / Units or net cash flows from operating activities as determined by GAAP or as a measure of liquidity. The Company s calculation of FFO, FFO available to Common Shares and Units / Units, Normalized FFO and Normalized FFO available to Common Shares and Units / Units may differ from other real estate companies due to, among other items, variations in cost capitalization policies for capital expenditures and, accordingly, may not be comparable to such other real estate companies. 

(4) FFO available to Common Shares and Units / Units and Normalized FFO available to Common Shares and Units / Units are calculated on a basis consistent with net income available to Common Shares / Units and reflects adjustments to net income for preferred distributions and premiums on redemption of preferred shares/preference units in accordance with GAAP. The equity positions of various individuals and entities that contributed their properties to the Operating Partnership in exchange for OP Units are collectively referred to as the Noncontrolling Interests Operating Partnership . Subject to certain restrictions, the Noncontrolling Interests Operating Partnership may exchange their OP Units for Common Shares on a one-for-one basis. 

Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualita tive Disclosures about Market Risk 
 The Company is exposed to market risk from financial instruments primarily from changes in interest rates. Such risks derive from the refinancing of debt maturities, from exposure to interest rate fluctuations on floating rate debt and from derivative instruments utilized to swap fixed rate debt to floating or to hedge rates in anticipation of future debt issuances. Our operating results are, therefore, affected by changes in short-term interest rates, primarily SOFR, London Interbank Offered Rate LIBOR and Securities Industry and Financial Markets Association SIFMA indices, which directly impact borrowings under our revolving credit facility and/or interest on secured and unsecured borrowings contractually tied to such rates. Short-term interest rates also indirectly affect the discount on notes issued under our commercial paper program. Additionally, we have exposure to long-term interest rates, particularly U.S. Treasuries, as they are utilized to price our long-term borrowings and therefore affect the cost of refinancing existing debt or incurring additional debt. 
 The Alternative Reference Rates Committee (the ARRC has identified SOFR as the preferred alternative rate for USD LIBOR. As part of the transition process that is now under way, LIBOR is no longer published for certain tenors and key USD settings are expected to be discontinued by June 2023. SOFR is now the primary basis for determining interest payments on borrowings on the Company s 2.5 billion revolving credit facility. We are closely monitoring the evolution of practices in the credit markets and we do not expect such transition to have a material impact on the Company s financial position or cash flows. 
 The Company monitors and manages interest rates as part of its risk management process, by targeting adequate levels of floating rate exposure and an appropriate debt maturity profile. From time to time, we may utilize derivative instruments to manage interest rate exposure and to comply with the requirements of certain lenders, but not for trading or speculative purposes. 
 The Company had total variable rate debt of 0.5 billion, representing 6.4 of total debt, and 0.6 billion, representing 7.3 of total debt, as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. If interest rates had been 100 basis points higher in 2022 and 2021 and average balances coincided with year end balances, our annual interest expense would have been 4.7 million and 6.1 million higher, respectively. Unsecured notes issued under the Company s commercial paper program are treated as variable rate debt for the purposes of this calculation even though they do not have a stated interest rate, given their short-term nature. The effect of derivatives, if applicable, is also considered when computing the total amount of variable rate debt. 
 Changes in interest rates also affect the estimated fair market value of our fixed rate debt, computed using a discounted cash flow model. As of December 31, 2022, the Company had total outstanding fixed rate debt of 7.0 billion, or 93.6 of total debt, with an estimated fair market value of 6.2 billion. If interest rates had been 100 basis points lower as of December 31, 2022, the estimated fair market value would have increased by approximately 397.5 million. As of December 31, 2021, the Company had total outstanding fixed rate debt of 7.7 billion, or 92.7 of total debt, with an estimated fair market value of 8.4 billion. If interest rates had been 100 basis points lower as of December 31, 2021, the estimated fair market value would have increased by approximately 637.2 million. 
 40 
 
 Table of Contents 
 
 As of December 31, 2022, the Company s derivative instruments had a net asset fair value of approximately 20.7 million. If interest rates increased by 35 basis points across the curve relative to market quotes as of December 31, 2022 (a 10 upward parallel shift ), the net asset fair value of the Company s derivative instruments would be approximately 39.4 million. If interest rates decreased by 35 basis points (a 10 downward parallel shift ), the net asset fair value of the Company s derivative instruments would be approximately 1.5 million. 
 These amounts were determined by considering the impact of hypothetical interest rates on the Company s financial instruments. These analyses do not consider the effects of the changes in overall economic activity that could exist in such an environment. Further, in the event of changes of such magnitude, management would likely take actions to further mitigate its exposure to these changes. However, due to the uncertainty of the specific actions that would be taken and their possible effects, this analysis assumes no changes in the Company s financial structure or results. 
 The Company cannot predict the effect of adverse changes in interest rates on its debt and derivative instruments and, therefore, its exposure to market risk, nor can there be any assurance that long-term debt will be available at advantageous pricing. Consequently, future results may differ materially from the estimated adverse changes discussed above.

 REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGIS TERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM 

To the Shareholders and the Board of Trustees of Equity Residential 
 
 Opinion on the Financial Statements 
 
 We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Equity Residential (the Company) as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, the related consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive income, changes in equity and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2022, and the related notes and financial statement schedule listed in the Index at Item 15(a) (collectively referred to as the consolidated financial statements ). In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company at December 31, 2022 and 2021, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2022, in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. 
 
 We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the Company's internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2022, based on criteria established in Internal Control Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (2013 framework) and our report dated February 16, 2023 expressed an unqualified opinion thereon. 
 
 Basis for Opinion 
 
 These financial statements are the responsibility of the Company's management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company s financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. 
 
 We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. Our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion. 
 
 Critical Audit Matter 
 
 The critical audit matter communicated below is a matter arising from the current period audit of the financial statements that was communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that: (1) relates to accounts or disclosures that are material to the financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective or complex judgments. The communication of the critical audit matter does not alter in any way our opinion on the consolidated financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matter below, providing a separate opinion on the critical audit matter or on the accounts or disclosures to which it relates. 

Impairment of Long-Lived Assets 

Description of the Matter 
 At December 31, 2022, the Company s net investment in real estate was approximately 19.1 billion. As more fully described in Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company periodically evaluates its long-lived assets, including its investment in real estate, for impairment. The judgments and assumptions regarding the existence of impairment indicators are based on factors such as operational performance, market conditions, legal and environmental concerns, the Company s intent and ability to hold the related asset, as well as any significant cost overruns on development properties. If the expected future undiscounted cash flows are less than the carrying amount of the long-lived asset, an impairment loss is recognized for the difference between the estimated fair value and the carrying amount. Auditing the Company's process to evaluate indicators of impairment was complex due to a high degree of subjectivity in the identification of events or changes in circumstances that may indicate impairment was present. Changes in these judgments could have a material impact on the Company s analysis.

 Table of Contents 

How We Addressed the Matter in Our Audit 
 We obtained an understanding, evaluated the design and tested the operating effectiveness of controls over the Company s long-lived asset impairment evaluation, including controls over management s determination and review of the significant assumptions used in the analyses described above. We performed audit procedures that included, among others, evaluating the judgments used by management to identify whether indicators of impairment were present and testing the significant assumptions and completeness and accuracy of market and operating data used by the Company in its analyses. We reviewed costs incurred on development properties. We compared the significant assumptions used by management to current market data and performed sensitivity analyses of certain significant assumptions, such as market capitalization rates. We also held discussions with management and read the minutes of meetings of the Board of Trustees and related committees to understand whether there were any changes in management s operating and development plans that would result in the disposal of a property significantly before the end of its useful life.

 We have audited Equity Residential s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2022, based on criteria established in Internal Control Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (2013 framework) (the COSO criteria). In our opinion, Equity Residential (the Company) maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2022, based on the COSO criteria. 
 
 We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the consolidated balance sheets of the Company as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, the related consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive income, changes in equity and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2022, and the related notes and financial statement schedule listed in the Index at Item 15(a) and our report dated February 16, 2023 expressed an unqualified opinion thereon. 
 
 Basis for Opinion 
 
 The Company s management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting, and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting included in the accompanying Management's Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company s internal control over financial reporting based on our audit. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. 
 
 We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. 
 
 Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk, and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion. 
 
 Definition and Limitations of Internal Control Over Financial Reporting 
 
 A company s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and trustees of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements. 
 
 Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

 NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 
 ownership interest in, ERPOP. All of the Company s property ownership, development and related business operations are conducted through the Operating Partnership and EQR has no material assets or liabilities other than its investment in ERPOP. EQR issues equity from time to time, the net proceeds of which it is obligated to contribute to ERPOP, but does not have any indebtedness as all debt is incurred by the Operating Partnership. The Operating Partnership holds substantially all of the assets of the Company, including the Company s ownership interests in its joint ventures. The Operating Partnership conducts the operations of the business and is structured as a partnership with no publicly traded equity. As of December 31, 2022, the Company, directly or indirectly through investments in title holding entities, owned all or a portion of properties located in states and the District of Columbia consisting of apartment units. 

Partially Owned Properties Consolidated 

. 

 Lease Intangibles The Company considers the value of acquired in-place leases and above/below market leases and the amortization period is the average remaining term of each respective acquired lease. 

 Other Intangible Assets The Company considers whether it has acquired other intangible assets, including any customer relationship intangibles and the amortization period is the estimated useful life of the acquired intangible asset. 

 Building Based on the allocation of the relative fair value determined on an as-if vacant basis. Depreciation is calculated on the straight-line method over an estimated useful life of . 

 Long-Term Debt The Company calculates the allocation of the relative fair value by discounting the remaining contractual cash flows on each instrument at the current market rate for those borrowings. 

 Replacements inside an apartment unit such as appliances and carpeting are depreciated over an estimated useful life of five to . Expenditures for ordinary maintenance and repairs are expensed to operations as incurred and significant renovations and building improvements that improve and/or extend the useful life of the asset are capitalized over their estimated useful life, generally five to . Initial direct leasing costs are expensed as incurred as such expense approximates the deferral and amortization of initial direct leasing costs over the lease terms. The Company classifies real estate assets as real estate held for sale when it is probable a property will be disposed of. The Company classifies properties under development and/or expansion and properties in the lease-up phase (including land) as construction-in-progress until construction has been completed and certificates of occupancy permits have been obtained. 

the Company uses its professional judgment in determining whether such costs meet the criteria for capitalization or must be expensed as incurred. The Company capitalizes interest, real estate taxes and insurance, as well as payroll for those individuals directly responsible for and who spend their time on the execution and supervision of development activities. Additionally, the Company capitalizes payroll for those individuals directly responsible for and who spend their time on the execution and supervision of major capital and/or renovation projects. Capitalization ends when the asset, or a portion of the asset, is substantially completed and ready for its intended use. These costs are reflected on the balance sheets as increases to depreciable property and/or construction-in-progress. During the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, the Company capitalized mil lion and million, respectively, of payroll and associated costs of employees directly responsible for and who spend their time on the execution and supervision of development activities as well as major capital and/or renovation projects. 

lease terms with market-based renewal options and consist of ground floor retail spaces and master-leased parking garages that serve as additional amenities for our residents. The majority of the Company s revenue is derived from residential, non-residential and other lease income. Our revenue streams have the same timing and pattern of revenue recognition across our reportable segments, with consistent allocations between the lease and revenue recognition standards. The Company elected an accounting policy to account for both its lease and non-lease components (specifically common area maintenance charges) as a single lease component under the lease standard. The Company is a lessor for its residential and non-residential leases and is a lessee for its corporate headquarters and regional offices and ground leases for land underlying current operating properties or projects under development. If applicable, lease agreements must be evaluated to determine the accounting treatment as a finance or operating lease in accordance with the lease standard. The lease standard also requires lessees to recognize on the balance sheet: (a) a liability for the lease obligation (initially measured at the present value of the future lease payments not yet paid over the lease term); and (b) an asset for its right to use the underlying asset (initially equal to the lease liability). The Company uses estimates and judgments on the discount rate used to calculate the present value of the future lease payments. The Company uses its incremental borrowing rate as the discount rate because the Company typically cannot readily determine the rate implicit in the lease. Since the Company s credit backs the corporate office lease obligations and the lease terms are generally or less, the discount rate range was estimated by using the Company s borrowing rates for actual pricing data. The discount rate range for ground leases takes into account various factors, including the longer life of the ground leases, and was estimated by using the Company s borrowing rates for actual pricing data through years and other long-term market rates. The Company s revenue streams that are not accounted for under the lease standard include: Parking revenue The Company s parking revenue, not related to leasing, is derived primarily from monthly and transient daily parking and is accounted for at the point in time when control of the goods or services transfers to the customer and our performance obligation is satisfied. 

 Other rental and non-rental related revenue The Company receives other income, including, but not limited to: (a) ancillary income, such as laundry, renters insurance and cable income; (b) net settlement income; and (c) miscellaneous fee income. 

 Fee and asset management revenue and interest income The Company s fee and asset management revenue and interest income are recorded on an accrual basis. 

 Gains or losses on sales of real estate properties The Company accounts for the sale of real estate properties and any related gain recognition in accordance with the accounting guidance applicable to sales of real estate, which establishes standards for recognition of profit on all real estate sales transactions. The Company recognizes the sale and associated gain or loss from the disposition when control transfers to unrelated third parties, contingencies have been removed and sufficient cash consideration has been received by the Company. 

 See Note 8 for the Company s rental income detail allocated between the lease and revenue recognition standards. The Company s allowance for doubtful accounts (which offsets accounts receivable and is included within other assets on the consolidated balance sheets) and bad debts (which reduce rental income on the consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive income) have historically been very modest, particularly in our residential business, given the quality of our resident base and asset class. However, due to the impact of the novel coronavirus COVID-19 pandemic and extended eviction moratoriums enacted during the pandemic, the allowance for doubtful accounts and bad debts became elevated during 2020 and remained elevated in 2021 and 2022. In accordance with the lease standard, if we determine the lease payments are not probable of collection (based on known troubled accounts, rent deferral plans granted, historical experience and other currently available evidence), we fully reserve for any unpaid amounts, deferred rent receivable, variable lease payments and straight-line receivable balances and recognize rental income only if cash is received. If the Company s estimates of collectibility differ from the cash received, then the timing and amount of the Company s reported revenue could be impacted. See Note 8 for additional details. 
 par value per share (the Common Shares ), issued pursuant to EQR s incentive equity compensation and employee share purchase plans will result in ERPOP issuing units of partnership interest OP Units to EQR on a one-for-one basis, with ERPOP receiving the net cash proceeds of such issuances. See Note 12 for further discussion. 
 provision for federal income taxes at the EQR level. In addition, ERPOP generally is not liable for federal income taxes as the partners should recognize their allocable share of income or loss in their tax returns; therefore no provision for federal income taxes has been made at the ERPOP level. Historically, the Company has generally only incurred certain state and local income, excise and franchise taxes. The Company has elected taxable REIT subsidiary status for certain of its corporate subsidiaries and, as a result, these entities will incur both federal and state income taxes on any taxable income of such entities after consideration of any net operating losses. The Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act (the CARES Act included tax provisions which increased allowable interest expense deductions for 2020 (no increases for 2021 and 2022) and increased the ability for taxpayers to use net operating losses. These provisions did not result in a material impact to the Company s taxable income or tax liabilities. The CARES Act also allowed corporations to request accelerated refunds of their alternative minimum tax AMT credit. Prior to enactment of this provision, the remaining credits would have been refunded in installments in 2020, 2021 and 2022. We received a refund of our remaining million in AMT credits during the year ended December 31, 2020.

The Company issued Internal Revenue Service IRS Form 1099-DIV to shareholders to report the tax character of Company distributions consistent with these amounts. The Company provides additional information to assist shareholders in the preparation of their tax returns. For 2022, the Company reported an AMT preference adjustment equal to per share a nd disclosed amounts defined under Treasury Regulation 1.1061-6(c) as One Year Amounts Disclosure and Three Year Amounts Disclosure equal to per share and per share, resp ectively. 

In March 2020, the FASB issued an amendment to the reference rate reform standard which provides the option for a limited period of time to ease the potential burden in accounting for, or recognizing the effects of, reference rate reform on contract modifications and hedge accounting. The new standard was effective for the Company upon issuance and elections could be made through December 31, 2024. The Company elected to apply the hedge accounting expedients and application of these expedients preserves the presentation of derivatives consistent with past presentation. The Company continues to evaluate the impact of the guidance and may apply other elections as applicable as additional changes in the market occur. In April 2020, a FASB staff question and answer document was issued which intended to reduce the challenges of evaluating the enforceable rights and obligations of leases for concessions granted to lessees in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. We elected not to evaluate whether qualifying concessions provided by the Company in response to the COVID-19 pandemic are a lease modification, subject to the criteria that the total payments under the amended lease cannot result in a substantial increase in the rights of the lessor or obligations of the lessee. We also elected to treat the concessions as though they were contemplated as part of the existing contracts and therefore will not apply lease modification rules to the qualifying lease concession amendments. As such, deferrals deemed collectible are recorded as rental receivables with no change to timing of rental revenues and deferrals deemed non-collectible and abatements reduce rental revenues in the deferral/abatement period and cause rental revenues to effectively follow a cash basis related to the changes. The accounting elections provided by the FASB mainly apply to the Company s non-residential leases and the majority of the amendments will not require a straight-line adjustment. See Note 8 for additional discussion. In June 2016, the FASB issued a standard which requires companies to adopt a new approach for estimating credit losses on certain types of financial instruments, such as trade and other receivables and loans. The standard requires entities to estimate a lifetime expected credit loss for most financial instruments, including trade receivables. In November 2018, the FASB issued an amendment excluding operating lease receivables accounted for under the lease standard from the scope of the credit losses standard. The Company adopted this standard as required effective January 1, 2020, and it did not have a material effect on its consolidated results of operations and financial position. 
 properties consisting of ap artment units having a noncontrolling interest deficit balance of million at December 31, 2022 . The Company is required to make certain disclosures regarding noncontrolling interests in consolidated limited-life subsidiaries. Of the consolidated entities described above, the Company is the controlling partner in limited-life partnerships owning properties having a noncontrolling interest deficit balance of million. These two partnership agreements contain provisions that require the partnerships to be liquidated through the sale of their assets upon reaching a date specified in each respective partnership agreement. The Company, as controlling partner, has an obligation to cause the property owning partnerships to distribute the proceeds of liquidation to the Noncontrolling Interests in these Partially Owned Properties only to the extent that the net proceeds received by the partnerships from the sale of their assets warrant a distribution based on the partnership agreements. As of December 31, 2022, the Company estimates the value of Noncontrolling Interest distributions for these two properties would have been approximately million Settlement Value had the partnerships been liquidated. This Settlement Value is based on estimated third-party consideration realized by the partnerships upon disposition of the two Partially Owned Properties and is net of all other assets and liabilities, including yield maintenance on the mortgages encumbering the properties, that would have been due on December 31, 2022 had those mortgages been prepaid. Due to, among other things, the inherent uncertainty in the sale of real estate assets, the amount of any potential distribution to the Noncontrolling Interests in the Company s Partially Owned Properties is subject to change. To the extent that the partnerships underlying assets are worth less than the underlying liabilities, the Company has no obligation to remit any consideration to the Noncontrolling Interests in these Partially Owned Properties.

Limited Partner Units Ownership Interest in Operating Partnership 

The equity positions of various individuals and entities that contributed their properties to the Operating Partnership in exchange for OP Units, as well as the equity positions of the holders of restricted units, are collectively referred to as the Noncontrolling Interests Operating Partnership and Limited Partners Capital, respectively, for the Company and the Operating Partnership. Subject to certain exceptions (including the book-up requirements of restricted units), the Noncontrolling Interests Operating Partnership/Limited Partners Capital may exchange their Units with EQR for Common Shares on a one-for-one basis. The carrying value of the Noncontrolling Interests Operating Partnership/Limited Partners Capital (including redeemable interests) is allocated based on the number of Noncontrolling Interests Operating Partnership/Limited Partners Capital in total in proportion to the number of Noncontrolling Interests Operating Partnership/Limited Partners Capital in total plus the total number of Common Shares/General Partner Units. Net income is allocated to the Noncontrolling Interests Operating Partnership/Limited Partners Capital based on the weighted average ownership percentage during the period. The Operating Partnership has the right but not the obligation to make a cash payment instead of issuing Common Shares to any and all holders of Noncontrolling Interests Operating Partnership/Limited Partners Capital requesting an exchange of their Noncontrolling Interests Operating Partnership/Limited Partners Capital with EQR. Once the Operating Partnership elects not to redeem the Noncontrolling Interests Operating Partnership/Limited Partners Capital for cash, EQR is obligated to deliver Common Shares to the exchanging holder of the Noncontrolling Interests Operating Partnership/Limited Partners Capital. The Noncontrolling Interests Operating Partnership/Limited Partners Capital are classified as either mezzanine equity or permanent equity. If EQR is required, either by contract or securities law, to deliver registered Common Shares, such Noncontrolling Interests Operating Partnership/Limited Partners Capital are differentiated and referred to as Redeemable Noncontrolling Interests Operating Partnership and Redeemable Limited Partners, respectively. Instruments that require settlement in registered shares cannot be classified in permanent equity as it is not always completely within an issuer s control to deliver registered shares. Therefore, settlement in cash is assumed and that responsibility for settlement in cash is deemed to fall to the Operating Partnership as the primary source of cash for EQR, resulting in presentation in the mezzanine section of the balance sheet. The Redeemable Noncontrolling Interests Operating Partnership/Redeemable Limited Partners are adjusted to the greater of carrying value or fair market value based on the Common Share price of EQR at the end of each respective reporting period. EQR has the ability to deliver unregistered Common Shares for the remaining portion of the Noncontrolling Interests Operating Partnership/Limited Partners Capital that are classified in permanent equity at December 31, 2022 and 2021. The carrying value of the Redeemable Noncontrolling Interests Operating Partnership/Redeemable Limited Partners is allocated based on the number of Redeemable Noncontrolling Interests Operating Partnership/Redeemable Limited Partners in proportion to the number of Noncontrolling Interests Operating Partnership/Limited Partners Capital in total. Such percentage of the total carrying value of Units/Limited Partner Units which is ascribed to the Redeemable Noncontrolling Interests Operating Partnership/Redeemable Limited Partners is then adjusted to the greater of carrying value or fair market value as described above. As of December 31, 2022 and 2021, the Redeemable Noncontrolling Interests Operating Partnership/Redeemable Limited Partners have a redemption value of approximately million and million, respectively, which represents the value of Common Shares that would be issued in exchange for the Redeemable Noncontrolling Interests Operating Partnership/Redeemable Limited Partners.

Net proceeds from EQR Common Share and Preferred Share (see definition below) offerings and proceeds from exercise of options for Common Shares are contributed by EQR to ERPOP. In return for those contributions, EQR receives a number of OP Units in ERPOP equal to the number of Common Shares it has issued in the equity offering (or in the case of a preferred equity offering, a number of preference units in ERPOP equal in number and having the same terms as the Preferred Shares issued in the equity offering). As a result, the net proceeds from Common Shares and Preferred Shares are allocated for the Company between shareholders equity and Noncontrolling Interests Operating Partnership and for the Operating Partnership between General Partner s Capital and Limited Partners Capital to account for the change in their respective percentage ownership of the underlying equity. The Company s declaration of trust authorizes it to issue up to preferred shares of beneficial interest, par value per share (the Preferred Shares ), with specific rights, preferences and other attributes as the Board of Trustees may determine, which may include preferences, powers and rights that are senior to the rights of holders of the Company s Common Shares. par value; shares authorized:

(1) On or after the call date, redeemable Preferred Shares/Preference Units may be redeemed for cash at the option of the Company or the Operating Partnership, respectively, in whole or in part, at a redemption price equal to the liquidation price per share/unit, plus accrued and unpaid distributions, if any. 

 (2) Dividends on Preferred Shares/Preference Units are payable quarterly. 

Other EQR and ERPOP currently have an active universal shelf registration statement for the issuance of equity and debt securities that automatically became effective upon filing with the SEC in May 2022 and expires in May 2025. Per the terms of ERPOP s partnership agreement, EQR contributes the net proceeds of all equity offerings to the capital of ERPOP in exchange for additional OP Units (on a one-for-one Common Share per OP Unit basis) or preference units (on a one-for-one preferred share per preference unit basis). The Company has an At-The-Market ATM share offering program which allows EQR to issue Common Shares from time to time into the existing trading market at current market prices or through negotiated transactions, including under forward sale arrangements. In May 2022, the Company replaced the prior program with a new program which extended the maturity to May 2025 and gives us the authority to issue up to million shares, all of which remain available for issuance as of December 31, 2022. Forward sale agreements under the ATM program allow the Company, at its election, to settle the agreements by issuing Common Shares in exchange for net proceeds at the then-applicable forward sale price specified by the agreement or, alternatively, to settle the agreements in whole or in part through the delivery or receipt of Common Shares or cash. Issuances of shares under these forward sale agreements are classified as equity transactions. Accordingly, amounts relating to the forward sale agreements are recorded in the consolidated financial statements until settlement occurs. Prior to any settlements, the only impact to the consolidated financial statements is the inclusion of incremental shares, if any, within the calculation of diluted net income per share using the treasury stock method (see Note 11 for additional discussion). The actual forward price per share to be received by the Company upon settlement will be determined on the applicable settlement date based on adjustments made to the initial forward price to reflect the then-current overnight federal funds rate and the amount of dividends paid to holders of the Company s Common Shares over the term of the forward sale agreement. During the quarter ended September 30, 2021, the Company entered into forward sale agreements under the prior program for a total of approximately million Common Shares at a weighted average initial forward price per share of . During the quarter ended December 31, 2022, the Company settled all of the outstanding forward sale agreements, at a weighted average forward price per share of , which is inclusive of adjustments made to reflect the then-current federal funds rate and the amount of dividends paid to holders of the Company's Common Shares, for net proceeds of approximately million. Concurrent with this transaction, ERPOP issued the same amount of OP Units to EQR in exchange for the net proceeds. The Company may repurchase up to million Common Shares under its share repurchase program. open market repurchases have occurred since 2008. As of December 31, 2022 , EQR has remaining authorization to repurchase up to million of its shares.

The Company s unsecured public notes contain certain financial and operating covenants including, among other things, maintenance of certain financial ratios. The Company was in compliance with its unsecured public debt covenants for both the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021. EQR and ERPOP currently have an active universal shelf registration statement for the issuance of equity and debt securities that automatically became effective upon filing with the SEC in and expires in . Line of Credit and Commercial Paper On October 26, 2022, the Company replaced its existing billion facility with a new billion unsecured revolving credit facility maturing on . The Company has the ability to increase available borrowings by an additional million by adding lenders to the facility, obtaining the agreement of existing lenders to increase their commitments or incurring one or more term loans. The interest rate on advances under the facility will generally be the Secured Overnight Financing Rate SOFR plus a spread (currently ), or based on bids received from the lending group, and the Company pays an annual facility fee (currently ). Both the spread and the facility fee are dependent on the Company s senior unsecured credit rating. The Company did t borrow any amounts under its revolving credit facility during the year ended December 31, 2022 and the weighted average interest rate was for the year ended December 31, 2021. The Company has an unsecured commercial paper note program under which it may borrow up to a maximum of billion subject to market conditions. The notes will be sold under customary terms in the United States commercial paper note market and will rank pari passu with all of the Company s other unsecured senior indebtedness.

million, which is included in interest and other income in the consolidated statements of operations. The Company did t own any of these investment securities at December 31, 2021. A three-level valuation hierarchy exists for disclosure of fair value measurements. The valuation hierarchy is based upon the transparency of inputs to the valuation of an asset or liability as of the measurement date. A financial instrument s categorization within the valuation hierarchy is based upon the lowest level of input that is significant to the fair value measurement. The three levels are defined as follows: Level 1 Inputs to the valuation methodology are quoted prices (unadjusted) for identical assets or liabilities in active markets. 

 Level 2 Inputs to the valuation methodology include quoted prices for similar assets and liabilities in active markets, and inputs that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly or indirectly, for substantially the full term of the financial instrument. 

 Level 3 Inputs to the valuation methodology are unobservable and significant to the fair value measurement. 

 The Company s derivative positions are valued using models developed by the respective counterparty as well as models applied internally by the Company that use as their inputs readily observable market parameters (such as forward yield curves and credit default swap data). 

Fair Value Measurement Type

Overview of Share Incentive Plans The 2019 Share Incentive Plan (the 2019 Plan ), as approved by the Company s shareholders on June 27, 2019, expires on June 27, 2029 and reserves Common Shares for issuance. All future awards will be granted under the 2019 Plan. As of December 31, 2022, shares were available for future issuance. Pursuant to the 2019 Plan and the 2011 Share Incentive Plan (the 2011 Plan (collectively the Share Incentive Plans ), officers, trustees, key employees and consultants of the Company and its subsidiaries may be granted share options to acquire Common Shares Options ), including non-qualified share options NQSOs ), incentive share options ISOs and share appreciation rights SARs ), or may be granted restricted or non-restricted shares/units (including long-term incentive plan awards), subject to conditions and restrictions. Options, SARs, restricted shares and restricted units are sometimes collectively referred to herein as Awards. The 2011 Plan will terminate when all outstanding Awards have expired or have been exercised/vested. The Board of Trustees may at any time amend or terminate the Share Incentive Plans, but termination will not affect Awards previously granted, absent immediate vesting and cash settlement. Any Options which had vested prior to such a termination would remain exercisable by the holder. Employee Long-Term Compensation Awards

 (2) A restricted unit will automatically convert to an OP Unit when the capital account of each restricted unit increases books-up to a specified target. The probability of a book-up occurring within the ten-year contractual life along with the liquidity risk associated with various hold period restrictions are both reflected in the discount. If the capital target is not attained within ten years following the date of issuance, the restricted unit will automatically be canceled and no compensation will be payable to the holder of such canceled restricted unit. If the capital target is attained and the restricted unit is converted to an OP Unit, it will not expire.

 (5) Exercise price per share The closing share price of the Common Shares on the grant date. 

The valuation method and assumptions are the same as those the Company used in accounting for Option expense in its consolidated financial statements. The Black-Scholes option valuation model was developed for use in estimating the fair value of traded options that have no vesting restrictions and are fully transferable. This model is only one method of valuing options. Because the Company s Options have characteristics significantly different from those of traded options, and because changes in the subjective input assumptions can materially affect the fair value estimate, the actual value of the Options to the recipient may be significantly different. Long-Term Incentive Plan The Company s executive compensation program allows the Chairman, Chief Executive Officer and certain other executive officers to earn from to of the target number of long-term incentive LTI awards, payable in the form of restricted shares and/or restricted units. No payout would be made for any result below of the target performance metric. The Company s Total Shareholder Return TSR ), Normalized Funds from Operations FFO and Net Debt to Normalized EBITDAre (Earnings Before Interest, Taxes, Depreciation and Amortization for Real Estate) results over a forward-looking three-year performance period determine the restricted shares and/or restricted units awarded and are compared to pre-established quantitative performance metrics. The grant date fair value of the awards is estimated using a Monte Carlo model for the TSR portion of the awards, and the resulting expense is recorded over the service period regardless of whether the TSR performance measures are achieved, while the Normalized FFO and Net Debt to Normalized EBITDAre portions of the awards are adjusted based on the final achievement obtained. If the executive is retirement-eligible, the grant date fair value is amortized into expense over the first year. All other awards are amortized into expense over the three-year performance and vesting period. If employment is terminated prior to vesting, the restricted shares and restricted units are generally canceled. The LTI participants receive distributions only on restricted units awarded equal to of the quarterly distributions paid on OP Units during the performance period. At the end of the performance period, LTI participants receive dividends/distributions actually earned on restricted shares or restricted units awarded during the performance period, less any distributions already paid on the restricted units. The grant date fair value of the TSR portion of the LTI awards is estimated using a multifactor Monte Carlo model to determine share prices for a set of relative awards for which the payout of the award depends on the spread of EQR s TSR to the TSR of two indices: (a) the FTSE Nareit Apartment Index; and (b) the FTSE Nareit Equity Index. The absolute Company TSR metric previously included in the TSR portion of the LTI awards for which the payout of the award only depended on EQR s TSR was replaced with a Net Debt to Normalized EBITDAre metric for the 2022 LTI plan, covering the three-year performance period from January 1, 2022 through December 31, 2024. The grant date fair value of the Normalized FFO and Net Debt to Normalized EBITDAre portions of the LTI awards are estimated using the closing price of EQR Common Shares on the grant date for the restricted shares and a discounted closing price of EQR Common Shares on the grant date for the restricted units to reflect the book-up and liquidity risk inherent in the units. 

Weighted average fair value per restricted unit 

The valuation method and assumptions are the same as those the Company used in accounting for the LTI award expense in its consolidated financial statements. The Monte Carlo valuation model is only one method of valuing awards. Because the Company s restricted shares/units have characteristics significantly different from those of traded shares/units, and because changes in the subjective input assumptions can materially affect the fair value estimate, the actual value of the restricted shares/units to the recipient may be significantly different. Trustees All non-employee Trustees, with the exception of the Company s Chairman, are granted Options, restricted shares and/or restricted units that vest one year from the grant date that corresponds to the term for which he or she has been elected to serve. Since 2016, the Chairman has only received awards under the LTI plan (see further discussion above). Retirement Benefits The Company s Share Incentive Plans provide for certain benefits upon retirement.

The Company established a defined contribution plan (the 401(k) Plan to provide retirement benefits for employees that meet minimum employment criteria.

The Company recognized an expense in the amount of million, million and million for the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively. The Company established the SERP to provide certain officers and trustees an opportunity to defer a portion of their eligible compensation in order to save for retirement. The SERP is restricted to investments in Common Shares, certain marketable securities that have been specifically approved and cash equivalents. The deferred compensation liability represented in the SERP and the securities issued to fund such deferred compensation liability are consolidated by the Company and carried on the Company s balance sheets, and the Company s Common Shares held in the SERP are accounted for as a reduction to paid in capital (included in general partner s capital in the Operating Partnership s financial statements). 

 Common Shares pursuant to a Distribution Reinvestment Plan (the 2014 DRIP ), which included the remaining shares available for issuance under a previous registration. The registration was automatically declared effective the same day and will expire when all shares have been issued. The Company has Common Shares available for issuance under the 2014 DRIP at December 31, 2022. The 2014 DRIP provides holders of record and beneficial owners of Common Shares and Preferred Shares with a simple and convenient method of reinvesting cash dividends/distributions in additional Common Shares. Common Shares purchased under the 2014 DRIP may, at the option of EQR, be directly issued by EQR or purchased by EQR s transfer agent in the open market using participants funds. The net proceeds from any Common Share issuances are contributed to ERPOP in exchange for OP Units.

We have entered into, and may continue in the future to enter into, joint venture agreements with third-party partners for the development of multifamily rental properties. The joint venture agreements with each development partner include buy-sell provisions that provide the right, but not the obligation, for the Company to acquire each respective partner s interests or sell its interests at any time following the occurrence of certain pre-defined events described in the joint venture agreements.

The Company intends to invest of the equity for each selected project and Toll intends to invest . It is expected that each project will also be financed with approximately non-recourse construction debt. The parties have targeted an initial minimum co-investment of approximately million in combined equity. The Company and Toll have and expect to continue to enter into separate joint venture agreements for each property, and the Company has and expects to continue to account for these unconsolidated joint ventures under the equity method of accounting. As of December 31, 2022, the Company and Toll have entered into separate joint venture agreements under the Commitment Agreement, with three projects currently under development. Other Commitments We have entered into, and may continue in the future to enter into, real estate technology and other real estate fund investments.

Contingencies Litigation and Legal Matters The Company, as an owner of real estate, is subject to various federal, state and local laws. Compliance by the Company with existing laws has not had a material adverse effect on the Company. However, the Company cannot predict the impact of new or changed laws or regulations on its current properties or on properties that it may acquire in the future. The Company does not believe there is any litigation pending or threatened against it that, individually or in the aggregate, may reasonably be expected to have a material adverse effect on the Company. 

 The Company s primary business is the acquisition, development and management of multifamily residential properties, which includes the generation of rental and other related income through the leasing of apartment units to residents. The chief operating decision maker evaluates the Company s operating performance geographically by market and both on a same store and non-same store basis. While the Company does maintain a non-residential presence, it accounts for approximately of total revenues for the year ended December 31, 2022 and is designed as an amenity for our residential residents. The chief operating decision maker evaluates the performance of each property on a consolidated residential and non-residential basis. The Company s geographic consolidated same store operating segments represent its reportable segments. The Company s development activities are other business activities that do not constitute an operating segment and as such, have been aggregated in the Other category in the tables presented below. All revenues are from external customers and there is customer who contributed 10 or more of the Company s total revenues during the three years ended December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively. The primary financial measure for the Company s rental real estate segment is net operating income NOI ), which represents rental income less: 1) property and maintenance expense and 2) real estate taxes and insurance expense (all as reflected in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive income). The Company believes that NOI is helpful to investors as a supplemental measure of its operating performance because it is a direct measure of the actual operating results of the Company s apartment properties. Revenues for all leases are reflected on a straight-line basis in accordance with GAAP for the current and comparable periods.
