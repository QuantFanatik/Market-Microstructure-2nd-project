ITEM 1. 
 BUSINESS 

Overview 

Rebus Holdings, Inc. (fka Inspyr Therapeutics, Inc.) is a pharmaceutical company focused on the research and development of novel targeted precision therapeutics for the treatment of cancer. Our approach utilizes our proprietary delivery technology to better enhance immuno-modulation for improved therapeutic outcomes. Our potential first-in-class immune-oncology lead asset, RT-AR001, an adenosine A 2A receptor antagonist, is differentiated by its intratumoral delivery of nano- or microparticle formulations that allows for better tumor infiltration. The adenosine A 2 Receptor is one of many T-cell surface immune checkpoint proteins. Our patented portfolio of adenosine receptor antagonists provides flexibility to optimize treatment based on the specific adenosine targets found in each type of cancer. 

Adenosine Receptor Modulators 

The adenosine receptor modulators include A 2A , A 2B and dual A 2A /A 2B antagonists, that have broad development applicability including indications within immuno-oncology. Very high concentrations of adenosine are produced in the tumor microenvironment which prevents the host s own immune cells from attacking the tumor. Adenosine receptor antagonists as single-agents and in combination with other existing immuno-oncology agents may overcome this immunosuppression and boost the host immune response leading to enhanced anti-tumor activity as well as inhibition of metastasis. Preclinical data has shown the direct effects with our drug candidates on certain types of cancer cells. 

We have completed the manufacture of our novel platform delivery system of nano- or microparticle formulations that will be used in toxicology studies anticipated to begin in the second half of 2023, that will support the submission of an IND in 2024. 

While we believe that the data from our nonclinical studies appear encouraging, the outcome of our ongoing or future studies may ultimately be unsuccessful. 

We have manufactured sufficient amounts of nano- or microparticle formulations, to take us through the IND and initial clinical studies. 

Rebus Holdings/ Ridgeway Licensing Agreement 

Pursuant to our recent termination of license with Ridgeway Therapeutics, Inc., we reacquired the rights to certain intellectual property, discussed above, and are currently focusing on a pipeline of small molecule adenosine receptor modulators. In October 2020, pursuant to the cancellation of a license agreement whereby we previously licensed US Patent 9,593,118, we reacquired the exclusive right to such patent that covers both A 2B and dual A 2A /A 2B antagonists. Accordingly, going forward our major focus will be: (i) further characterization of the anti-cancer activity of our unique pipeline delivery platform containing A 2A , A 2B and dual A 2A /A 2B antagonists, leading to selection of a clinical candidate or candidates for an Investigative New Drug or IND enabling studies; and (ii) licensing and/or partnering our delivery platform and the A 2B and dual A 2A /A 2B antagonists for further development. 

2 

Our ability to execute the business plan is contingent upon our ability to raise the necessary funds. During January 2021, we sold 500,000 of debt securities for cash, and in June 2021, we sold 600,000 of debt securities for 500,000 in cash and 100,000 in cancellation of outstanding obligations. We are currently using such funds to maintain our SEC reporting requirements, pay outstanding invoices to our independent registered accounting firm, legal fees, and to retain consultants and other personnel in preparation for an Investigational New Drug Application IND filing related to our unique delivery platform and portfolio of adenosine A 2 R antagonists for the treatment of certain solid tumors. Should we fail to further raise sufficient funds to execute our business plan, our priority would be to maintain our intellectual property portfolio and seek business development opportunities with potential development partners and/or acquirors. 

Pre-Revenue 

We are a pre-revenue, early-stage company that has not achieved profitability, and has no product revenues. Additionally, we have no approved products for sale. 

Going Concern 

Our auditors report on our December 31, 2022 consolidated financial statements expressed an opinion that our capital resources as of the date of their Audit Report were not sufficient to sustain operations or complete our planned activities for the upcoming year unless we raised additional funds. As of December 31, 2022 we had sufficient cash on hand to operate until March, 2023. If we do not obtain additional funds by such time, we may no longer be able to continue as a going concern and will cease operation which means that our shareholders will lose their entire investment. 

Recent Developments 

Effective October 12, 2021, we (i) completed a 1-for-75 Reverse Stock Split and (ii) a holding company reorganization whereby we changed our name to Rebus Holdings, Inc. 

On August 16, 2021, we appointed Raul Silvestre, Esq. as (i) our interim chief executive officer and principal accounting officer and (ii) a member of the Board of Directors. 

On June 18, 2021, we completed the private placement of 600,000 of non-interest bearing senior convertible debentures consisting of (i) 500,000 purchased in cash and (ii) 100,000 purchased pursuant to the cancellation of outstanding obligations. 

On January 12, 2021, we completed the private placement of 500,000 of non-interest bearing senior convertible debentures 

Product Development of Adenosine Receptor Modulators 

As a result of the License Termination, the Company has refocused its business plan on the research and development of its lead asset, RT-AR001, an adenosine A 2 receptor antagonist, which is differentiated by its intratumoral delivery of nano- or microparticle formulations that allows for better tumor infiltration. 

Adenosine is an extracellular signaling molecule that regulates multiple aspects of tissue function and specifically plays a role in immunity and inflammation. The adenosine A 2 receptor is one of many T-cell surface immune checkpoint proteins. High levels of adenosine in the tumor microenvironment are produced and, therefore, adenosine signaling, mediated through the A 2A and A 2B receptors, suppresses the host immune response to the tumor cells. 

3 

As such, our portfolio of adenosine receptor antagonists has broad applicability as potential immuno-oncology (IO) therapeutic agents in multiple solid tumor types both as a potential single agent and in combination with other IO agents, in addition to traditional cytotoxic chemotherapy. We are actively seeking licensing opportunities and/or partners to further develop our unique platform delivery system of A 2A , A 2B and dual A 2A /A 2B receptor antagonists. Our current product development plan for adenosine receptor antagonists contemplates the following major initiatives, subject to the Company receiving sufficient funds: 

Continue development of anti-cancer agents with partner company, Ridgeway Therapeutics, Inc. 

Further characterization of our platform delivery system and existing agents in preclinical studies, and towards an investigational new drug (IND) application. 

Support ongoing licensing / partnership activities. 

Pre-IND and IND 

The Company is currently pursuing an IND filing related to our unique delivery platform and portfolio of adenosine A 2 R antagonists for the treatment of certain solid tumors, and is preparing its pre-IND application, for its lead asset, RT-AR001, an adenosine A 2A receptor antagonist. 

Between September 2021 and February 2022, our CMO manufactured to GMP standards; both our adenosine A 2A receptor antagonist as well as the nano- or microparticle formulation for intratumoral delivery known as RT-AR001. We have sufficient material to take us through the IND and initial clinical studies. 

We have completed in-vitro testing of our adenosine A 2A receptor antagonist and will begin toxicology testing with RT-AR001 in the second half of 2023. The Company plans to provide a further update on RT-AR001 s clinical development in the fourth quarter of 2023. 

Our Technology 

We have what we believe to be a robust intellectual property portfolio covering proprietary A 2A agonists (LNC-001, see below), A 2B antagonists (LNC-002, see below), and dual A 2A /A 2B antagonists (LNC-003, see below). We also have a substantial catalogue of synthesized compounds, specifically A 2A agonists and A 2B antagonists that require further characterization and testing for potential clinical candidates. We believe that our proprietary dual A 2A /A 2B antagonists have great potential and should be further explored. 

Patents and Proprietary Rights 

Our success will likely depend upon our ability to preserve our proprietary technologies and operate without infringing the proprietary rights of other parties. However, we may rely on certain proprietary technologies and know-how that are not patentable or that we determine to keep as trade secrets. We protect our proprietary information, in part, using confidentiality agreements with our employees, consultants, significant scientific collaborators, and sponsored researchers that generally provide that all inventions conceived by the individual in the course of rendering services to us shall be our exclusive property. 

The intellectual property underlying our technology is covered by certain patents and patent applications previously owned by Lewis and Clark Pharmaceuticals, Inc. LNC and now fully owned by the Company. All of the LNC intellectual property has been assigned to the Company. We solely own all of our patents and patent applications for adenosine receptor modulators, which include three patent estates, one for A 2A agonists (LNC-001), the second for A 2B antagonists (LNC-002), and the third for dual A 2A /A 2B antagonists (LNC-003). Ownership of these patent estates came from our purchase (in exchange for 7,122,172 shares of our common stock) of Lewis and Clark Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (LNC) on July 31, 2017. The purchase of LNC also included all know-how, pre-clinical data, and development data that relate to and form the basis of our technology. Under the purchase agreement, we are sole owners of the technology and patent estates and are not required to make any other future payments, including fees or other reimbursements, milestones, or royalties, to LNC.

When appropriate, we will continue to seek patent protection for inventions in our core technologies and in ancillary technologies that support our core technologies or which we otherwise believe will provide us with a competitive advantage. We will accomplish this by filing and maintaining patent applications for discoveries we make, either alone or in collaboration with scientific collaborators and strategic partners. Typically, we plan to file patent applications in the United States. In addition, we plan to obtain licenses or options to acquire licenses to patent filings from other individuals and organizations that we anticipate could be useful in advancing our research, development, and commercialization initiatives and our strategic business interest.

Development Strategy 

We anticipate that under the planning and direction of key personnel, to outsource all our nonclinical development and manufacturing, and the majority of our clinical development activities to contract research organizations (CROs) and contract manufacturing organizations (CMOs). Our contract CROs and CMOs are required to comply with federal, state and United States Food and Drug Administration or FDA regulations including Good Manufacturing Practices (cGMP), Good Clinical Practices (GCP), and Good Lab Practices (GLP). 

We intend to conduct toxicology testing of our A 2A antagonist RT-AR001 the select a candidate for clinical trials in an oncology indication. This oncology work is expected to be run in conjunction with and oversight from Ridgeway Therapeutics, Inc. for the selection of an anti-cancer agent. 

Commercialization Strategy 

We intend to (i) license or sell the underlying technology of our therapeutics to third parties during or after our clinical trials, (ii) seek a corporate partner for further development, or (iii) continue developing our drug candidates ourselves. It is expected that such third parties would then continue to develop, market, sell, and distribute any resulting products. As part of our overall strategic plan, we are exploring our options and actively seeking to engage in a collaborative, strategic and/or licensing arrangement with another pharmaceutical company. If we enter into any such transaction, we may be required to give up certain rights to our technology and control over its future development. 

Intellectual Property 

We regard the protection of patents and other intellectual property rights that we own or license as critical to our business and competitive position. To protect our intellectual property, we rely on patent, trade secret, and copyright law, as well as confidentiality, nondisclosure, assignment of invention and other contractual arrangements with our officers, directors, employees, consultants, investigators, clinical trial sites, contractors, collaborators and other third parties to whom we disclose confidential information. Our policy is to pursue patent applications on inventions and discoveries that we believe are commercially important to the development and growth of our business. We solely own or have exclusive licenses to our patents and patent applications. 

Our pipeline currently includes a substantial catalogue of synthesized compounds, specifically A 2A agonists and A 2B antagonists that require further characterization and testing for potential clinical candidates. Our proprietary dual A 2A /A 2B antagonists have great potential and need to be further explored. 

Our intellectual property estate, shown above, has twenty-eight (28) issued patents in twenty-five (25) different jurisdictions and five (5) currently pending applications. 

When appropriate and funding permitting, we plan to continue to seek patent protection for inventions in our core technologies and in ancillary technologies that support our core technologies or which we otherwise believe would provide us with a competitive advantage. We expect to be able to accomplish this by filing and maintaining patent applications for discoveries we make, either alone or in collaboration with scientific collaborators and strategic partners. Typically, we plan to file patent applications in the United States as well as foreign countries, where applicable. In addition, we may obtain licenses or options to acquire licenses to patent filings from other individuals and organizations that we anticipate could be useful in advancing our research, development and commercialization initiatives and our strategic business interest.

Manufacturing and Supply 

We do not plan to develop company-owned or company-operated manufacturing facilities. We historically have and we plan to in the future, outsource all drug manufacturing to contract manufacturers that are required to operate in compliance with cGMP. We may also seek to refine the current manufacturing process in order to achieve improvements in efficiency, costs, purity and the like as well as address different drug formulations to achieve improvements in stability and/or drug delivery. 

Between September 2021 and February 2022, our CMO manufactured to GMP standards, both our adenosine A 2A receptor antagonist as well as the nano- or microparticle formulation for intratumoral delivery known as RT-AR001. We have sufficient material to take us through the IND and initial clinical studies. 

Governmental Regulations 

FDA Approval Process 

Prior to commencement of clinical studies involving humans, preclinical testing of new pharmaceutical products is generally conducted on animals in the laboratory to evaluate the potential efficacy and safety of the product candidate. The results of these studies are submitted to the FDA as part of an IND application, which must become effective before clinical testing in humans can begin. Typically, human clinical evaluation involves a time-consuming and costly three-phase process. In Phase I, clinical trials are conducted with a small number of people to assess safety, tolerability and to evaluate the pattern of drug distribution within the body. In Phase II, clinical trials are conducted with groups of patients afflicted with a specific disease in order to determine preliminary efficacy, optimal dosages and expanded evidence of safety. (In some cases, an initial trial is conducted in diseased patients to assess both preliminary efficacy and preliminary safety, in which case it is referred to as a Phase I/II trial.) In Phase III, large-scale, multi-center, comparative trials are conducted with patients afflicted with a target disease in order to provide enough data to demonstrate the efficacy and safety required by the FDA. The FDA closely monitors the progress of each of the three phases of clinical testing and may, at its discretion, re-evaluate, alter, suspend, or terminate the testing based upon the data which have been accumulated to that point and its assessment of the risk/benefit ratio to the patient. All adverse events must be reported to the FDA. Monitoring of all aspects of the study to minimize risks is a continuing process. 

The results of the preclinical and clinical testing on non-biologic drugs and certain diagnostic drugs are submitted to the FDA in the form of a New Drug Application (NDA) for approval prior to commencement of commercial sales. In responding to an NDA submission, the FDA may grant marketing approval, may request additional information, may deny the application if it determines that the application does not provide an adequate basis for approval, and may also refuse to review an application that has been submitted if it determines that the application does not provide an adequate basis for filing and review. There can be no assurance that approvals would be granted on a timely basis, if at all, for any of our proposed products. 

Orphan Drugs 

Under the Orphan Drug Act, the FDA may grant orphan drug designation to drugs intended to treat a rare disease or condition, which is generally defined as a disease or condition that affects fewer than 200,000 individuals in the United States. Orphan drug designation must be requested before submitting an NDA. After the FDA grants orphan drug designation, the generic identity of the drug and its potential orphan use are disclosed publicly by the FDA. Orphan drug designation does not convey any advantage in, or shorten the duration of, the regulatory review and approval process. The first NDA applicant to receive FDA approval for a particular active ingredient to treat a particular disease with FDA orphan drug designation is entitled to a seven-year exclusive marketing period in the United States for that product, for that indication. During the seven-year exclusivity period, the FDA may not approve any other applications to market the same drug for the same orphan indication, except in limited circumstances, such as a showing of clinical superiority to the product with orphan drug exclusivity in that it is shown to be safer, more effective or makes a major contribution to patient care. Orphan drug exclusivity does not prevent the FDA from approving a different drug for the same disease or condition, or the same drug for a different disease or condition. Among the other benefits of orphan drug designation are tax credits for certain research and a waiver of the NDA application user fee.

Asia, European and Other Regulatory Approval 

Whether or not FDA approval has been obtained, approval of a product by comparable regulatory authorities in Europe and other countries is necessary prior to commencement of marketing the product in such countries. The regulatory authorities in each country may impose their own requirements and may refuse to grant an approval, or may require additional data before granting it, even though the relevant product has been approved by the FDA or another authority. As with the FDA, the regulatory authorities in the European Union (EU), countries located in Asia, and other developed regions have lengthy approval processes for pharmaceutical products. The process for gaining approval in particular countries and regions varies, but generally follows a similar sequence to that described for FDA approval. In Europe, the European Committee for Proprietary Medicinal Products provides a mechanism for EU-member states to exchange information on all aspects of product licensing. The EU has established a European agency for the evaluation of medical products, with both a centralized community procedure and a decentralized procedure, the latter being based on the principle of licensing within one member country followed by mutual recognition by the other member countries. In China, the CFDA functions as the counterpart to the FDA in the United States and is responsible for overseeing drug approvals in China and its territories. 

Reimbursement and Health Care Cost Control 

Reimbursement for the costs of treatments and products such as ours from government health administration authorities, private health insurers and others, both in the United States and abroad, is a key element in the success of new health care products. Significant uncertainty often exists as to the reimbursement status of newly approved health care products. The revenue and profitability of some health care-related companies have been affected by the continuing efforts of governmental and third-party payors to contain or reduce the cost of health care through various means. Payors are increasingly attempting to limit both coverage and the levels of reimbursement for new therapeutic products approved for marketing by the FDA, and are refusing, in some cases, to provide any coverage for uses of approved products for disease indications for which the FDA has not granted marketing approval. In certain foreign markets, pricing or profitability of prescription pharmaceuticals is subject to government control. 

In the United States, there have been a number of federal and state proposals to implement government control over health care costs. The U.S. Patient Protection and Affordance Care Act and the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act were signed into law in March 2010. A number of provisions of those laws require further rulemaking action by governmental agencies to implement. The laws change access to health care products and services and create new fees for the pharmaceutical and medical device industries. Future rulemaking could increase rebates, reduce prices or the rate of price increases for health care products and services, or require additional reporting and disclosure. The laws also include new authorization to the FDA to approve companies to market biosimilar products within the United States, although to date FDA rulemaking under this legislation has been limited. We cannot predict the timing or impact of any such future rulemaking on our business. 

Other Regulations 

We are also subject to various U.S. federal, state, local and international laws, regulations and recommendations relating to safe working conditions, laboratory and manufacturing practices and the use and disposal of hazardous or potentially hazardous substances, including radioactive compounds and infectious disease agents, used in connection with our business. Additionally, we are subject to regulations and standards relating to corporate governance and public disclosure, including the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, and Securities and Exchange Commission regulations. We cannot accurately predict the extent of government regulation which might result from future legislation or administrative action. 

Employees 

As of March 15, 2023, we employed only Mr. Silvestre, on a part time basis, as our interim chief executive officer who is our only employee. In addition, we contract with a limited number of consultants to assist in activities related to our operations.

Corporate History 

We were incorporated in the State of Delaware in November 2003. In August of 2016, we changed our name from GenSpera, Inc. to Inspyr Therapeutics, Inc. In October 2021, we completed a holding company reorganization structure, changing our name to Rebus Holdings, Inc. Our principal office is located in Westlake Village, California. Since our inception, we have invested a substantial portion of our efforts and financial resources in the development of mipsagargin (G-202). In July of 2017, we acquired Lewis and Clark Pharmaceuticals and licensed certain assets to Ridgeway Therapeutics for further development. Upon the termination of such license in October 2020, we resumed operations focusing our efforts on our Adenosine Receptor Modulators. On October 12, 2021, we completed a 1:75 reverse stock split of our common stock. We have generated no revenues from the sale of our product candidates and have experienced substantial net operating losses.

ITEM 1A. 
 RISK FACTORS 

We have described below a number of uncertainties and risks which, in addition to uncertainties and risks presented elsewhere in this Annual Report, may adversely affect our business, operating results and financial condition. The uncertainties and risks enumerated below as well as those presented elsewhere in this Annual Report should be considered carefully in evaluating us, our business and the value of our securities. The following important factors, among others, could cause our actual business, financial condition and future results to differ materially from those contained in forward-looking statements made in this Annual Report or presented elsewhere by management from time to time. In these circumstances, the market price of our common stock could decline, and you could lose your entire investment. 

Risks Related to our Financial Position, Need to Raise Additional Capital, and Series F Preferred Stock 

We were forced to curtail our operations due to a lack of operating capital and we will not be able to continue as a going concern if we do not obtain additional financing. 

Since our inception, we have funded our operations through the sale of our securities. Our cash balances at December 31, 2022 and 2021 were approximately 5,000 and 711,000, respectively. Despite raising 1,000,000 in gross proceeds through the sale of convertible debentures consisting of (i) 500,000 in January 2021 and (ii) 500,000 (for cash) in June 2021, our ability to continue as a going concern is still wholly dependent upon obtaining sufficient capital to fund our operations. We have no committed sources of additional capital and our access to capital funding is always uncertain. Accordingly, despite our ability to secure capital in the past, we cannot assure you that we will be able to secure additional capital through financing transactions, including issuance of debt, or through other means such as the licensing of our technology or grants. In the event that we are not able to secure additional funding, we may be forced to curtail operations, delay or stop ongoing clinical trials, cease operations altogether or file for bankruptcy. 

Our auditors have expressed substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern. 

Our auditors report on our December 31, 2022 consolidated financial statements expressed an opinion that our capital resources as of the date of their audit report were not sufficient to sustain operations or complete our planned activities for the upcoming year unless we raised additional funds. Our current cash level raises substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern past the first quarter of 2023. If we do not obtain additional funds by such time, we may no longer be able to continue as a going concern and will cease operation which means that our shareholders will lose their entire investment. 

If we do not raise sufficient capital, we may lose rights to certain intellectual property which is the basis of our lead product candidates. 

In October 2020, pursuant to the cancellation of a license agreement, we reacquired the rights to US Patent 9,593,118, which covers both A 2B and dual A 2A /A 2B antagonists. The intellectual property contained in US Patent 9,593,118 is the basis of our lead product candidates. As a condition to the cancelation of the license, we are required to raise an aggregate of 5 million prior to October of 2023. As of the date of this Annual Report, we have raised approximately 1,500,000 in capital beginning from October 5, 2020 (the date of the termination of license agreement). If we are unable to raise such capital, the license cancelation will be revoked, and the license will be reinstated in exchange for the return of the common shares and Series F Preferred Stock. In such event, we will lose all rights to the technology which forms the basis of our lead product candidate which will have a material adverse effect on our business and prospects. 

Our shareholders will experience substantial dilution upon the conversion of our Series F Preferred Stock. 

On October 5, 2020, we reacquired the rights to certain intellectual property that is the basis of our lead proposed product. In exchange for the cancelation of the prior license, which resulted in our reacquisition of such technology, we issued 8,000 shares of Series F Preferred Stock. The 8,000 shares of Series F Preferred Stock are convertible into an aggregate amount that will equal 80 of our issued and outstanding Common Stock immediately post conversion. Upon conversion, our shareholders will experience substantial dilution. 

10 

Risks Relating to Our Stage of Development and Business 

If we are unable to successfully attract and retain a new management team and secure additional members and employees, our business could be harmed. 

On June 16, 2021, Michael Cain, our interim chief executive officer and principal accounting officer resigned as an officer and as a member of the Board of Directors. On August 16, 2021, we appointed Raul Silvestre as interim chief executive officer and principal accounting officer. We will need to augment senior management as well as engage additional personnel to execute our business plan and grow our business. Our success depends largely on the development and execution of our business strategy by our management team. The recent transitions in our executive team may be disruptive to our business, and if we are unable to manage an orderly transition, our business may be adversely affected. Additionally, since our management team consists of only one individual, Mr. Silvestre, the loss of Mr. Silvestre would likely harm our ability to implement our business strategy and respond to the rapidly changing market conditions in which we operate. There may be a limited number of persons with the requisite skills to serve in these positions, and we cannot assure you that we would be able to identify or employ such qualified personnel on acceptable terms, if at all. Additionally, we cannot assure you that management will succeed in working together as a team. In the event that we are unsuccessful, our business and prospects could be harmed. 

We are an early-stage company, have no product revenues, are not profitable and may never be profitable. 

From inception through December 31, 2022, we have raised approximately 39.1 million through the sale of our securities and exercise of outstanding warrants. During this same period, we have recorded an accumulated deficit of approximately 65.3 million. Our net loss for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2022 was 1,020,000. We recognized 2,698,000 of income for the year ended December 31, 2021 (resulting from net noncash income of 3,720,000 related to our convertible notes payable and related derivatives). Our increase in net loss is primarily the result of a reduction in gain from the change in fair value of our derivative instruments and a reduction in gains from conversion of debt, partially offset by reductions in interest expense and operating expenses. None of our products in development have received approval from the United States Food and Drug Administration or FDA, or other regulatory authorities; we have no sales and have never generated revenues nor do we expect to for the foreseeable future. We have currently curtailed our pre-clinical and clinical trials related to mipsagargin and are currently focusing our efforts on the development of our adenosine receptor modulators. We expect to incur significant operating losses for the foreseeable future as we continue the research, pre-clinical and clinical development of our product candidates as well as the possible in-licensing of additional clinical and pre-clinical assets. Accordingly, we will need additional capital to fund our continuing operations and any expansion plans. Since we do not generate any revenue, the most likely sources of such additional capital include the sale of our securities, a strategic licensing collaboration transaction or joint venture involving the rights to one or more of our product candidates, or from grants. To the extent that we raise additional capital by issuing equity securities, our stockholders are likely to experience dilution with regard to their percentage ownership of the company, which may be significant. If we raise additional funds through collaborations or licensing arrangements, we may be required to relinquish some or all the rights to our technologies, product candidates, or grant licenses on terms that are not favorable to us. If we raise additional capital by incurring debt, we could incur significant interest expense and become subject to covenants that could affect the manner in which we conduct our business, including securing such debt obligations with our assets. 

Our product candidates are at various stages of early development and significant financial resources are required to develop commercially viable products and obtain regulatory approval to market and sell such products. We will need to devote significantly more research and development efforts, financial resources and personnel to develop commercially viable products and obtain regulatory approvals. We may encounter hurdles and unexpected issues as we proceed in the development of our other product candidates. While initial data from our research appear promising, the outcome of the pre-clinical and development work is uncertain and future trials may ultimately be unsuccessful. If we fail to develop and successfully commercialize our product candidates, our business may be materially harmed and could fail. 

We have a limited operating history as a company and may not be able to effectively operate our business. 

Our limited staff and operating history mean that there is a high degree of uncertainty regarding our ability to: 

develop and commercialize our technologies and proposed products; 

obtain regulatory approval to commence the marketing of our products; 

11 

identify, hire and retain the needed personnel to implement our business plan; 

manage growth; 

achieve market acceptance or insurance reimbursement for any of our proposed products, if successfully developed; or 

respond to competition. 

No assurances can be given as to exactly when, if at all, we will be able to fully develop, and take the necessary steps to derive any revenues from our proposed product candidates. 

We rely on technologies that we may not be able to commercially develop, which will prevent us from generating revenues, operating profitably or providing investors any return on their investment. 

We have refocused our development on our adenosine receptor modulator technologies and our ability to generate revenue and operate profitably will depend on us being able to develop these technologies for human applications. We cannot guarantee that the results obtained in clinical evaluation of our therapies will be sufficient to warrant approval by the FDA for clinical use. Even if our therapies are approved for use by the FDA, there is no guarantee that they will exhibit an enhanced efficacy relative to competing products such that they will be adopted by the medical community. Without significant adoption by the medical community our product candidates will have limited commercial potential which will likely result in the loss of your entire investment. 

Inability to complete pre-clinical and clinical testing and trials will impair the viability of the Company. 

We are in the development stage and have not yet applied for approval by the FDA to conduct clinical trials. Even if we successfully file an IND application and receive clearance from the FDA to commence trials, the outcome of pre-clinical, clinical and product testing of our product candidates is uncertain, and if we are unable to satisfactorily complete such testing, or if such testing yields unsatisfactory results, we will be unable to commercially produce our proposed products. Before obtaining regulatory approvals for the commercial sale of any potential human products, our product candidates will be subjected to extensive pre-clinical and clinical testing to demonstrate their safety and efficacy in humans. No assurances can be given that the clinical trials of our product candidates, or those of licensees or collaborators, will demonstrate the safety and efficacy of such product candidates at all, or to the extent necessary to obtain appropriate regulatory approvals, or that the testing of such product candidates will be completed in a timely manner, if at all, or without significant increases in costs, program delays or both, all of which could harm our ability to generate revenues. In addition, our product candidates may not prove to be more effective for treating disease than current therapies. Accordingly, we may have to delay or abandon efforts to research, develop or obtain regulatory approval to market our product candidates. Many companies involved in biotechnology research and development have suffered significant setbacks in advanced clinical trials, even after promising results in earlier trials. The failure to adequately demonstrate the safety and efficacy of a therapeutic product under development could delay or prevent regulatory approval of the product and could harm our ability to generate revenues, operate profitably or produce any return on an investment in our company. 

Raising capital may be difficult as a result of our history of losses and limited operating history in our current stage of development. 

When making investment decisions, investors typically look at a company s management, earnings and historical performance in evaluating the risks and operations of the business and the business s future prospects. Our history of losses, new senior management team and relatively limited operating history in our current stage of development makes such evaluation, as well as any estimation of our future performance, substantially more difficult. As a result, investors may be unwilling to invest in us or on terms or conditions which are acceptable. If we are unable to secure additional financing, we may need to materially scale back our business plan and/or operations or cease operations altogether. 

12 

A pandemic, epidemic or outbreak of an infectious disease in the markets in which we operate or that otherwise impacts our facilities or advisors could adversely impact our business. 

If a pandemic, epidemic, or outbreak of an infectious disease including the recent outbreak of respiratory illness caused by a novel coronavirus (COVID-19) or other public health crisis were to affect our facilities or those of our suppliers, our business could be adversely affected. A pandemic typically results in social distancing, travel bans and quarantine, and this may limit access to our facilities, management, support staff and professional advisors. These factors, in turn, may not only materially impact our operations and financial condition, but our overall ability to react timely to mitigate the impact of this event. Also, it may hamper our efforts to comply with our filing obligations with the Securities and Exchange Commission. 

Business or economic disruptions or global health concerns could seriously harm our development efforts and increase our costs and expenses. 

Broad-based business or economic disruptions could adversely affect our ongoing or planned research and development activities. For example, in November 2019 an outbreak of a novel strain of coronavirus originated in Wuhan, China, and has since spread around the world, including to the United States. To date, this outbreak has already resulted in extended shutdowns of many businesses around the world, including in the United States. Global health concerns, such as coronavirus, could also result in social, economic, and labor instability in the countries in which we or the third parties with whom we engage operate. We cannot presently predict the scope, severity and longevity of any potential business shutdowns or disruptions, but if we or any of the third parties with whom we engage or plan to engage, including the suppliers, clinical trial sites, regulators and other third parties with whom we conduct business or plan to conduct business, were to experience shutdowns or other business disruptions, our ability to conduct our business in the manner and on the timelines presently planned could be materially and negatively impacted. It is also possible that global health concerns such as this one could disproportionately impact the hospitals and clinical sites in which we conduct or plan to conduct any of our clinical trials, which could have a material adverse effect on our business and our results of operation and financial condition. 

Risks Related to Commercialization 

The market for our proposed products is rapidly changing and competitive. 

The pharmaceutical and biotechnology industries are subject to rapid and substantial technological change and innovation. Developments by others may render our proposed products non-competitive or obsolete, or we may be unable to keep pace with technological developments and other market factors. Competition from pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies, universities, governmental entities and others diversifying into the field is intense and is expected to increase. 

As a pre-revenue company, our resources are limited, and we may experience challenges inherent in the early development of novel therapeutics. Competitors have developed or are in the process of developing technologies that are, or in the future may be, the basis for competition. Some of these technologies may have an entirely different approach or means of accomplishing similar therapeutic efforts compared to our proposed products. Our competitors may develop therapies that are safer, more effective and less costly than our proposed products and therefore, present a serious competitive threat to us. 

The acceptance of therapies that are alternatives to ours may limit market acceptance of our proposed products, even if commercialized. Many of our targeted diseases and conditions can also be treated by other medications and treatments. These treatments may be widely accepted in medical communities and have a longer history of use. The established use of other competing therapies may limit the potential for our proposed products, even if commercialized. 

13 

Our proposed products may not be accepted by the healthcare community. 

Our proposed products, if approved for marketing, may not achieve market acceptance by the healthcare community since hospitals, physicians, patients, or the medical community in general may decide not to utilize them. We are attempting to develop products that are likely to be first approved for marketing as a treatment for late-stage cancer where there is no truly effective standard of care. If approved for use in late-stage cancer, our proposed products might then be evaluated in earlier stages where they could represent a substantial departure from established treatment methods and would most likely compete with a number of more conventional drugs and therapies which are manufactured and marketed by major pharmaceutical companies. It is too early in the development cycle of our proposed products for us to predict our major competitors. The degree of market acceptance of our products, if developed, will depend on a number of factors, including but not limited to: 

our ability to demonstrate the clinical efficacy and safety of our proposed products to the medical community; 

our ability to create products that are superior to alternative products; 

our ability to establish in the medical community the potential advantage of our treatments over alternative treatment methods; and 

the reimbursement policies of government and third-party payors. 

If the healthcare community does not accept our products, our business could be materially harmed. 

Our potential competitors in the biotechnology and pharmaceutical industries have significantly greater resources than we have. 

We compete against numerous companies, many of which have substantially greater resources than we have. Several such competitors have research programs and/or efforts to treat the same diseases we target. Companies that may compete with us have substantially greater financial, research, manufacturing and marketing resources than we do. As a result, such competitors may find it easier to compete in our industry and bring competing products to market. 

Risks Related to the Development and Manufacturing of Our Product Candidates 

We intend to rely exclusively upon third-party FDA-regulated manufacturers and suppliers for our proposed products. 

We currently have no internal manufacturing capability and intend to rely exclusively on FDA-approved licensees, strategic partners or third-party contract manufacturers or suppliers for the foreseeable future. Because manufacturing facilities are subject to regulatory oversight and inspection, the failure of any of our third-party FDA regulated manufactures or suppliers to comply with regulatory requirements could result in material manufacturing delays and product shortages, which could delay or otherwise negatively impact our clinical trials and product development plans. Should we be forced to manufacture our proposed products, we cannot give any assurance that we would be able to develop internal manufacturing capabilities or secure third-party suppliers for raw materials. In the event that we seek third party suppliers or alternative manufacturers, they may require us to purchase a minimum amount of materials or could require other unfavorable terms. Any such event could materially impact our business prospects and could delay the development of our proposed products. Moreover, we cannot give any assurance that the contract manufacturers or suppliers that we select will be able to supply our products in a timely or cost-effective manner or in accordance with applicable regulatory requirements or our own specifications. 

We may not be able to establish or maintain the third-party relationships that are necessary to develop or potentially commercialize our product candidates. 

As needed, we plan to rely heavily on third party collaborators, partners, licensees, clinical research organizations, clinical investigators, vendors or other third parties to support our research and development efforts and to conduct clinical trials for our product candidates. We cannot guarantee that we will be able to successfully negotiate agreements for, or maintain relationships with, these third parties on a commercially reasonable basis, if at all. Additionally, to commercialize our proposed products, we intend to rely on third party licensees or the outright sale of our proposed products to pharmaceutical partner(s). If we fail to establish or maintain such third-party relationships as anticipated, our business could be adversely affected. 

14 

We are dependent upon third parties to develop our product candidates, and such parties are, to some extent, outside of our control. 

We depend and plan to depend upon independent contract research organizations, investigators, and collaborators, such as universities and medical institutions, to conduct our pre-clinical and clinical studies. These individuals and/or entities are not our employees and we cannot control the amount or timing of resources that they devote to our programs. These third parties may not assign as great a priority to our programs or pursue them as diligently as we would if we were undertaking such programs ourselves. If these third parties fail to devote sufficient time and resources to our programs, or if their performance is substandard, the development of our drug candidates and corresponding FDA approval could be delayed or fail entirely. 

Our therapeutic compounds may not be able to be manufactured profitably on a large enough scale to support commercialization. 

To date, our therapeutic compounds have only been manufactured at a scale which is adequate to supply our research activities and early-stage clinical trials. There can be no assurance that the procedures currently used to manufacture our therapeutic compounds will work at a scale which is adequate for commercial needs. In the event our therapeutic compounds cannot be manufactured in sufficient quantities for commercialization, our future prospects could be significantly impacted, and our financial prospects would be materially harmed. 

Risks Relating to our Intellectual Property 

Our competitive position is dependent on our intellectual property and we may not be able to withstand challenges to our intellectual property rights. 

We rely on our intellectual property, including our issued and applied for U.S. and foreign patents as the foundation of our business. If our intellectual property rights are challenged, no assurances can be given that our patents or licenses would survive claims alleging invalidity or infringement on other patents and/or licenses. In addition, disputes may arise regarding inventorship of our intellectual property. It is possible that our intellectual property may be infringing upon existing patents that we are not currently unaware of. As the number of participants in the marketplace grows, the possibility of patent infringement claims against us increases. It is difficult, if not impossible, to determine how such disputes would be resolved. Furthermore, because of the substantial amount of discovery required in connection with patent litigation, there is a risk that some of our confidential information could be required to be publicly disclosed. Any litigation claims against us may cause us to incur substantial costs and could place a significant strain upon our financial resources, divert the attention of management or restrict our core business or result in the public disclosure of confidential information. 

We may incur substantial costs as a result of litigation or other proceedings relating to patent and other intellectual property rights and we may be unable to protect our rights to, or use of, our technology. 

Some or all of our patent applications may not issue as patents, or the claims of any issued patents may not afford meaningful protection for our technologies or products. In addition, patents issued to us or our licensors, if any, may be challenged and subsequently narrowed, invalidated or circumvented. Patent litigation is widespread in the biotechnology industry and could harm our business. Litigation might be necessary to protect our patent position or to determine the scope and validity of third-party proprietary rights. If we choose to go to court to stop someone else from using the inventions claimed in our patents, that individual or company would have the right to ask the court to rule that such patents are invalid and/or should not be enforced against that third party. These lawsuits are expensive, and we may not have the required resources to pursue such litigation or to protect our patent rights. In addition, there is a risk that the court might decide that these patents are not valid and that we do not have the right to stop the other party from using the inventions. There is also the risk that, even if the validity of these patents is upheld, the court could refuse to stop the other party on the ground that such other party s activities do not infringe on our rights contained in these patents. 

Furthermore, a third party may claim that we are using inventions covered by their patent rights and may go to court to stop us from engaging in our normal operations and activities, including making or selling our product candidates. These lawsuits are costly and could materially increase our operating expenses and divert the attention of managerial and technical personnel. There is a risk that a court would decide that we are infringing the third party s patents and would order us to stop the activities covered by the patents. In addition, there is a risk that a court would order us to pay the other party damages for having violated the other party s patents. The biotechnology industry has produced a proliferation of patents, and it is not always clear to industry participants, including us, which patents cover various types of products or methods of use. The coverage of patents is subject to interpretation by the courts, and the interpretation is not always uniform. 

15 

Because some patent applications in the United States may be maintained in secrecy until the patents are issued, patent applications in the United States and many foreign jurisdictions are typically not published until eighteen months after filing, and publications in the scientific literature often lag behind actual discoveries, we cannot be certain that others have not filed patent applications for technology covered by our issued patents or our pending applications or that we were the first to invent the technology. Our competitors may have filed, and may in the future file, patent applications covering technology similar to ours. Any such patent application may have priority over our patent applications and could further require us to obtain rights to issued patents covering such technologies. 

If another party has filed a United States patent application on inventions similar to ours, we may have to participate in an interference or other proceeding in the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office, or the PTO, or a court to determine priority of invention in the United States. The costs of these proceedings could be substantial, and it is possible that such efforts would be unsuccessful, resulting in a loss of our United States patent position with respect to such inventions. 

Some of our competitors may be able to sustain the costs of complex patent litigation more effectively than we can because they have substantially greater resources. In addition, any uncertainties resulting from the initiation and continuation of any litigation could have a material adverse effect on our ability to raise the capital necessary to continue our operations. 

Obtaining and maintaining our patent protection depends upon compliance with various procedural, documentary, fee payment and other requirements imposed by governmental patent agencies, and our patent protection could be reduced or eliminated for non-compliance with these requirements. 

The PTO and various foreign governmental patent agencies require compliance with a number of procedural, documentary, fee payment and other provisions during the patent process. There are situations in which noncompliance can result in abandonment or lapse of a patent or patent application, resulting in partial or complete loss of patent rights in the relevant jurisdiction. In such an event, competitors might be able to enter the market earlier than would otherwise have been the case. 

We may not be able to adequately protect our intellectual property. 

We rely in part on trade secret protection in order to protect our proprietary trade secrets and unpatented know-how. However, trade secrets are difficult to protect, and we cannot be certain that others do not develop the same or similar technologies on their own. Additionally, research with regard to our technologies has been performed in countries outside of the United States, and we also anticipate conducting joint ventures, collaborations and future clinical trials outside the US. The laws in some of these countries may not provide protection for our trade secrets and intellectual property. We have taken steps, including entering into confidentiality agreements with our employees, consultants, service providers, and potential strategic partners to protect our trade secrets and unpatented know-how. These agreements generally require that the other party keep confidential and not disclose to third parties all confidential information developed by the party or made known to the party by us during the course of the party s relationship with us. We also typically obtain agreements from these parties which provide that inventions conceived by the party in the course of rendering services to us are our property. However, these agreements may not be honored, including in foreign countries in which we conduct research, and may not effectively assign intellectual property rights to us. Enforcing a claim that a party illegally obtained and is using our trade secrets or know-how is difficult, expensive and time consuming, and the outcome is unpredictable. In addition, courts outside the United States may be less willing to protect trade secrets or know-how. The failure to obtain or maintain trade secret protection could adversely affect our competitive position. 

We may be subject to claims that our employees or consultants have wrongfully used or disclosed alleged trade secrets of their former employers. 

As is common in the biotechnology and pharmaceutical industries, we may employ and hire individuals and/or entities who were previously employed at other biotechnology or pharmaceutical companies, including our competitors or potential competitors. Although no claims against us are currently pending, we may be subject to claims that these individuals, entities or that we have inadvertently or otherwise used or disclosed trade secrets or other proprietary information of their former employers. Litigation may be necessary to defend against these claims. Even if we are successful in defending against these claims, litigation could result in substantial costs and be a distraction to management. 

16 

Risks Relating to Marketing Approval and Government Regulations 

Data obtained from clinical trials are susceptible to varying interpretations and may not be sufficient to support approval of our proposed products by the FDA. 

The design of our potential clinical trials will be based on many assumptions about the expected effect of our product candidates and if those assumptions are incorrect, our potential clinical trials may not produce statistically significant results. Preliminary results may not be confirmed on full analysis of the detailed results of early clinical trials. Data already obtained, or in the future obtained, from pre-clinical studies and clinical trials do not necessarily predict the results that may be obtained from later trials. Moreover, pre-clinical and clinical data are susceptible to varying interpretations, which could delay, limit or prevent regulatory approval. A number of companies in the pharmaceutical and biotechnology industries have suffered significant setbacks in advanced clinical trials, even after promising results in earlier trials. The failure to adequately demonstrate the safety and effectiveness of a proposed formulation or product under development could delay or prevent regulatory clearance of the potential drug. Our products may not prove to be safe and effective in clinical trials and may not meet all regulatory requirements needed to receive regulatory approval. While data from our completed trials appear promising, the outcome of the current trials is uncertain, and these trials or future trials may ultimately be unsuccessful. Our clinical trials may among other things, not demonstrate sufficient levels of safety and efficacy necessary to obtain the requisite regulatory approvals for our drugs, and thus our proposed drugs may not be approved for marketing. 

Our proposed products may not receive FDA or other regulatory approvals. 

The FDA and comparable government agencies in foreign countries impose substantial regulations on the manufacture and marketing of pharmaceutical products through expensive, lengthy and detailed laboratory, pre-clinical and clinical testing procedures, sampling activities and other costly and time-consuming procedures. Satisfaction of these regulations typically takes several years or more and varies substantially based upon the type, complexity and novelty of the proposed product. Our proposed products are subject to extensive regulation and/or acceptance by numerous governmental authorities in the United States, including the FDA, and authorities in other countries. Most of our proposed products will require governmental approval before they can be commercialized. Our failure to receive the regulatory approvals in the United States or foreign countries will materially impact our business. 

Our proposed products may not have favorable results in clinical trials or receive regulatory approval. 

Encouraging results from our studies to date should not be relied upon as evidence that our planned pre-clinical and clinical trials will ultimately be successful, or our products approved for marketing. Even though the results of our studies to date may seem promising in certain respects, we will be required to demonstrate through further pre-clinical and clinical trials that our product candidates are safe and effective for use in a diverse population before we can seek regulatory approvals for their commercial sale. There is typically an extremely high rate of attrition from the failure of product candidates as they proceed through clinical trials. If any product candidate fails to demonstrate sufficient safety and efficacy in any clinical trial, then we could experience potentially significant delays in, or be required to abandon, development of that product candidate. While initial data from our preliminary studies appear promising, the outcome of any clinical trials is uncertain and such trials or future trials may ultimately be unsuccessful. 

If users of our proposed products are unable to obtain adequate reimbursement from third-party payors, market acceptance of our proposed products may be limited, and we may not achieve revenues or profits. 

The continuing efforts of governments, insurance companies, health maintenance organizations and other payers of healthcare costs to contain or reduce costs of health care may affect our future revenues and profitability as well as the future revenues and profitability of our potential customers, suppliers and collaborative partners in addition to the availability of capital. In other words, our ability to commercialize our proposed products depends in large part on the extent to which appropriate reimbursement levels for the cost of our proposed formulations, products and related treatments are obtained by the health care providers of these products and treatments. At this time, we cannot predict the precise impact that recently adopted or future laws will have on these reimbursement levels. 

17 

We may be unable to comply with our reporting and other requirements under federal securities laws. 

The Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, as well as related new rules and regulations implemented by the United States Securities and Exchange Commission, or SEC, and the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board, require changes in the corporate governance practices and financial reporting standards for public companies. These laws, rules and regulations, including compliance with Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 relating to internal control over financial reporting, would be expected to materially increase the Company s legal and financial compliance costs and make some activities more time-consuming and more burdensome. Presently we qualify as a non-accelerated filer. Accordingly, we are exempt from the requirements of Section 404(b) and our independent registered public accounting firm is not required to audit the design and operating effectiveness of our internal controls and management s assessment of the design and the operating effectiveness of such internal controls. In the event that we become an accelerated filer, we will be required to expend substantial capital in connection with compliance. 

We do not have effective internal controls over our financial reporting. 

Because of our limited resources, management has concluded that our internal control over financial reporting may not be effective in providing reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. Effective internal controls over financial reporting and disclosure controls and procedures are necessary for us to provide reliable financial and other reports and effectively prevent fraud. If we cannot provide reliable financial or SEC reports or prevent fraud, investors may lose confidence in our SEC reports, our operating results and the trading price of our common stock could suffer materially, and we may become subject to litigation. 

Compliance with changing regulation of corporate governance and public disclosure may result in additional expenses and will divert time and attention away from revenue generating activities. 

Changing laws, regulations and standards relating to corporate governance and public disclosure, including the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 and related SEC regulations, have created uncertainty for public companies and significantly increased the costs and risks associated with accessing the public markets and public reporting. Our management team invests significant time and financial resources to comply with both existing and evolving standards for public companies, which will lead to increased general and administrative expenses and a diversion of management time and attention from developing our business to compliance activities which could have an adverse effect on our business. 

Risks Relating to our Securities 

Our common stock price may be particularly volatile because of our stage of development and business. 

The market prices for the securities of biotechnology and pharmaceutical companies in general, and early-stage drug development companies in particular, such as ours, have been highly volatile and may continue to be highly volatile in the future. The following may have a significant impact on the market price of our common stock: 

our ability to retain and augment our current management team and workforce, which currently consists of only one employee, our chief executive officer; 

the development status of our drug candidates, particularly the results of our clinical trials; 

market conditions or trends related to the biotechnology and pharmaceutical industries, or the market in general; 

announcements of technological innovations, new commercial products, or other material events by our competitors or us; 

disputes or other developments concerning our proprietary rights; 

18 

changes in, or failure to meet, securities analysts or investors expectations of our financial and developmental performance; 

additions or departures of key personnel; 

loss of any strategic relationship; 

discussions of our business, products, financial performance, prospects, or stock price by the financial and scientific press and online investor communities such as chat rooms; 

industry developments, including, without limitation, changes in healthcare policies or practices or third-party reimbursement policies; 

public concern as to, and legislative action with respect to, testing or other research areas of biopharmaceutical and pharmaceutical companies, the pricing and availability of prescription drugs, or the safety of drugs; 

regulatory developments in the United States or foreign countries; and 

economic, political and other external factors. 

Broad market fluctuations may cause the market price of our common stock to decline substantially. Additionally, fluctuations in the trading price or liquidity of our common stock may materially and adversely affect, among other things, the interest of investors to purchase our common stock on the open market and, generally, our ability to raise capital. 

Our board of directors has broad discretion to issue additional securities, in the event that we have adequate authorized capital to issue such securities. 

We are authorized under our certificate of incorporation to issue up to 1,000,000,000 shares of common stock and 30,000,000 blank check shares of preferred stock. Shares of our blank check preferred stock provide the board of directors with broad authority to determine voting, dividend, conversion, and other rights. As of March 15, 2023, we have issued and outstanding 32,132,907 shares of common stock. We have also authorized 1,853 shares of Series A 0 Convertible Preferred Stock, of which 133.8125 are outstanding, 1,000 shares of Series B 0 Convertible Preferred Stock, of which 71 are outstanding, 290.43148 shares of Series C 0 Convertible Preferred Stock, that are all outstanding, 5,000 shares of Series D 0 Convertible Preferred Stock, all of which are outstanding, 5,000 shares of Series E 0 Convertible Preferred Stock, all of which are outstanding, and 8,000 shares of Series F 0 Convertible Preferred Stock, all of which are outstanding. Accordingly, we are entitled to issue 967,867,093 shares of common stock, and 29,981,505 additional shares of blank check preferred stock. Notwithstanding, all of our Series F Convertible Preferred Stock is convertible into 80 of our issued and outstanding common stock immediately prior to issuance. Our board may generally issue those common and preferred shares, or convertible securities to purchase those shares, without further approval by our shareholders. Any additional preferred shares we may issue could have such rights, preferences, privileges, and restrictions as may be designated from time-to-time by our board, including preferential dividend rights, voting rights, conversion rights, redemption rights and liquidation provisions. 

It is likely that we will issue a large number of additional securities to raise capital in order to further our business plans. It is also likely that we will issue a large number of additional securities to directors, officers, employees and consultants as compensatory grants in connection with their services, both in the form of stand-alone grants or under our various stock plans. Any issuances could be made at a price that reflects a discount to, or a premium from, the then-current market price of our common stock. These issuances would dilute the percentage ownership interest of our current shareholders, which would have the effect of reducing your influence on matters on which our stockholders vote, and might dilute the net tangible book value per share of our common stock. 

19 

Future sales of our common stock could cause our stock price to fall. 

Transactions that result in a large amount of newly issued shares become readily tradable, or other events that cause current stockholders to sell shares, could place downward pressure on the trading price of our common stock. In addition, the lack of a robust trading market may require a stockholder who desires to sell a large number of shares of common stock to sell the shares in increments over time to mitigate any adverse impact of the sales on the market price of our stock. If our stockholders sell, or the market perceives that our stockholders intend to sell for various reasons, substantial amounts of our common stock in the public market, including shares issued upon the exercise of outstanding options or warrants, the market price of our common stock could fall. Sales of a substantial number of shares of our common stock may make it more difficult for us to sell equity or equity-related securities in the future at a time and price that we deem reasonable or appropriate. We may become involved in securities class action litigation that could divert management s attention and harm our business. 

As of March 15, 2023, we had 1,000,000,000 shares of common stock authorized and 32,132,907 shares outstanding, 1,853 shares of Series A 0 Convertible Preferred Stock authorized and 133.8125 Series A 0 Convertible Preferred Stock outstanding, 1,000 shares of Series B 0 Convertible Preferred Stock authorized and 71 Series B 0 Convertible Preferred Stock outstanding, 290.43148 shares of Series C 0 Convertible Preferred Stock authorized and outstanding, 5,000 shares of Series D 0 Convertible Preferred Stock authorized and outstanding, 5,000 shares of Series E 0 Convertible Preferred Stock authorized and outstanding, and 8,000 shares of Series F 0 Convertible Preferred Stock authorized and outstanding. We additionally have issued an aggregate of 5,591,048 of senior convertible debentures and convertible notes that are convertible into common stock at any time, of which 310,072 is outstanding. Substantially all of the common shares and common shares underlying the Series A 0 Convertible Preferred, Series B 0 Convertible Preferred, Series C 0 Convertible Preferred, Series D 0 Convertible Preferred, Series E 0 convertible Preferred, and Series F 0 Convertible Preferred are available for public sale, subject in some cases to volume and other limitations or delivery of a prospectus. As of March 15, 2023, we were obligated to reserve for issuance (i) 5 shares of our common stock issuable upon the conversion of 133.8125 shares of Series A 0 Convertible Preferred Stock including an additional number of common shares we are contractually obligated to reserve pursuant to our December 2015 offering; (ii) 6,543,778 shares of our common stock issuable upon the conversion of 71 shares of Series B 0 Convertible Preferred Stock including an additional number of common shares we are contractually obligated to reserve pursuant to our December 2016 offering; (iii) 678 shares of our common stock issuable upon the conversion of 290.43148 shares of Series C 0 Convertible Preferred Stock including an additional number of common shares we are contractually obligated to reserve pursuant to our March 2017 offering, (iv) 18 shares of common stock issuable upon the conversion of 5,000 shares of Series D 0 Convertible Preferred Stock, (v) 222 shares of common stock issuable upon the conversion of 5,000 shares of Series E 0 Convertible Preferred Stock, (vi) an indeterminate number of shares of common stock issuable upon the conversion of 8,000 shares of Series F 0 Convertible Preferred Stock (such amount will equal 80 of the common stock post conversion), (vii) 1 share of our common stock issuable upon exercise of outstanding warrants at a weighted average exercise price of 244,688 per share, and (viii) 36,358,766 shares of our common stock issuable upon conversion of our outstanding convertible notes/debentures. Subject to applicable vesting requirements and holding periods, upon conversion or exercise of the outstanding convertible notes and warrants, the underlying shares may be resold into the public market. We cannot predict if future issuances or sales of our common stock, or the availability of our common stock for sale, would harm the market price of our common stock or our ability to raise capital. 

The market for our common stock has historically been illiquid and our investors may be unable to sell their shares. 

Our common stock has historically traded with limited volume on the pink sheets of the OTC Markets Group Inc. Accordingly, although there has been an increased public market for our common stock, it still has historically been relatively illiquid compared to that of a seasoned issuer. Prior to making an investment in our securities, you should consider the historically limited market for our common stock. No assurances can be given that the trading volume of our common stock will increase or remain the same. 

We have not paid cash dividends in the past and do not expect to pay cash dividends in the foreseeable future. 

We have never paid cash dividends on our common stock and do not anticipate paying cash dividends on our common stock in the foreseeable future. If we do not pay dividends, our common stock may be less valuable because a return on your investment will only occur if the market price of our common stock appreciates. 

20 

Provisions of Delaware law and executive employment agreements may prevent or delay a change of control, which could depress the trading price of our common stock. 

We are subject to the Delaware anti-takeover laws regulating corporate takeovers. These anti-takeover laws prevent Delaware corporations from engaging in a merger or sale of more than 10 of its assets with any stockholder, including all affiliates and associates of the stockholder, who owns 15 or more of the corporation s outstanding voting stock, for three years following the date that the stockholder acquired 15 or more of the corporation s assets unless: 

the Board of Directors approved the transaction in which the stockholder acquired 15 or more of the corporation s assets; 

after the transaction in which the stockholder acquired 15 or more of the corporation s assets, the stockholder owned at least 85 of the corporation s outstanding voting stock, excluding shares owned by directors, officers and employee stock plans in which employee participants do not have the right to determine confidentially whether shares held under the plan will be tendered in a tender or exchange offer; or 

on or after this date, the merger or sale is approved by the Board of Directors and the holders of at least two-thirds of the outstanding voting stock that is not owned by the stockholder. 

A Delaware corporation may opt out of the Delaware anti-takeover laws if its certificate of incorporation or bylaws so provides. We have not opted out of the provisions of the anti-takeover laws. As such, these laws could prohibit or delay mergers or other takeover or change of control transactions and may discourage attempts by other companies to acquire us. 

In addition, employment agreements with certain executive officers provide for the payment of severance and accelerated vesting of options and restricted stock in the event of termination following a change of control. These provisions could have the effect of discouraging potential takeover attempts even if it would be beneficial to shareholders. 

Our certificate of incorporation and bylaws contain provisions that could discourage a third-party from acquiring us. 

Our certificate of incorporation and bylaws, as applicable, among other things (i) provide our board with the ability to alter the bylaws without stockholder approval and (ii) provide that vacancies on our board of directors may be filled by a majority of directors in office. These provisions, while designed to reduce vulnerability to an unsolicited acquisition proposal, and to discourage certain tactics used in proxy fights, may negatively impact a third-party s decision to acquire us even if it would be beneficial to shareholders. 

If securities or industry analysts do not publish research or reports or if they publish unfavorable research or reports, an active market for our common stock may not develop and the price of our common stock could decline. 

We are a small company which is relatively unknown to stock analysts, stock brokers, institutional investors and others in the investment community that generate or influence sales volume. Even if we come to the attention of such persons, they may be reluctant to follow or recommend an unproven company such as ours until such time as we became more seasoned and viable. Generally, the trading market for a company s securities depends in part on the research and reports that securities or industry analysts publish. We currently have limited research coverage by securities and industry analysts. As a consequence, there may be periods of time when trading activity in our shares is minimal or non-existent, as compared to a seasoned issuer with significant research coverage. We cannot give you any assurance that a broader or more active public trading market for our common stock will develop or if developed, will be sustained, or that current trading levels could be sustained or not diminish. In addition, in the event any analysts downgrades our securities, the price of our shares would likely decline. If one or more of these analysts ceases to cover us or fails to publish regular reports on us, interest in the purchase of our securities could decrease, which could cause the price of our common stock and its trading volume, if any, to decline.

Our common stock is considered a penny stock, and is subject to additional sale and trading regulations that may make it more difficult to sell. 

Our common stock is considered a penny stock. The principal result or effect of being designated a penny stock is that securities broker-dealers participating in sales of our common stock are subject to the penny stock regulations set forth in Rules 15g-2 through 15g-9 promulgated under the Exchange Act. For example, Rule 15g-2 requires broker-dealers dealing in penny stocks to provide potential investors with a document disclosing the risks of penny stocks and to obtain a manually signed and dated written receipt of the document at least two business days before effecting any transaction in a penny stock for the investor s account. Moreover, Rule 15g-9 requires broker-dealers in penny stocks to approve the account of any investor for transactions in such stocks before selling any penny stock to that investor. This procedure requires the broker-dealer to (i) obtain from the investor information concerning his or her financial situation, investment experience and investment objectives; (ii) reasonably determine, based on that information, that transactions in penny stocks are suitable for the investor and that the investor has sufficient knowledge and experience as to be reasonably capable of evaluating the risks of penny stock transactions; (iii) provide the investor with a written statement setting forth the basis on which the broker-dealer made the determination in (ii) above; and (iv) receive a signed and dated copy of such statement from the investor, confirming that it accurately reflects the investor s financial situation, investment experience and investment objectives. Compliance with these requirements may make it more difficult and time consuming for holders of our common stock to resell their shares to third parties or to otherwise dispose of them in the market or otherwise. 

The number of brokerage firms depositing and transacting trades for penny stock companies is very limited. 

Currently, our Common Stock is traded on the OTC Markets Pink Tier. Many traditional brokerage firms and on-line brokerages refuse to accept for deposit and trade any penny stocks generally. For those that do, the time, effort and costs associated with depositing common stock in companies such as ours which has recently had sub-penny bid and ask are onerous, time consuming and costly. This may present material concerns and obstacles to those persons beneficially owning our common stock in certificate or book entry form, and wish to deposit same into a brokerage account.

Company Overview 

Business 

We are a pharmaceutical company focused on the research and development of novel targeted precision therapeutics for the treatment of cancer. Our approach utilizes our proprietary delivery technology to better enhance immuno-modulation for improved therapeutic outcomes. Our potential first-in-class immune-oncology lead asset, RT-AR001, an adenosine A 2B receptor antagonist, is differentiated by its intratumoral delivery of nano- or microparticle formulations that allows for better tumor infiltration. The adenosine A 2 Receptor is one of many T-cell surface immune checkpoint proteins. Our patented portfolio of adenosine receptor antagonists provides flexibility to optimize treatment based on the specific adenosine targets found in each type of cancer. 

Adenosine Receptor Modulators 

The adenosine receptor modulators include A 2A , A 2B and dual A 2A /A 2B antagonists, that have broad development applicability including indications within immuno-oncology. Very high concentrations of adenosine are produced in the tumor microenvironment which prevents the host s own immune cells from attacking the tumor. Adenosine receptor antagonists as single-agents and in combination with other existing immuno-oncology agents may overcome this immunosuppression and boost the host immune response leading to enhanced anti-tumor activity as well as inhibition of metastasis. Preclinical data has shown the direct effects with our drug candidates on certain types of cancer cells. 

27 

Rebus Holdings/ Ridgeway Licensing Agreement 

Pursuant to our recent termination of license with Ridgeway Therapeutics, Inc., we reacquired the rights to certain intellectual property, discussed above, and are currently focusing on a pipeline of small molecule adenosine receptor modulators. In October 2020, pursuant to the cancellation of a license agreement whereby we previously licensed US Patent 9,593,118, we reacquired the exclusive right to such patent that covers both A 2B and dual A 2A /A 2B antagonists. Accordingly, going forward our major focus will be: (i) further characterization of the anti-cancer activity of our unique pipeline delivery platform containing A 2A , A 2B and dual A 2A /A 2B antagonists, leading to selection of a clinical candidate or candidates for an Investigative New Drug or IND enabling studies; and (ii) licensing and/or partnering our delivery platform and the A 2B and dual A 2A /A 2B antagonists for further development. 

Pre-Revenue 

We are a pre-revenue, early-stage company that has not achieved profitability, and has no product revenues. Additionally, we have no approved products for sale. 

Recent Developments 

Effective October 12, 2021, we (i) completed a 1-for-75 Reverse Stock Split and (ii) a holding company reorganization whereby we changed our name to Rebus Holdings, Inc. 

On August 16, 2021, we appointed Raul Silvestre, Esq. as (i) our interim chief executive officer and principal accounting officer and (ii) a member of the Board of Directors. 

On June 18, 2021, we completed the private placement of 600,000 of non-interest bearing senior convertible debentures in exchange for 500,000 in cash and the cancellation of 100,000 in obligations. 

On January 12, 2021, we completed the private placement of 500,000 of non-interest bearing senior convertible debentures. 

Financial 

To date, we have devoted substantially all of our efforts and financial resources to the development of our proposed drug candidates. We have not received FDA approval to market, distribute or sell any products. We have recently begun working on developing IND approved studies for our adenosine receptor technology platform. 

Since our inception in 2003, we have generated no revenue from product sales and have funded our operations principally through the private and public sales of our equity securities. We have never been profitable and as of December 31, 2022, we had an accumulated deficit of approximately 65.3 million. We expect to continue to incur significant operating losses for the foreseeable future as we continue the development of our product candidates and advance them through clinical trials. 

Our cash balances at December 31, 2022 were approximately 5,000 representing 100 of total assets. In January 2021, we completed a private placement of 500,000 in cash of our debt securities and in June 2021 we completed an additional private placement of 500,000 in cash of our debt securities. Based on our current expected level of operating expenditures and current cash balance as of the date of this report, we expect to be able to fund our operations into the first quarter of 2023. This period could be shortened if there are any significant increases in spending that were not anticipated or other unforeseen events. 

We anticipate raising additional cash through the private or public sales of equity or debt securities to continue to fund our operations and the development of our product candidates. There is no assurance that any such collaborative arrangement will be entered into or that financing will be available to us when needed in order to allow us to continue our operations, or if available, on terms acceptable to us. If we do not raise sufficient funds in a timely manner, we may be forced to curtail operations, delay or stop our ongoing pre-clinical studies and potential clinical trials, cease operations altogether, or file for bankruptcy. We currently do not have commitments for future funding from any source. 

28 

Going Concern 

Our auditors report on our December 31, 2022 consolidated financial statements expressed an opinion that our capital resources as of the date of their Audit Report were not sufficient to sustain operations or complete our planned activities for the upcoming year unless we raised additional funds. Upon the cancellation of the Ridgeway license, we resumed preclinical development. Our current cash level raises substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern. If we do not obtain additional funds, we may no longer be able to continue as a going concern and will cease operation which means that our shareholders will lose their entire investment. 

Critical Accounting Policies and Use of Estimates 

The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States requires management to make significant judgments and estimates that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of expenses during the reporting period. Management bases these significant judgments and estimates on historical experience and other assumptions it believes to be reasonable based upon information presently available. 

Recent Accounting Pronouncements 

There have not been any recent changes in accounting pronouncements and Accounting Standards Update (ASU) issued by the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) during the twelve months ended December 31, 2022 that are of significance or potential significance to the Company. 

Results of Operations 

Year Ended December 31, 2022 Compared to the Year Ended December 31, 2021 

Our results of operations have varied significantly from year to year and quarter to quarter and may vary significantly in the future. We did not have revenue during the years ending December 31, 2022 and 2021. We do not anticipate generating any revenues during 2023. Net loss for 2022 was approximately 1.0 million and net income for 2021 was approximately 2.7 million, resulting from the operational activities described below. 

Operating Expenses 

Operating expense totaled 0.7 million and 1.0 million during 2022 and 2021, respectively. The decrease in operating expenses is the result of the following factors.

Research and Development 

Research and development expenses totaled 0.2 million and 0.5 million for the years ended 2022 and 2021, respectively. The decrease of approximately 0.3 million, or 52 , for the year ended December 31, 2022 compared to the same period in 2021, was primarily due to decreased development expense. 

Our current research and development expenses currently consist primarily of consulting fees and development expense related to development of the adenosine A2R antagonists and preparation for an IND filing. 

General and Administrative 

General and administrative expenses totaled 0.4 million and 0.5 million during 2022 and 2021, respectively. The decrease of approximately 0.1 million, or 20 , in 2022 compared to 2021 was primarily due to decreased professional fees, director compensation and corporate communications. 

Our general and administrative expenses currently consist primarily of expenditures related to legal, accounting and tax, other professional services, and general operating expenses. 

Other Income (Expense) 

Other income (expense) totaled approximately 0.3 million of expense and 3.7 million of income for 2022 and 2021, respectively.

Gain (loss) on change in fair value of derivative liability 

As a result of a change in the fair value of our derivative liability, we realized loss of 0.3 million and gain of 3.7 million during the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. The change in the fair value of our derivative liability was the result of our convertible debentures and notes issued in September 2017, July 2018, December 2018, July 2019, October 2019, November 2019, March 2020, October 2020, January 2021 and June 2021, where we issued convertible notes with variable conversion rates, and to the issuance of our Series F preferred stock in October 2020, which is convertible into a variable number of shares of common stock. Refer to Note 7 in our Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion on our derivative liability. 

Gain on conversion of debt 

There was a loss on conversion of debt of approximately 0.02 million during the year ended December 31, 2022, with a gain of approximately 1.1 million during the year ended December 31, 2021. Gain on conversion of debt results from the difference between the fair value of common stock issued upon conversion and the carrying amount of the debt converted. 

Interest income (expense) 

We had 0.1 million net interest expense in 2022, compared to 1.1 million of expense in 2021. The decrease of 1.0 million was attributable to a decrease in the cost associated with derivative instruments issued with a value in excess of proceeds received. 

30 

Liquidity and Capital Resources 

We have incurred losses since our inception in 2003 as a result of significant expenditures for operations and research and development and the lack of any approved products to generate revenue. We have an accumulated deficit of approximately 65.3 million as of December 31, 2022 and anticipate that we will continue to incur additional losses for the foreseeable future. Through December 31, 2022, we have funded our operations through the private sale of our equity securities, convertible debt and exercise of options and warrants, resulting in gross proceeds of 39.1 million. Cash at December 31, 2022 was approximately 5,000. 

Our auditors report on our December 31, 2022 financial statements expressed an opinion that our capital resources as of the date of their Audit Report were not sufficient to sustain operations or complete our planned activities for the upcoming year unless we raised additional funds. Based on our current level of expected operating expenditures, we expect to be able to fund our operations into the first quarter of 2023. This assumes that we spend minimally on general operations and only continue conducting our ongoing clinical trials, and that we do not encounter any unexpected events or other circumstances that could shorten this time period. If we do not obtain additional funds by such time, we may no longer be able to continue as a going concern and will cease operation which means that our shareholders will lose their entire investment. 

We are actively seeking sources of financing to fund our continued operations and research and development programs. To raise additional capital, we may sell equity or debt securities, or enter into collaborative, strategic and/or licensing transactions. There can be no assurance that we will be able to complete any financing transaction in a timely manner or on acceptable terms or otherwise. If we are not able to raise additional cash, we may be forced to further delay, curtail, or cease development of our product candidates, or cease operations altogether.

ITEM 9A. 
 CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES 

Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures 

Our management, which consists only of our Principal Executive Officer and Principal Accounting Officer (who is also our Principal Executive Officer), has evaluated the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act) as of December 31, 2022. Based on that evaluation, management concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures as of December 31, 2022 were ineffective in ensuring that information required to be disclosed by us in reports that we file or submit under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the Securities and Exchange Commission s rules and forms. 

Inherent Limitations Over Internal Controls 

The Company s internal control over financial reporting is designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles GAAP ). The Company s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that: 

(i) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the Company s assets; 

(ii) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with GAAP, and that the Company s receipts and expenditures are being made only in accordance with authorizations of the Company s management and directors; and 

(iii) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the Company s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements. 

Management, which consists only of our Principal Executive Officer and Principal Accounting Officer (who is also our Principal Executive Officer), does not expect that the Company s internal controls will prevent or detect all errors and all fraud. A control system, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the objectives of the control system are met. Further, the design of a control system must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints, and the benefits of controls must be considered relative to their costs. Because of the inherent limitations in all control systems, no evaluation of internal controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues and instances of fraud, if any, have been detected. Also, any evaluation of the effectiveness of controls in future periods are subject to the risk that those internal controls may become inadequate because of changes in business conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. 

32 

Management s Annual Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting 

The Company s management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rule 13a-15(f) under the Exchange Act). Management conducted an assessment of the effectiveness of the Company s internal control over financial reporting based on the criteria set forth in Internal Control Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (2013). Based on the Company s assessment, management has concluded, that due to limited resources and limited number of employees, its internal control over financial reporting was ineffective as of December 31, 2022 to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements in accordance with GAAP. To mitigate the current limited resources and employees, we rely heavily on direct management oversight of transactions, along with the use of legal and accounting professionals. As we grow, we expect to increase the number of employees, which would enable us to implement adequate segregation of duties within the internal control framework. 

Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting 

There were no changes in the Company s internal control over financial reporting during the fourth quarter of 2022, which were identified in connection with management s evaluation required by paragraph (d) of rules 13a-15 and 15d-15 under the Exchange Act that has materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, the Company s internal control over financial reporting. 

This annual report does not include an attestation report of the Company s independent registered public accounting firm regarding internal control over financial reporting. Management s report was not subject to attestation by the Company s independent registered public accounting firm pursuant to the rules of the SEC that permit smaller reporting companies to provide only the management s report in this annual report.

Section 16(a) Beneficial Ownership Reporting Compliance 

Section 16(a) of the Exchange Act requires our officers, directors, and stockholders owning more than ten percent of our common stock, to file reports of ownership and changes in ownership with the SEC and to furnish us with copies of such reports. Based solely on our review of Form 3, 4 and 5 s, the following table provides information regarding any of the reports which were filed late during the fiscal year ended December 31, 2022: 

N/A 

Limitation on Liability and Indemnification of Directors and Officers 

Our certificate of incorporation states that, to the fullest extent permitted by the Delaware General Corporate Law, or the DGCL, no director shall be personally liable to us or our stockholders for monetary damages for breach of fiduciary duty as director; provided, however, that this provision eliminating personal liability of a director shall not eliminate or limit the liability of a director (i) for any breach of the director s duty of loyalty to us or our stockholders, (ii) for acts or omissions not in good faith or which involve intentional misconduct or a knowing violation of law, (iii) under section 174 of the DGCL, or (iv) for any transaction from which the director derived an improper personal benefit. 

Section 174 of the DGCL provides, among other things, that a director who willfully and negligently approves of an unlawful payment of dividends or an unlawful stock purchase or redemption may be held liable for such actions. A director who was either absent when the unlawful actions were approved or dissented at the time, may avoid liability by causing his or her dissent to such actions to be entered in the books containing the minutes of the meetings of the board of directors at the time the action occurred or immediately after the absent director receives notice of the unlawful acts. 

Our certificate of incorporation and bylaws provide that we will indemnify our directors and officers and may indemnify our employees or agents to the fullest extent permitted by law against liabilities and expenses incurred in connection with litigation in which they may be involved because of their offices or positions with us. However, nothing in our certificate of incorporation or bylaws protects or indemnifies a director, officer, employee or agent against any liability to which that person would otherwise be subject by reason of willful misfeasance, bad faith, gross negligence or reckless disregard of the duties involved in the conduct of that person s office or position. To the extent that a director has been successful in defending any proceeding brought against him, the Delaware General Corporation Law provides that the director shall be indemnified against reasonable expenses incurred by him in connection with the proceeding. 

Diversity of Board of Directors 

We do not have a formal policy with regard to the consideration of diversity in identifying director nominees, but the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee strives to nominate Directors with a variety of complementary skills so that, as a group, the board of directors will possess the appropriate talent, skills, and expertise to oversee our businesses. 

Code of Ethics 

We have adopted a Code of Ethics that applies to our principal executive officer, principal financial officer, principal accounting officer or controller, or persons performing similar functions. A copy of our code is attached to this Annual Report as Exhibit 14.01.

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING 
 FIRM 

To
the Board of Directors and Stockholders of 

 Rebus
Holdings, Inc. and subsidiaries 

Opinion
on the Consolidated Financial Statements 

We
have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheet of Rebus Holdings, Inc. and subsidiaries (the Company) as of December 31, 2022,
and the related consolidated statements of operations, stockholders deficit, and cash flows for the year ended December 31, 2022,
and the related notes schedule (collectively referred to as the consolidated financial statements). In our opinion, the consolidated
financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of December 31, 2022 and the
results of its operations and its cash flows for the year ended December 31, 2022, in conformity with accounting principles generally
accepted in the United States of America. 

The
Company's Ability to Continue as a Going Concern 

The
accompanying consolidated financial statements have been prepared assuming the Company will continue as a going concern. As discussed
in Note 2 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements, the Company has not yet generated any significant revenue, has incurred
recurring losses from operations, generated negative cash flows from operating activities and had an accumulated deficit that raises
substantial doubt about the Company s ability to continue as a going concern. Management's evaluation of the events and conditions
and management s plans in regarding these matters are also described in Note 2. The consolidated financial statements do not include
any adjustments that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty. 

Basis
for Opinion 

These
consolidated financial statements are the responsibility of the Company s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion
on the Company s financial statements based on our audit. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting
Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB) and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal
securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. 

We
conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain
reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. The Company
is not required to have, nor were we engaged to perform, an audit of its internal control over financial reporting. As part of our audit,
we are required to obtain an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion
on the effectiveness of the Company s internal control over financial reporting. Accordingly, we express no such opinion. 

Our
audit included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or
fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding
the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audit also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant
estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe that our audit provide
a reasonable basis for our opinion. 

Critical
Audit Matters 

The
critical audit matters are matters arising from the current period audit of the financial statements that were communicated or required
to be communicated to the audit committee and that: (1) relate to accounts or disclosures that are material to the financial statements
and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of critical audit matters does not alter
in any way our opinion on the consolidated financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit
matters below, providing separate opinions on the critical audit matters or on the accounts or disclosures to which they relate. 

Valuation
of Derivative Liabilities 

As
described in Note 7 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company measures fair value of derivative liabilities at fair value
using level three inputs. To determine fair value of derivative liabilities, the Company determines the appropriate valuation methodology
and assumptions, including unobservable inputs. The derivative liabilities are measured at fair value using a Black-Scholes valuation
model that uses significant assumptions, including the Company s stock price, historical volatility of the Company s shares,
risk-free interest rate and probability of conversion occurrence through maturity. 

Auditing
management s estimate for the fair value of derivative liabilities was complex and highly judgmental as it involved our assessment
of the significant assumptions used by management because the fair value calculations were sensitive to changes in assumptions described
above, and certain inputs used in the determination of fair values were based on unobservable data, including, but not limited to, the
historical volatility and probability of conversion. 

To
test the fair value of derivative liabilities, we performed audit procedures that included, among others, evaluating the methodologies
used in the valuation model and the significant assumptions used by the Company. 

/s/ 

We have served as the Company s auditor since 2022.

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM 

To the Stockholders
and Board of Directors of:

Inc. 

Opinion on
the Financial Statements 

We
have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheet of Rebus Holdings, Inc. and Subsidiaries (the Company as of December
31, 2021, the related consolidated statements of operations, changes in stockholders deficit and cash flows for the year ended
December 31, 2021, and the related notes (collectively referred to as the consolidated financial statements ). In our opinion,
the consolidated financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of December
31, 2021, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for the year ended December 31, 2021 in conformity with accounting principles
generally accepted in the United States of America. 

Explanatory
Paragraph Going Concern 

The
accompanying consolidated financial statements have been prepared assuming that the Company will continue as a going concern. As discussed
in Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company has incurred losses since inception and has generated no revenues. The
Company has a working capital deficit and an accumulated deficit. These factors raise substantial doubt about the Company s ability
to continue as a going concern. Management s plans in regard to these matters are described in Note 2. The consolidated financial
statements do not include any adjustments that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty 

Basis for Opinion 

These

We
conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain
reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud.
The Company is not required to have, nor were we engaged to perform, an audit of its internal controls over financial reporting. As part
of our audit, we are required to obtain an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, but not for the purpose of expressing
an opinion on the effectiveness of the Company s internal control over financial reporting. Accordingly, we express no such opinion. 

Our
audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements, whether
due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence
regarding the amounts and disclosures in the consolidated financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles
used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall consolidated financial statement presentation. We
believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.

 NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 

 DECEMBER 31, 2022 AND 2021 

Our ability to execute the business plan is contingent upon our ability to raise the necessary funds. During March 2020, we sold approximately of debt securities and in October 2020, we sold of debt securities for cash. In January 2021, we sold an additional of debt securities for cash and in June 2021, we sold an additional of debt securities for cash. We are currently using such funds to maintain our SEC reporting requirements, pay legal accounting and other professional fees, and to retain consultants and other personnel to develop the adenosine A2R antagonists and in preparation for an IND filing related to our unique delivery platform and portfolio of adenosine A2R antagonists for the treatment of certain solid tumors. Should we fail to further raise sufficient funds to execute our business plan, our priority would be to maintain our intellectual property portfolio and seek business development opportunities with potential development partners and/or acquirors. 

Adoption of Agreement and Plan of Merger and Consummation of Reorganization 

On September 28, 2021 the Company entered into an Agreement and Plan of Merger (the Merger Agreement to implement a holding company reorganization, which became effective on October 11, 2021 at 5:00 p.m. Eastern Time (the Effective Time ). The Merger Agreement was entered into by and among Inspyr Therapeutics, Inc., Rebus Holdings, Inc., and Rebus Sub, Inc., a wholly-owned subsidiary of Rebus Holdings which has resulted in Rebus becoming the direct parent company of Inspyr Therapeutics and replacing Inspyr Therapeutics as the public company trading on the OTC Markets OTC (the Reorganization ). Further, the Company began trading under the symbol RBSH on November 9, 2021. 

Upon consummation of the Reorganization (and the Reverse Stock Split as defined below), Inspyr stockholders automatically became stockholders of Rebus Holdings, on a one-for-one basis, with the same number and approximate ownership percentage of shares of the same class as they held in Inspyr immediately prior to the Effective Time. The Reorganization was intended to be a tax-free transaction for U.S. federal income tax purposes for Inspyr stockholders. 

As a result of the Reorganization, Rebus Holdings became the successor issuer to Inspyr Therapeutics pursuant to Rule 12g-3(a) of the Exchange Act, and as a result, shares of Rebus Holdings Common Stock are deemed registered under Section 12(g) of the Exchange Act as the Common Stock of the successor issuer. 

Reverse Stock Split 

On September 1, 2021, the Board of Directors approved a one-for-seventy-five reverse stock split of the Company s Common Stock Reverse Stock Split ). The Reverse Stock Split became effective with the Secretary of State of Delaware as of 4:59 p.m. Eastern Time on October 5, 2021, and the Company began trading on a post Reverse Stock Split basis at the market open on October 12, 2021. As a result of the Reverse Stock Split, each of the holders of the Company s Common Stock received one (1) new share of Common Stock for every seventy-five (75) shares such shareholder held immediately prior. No fractional shares were issued as a result of the Reverse Stock Split. Any fractional shares that would have otherwise resulted from the Reverse Stock Split will be rounded up to the next whole number of shares. The Reverse Stock Split also affected the Company s outstanding stock options, warrants and other exercisable or convertible instruments and resulted in the shares underlying such instruments being reduced and the exercise price being increased proportionately to the Reverse Stock Split ratio. All share and per share data have been retroactively restated in the accompanying consolidated financial statements and footnotes for all periods presented to reflect the effects of the Reverse Stock Split. 

Post Reverse Stock Split and Reorganization Information 

The Company began trading on post Reverse Stock Split and Reorganization basis on the Pink Sheets of the OTC Markets Group on October 12, 2021. The symbol remained NSPX until November 9, 2021, at which time the Company began trading under the symbol RBSH. 

The officers and members of the Board of Inspyr became the officers and members of the board of directors of the Rebus Holdings. 

Pursuant to the Reorganization, Rebus Holdings has, on a consolidated basis, the same assets, businesses, and operations as Inspyr Therapeutics had immediately prior to the Reorganization. 

Termination of License Agreement 

On October 5, 2020, the Company entered into an agreement with Ridgeway Termination Agreement whereby the parties terminated the licensing agreement previously entered into on August 3, 2018 Licensing Agreement ), The Company had previously licensed certain technologies related to targeting adenosine receptor antagonists for the treatment of cancer (the Licensed Assets ). As a result of the Termination Agreement, the Company reacquired full ownership and worldwide rights to all of the Licensed Assets as well as any improvements made thereto. 

In exchange for entering into the Termination Agreement, the Company issued to Ridgeway: (i) shares Common Stock, and (ii) shares of Series F 0 Convertible Preferred Stock Series F Preferred Stock ). Additionally, the Company paid approximately of Ridgeway s expenses and costs. 

Pursuant to the Certificate of Designation of the Series F Preferred Stock, each share of Series F Preferred Stock has a stated value of 10.00 per share and is convertible into Common Stock at any time at the election of the holder. In the aggregate, all of the Series F Preferred Stock issued to Ridgeway is convertible into such number of shares of Common Stock equal to eighty percent (80 of the issued and outstanding shares of Common Stock, post-conversion, on the conversion date (taking into effect any forward or reverse stock splits or consolidations). The Series F Preferred Stock votes on an as if converted to Common Stock basis. Additionally, upon the Company s outstanding Convertible Debentures (as such term is defined in the Certificate of Designation) being terminated, converted, or otherwise extinguished, the Series F Preferred Stock will automatically convert into Common Stock. 

Pursuant to the Termination Agreement, in the event that the Company is unable to secure equity financing resulting in aggregate gross proceeds to the Company of at least by October 5, 2023, or in the event that the Company ceases its operations, then the Termination Agreement will be deemed terminated and the Licensing Agreement will be reinstated in exchange for the return of the Common Shares and Series F Preferred Stock previously issued to Ridgeway. 

As a result of the issuance of the Common Shares and Series F Preferred Stock, Ridgeway became the owner of approximately of the Company s issued and outstanding Common Stock as of the termination date. Furthermore, by virtue of the issuance of the Series F Preferred Stock, Ridgeway will vote its Series F Preferred Stock on an as if converted to Common Stock basis which shall be equal to eighty percent (80 of the issued and outstanding Common Stock post-conversion. Accordingly, the Board of Directors determined that a change in control of the registrant had occurred. The Company did not have a prior relationship with Ridgeway, or any of its principals, except pursuant to the terms contained in the Termination Agreement and its previous relationship under the Licensing Agreement. 

million and we have an accumulated deficit of 65
 million as of December 31, 2022. We anticipate incurring additional losses for the foreseeable future until such time,
if ever, that we can generate significant sales from our therapeutic product candidates which are currently in development or we
enter into cash flow positive business development transactions. 

To date, we have generated no sales or revenues, have incurred significant losses and expect to incur significant additional losses as we advance our product candidates through development. Consequently, our operations are subject to all the risks inherent in the establishment of a pre-revenue business enterprise as well as those risks associated with a company engaged in the research and development of pharmaceutical compounds. 

Our cash balances at December 31, 2022 were approximately , representing of our total assets. Based on our current expected level of operating expenditures, and including that we raised in January 2021 and that we raised in June 2021, pursuant to the sale of our senior convertible debentures, we expect to be able to fund our operations into the first quarter of 2023. We will require additional cash to fund and continue our operations beyond that point. This period could be shortened if there are any unanticipated increases in planned spending on development programs or other unforeseen events. We anticipate raising additional funds through public or private sales of debt or equity securities, or some combination thereof. There is no assurance that any such financing will be available when needed in order to allow us to continue our operations, or if available, on terms favorable or acceptable to us. 

In the event additional financing is not obtained, we may pursue cost cutting measures as well as explore the sale of assets to generate additional funds. If we are required to significantly reduce operating expenses and delay, reduce the scope of, or eliminate any of our development programs or clinical trials, these events could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, and financial condition. These factors raise substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern. The consolidated financial statements do not include any adjustments relating to recoverability and classification of recorded asset amounts or the amounts and classification of liabilities that might be necessary should we be unable to continue as a going concern. 

Our current cash level raises substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern past the fourth quarter of 2022. If we do not obtain additional funds by such time, we may no longer be able to continue as a going concern and will cease operation which means that our shareholders will lose their entire investment.

Legal Matters 

The Company is subject at times to legal proceedings and claims, which arise in the ordinary course of its business. Although occasional adverse decisions or settlements may occur, the Company believes that the final disposition of such matters should not have a material adverse effect on its financial position, results of operations or liquidity. 

Uncertainty Due to Geopolitical Events 

Due to Russia s invasion of Ukraine, which
began in February 2022, and the resulting sanctions and other actions against Russia and Belarus, there has been uncertainty and
disruption in the global economy. Although the Russian war against Ukraine did not have a material adverse impact on the Company s
financial results for the year ended December 31, 2022, at this time the Company is unable to fully assess the aggregate impact
the Russian war against Ukraine will have on its business due to various uncertainties, which include, but are not limited to, the duration
of the war, the war s effect on the economy, its impact to the business of the Company, and actions that may be taken by governmental
authorities related to the war. 

COVID-19 Uncertainty 

On March 11, 2020, the World Health Organization declared a pandemic related to the rapidly spreading coronavirus (COVID-19) outbreak, which has led to a global health emergency. The extent of the public-health impact of the outbreak is currently unknown and rapidly evolving, and the related health crisis could adversely affect the global economy, resulting in an economic downturn. Any disruption of the Company s facilities or those of our suppliers could likely adversely impact the Company s operations. At this time, there is significant uncertainty relating to the potential effect of the novel coronavirus on our business.

Mr. Silvestre, our CEO since August 16, 2021, is a principal of Silvestre Law Group, P.C.

million of net operating loss carryforwards NOL at December 31, 2022, of which million will In addition, the Company has research and development tax credits of approximately at December 31, 2022 available to offset future taxable income, which will We have provided a 100 valuation allowance for the deferred tax benefits resulting from the net operating loss carryover and our tax credits due to our lack of earnings history. In addressing the realizability of deferred tax assets, management considers whether it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. The ultimate realization of deferred tax assets is dependent upon the generation of future taxable income during the periods in which those temporary differences are deductible. The valuation allowance decreased by approximately million and increased by approximately for the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. Significant components of deferred tax assets and liabilities are as follows (in thousands): 

Stock-based compensation 

- 

Accrued compensation 

Other 

Tax credits 

Total deferred tax assets 

Less: valuation allowance 

() 

() 
 
 Net deferred tax assets 

- 

- 

The above NOL carryforward may be subject to an annual limitation under Section 382 and 383 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, and similar state provisions if the Company experienced one or more ownership changes which would limit the amount of NOL carryforward that can be utilized to offset future taxable income. In general, an ownership change, as defined by Section 382 and 383, results from transactions increasing ownership of certain stockholders or public groups in the stock of the corporation by more than 50 percentage points over a three-year period. The Company has not completed an IRC Section 382/383 analysis. If a change in ownership were to have occurred, NOL carryforwards could be eliminated or restricted. If eliminated, the related asset would be removed from the deferred tax asset schedule with a corresponding reduction in the valuation allowance. Due to the existence of the valuation allowance, limitations created by future ownership changes, if any, will not impact the Company s effective tax rate. 

The actual tax benefit differs from the expected tax benefit for the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021 (computed by applying the U.S. Federal Corporate tax rate of 21 to income before taxes) are as follows:
