the Depository Trust Clearing Corporation (DTCC) has declined to facilitate or process the distribution of the Shibu Inu Tokens
to GTII shareholders holding shares in CEDE Co, which is a substantial portion of GTII s outstanding common shares. The Company,
in preparation for the distribution of this digital dividend, purchased one billion Shibu Inu Tokens and set them aside to be distributed.

of the digital dividend to all shareholders who opened a digital wallet on beyondblockchain, or other digital platforms, including Etherium
and Bitcoin. There is currently no method of passing these tokens through to brokerage account holders to match out transfer agent records

process of evaluating whether or not to appeal FINRA s decision. In the meantime, the distribution of tokens will not be undertaken

Kansas, and accounts receivables from two companies operating in Brazil in the amounts of 3,600,000 and 3,600,000 respectively. TTII
Oil Gas, Inc. also purchased three promissory notes in the amounts of 100,000, 100,000 and 350,000, as well an overdue contract
for revenue in the amount of 1,000,000. Finally, a gun sight patent was also acquired from Century Technologies, Inc. All accounts and
notes receivable were deemed uncollectable due to the age and circumstances, and therefore were assessed no value in the asset purchase.
The equity ownerships were also deemed to be impaired due to the inactive nature of the entities and were not allocated any value. The
gun sight patent was also not readily assessable as to value and no purchase price was allocated to this asset. Also, due to the mechanic s
lien and lawsuit on the oil leases, as well as the absence of an official reserve report, the oil lease was also impaired, and no value
was recorded for this asset. In September 2015, the Chautauqua County Court decided that American Resource Technologies Inc. management
and Board of Directors improperly acted and rendered the original Agreement a nullity. During 2019, the Company removed additional obligations
related to the ARUR acquisition and settled legal fees due. During the 2 nd quarter 2020, the Company was successful in recalling
the 4,668,530 shares and cancelling them from the shareholders list.

On
February 3, 2017, the Company filed suit in Eastern District Federal Court New York against American Resource Technologies, Inc., (ARUR)
and several directors and officers relating to the Chautauqua County Court Kansas decision nullifying the acquisition Agreement of ARUR.
The Company has made several attempts to recover the shares of GTII stock paid to ARUR for the asset acquisition and the various costs
and expenses expended by GTII in fulfillment of its obligations under the contract with ARUR. The failure of non-litigation attempts
to resolve the matter resulted in filing an action for declaratory judgment in the US District Court for the Eastern District of New
York, Docket No. 17-CV-0698. The case was subsequently withdrawn due to the close of ARUR operations. During the 2 nd quarter
2020, the Company was successful in recalling the 4,668,530 shares and cancelling them from the shareholders list. 

On

Kong, with GoFun Group, Ltd. through its wholly owned subsidiary Go F B Holdings, Ltd. GoFun Group, Ltd. is a privately held company
running a casual dining restaurant business, based in Hong Kong. Subsequent to the agreement being signed, GoFun Group failed to substantially
perform under the agreement, including, but not limited to providing audited financials of its assets, making the ongoing payments called
for in the agreement, along with other matters that led Global Tech to initiate litigation in the United States. Currently, Global Tech
and GoFun are litigating the matter in the U.S District Court for the Southern District of New York, Docket No.17-CV-03727 . On October
2, 2019, the Company was able to secure, via preliminary settlement, the return of 43,649,491 shares of the Company s stock out

to the Company s treasury and cancelled. On May 14, 2021, the Superior Court of New Jersey, Chancery Division: Monmouth County
(docket no. PAS-MON-C-60-21) issued an order restraining the removal of restrictive legends on the remaining 7,000,000 shares of stock,
pending further order of the New Jersey Court. The underlying matter currently in the U.S. district Court for the Southern District of
New York, remains pending. The Company and GoFun have mutually agreed to resolve the matter and the respective counsels are currently
working toward that goal.

Cautionary
Statements 

This
Form 10-K may contain forward-looking statements, as that term is used in federal securities laws, about Global Tech s
consolidated financial condition, results of operations and business. These statements include, among others: 

statements concerning the
 potential benefits that may be experienced from business activities and certain transactions contemplated or completed; and 

statements of our expectations,
 beliefs, future plans and strategies, anticipated developments and other matters that are not historical facts. These statements
 may be made expressly in this Form 10-K. You can find many of these statements by looking for words such as believes, 
 expects, anticipates, estimates, opines, or similar expressions used in this
 Form 10-K. These forward-looking statements are subject to numerous assumptions, risks and uncertainties that may cause our actual
 results to be materially different from any future results expressed or implied in those statements. The most important facts that
 could prevent us from achieving our stated goals include, but are not limited to, the following: 

a) 
 volatility or decline of
 Global Tech s stock price; 

b) 
 potential fluctuation of
 quarterly results; 

c) 
 failure to earn revenues
 or profits; 

d) 
 inadequate capital to continue
 or expand our business, and inability to raise additional capital or financing to implement our business plans; 

e) 
 failure to commercialize
 our technology or to make sales; 

f) 
 decline in demand for our
 products and services; 

g) 
 rapid adverse changes in
 markets; 

h) 
 litigation with or legal
 claims and allegations by outside parties against GTII, including but not limited to challenges to intellectual property rights; 

i) 
 insufficient revenues to
 cover operating costs; and 

J) 
 inability to make a business
 acquisition that is profitable for the Company and its shareholders. 

There
is no assurance that we will be profitable, we may not be able to successfully develop, manage or market our products and services, we
may not be able to attract and retain qualified executives and technology personnel, we may not be able to obtain customers for our products
or services, our products and services may become obsolete, government regulation may hinder our business, additional dilution in outstanding
stock ownership may be incurred due to the issuance of more shares, warrants and stock options, or the exercise of outstanding warrants
and stock options, and other risks inherent in our businesses. 

Because
the statements are subject to risks and uncertainties, actual results may differ materially from those expressed or implied by the forward-looking
statements. We caution you not to place undue reliance on the statements, which speak only as of the date of this Form 10-K. The cautionary
statements contained or referred to in this section should be considered in connection with any subsequent written or oral forward-looking
statements that we or persons acting on our behalf may issue. We do not undertake any obligation to review or confirm analysts

RESULTS
OF OPERATIONS 

Results
of Operations for the Year Ended December 31, 2022, compared to the Year Ended December 31, 2021: 

During
the 2022 year, we generated revenues of 0, compared to 24,120 for 2021. Our revenues reported were from our subsidiary Bronx from the
date of acquisition of December 30, 2021 through December 31, 2021. Our total operating expenses increased from 6,150,624 in 2021 to
 13,117,530 in 2022. The increase was primarily the result of the increase in stock-based compensation to our professionals. General
and administrative expenses increased from 237,093 in 2021 to 434,547 in 2022, an increase of 197,454, mostly due to the increase
in travel related expenses due to increased corporate activity. Compensation to officers, medical contributions and service fees to professionals
increased by 6,809,123, from 5,370,318 to 12,179,441 due mostly to the increase in share-based compensation, and medical benefits
for employees. Depreciation expense decreased by 1,303 to 1,697 from 3,000 the prior year. 

Our
net loss increased by 7,530,280 to 13,593,202 in 2022 from 6,062,922 in 2021, due to the increased stock-based compensation in 2021. 

LIQUIDITY
AND CAPITAL RESOURCES 

On
December 31, 2022, we had cash on hand of 3,320,164 compared to 359,143 on December 31, 2021,. We used cash in our operations of
 488,278 in 2022 compared to 655,623 in 2021, a 26 decrease. We (paid) raised net 151,821 and (109,512) from
related party loans in 2022 and 2021, respectively. We anticipate that we will have an increase in our cash flow from continuing
operations with the acquisition made during the year. We have sufficient cash on hand on December 31, 2022, to cover our
negative cash flow. We will attempt to increase our operating activities with our acquisition operations in 2023, and possibly raise
capital through the sale of our common stock or through debt financing. 

Some
of Global Tech s past due obligations, including 338,000 of accounts payable, and 113,000 of notes payable and judgments, were
incurred or obtained prior to 2005. No actions have been taken by any of the applicable creditors. Action by any such creditor would
materially decrease our liquidity. Global Tech has no credit facilities with which to resolve these outstanding obligations from prior
years but will attempt to fully resolve them upon a successful capital raise and monetary action of the business. This may have a negative
impact on our future. 

CONTRACTUAL
OBLIGATIONS 

The
Company has contractional obligations with numerous independent service providers. 

Going
Concern Qualification 

The
Company has incurred significant losses from operations, and such losses are expected to continue. The Company s has
included a Going Concern Qualification in their report for the year ended December 31, 2022. In addition, the Company has
net losses and negative working capital. The foregoing raises substantial doubt about the Company s ability to continue as a going
concern. Management s plans include seeking additional capital and/or debt financing. There is no guarantee that additional capital
and/or debt financing will be available when and to the extent required, or that if available, it will be on terms acceptable to the
Company. The financial statements do not include any adjustments that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty. The Going
Concern Qualification may make it substantially more difficult to raise capital.

Potential
Impact of COVID-19 

The
Company is concerned that the COVID-19 virus may impact the Company s ability to raise additional equity capital due to the uncertainty
of the virus effects on the economy and capital markets, which may make potential investors less likely to invest during the pandemic.
This may affect the Company s ability to raise equity capital to meet its financial obligations, implement its business plan and
continue as a going concern. 

Off-Balance
Sheet Arrangements 

We
have no off-balance sheet arrangements. 

Critical
Accounting Policies and Estimates 

Our
discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements, which
have been prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. These principles require us to make estimates and
judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue and expenses, cash flow and related disclosure of contingent
assets and liabilities. Our estimates include those related to revenue recognition, accounts receivable reserves, income and other taxes,
stock-based compensation and equipment and contingent obligations. We base our estimates on historical experience and on various other
assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances. Actual results may differ from these estimates. To the extent that
there are material differences between these estimates and our actual results, our future financial statements will be affected. 

We
define our critical accounting policies as those U.S. generally accepted accounting principles that require us to make
subjective estimates about matters that are uncertain and are likely to have a material impact on our financial condition and results
of operations as well as the specific way, we apply those principles. Our estimates are based upon assumptions and judgments about matters
that are highly uncertain at the time the accounting estimate is made and applied and require us to continually assess a range of potential
outcomes. A detailed discussion of the critical accounting policies that most affect our Company is in Footnote 2 of the notes to our
financial statements.

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING
FIRM 

To
the Board of Directors and Stockholders of 

Global
Tech Industries Group, Inc. 

Opinion
on the Consolidated Financial Statements 

We
have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Global Tech Industries Group, Inc. (the Company) as of December 31, 2021
and the related consolidated statements of operations, changes in stockholders equity (deficit) and cash flows for the year then
ended, and the related notes (collectively referred to as the consolidated financial statements). In our opinion, the consolidated financial
statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of December 31, 2021 and the results of
its operations and its cash flows for the year then ended, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United
States of America. 

Consideration
of the Company s Ability to Continue as a Going Concern 

The
accompanying consolidated financial statements have been prepared assuming that the Company will continue as a going concern. As discussed
in Note 1, the Company has incurred significant accumulated deficits, recurring operating losses and a negative working capital. This
and other factors raise substantial doubt about the Company s ability to continue as a going concern. Management s plans
in regard to these matters are also discussed in Note 1. The consolidated financial statements do not include any adjustments that might
result from the outcome of this uncertainty. 

Basis
for Opinion 

These
consolidated financial statements are the responsibility of the Company s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion
on the Company s consolidated financial statements based on our audit. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public
Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company
in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission
and the PCAOB. 

We
conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain
reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud.
The Company is not required to have, nor were we engaged to perform, an audit of its internal control over financial reporting. As part
of our audit, we are required to obtain an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, but not for the purpose of expressing
an opinion on the effectiveness of the Company s internal control over financial reporting. Accordingly, we express no such opinion. 

Our
audit included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements, whether due
to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence
regarding the amounts and disclosures in the consolidated financial statements. Our audit also included evaluating the accounting principles
used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe
that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion. 

Critical
Audit Matters 

The
critical audit matter communicated below are matters arising from the current period audit of the consolidated financial statements that
were communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that: (1) relate to accounts or disclosures that are material
to the consolidated financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication
of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion on the consolidated financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are
not, by communicating the critical audit matters below, providing separate opinions on the critical audit matters or on the accounts
or disclosures to which they relate. 

Stock
for Services 

As
described in Note 9 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company issued common stock for services. Management establishes their
estimate for the value of the stock for services using historical stock price information. 

The
principal considerations for our determination that performing procedures relating to stock for services is a critical audit matter are
due to the material impact it has on the consolidated financial statements. 

Addressing
the matter involved performing procedures and evaluating audit evidence in connection with forming our overall opinion on the consolidated
financial statements. These procedures included, among others, evaluating the reasonableness of the historical stock price information
used by management to determine the expense related to stock for services.

CORPORATE
HISTORY 

B) 
 GOING CONCERN 

The
accompanying consolidated financial statements have been prepared assuming that the Company will continue as a going concern. The Company
incurred a net loss of during the fiscal year ended December 31, 2022, and has an accumulated deficit of at December
31, 2022. 

The
Company did not generate significant revenues during the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, and its cash flows are not sufficient
enough to support all expenses of the Company. The Company as yet still requires substantial financing. Most of the financing has been
provided by David Reichman, the Chief Executive Officer and Chairman. The Company is dependent upon his ability and willingness to continue
to provide the financing necessary to meet reporting and filing requirements of a public company. 

However, in order for the Company to remain a going concern, it will need to generate
significant cashflow to sustain the needs of the Company, financially, and it may be required to continue to receive funds from equity
or debt financing to accomplish this need. There can be no assurance that the Company will continue to receive any proceeds from equity
offerings or that the Company will be able to obtain the necessary funds to finance its operations. These conditions raise substantial
doubt about its ability to continue as a going concern. The financial statements do not include any adjustments that might result from
the outcome of this uncertainty. 

On
March 11, 2020, the World Health Organization declared the outbreak of a coronavirus (COVID-19) a pandemic. As a result, economic uncertainties
have arisen which have the potential to negatively impact the Company s ability to raise funding from the markets. Other financial
impact could occur though such potential impact is unknown at this time.

in revenue from its subsidiary Bronx Family Eye Care from December 30, 2021 through December 31, 2021, the period
that Bronx s activity was consolidated with the Company. The Company
recognizes revenues in accordance with ASC 606 Revenue from Contracts with Customers. Revenue is recognized as services are rendered
or when control of our products is transferred to our customers in an amount that reflects the consideration the Company expects to be
entitled to in exchange for those services or products. The Company considers revenue earned when all the following criteria are met:
(i) the contract with the customer has been identified, (ii) the performance obligations have been identified, (iii) the transaction
price has been determined, (iv) the transaction price has been allocated to the performance obligations, and (v) the performance obligations
have been satisfied. Bronx s performance obligation is completed once the eye exam or other services are complete. The revenue
for the eyewear is recorded once the eyewear has been delivered to the patient. All services and products sold are recorded as revenue
at the pre-determined and agreed upon price, and once the services are performed and the products have been delivered. Service fees and
the delivery of eyewear products may happen at different times and stages of our contracts with our customers. Revenues are recorded
at the completion of each stage of Bronx s deliverables.

and then sells the refined gold to its customers. 

Pursuant
to the SPA, of the GTI shares were exchanged for shares of the Company s common stock (acquisition date fair value
was ). GTI has met its performance obligations and this transaction closed in the second quarter of 2022. As per the table
below the License asset was valued at net of additional liabilities recorded on the closing date of the transaction
May 25, 2022.

acquisition of GTI is being treated as an asset purchase and not business combination per ASC 805 as substantially all of the assets
acquired are concentrated in a single identifiable asset . The following table summarizes the consideration transferred to

portion of GTII s outstanding common shares. The Company, in preparation for the distribution of this digital dividend, purchased
one billion Shibu Inu Tokens and set them aside to be distributed. It also sold its interest in www.beyondblockchain.us to Alt5
Sigma in anticipation of that company processing the distribution of the digital dividend to all shareholders who opened a digital wallet
on beyondblockchain, or other digital platforms, including Etherium and Bitcoin. There is currently no method of passing these tokens
through to brokerage account holders to match out transfer agent records and the company is of the opinion that DTCC should be able to
develop a process to distribute this dividend, and it is therefore in the process of evaluating whether or not to appeal FINRA s
decision. In the meantime, the distribution of tokens will not be undertaken at this time. 

On July 28, 2022 FINRA declined
to effectuate the Company s request to pay a digital dividend to its shareholders. FINRA determined that the Company action was
deficient because the Depository Trust Clearing Corporation (DTCC) is unable to process the digital dividend distribution to GTII
shareholders holding shares in CEDE Co, which is a substantial percentage of its shareholders.

On
February 3, 2017, the Company filed suit in Eastern District Federal Court New York against American Resource Technologies, Inc., (ARUR)
and several directors and officers relating to the Chautauqua County Court Kansas decision nullifying the acquisition Agreement of ARUR.
The Company has made several attempts to recover the shares of GTII stock paid to ARUR for the asset acquisition and the various costs
and expenses expended by GTII in fulfillment of its obligations under the contract with ARUR. The failure of non-litigation attempts
to resolve the matter resulted in filing an action for declaratory judgment in the US District Court for the Eastern District of New
York, Docket No. 17-CV-0698. The case was subsequently withdrawn due to the close of ARUR operations. During the 2 nd quarter
2020, the Company was successful in recalling the shares and cancelling them from the shareholders list.

ITEM
9A. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES 

Disclosure
controls and procedures are controls and other procedures that are designed to ensure that information we are required to disclose is
recorded, processed, summarized and reported, within the time periods specified in the rules and forms of the Commission. David Reichman,
our Chief Executive Officer and our Principal Accounting Officer, is responsible for establishing and maintaining our disclosure controls
and procedures. 

Under
the supervision and with the participation of our management, including the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, we have
evaluated the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) and Rule 15d-15(e) of the Exchange
Act) as of the end of the period covered by this report. The disclosure controls and procedures ensure that all information required
to be disclosed by us in the reports that we file or submit under the Exchange Act is: (i) recorded, processed, summarized and reported,
within the time periods specified in the SEC s rule and forms; and (ii) accumulated and communicated to our management as appropriate
to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. Based on that evaluation, management concluded that our controls were not effective
as of December 31, 2021. 

Management s
Annual Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting 

Our
management is responsible to establish and maintain adequate internal control over financial reporting. Our Chief Executive Officer and
Chief Financial Officer are responsible to design or supervise a process that provides reasonable assurance regarding the reliability
of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting
principles. The policies and procedures include: 

maintenance of records in reasonable detail to accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of assets, 

reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally
accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management
and directors, and 

reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of assets that could have
a material effect on our financial statements. 

Internal
control over financial reporting cannot provide absolute assurance of achieving financial reporting objectives because of its inherent
limitations, including the possibility of human error and circumvention by collusion or overriding of controls. Accordingly, even an
effective internal control system may not prevent or detect material misstatements on a timely basis. Also, projections of any evaluation
of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions or that
the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. 

For
the year ended December 31, 2022, our management has relied on the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO
- 2013), Internal Control - Integrated Framework, to evaluate the effectiveness of our internal control over financial
reporting. Based upon that framework, management concluded that our internal control over financial reporting had material weaknesses
and was not effective as of December 31, 2021. A material weakness is a deficiency, or combination thereof, in internal control over
financial reporting, such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of the Company s annual or interim
financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis. 

The
material weaknesses relate to the limited number of persons responsible for the recording and reporting of financial information, the
lack of separation of financial reporting duties, and the limited size of our management team in general. We are in the process of evaluating
methods of improving our internal control over financial reporting, including the possible addition of financial reporting staff and
the increased separation of financial reporting responsibility, and intend to implement such steps as are necessary and possible to correct
these material weaknesses. 

This
annual report does not include an attestation report of the Company s registered public accounting firm regarding internal control
over financial reporting. Management s report was not subject to attestation requirements by the company s registered public
accounting firm pursuant to temporary rules of the Securities and Exchange Commission that permit the company to provide only management s
report in this annual report.

Changes
in Internal Controls over Financial Reporting 

During
the year ended December 31, 2022, there was no significant change in our internal controls over financial reporting or in other factors
that materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal controls over financial reporting. 

Inherent
Limitations over Internal Controls 

GTII s
management does not expect that its disclosure controls or its internal control over financial reporting will prevent or detect all error
and all fraud. A control system, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that
the control system s objectives will be met. The design of a control system must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints,
and the benefits of controls must be considered relative to their costs. Further, because of the inherent limitations in all control
systems, no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that misstatements due to error or fraud will not occur or that all
control issues and instances of fraud, if any, within GTII have been detected. These inherent limitations include the realities that
judgments in decision making can be faulty and that breakdowns can occur because of simple error or mistake. Controls can also be circumvented
by the individual acts of some persons, by collusion of two or more people, or management override of the controls. The design of any
system of controls is based in part on certain assumptions about the likelihood of future events, and there can be no assurance that
any design will succeed in achieving its stated goals under all potential future conditions. Projections of any evaluation of controls
effectiveness to future periods are subject to risks. Over time, controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions or deterioration
in the degree of compliance with policies or procedures. 

Our
disclosure controls and procedures are designed to provide reasonable assurance of that our reports will be accurate. Our Chief Executive
Officer and Principal Accounting Officer concludes that our disclosure controls and procedures were not effective at that reasonable
assurance level, as of the end of the period covered by this Form 10-K due to the lack of sufficient segregation of duties and the lack
of appropriate personnel. The Company plans to address these material weaknesses as resources become available by hiring additional professional
staff, such as a Chief Financial Officer, as funding becomes available, outsourcing certain aspects of the recording and reporting functions,
and separating responsibilities. Our future reports shall also indicate that our disclosure controls and procedures are designed for
this reason and shall indicate the related conclusion by the Chief Executive Officer and Principal Accounting Officer as to their effectiveness.

Board
Leadership Structure and Role in Risk Oversight 

Although
we have not adopted a formal policy on whether the Chairman and Chief Executive Officer positions should be separate or combined, we
have determined that it is in the best interests of the Company and its shareholders for these positions to remain combined. However,
the board of directors has created the position of Vice-Chairman to secure the continuity of the chain of command in case one or all
the officers are unable to carry out their responsibilities for a period of time, and to further ensure that responsible management of
the company moves forward unhindered. 

Our
Board of Directors focuses on the most significant risks facing our company and our company s general risk management strategy,
and ensure that risks undertaken by our Company are consistent with the Board s appetite for risk. While the Board oversees our
company s risk management, management is responsible for day-to-day risk management processes. We believe this division of responsibilities
is the most effective approach for addressing the risks facing our company and that our Board leadership structure supports this approach. 

On
September 29, 2021, all officers and directors signed an acknowledgement of the Company s policy regarding avoidance of insider
trading. This policy seeks to prevent insider trading on material non-public information by any officers and directors. 

Limitation
of Liability and Indemnification of Officers and Directors 

Under
Nevada General Corporation Law and our articles of incorporation, our directors will have no personal liability to us or our stockholders
for monetary damages incurred as the result of the breach or alleged breach by a director of his duty of care. This provision
does not apply to the directors (i) acts or omissions that involve intentional misconduct or a knowing and culpable violation
of law, (ii) acts or omissions that a director believes to be contrary to the best interests of the corporation or our shareholders or
that involve the absence of good faith on the part of the director, (iii) approval of any transaction from which a director derives an
improper personal benefit, (iv) acts or omissions that show a reckless disregard for the director s duty to the corporation or
our shareholders in circumstances in which the director was aware, or should have been aware, in the ordinary course of performing a
director s duties, of a risk of serious injury to the corporation or our shareholders, (v) acts or omissions that constituted an
unexcused pattern of inattention that amounts to an abdication of the director s duty to the corporation or our shareholders, or
(vi) approval of an unlawful dividend, distribution, stock repurchase or redemption. This provision would generally absolve directors
of personal liability for negligence in the performance of duties, including gross negligence. 

The
effect of this provision in our articles of incorporation is to eliminate the rights of the Company and our stockholders (through stockholder s
derivative suits on behalf of the Company to recover monetary damages against a director for breach of his fiduciary duty of care as
a director (including breaches resulting from negligent or grossly negligent behavior) except in the situations described in clauses
(i) through (vi) above. This provision does not limit nor eliminate the rights of the Company or any stockholder to seek non-monetary
relief such as an injunction or rescission in the event of a breach of a director s duty of care. In addition, our Articles of
Incorporation provide that if Nevada law is amended to authorize the future elimination or limitation of the liability of a director,
then the liability of the directors will be eliminated or limited to the fullest extent permitted by the law, as amended. Nevada General
Corporation Law grants corporations the right to indemnify their directors, officers, employees and agents in accordance with applicable
law. Our bylaws provide for indemnification of such persons to the full extent allowable under applicable law. These provisions will
not alter the liability of the directors under federal securities laws. 

We
intend to enter into agreements to indemnify our directors and officers, in addition to the indemnification provided for in our bylaws.
These agreements, among other things, indemnify our directors and officers for certain expenses (including attorneys fees), judgments,
fines, and settlement amounts incurred by any such person in any action or proceeding, including any action by or in the right of the
Company, arising out of such person s services as a director or officer of the Company, any subsidiary of the Company or any other
company or enterprise to which the person provides services at the request of the Company. We believe that these provisions and agreements
are necessary to attract and retain qualified directors and officers.

Insofar
as indemnification for liabilities arising under the Securities Act may be permitted to directors, officers or persons controlling the
Company pursuant to the foregoing provisions, the Company has been informed that in the opinion of the Securities and Exchange Commission,
such indemnification is against public policy as expressed in the Securities Act and is therefore unenforceable.

ITEM
11. EXECUTIVE COMPENSATION. 

Compensation
Discussion and Analysis 

The
following Compensation Discussion and Analysis describes the material elements of compensation for our executive officers identified
in the Summary Compensation Table Named Executive Officers ), and executive officers that we may hire in the future. As
more fully described below, our board of directors approves all decisions for the total direct compensation of our executive officers,
including the Named Executive Officers brought forward by the Compensation Committee. 

Compensation
Program Objectives and Rewards 

Our
compensation philosophy is based on the premise of attracting, retaining, and motivating exceptional leaders, setting high goals, working
toward the common objectives of meeting the expectations of customers and stockholders, and rewarding outstanding performance. Following
this philosophy, in determining executive compensation, we consider all relevant factors, such as the competition for talent, our desire
to link pay with performance in the future, the use of equity to align executive interests with those of our stockholders, individual
contributions, teamwork and performance, and each executive s total compensation package. We strive to accomplish these objectives
by compensating all executives with total compensation packages consisting of a combination of competitive base salary and incentive
compensation. 

50 

 Table of Contents 

While
we have only hired two executives since inception because our business has not grown sufficiently to justify additional hires, we expect
to grow and hire in the future. To date, we have not applied a formal compensation program to determine the compensation of the Named
Executives Officers. In the future, as we and our management team expand, our board of directors expects to add independent members,
form a compensation committee comprised of independent directors, and apply the compensation philosophy and policies described in this
section of the Form 10-K. 

The
primary purpose of the compensation and benefits described below is to attract, retain, and motivate highly talented individuals when
we do hire, who will engage in the behaviors necessary to enable us to succeed in our mission while upholding our values in a highly
competitive marketplace. Different elements are designed to engender different behaviors, and the actual incentive amounts which may
be awarded to each Named Executive Officer are subject to the annual review of the board of directors. The following is a brief description
of the key elements of our planned executive compensation structure. 

Base
 salary and benefits are designed to attract and retain employees over time. 

Incentive
 compensation awards are designed to focus employees on the business objectives for a particular year. 

Equity
 incentive awards, such as stock options and non-vested stock, focus executives efforts on the behaviors within the recipients 
 control that they believe are designed to ensure our long-term success as reflected in increases to our stock prices over a period
 of several years, growth in our profitability and other elements. 

Severance
 and change in control plans are designed to facilitate a company s ability to attract and retain executives as we compete for
 talented employees in a marketplace where such protections are commonly offered. We currently have not given separation benefits
 to any of our Name Executive Officers. 

Benchmarking 

We
have not yet adopted benchmarking but may do so in the future. When making compensation decisions, our board of directors may compare
each element of compensation paid to our Named Executive Officers against a report showing comparable compensation metrics from a group
that includes both publicly-traded and privately-held companies. Our board believes that while such peer group benchmarks are a point
of reference for measurement, they are not necessarily a determining factor in setting executive compensation as each executive officer s
compensation relative to the benchmark varies based on scope of responsibility and time in the position. We have not yet formally established
our peer group for this purpose. 

The
Elements of David Reichman s and Kathy Griffin s Compensation Programs 

Base
Salary 

Executive
officer base salaries are based on job responsibilities and individual contribution. The board reviews the base salaries of our executive
officers, including our Named Executive Officers, considering factors such as corporate progress toward achieving objectives (without
reference to any specific performance-related targets) and individual performance experience and expertise. Additional factors reviewed
by the board of directors in determining appropriate base salary levels and raises include subjective factors related to corporate and
individual performance. For the year ended December 31, 2022, all executive officer base salary decisions were approved by the board
of directors. 

Our
board of directors determines base salaries for the Named Executive Officers at the beginning of each fiscal year, and the board proposes
new base salary amounts, if appropriate, based on its evaluation of individual performance and expected future contributions. We do not
have a 401(k) Plan, but if we adopt one in the future, base salary would be the only element of compensation that would be used in determining
the number of contributions permitted under the 401(k) Plan. 

51 

 Table of Contents 

Incentive
Compensation Awards 

The
Named Executives have not been paid bonuses and our board of directors has not yet established a formal compensation policy for the determination
of bonuses. If our revenue grows and bonuses become affordable and justifiable, we expect to use the following parameters in justifying
and quantifying bonuses for our Named Executive Officers and other officers of Global Tech Industries Group, Inc. (1) the growth in our
revenue, (2) the growth in our earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization, as adjusted EBITDA ), and
(3) our stock price. The board has not adopted specific performance goals and target bonus amounts for any of our fiscal years but may
do so in the future. 

Equity
Incentive Awards 

No
stock option awards have been made to any of our Named Executives or other officers or employees of Global Tech Industries Group, Inc.
under Omnibus Stock and Incentive Plan, which was subsequently cancelled. 

Benefits
and Prerequisites 

At
this stage of our business, we have limited benefits and no prerequisites for our employees. We do not have a 401(k) Plan but do have
a Profit-Sharing Plan Trust specifically earmarked as a retirement plan. This plan is funded by adding an amount as deemed appropriate
by the Board of Directors each year. We may adopt other plans and/or confer other fringe benefits for our executive officers in the future
if our business grows sufficiently to enable us to afford them. 

Separation
and Change in Control Arrangements 

We
have employment agreements with our Named Executive Officers. They are eligible for specific benefits or payments if their employment
or engagement terminates or if there is a change of control.

Pre-Approval
Policies and Procedures of Audit and Non-Audit Services of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm 

The
audit committee s policy is to pre-approve, typically at the beginning of our fiscal year, all audit and non-audit services, other
than de minimis non-audit services, to be provided by an independent registered public accounting firm. These services may include, among
others, audit services, audit-related services, tax services and other services and such services are generally subject to a specific
budget. The independent registered public accounting firm and management are required to periodically report to the full board of directors
regarding the extent of services provided by the independent registered public accounting firm in accordance with this pre-approval,
and the fees for the services performed to date. As part of the board s review, the board will evaluate other known potential engagements
of the independent auditor, including the scope of work proposed to be performed and the proposed fees, and approve or reject each service,
taking into account whether the services are permissible under applicable law and the possible impact of each non-audit service on the
independent auditor s independence from management. At audit committee meetings throughout the year, the auditor and management
may present subsequent services for approval. Typically, these would be services such as due diligence for an acquisition, that would
not have been known at the beginning of the year. 

The
audit committee has considered the provision of non-audit services provided by our independent registered public accounting firm to be
compatible with maintaining their independence. The audit committee will continue to approve all audit and permissible non-audit services
provided by our independent registered public accounting firm. 

As
of the date of this filing, our current policy is to not engage to provide, among other things, bookkeeping services, appraisal or valuation
services, or international audit services. The policy provides that we engage to provide audit, tax compliance, and other assurance services,
such as review of SEC reports or filings.

certifying the number of shares owned by said stockholder in such Corporation. 

(B)

email, facsimile, or other digital signature of the signatures of the officers or agents of the Corporation may be printed or lithographed
upon such certificate in lieu of the actual signatures.

though the person who signed such certificate or whose facsimile signature shall have been used thereon, had not ceased to be such officer
of the Corporation.

2.4
 Cancellation of Outstanding Certificates and Issuance of New Certificates: Order of Surrender: Penalties for Failure to Comply. 
All certificates surrendered to the Corporation for transfer shall be canceled and no new certificates shall be issued in lieu thereof
until the former certificate for a like number of shares shall have been surrendered and canceled, except as hereinafter provided with
respect to lost, stolen or destroyed certificates. When the certificate or Articles of Incorporation are amended in any way affecting
the statements contained in the certificates for outstanding shares, or it becomes desirable for any reason in the discretion of the
Board of Directors, to cancel any outstanding certificate or shares and issue a new certificate therefore conforming to the rights of
the holder, the Board of Directors may order any holders of outstanding certificates for shares to surrender and exchange them for new
certificates within a reasonable time to be fixed by the Board of Directors. The duty of surrender of any outstanding certificates may
also be enforced by action at law. 

2.5
 Lost, Stolen or Destroyed Certificates . Any stockholder claiming that his certificate for shares is lost, stolen or destroyed
may make an affidavit or affirmation of the fact and lodge the same with the Secretary of the Corporation, or if pursuant to Article
2.8, below, the Corporation s transfer agent, accompanied by a signed application for a new certificate. Thereupon, and upon the
giving of a satisfactory bond of indemnity to the Corporation not exceeding an amount double the value of the shares as represented by
such certificate (the necessity for such bond and the amount required to be determined by the President or Chief Executive Officer of
the Corporation), or in the case of a transfer agent, in such amount and pursuant to any and all other requirements of said transfer
agent, a new certificate may be issued of the same tenor and representing the same number, class and series of shares as were represented
by the certificate irate alleged to be lost, stolen or destroyed. 

2.6
 Transfer of Shares . Subject to the terms of any stockholder agreement relating to the transfer of shares or other transfer restrictions
contained in the Articles of Incorporation or authorized therein, shares of the Corporation shall be transferable on the books of the
Corporation by the holder thereof in person or by his duly authorized attorney, upon the surrender and cancellation of a certificate
or certificates for a like number of shares. Upon presentation and surrender of a certificate for shares properly endorsed and payment
of all taxes therefore, the transferee shall be entitled to a new certificate or certificates in lieu thereof. As against the Corporation,
a transfer of shares can be made only on the books of the Corporation and in the manner hereinabove provided, and the Corporation shall
be entitled to treat the holder of record of any share as the owner thereof and shall not be bound to recognize any equitable or other
claim to or interest in such share on the part of any other person, whether or not it shall have express or other notice thereof, save
as expressly provided by the statutes of the State of Nevada. 

2.7
 Restrictions on Transfer of Shares . Subject to the limitation imposed by Section 104.8204, Nevada Revised Statutes, a written
restriction on the transfer or registration of transfer of a security of the Corporation may be enforced against the holder of the restricted
security or any successor or transferee of the holder. A restriction on the transfer or registration of transfer of the securities of
the Corporation may be imposed either by the Certificate of Incorporation, the Bylaws or by an agreement among any number of security
holders or between one or more such holders and the Corporation. No restriction so imposed is binding with respect to securities issued
prior to the adoption of the restriction, unless the holders of the securities are parties to an agreement or voted in favor of the restriction.

2.8
 Transfer Agent . Unless otherwise specified by the Board of Directors by resolution, the Secretary of the Corporation shall act
as transfer agent of the certificates representing the shares of stock of the Corporation. The Secretary shall keep, or cause to be kept,

by resolution of the board of directors, a stock transfer book, the contents of which shall set forth among other things, the names and
addresses of the holders of all issued shares of the Corporation, the number of shares held by each, the certificate numbers representing
such shares, the date of issue of the certificates representing such shares, and whether or not such shares originate from original issue
or from transfer. Subject to Article 3.8, the names and addresses of the stockholders as they appear in the stock transfer book shall
be conclusive evidence as to who are the stockholders of record and as such entitled to receive notice of the meetings of stockholders;
to vote at such meetings; to examine the list of the stockholders entitled to vote at meetings; to receive dividends; and to own, enjoy
and exercise any other property or rights deriving from such shares against the Corporation. Each stockholder shall be responsible for
notifying the Secretary, or if applicable, the Corporation s transfer agent in writing of any change in his name or address and
failure so to do will relieve the Corporation, its directors, officers and agents, from liability for failure to direct notices or other
documents, or pay over or transfer dividends or other property or rights, to a name or address other than the name and address appearing
in the stock transfer book. 

2.9
 Close of Transfer Book and Record Date . For the purpose of determining stockholders entitled to notice of, or to, vote at any
meeting of stockholders, or any adjournment thereof, or stockholders entitled to receive payment of any dividend, if any, or in order
to make a determination of stockholders for any other proper purpose, the Board of Directors may prescribe a period not exceeding sixty
(60) days prior to any meeting of the stockholders during which no transfer of stock on the books of the Corporation may be made, or
may fix a day not more than sixty (60) days prior to the holding of any such meeting as the day as of which stockholders entitled to
notice and to vote at such meeting shall be determined; and only stockholders of record on such day shall be entitled to notice or to
vote at such meeting. When a determination of stockholders entitled to vote at any meeting of stockholders has been made as provided
in this section, such determination shall apply to any adjournment thereof. 

ARTICLE

 STOCKHOLDERS
AND MEETINGS 

3.1
 Stockholders of Record . Only stockholders of record on the books of the Corporation shall be entitled to be treated by the Corporation
as holders in fact of the shares standing in their respective names, and the Corporation shall not be bound to recognize any equitable
or other claim to, or interest in, any claims on the part of any other person, firm or Corporation, whether or not it shall have express
or other notice thereof, except as expressly provided by the laws of Nevada. 

3.2
 Meetings . Meetings of stockholders shall be held at the principal office of the Corporation, or at such other place, either within
or without the State of Nevada, as specified from time to time by the Board of Directors. If the Board of Directors shall specify another
location such change in location shall be recorded on the notice calling such meeting. 

- 3 - 

3.3
 Annual Meeting . Except as permitted by the Nevada Revised Statutes, the annual meeting of stockholders of the Corporation for
the election of directors, and for the transaction of such other business as may properly come before the meeting, shall be held on such
date, and at such time and place as the Board of Directors shall designate by resolution at any time. If the election of directors shall
not be held within the time period designated herein for any annual meeting of the stockholders, the Board of Directors shall cause the
election to be held at a special meeting of the stockholders as soon thereafter as may be convenient. Failure to hold the annual meeting
at the designated time shall not cause a forfeiture or dissolution of the Corporation. 

3.4
 Special Meetings . Special meetings of the stockholders of the Corporation may be called by the Chairman or Vice Chairman, of the
Board of Directors or the Board of Directors. 

3.5
 Actions at Meetings Not Regularly Called: Ratification and Approval. Whenever all stockholders entitled to vote at any meeting
consent, either by (i) a writing on the records of the meeting or filed with the Secretary; or (ii) presence at such meeting and oral
consent entered on the minutes; or (iii) taking part in the deliberations at such meeting without objection; the doings of such meeting
shall be as valid as if had at a meeting regularly called and noticed. At such meeting any business may be transacted which is not excluded
from the written consent or to the consideration of which no objection for want of notice is made at the time. If a meeting be irregular
for want of notice or of such consent, provided a quorum was present at such meeting, the proceedings of the meeting may be ratified
and approved and rendered likewise valid, and the irregularity or defect therein waived by a writing signed by all parties having the
right to vote at such meeting. Such consent or approval of stockholders may be made by proxy or attorney, but all such proxies and powers
of attorney must be in writing. 

3.6
 Notice of Stockholders Meeting: Signature: Contents, Service Waiver . The notice of stockholders meetings shall be in writing
and signed by the Chairman, Vice Chairman, President or Chief Executive Officer , or the Secretary, or by such other person or persons
as designated by the Board of Directors. Such notice shall state the purpose or purposes for which the meeting is called and the time
when, and the place, which may be within or without the State of Nevada, where it is to be held. A copy of such notice shall be either
delivered personally to, or shall be mailed postage prepaid to, or shall be emailed to, each stockholder of record entitled to vote at
such meeting not less than ten (10) nor more than sixty (60) days before such meeting. If mailed, it shall be directed to a stockholder
at their address as it appears on the records of the Corporation, and upon such mailing the service of any such notice shall be complete,
and the time of the notice shall begin to run from the date upon which such notice is deposited in the mail for transmission to such
stockholder. If emailed, notice shall be directed to a stockholder at their email address as it appears on the records of the Corporation,
and upon such emailing, the service of any such notice shall be complete, and the time of the notice shall begin to run from the date
upon which such notice is deposited for electronic transmission to such stockholder. Personal delivery of any such notice to any officer
of a Corporation or association, or to any member of a partnership, shall constitute delivery of such notice to such Corporation, association
or partnership. Notice duly delivered or mailed to a stockholder in accordance with the provisions of this section shall be deemed sufficient,
and in the event of the transfer of his stock after such delivery or mailing and prior to the holding of the meeting, it shall not be
necessary to deliver or mail notice of the meeting upon the transferee. Any stockholder may waive notice of any meeting by a writing
signed by him, or his duly authorized attorney, either before or after the meeting. Such waiver shall be deemed equivalent to any notice
required to be given pursuant to the Articles of Incorporation, the Bylaws, or the Nevada Revised Statutes. 

- 4 - 

3.7
 Consent of Stockholders in Lieu of Meeting . Any action required or permitted to be taken at any annual or special meeting of stockholders
of the Corporation may be taken by the written consent of the stockholders in lieu of a meeting, who hold that percentage of voting shares
equivalent to the amount that would be necessary to take such action if voted upon by the stockholders at an annual or special meeting
duly noticed and called in accordance with the Nevada Revised Statutes. 

3.8
 Voting Record . The Secretary, or if applicable, the Corporation s transfer agent, having charge of the stock transfer books
for shares of the Corporation, shall make, at least ten (10) days before such meeting of stockholders, a complete record of the stockholders
entitled to vote at each meeting of stockholders or any adjournment thereof, arranged in alphabetical order, with the address of and
the number of shares held by each. The record, for a period of ten days prior to such meeting, shall be kept on file at the principal
office of the Corporation, whether within or without the State of Nevada, and shall be subject to inspection by any stockholder for any
purpose germane to the meeting at any time during usual business hours. Such record shall be produced and kept open at the time and place
of the meeting and shall be subject to the inspection of any stockholder during the whole time of the meeting for the purposes thereof.
The original stock transfer books shall be deemed prima facie evidence as to who are the stockholders entitled to examine the record
or transfer books or to vote at any meeting of stockholders. 

3.9
 Quorum . A majority of the outstanding shares of the Corporation entitled to vote, represented in person or by proxy, shall constitute
a quorum at any meeting of stockholders, except as otherwise provided by the Nevada Revised Statutes and the Articles of Incorporation.
In the absence of a quorum at any such meeting, a majority of the shares so represented may adjourn the meeting from time to time for
a period not to exceed sixty (60) days without further notice. At such adjourned meeting at which a quorum shall be present or represented,
any business may be transacted which might have been transacted at the meeting as originally noticed. The stockholders present at a duly
organized meeting may continue to transact business until adjournment, notwithstanding the withdrawal of enough stockholders to leave
less than a quorum. 

3.10
 Manner of Acting . If a quorum is present, the affirmative vote of the majority of the shares represented at the meeting and entitled
to vote on the subject matter shall be the act of the stockholders, unless the vote of a greater proportion or number or voting by classes
is otherwise required by statute or by the Articles of Incorporation or these Bylaws. 

3.11
 Stockholder s Proxies . At any meeting of the stockholders of the Corporation, any stockholder may be represented and vote
by a proxy or proxies appointed by an instrument in writing. In the event that any such instrument in writing shall designate two or
more persons to act as proxies, a majority of such persons present at the meeting, or, if only one shall be present, then that one shall
have and may exercise all the powers conferred by such written instrument upon all of the persons so designated unless the instrument
shall otherwise provide. No such proxy shall be valid after the expiration of six (6) months from the date of its execution, unless coupled
with an interest, or unless the person executing it specifies therein the length of time for which it is to continue in force, which
in no case shall exceed seven (7) years from the date of its execution. Subject to the above, any proxy duly executed is not revoked
and continues in full force and effect until an instrument revoking it or a duly executed proxy bearing a later date is filed with the
Secretary of the Corporation.

is involved by reason of such Director s Corporate Status within thirty (30) days after the receipt by the Corporation of a written
statement from such Director requesting such advance or advances from time to time, whether prior to or after final disposition of such
Proceeding. Such statement or statements shall reasonably evidence the Expenses incurred by such Director and shall be preceded or accompanied
by an undertaking by or on behalf of such Director to repay any Expenses so advanced if it shall ultimately be determined that such Director
is not entitled to be indemnified against such Expenses. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Corporation shall advance all Expenses incurred
by or on behalf of any Director seeking advancement of expenses hereunder in connection with a Proceeding initiated by such Director

the Corporation to recover the unpaid amount of the claim and if successful in whole or in part, such Director shall also be entitled
to be paid the expenses of prosecuting such claim. The failure of the Corporation (including its Board of Directors or any committee
thereof, independent legal counsel, or stockholders) to make a determination concerning the permissibility of such advancement of Expenses
under this Article 5 shall not be a defense to an action brought by a Director for recovery of the unpaid amount of an advancement claim
and shall not create a presumption that such advancement is not permissible. The burden of proving that a Director is not entitled to
an advancement of expenses shall be on the Corporation 

(C)
In any suit brought by the Corporation to recover an advancement of expenses pursuant to the terms of an undertaking, the Corporation

Corporate Status as an Officer or Non-Officer Employee upon the receipt by the Corporation of a statement or statements from such Officer
or Non-Officer Employee requesting such advance or advances from time to time, whether prior to or after final disposition of such Proceeding.
Such statement or statements shall reasonably evidence the Expenses incurred by such Officer or Non-Officer Employee and shall be preceded
or accompanied by an undertaking by or on behalf of such person to repay any Expenses so advanced if it shall ultimately be determined
that such Officer or Non-Officer Employee is not entitled to be indemnified against such Expenses. 

(B)
In any suit brought by the Corporation to recover an advancement of expenses pursuant to the terms of an undertaking, the Corporation
shall be entitled to recover such expenses upon a final adjudication that the Officer or Non-Officer Employee has not met any applicable
standard for indemnification set forth in the Nevada Revised Statutes. 

9.7
 Contractual Nature of Rights. 

(A)
The provisions of this Article IX shall be deemed to be a contract between the Corporation and each Director and Officer entitled to
the benefits hereof at any time while this Article IX is in effect, in consideration of such person s past or current and any future
performance of services for the Corporation. Neither amendment, repeal or modification of any provision of this Article IX nor the adoption
of any provision of the Certificate of Incorporation inconsistent with this Article IX shall eliminate or reduce any right conferred
by this Article IX in respect of any act or omission occurring, or any cause of action or claim that accrues or arises or any state of
facts existing, at the time of or before such amendment, repeal, modification or adoption of an inconsistent provision (even in the case
of a proceeding based on such a state of facts that is commenced after such time), and all rights to indemnification and advancement
of Expenses granted herein or arising out of any act or omission shall vest at the time of the act or omission in question, regardless
of when or if any proceeding with respect to such act or omission is commenced. The rights to indemnification and to advancement of expenses
provided by, or granted pursuant to, this Article IX shall continue notwithstanding that the person has ceased to be a director or officer
of the Corporation and shall inure to the benefit of the estate, heirs, executors, administrators, legatees and distributees of such
person. 

- 19 - 

(B)
If a claim for indemnification hereunder by a Director or Officer is not paid in full by the Corporation within sixty (60) days after
receipt by the Corporation of a written claim for indemnification, such Director or Officer may at any time thereafter bring suit against
the Corporation to recover the unpaid amount of the claim, and if successful in whole or in part, such Director or Officer shall also
be entitled to be paid the expenses of prosecuting such claim. The failure of the Corporation (including its Board of Directors or any
committee thereof, independent legal counsel, or stockholders) to make a determination concerning the permissibility of such indemnification
under this Article IX shall not be a defense to an action brought by a Director or Officer for recovery of the unpaid amount of an indemnification
claim and shall not create a presumption that such indemnification is not permissible. The burden of proving that a Director or Officer
is not entitled to indemnification shall be on the Corporation. 

(C)
In any suit brought by a Director or Officer to enforce a right to indemnification hereunder, it shall be a defense that such Director
or Officer has not met any applicable standard for indemnification set forth in the Nevada Revised Statutes. 

9.8
 Non-Exclusivity of Rights . The rights to indemnification and advancement of Expenses set forth in this Article IX shall not be
exclusive of any other right which any Director, Officer, or Non-Officer Employee may have or hereafter acquire under any statute, provision

9.9
 Insurance . The Corporation may maintain insurance, at its expense, to protect itself and any Director, Officer or Non-Officer
Employee against any liability of any character asserted against or incurred by the Corporation or any such Director, Officer or Non-Officer
Employee, or arising out of any such person s Corporate Status, whether or not the Corporation would have the power to indemnify
such person against such liability under the Nevada Revised Statutes or the provisions of this Article IX. 

9.10
 Other Indemnification . The Corporation s obligation, if any, to indemnify or provide advancement of Expenses to any person
under this Article IX as a result of such person serving, at the request of the Corporation, as a director, partner, trustee, officer,

by any amount such person may collect as indemnification or advancement of Expenses from such other corporation, partnership, joint venture,
trust, employee benefit plan or enterprise (the Primary Indemnitor ). Any indemnification or advancement of Expenses under
this Article IX owed by the Corporation as a result of a person serving, at the request of the Corporation, as a director, partner, trustee,
officer, employee or agent of another corporation, partnership, joint venture, trust, employee benefit plan or other enterprise shall
only be in excess of, and shall be secondary to, the indemnification or advancement of Expenses available from the applicable Primary
