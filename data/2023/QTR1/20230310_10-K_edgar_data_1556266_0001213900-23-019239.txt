PART I 

Item 1. Description of Business. 

Overview and Corporate History 

TD Holdings, Inc. (formerly known as Bat Group,
Inc.), has become a business engaging in commodities trading business (the Commodities Trading Business and supply
chain service business (the Supply Chain Service Business in China since the disposition of its direct loans,
loan guarantees and financial leasing services to small-to-medium sized businesses, farmers and individuals in July 2018 and its used
luxurious car leasing business in August 2020. 

The Commodities Trading Business primarily involves
purchasing non-ferrous metal products from upstream metal and mineral suppliers and then selling to downstream customers. The Supply
Chain Service Business primarily has served as a one-stop commodity supply chain service and digital intelligence supply chain platform
integrating upstream and downstream enterprises, warehouses, logistics, information, and futures trading. 

Our Current Business 

Commodities Trading Business 

The Commodities Trading Business primarily involves
purchasing non-ferrous metal products, such as aluminum ingots, copper, silver, and gold, from upstream metal and mineral suppliers and
then selling to downstream customers. In connection with the Company s commodity sales, in order to help customers to obtain sufficient
funds to purchase various metal products and also help upstream metal and mineral suppliers to sell their metal products, the Company
launched its Supply Chain Service Business in December 2019. The Company primarily generates revenues from bulk non-ferrous commodity
products, and from providing related supply chain management services in the PRC. 

In order to diversify the Company s business,
the Company has operated the Commodities Trading Business through Shenzhen Huamucheng Trading Co., Ltd. Huamucheng since November 2019, which was renamed Shenzhen Baiyu Jucheng Data Technology Co., Ltd. Shenzhen Baiyu Jucheng in 2021. On November 22, 2019, Hao Limo Technology (Beijing) Co., Ltd. Hao Limo ), our indirectly wholly-owned subsidiary,
entered into a series of agreements with Shenzhen Baiyu Jucheng and the shareholders of Shenzhen Baiyu Jucheng pursuant to which we obtained
control of Shenzhen Baiyu Jucheng (the VIE Agreements ). On June 25, 2020, Hao Limo and Shenzhen Baiyu Jucheng entered
into certain VIE termination agreements to terminate the Shenzhen Baiyu Jucheng VIE Agreements. As such, Hao Limo no longer has the control
rights and rights to the assets, property and revenue of Shenzhen Baiyu Jucheng. At the same time, Shanghai Jianchi Supply Chain Co.,
Ltd. Shanghai Jianchi ), our wholly-owned subsidiary incorporated in China, acquired 100 equity interest of Shenzhen
Baiyu Jucheng from the shareholders of Shenzhen Baiyu Jucheng (the Shenzhen Baiyu Jucheng Shareholders for nominal
consideration. 

Through Shenzhen Baiyu Jucheng s business,
we source bulk commodity products from non-ferrous metals and mines or its designated distributors and then sell to manufacturers who
need these metals in large quantities. We also work with upstream suppliers in the sourcing of commodities. 

Through Shenzhen Qianhai Baiyu Supply Chain Co.,
Ltd. Qianhai Baiyu ), our wholly-owned subsidiary incorporated in China, we provide supply chain management services
to our customers. On October 26, 2020, Shenzhen Baiyu Jucheng entered into certain share purchase agreements to acquire 100 shares of
Qianhai Baiyu. Qianhai Baiyu is engaged in the supply chain service business and covers a full range of commodities, including non-ferrous
metals, ferrous metals, coal, metallurgical raw materials, soybean oils, oils, rubber, wood and various other types of commodities. It
also has a supply chain infrastructure, which includes processing, logistics, warehousing and terminals. Utilizing its customer base,
industry experience, and expertise in the commodity trading industry, Qianhai Baiyu serves as a one-stop commodity supply chain service
and digital intelligence supply chain platform integrating upstream and downstream enterprises, warehouses, logistics, information, and
futures trading.

The acquisition of Qianhai Baiyu has laid a solid
foundation for the Company to further expand its operations in the commodity supply chain field. The Company plans to strengthen and
upgrade its supply chain services platform by introducing a systematic quantitative risk control system, which will be based on the Qianhai
Baiyu s massive historical market data and complex data analysis models. The platform is expected to establish a quantitative risk
management system utilizing ETL data integration (Extract, Transform, Load) as its core, and then optimize trading portfolios by incorporating
various factors and strategies in order to effectively control risks and sustain business development. 

For the fiscal year ended December 31, 2022,
the Company generated revenue of 155,443,398 from its commodities trading business and 1,391,903 from its supply chain management services.

Our Business 

As of December 31, 2022, the Company has two
business lines, the commodities trading business and supply chain management services set forth below. 

Commodities Trading Business 

Industry Overview 

Bulk commodities trading refers to the trading
of materials used in industrial and agricultural production that are continuously purchased in bulk, and are unable to be purchased from
the retail sector. Commodities belong at the upstream stage of production processes of various industrial chains, and the supply and
demand conditions of commodities can cause price fluctuations and affect the development of these industrial chains. 

Commodities can be divided into four categories,
metals, energy, livestock and meat, and agricultural. Metal commodities include gold, silver, platinum, and copper. Energy commodities
include crude oil, heating oil, natural gas, and gasoline. Livestock and meat include lean hogs, pork bellies, live cattle, and feeder
cattle. Agricultural commodities include corn, soybeans, wheat rice, cocoa, coffee, cotton, and sugar. 

In recent years, although the growth rate of China s total commodity
sales has slowed down, the aggregate sales are still impressive and approach RMB200 billion. According to Colliers International, China s
major cities including Beijing, Shanghai, Guangzhou, Shenzhen, Chengdu and Xi an completed a total of approximately RMB197.1 billion
in commodity sales. In 2019 and 2020, these figures are RMB2.5 billion and RMB2.5 billion, respectively. Due to the outbreak of COVID-19
in 2019, this figure decreases sharply to RMB1,369 billion. Therefore, the data of 2021 indicates a strong recovery from COVID-19. 

Operation of Commodities Trading Business 

The Company s commodities trading operations via Shenzhen Baiyu
Jucheng are focused on non-ferrous metal commodities such as aluminum, copper, silver, and gold. We strive to become an emerging platform
in the non-ferrous metal e-commerce industry by offering all participants in the non-ferrous metal e-commerce industry a seamless, one-stop
transaction experience. 

Business Model 

We source bulk commodities from non-ferrous metal
mines or its designated distributors and sell them to manufacturers who need these metals in large quantities. We work with many suppliers
in the sourcing of commodities, including various metal and mineral suppliers such as Kunsteel Group, Baosteel Group, Aluminum Corporate
of China Limited, Yunnan Benyuan, Yunnan Tin, and Shanghai Copper. Potential customers include large infrastructure companies such as
China National Electricity, Datang Power, China Aluminum Foshan International Trade, Tooke Investment (China), CSSC International Trade
Co., Ltd., Shenye Group, and Keliyuan. 

6 

The Company has entered into a warehousing lease agreement with Shanghai
Quansheng Logistics Co., Ltd Shanghai Quansheng to designate it as the Company s warehouse in Shanghai. The
Company s criteria for choosing its warehouses are based primarily on the convenience of its location for transportation, which
is highly conducive to the transportation of non-ferrous metal commodities, and secondarily based on its storage price. 

Our inventory management procedure involves (1)
an Application for Storage, (2) Storage of the Commodities, (3) an Application for Shipment, and (4) Shipment of Commodities, which are
further described below. 

1) 
 Application for Storage 

The upstream suppliers
 apply for storage with the Company s leased warehouse center upon the sale of commodities to the Company. The application requires
 information including the commodities production company, brand, specifications, weight, quantity, and storage time. 

2) 
 Storage of the Commodities 

Upon
the arrival of the commodities at the warehouse, the warehouse checks and accepts the commodities according to the delivery instructions
provided by the transportation company, ensuring that the delivery instructions, storage application, and the delivered commodities are
all consistent. 

Upon
acceptance, the warehouse scans and places the commodities into sorted storage. The warehouse then issues a certificate of inspection,
which includes information such as the brand name, specifications, weight, quantity, packaging information, arrival time, storage location
and other information of the received commodities. The certificate of inspection is then signed and stamped by the delivery driver, the
warehouse manager, and the warehouse. Four copies of the certificate of inspection are made, two of which are provided to the transportation
company and the supplier. 

3) 
 Application for Shipment 

The
downstream customers apply for shipment with the warehouse upon the purchase of Commodities from the Company. The application requires
information including the production company, brand, specifications, weight, quantity, delivery time, and storage location number. 

The
downstream customers also fill in a delivery entrustment letter, including the name of the delivery company, the name of the delivery
person, his or her ID number, the delivery vehicle s license plate number, the time, quantity, and information regarding the warehouse
for delivery. 

4) 
 Shipment of Commodities 

The
warehouse prepares the commodities in advance according to the pick-up time and the Application for Shipment. 

Upon arrival of the pick-up
 driver at the warehouse, the Company reviews the identity of the pick-up driver according to the delivery entrustment letter. 

Upon
 completing the loading of the commodities for shipment, the warehouse issues a certificate of sale, which includes information such
 as the brand name, specifications, weight, quantity, delivery time, and storage location number. The pick-up driver, warehouse manager,
 and the warehouse signs and stamps the certificate of sale. Four copies of the certificate of sale are made, two of which are provided
 to the transportation company and the customer. 

7 

We use a prepaid unified purchase and distribution
model Prepaid Model in our business, which is further detailed below. 

Under the Prepaid Model, we make advance prepayments between one to
three months in advance when purchasing from the Company s upstream suppliers. The process involves first obtaining purchase orders
from one or more downstream purchasers and entering into sales agreements with such purchasers. After the Company receives the down payment
from the downstream purchasers, it aggregates the total amount of commodities required to fulfill the orders and enters into purchase
agreements with upstream suppliers to fulfill its purchase orders. Once the upstream suppliers have received the prepayment from the Company,
they produce and deliver the commodities to the Company s designated warehouse on the purchase agreement. Upon receipt of the commodities
in the designated warehouse, the Company is notified by the warehouse and obtains the full payment from the downstream purchasers. After
the Company pays its remaining balance to the upstream suppliers, it issues delivery instructions to the designated warehouse on the sales
agreement and has the commodities delivered to the downstream purchasers. 

Through the Prepaid Model, which is further illustrated
below, the Company maintains a stable distribution volume and thereby generates profit margins via purchase discounts from upstream suppliers
and mark-up pricing to downstream customers. 

Warehousing Arrangement 

Shenzhen Baiyu Jucheng has entered into a certain warehousing agreement
with Shanghai Quansheng pursuant to which Shenzhen Baiyu Jucheng designated Shanghai Quansheng as its warehouse for the storage of its
commodities. 

Pursuant to the warehousing agreement with Shanghai Quansheng, Shenzhen
Baiyu Jucheng and Shanghai Quansheng agreed to various customary representations, warranties and covenants, including, among other things,
(1) details regarding the procedures for the storage and retrieval of the commodities, (2) storage and penalty fees, and (3) negotiation
and litigation in the event of any breach of contract. 

8 

Suppliers 

We source the non-ferrous metal from various
sources including but not limited to smelters, non-ferrous metal wholesalers and metal traders. For the year ended December 31, 2022,
the Company purchased non-ferrous metal products from twenty-two third party suppliers. 

Customers 

We sell to various businesses in need of large
quantity of non-ferrous metal including home appliance manufacturing enterprises, cable manufacturing enterprises and wire manufacturing
enterprises. For the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, the Company sold non-ferrous metals to twenty-nine and twenty-seven customers,
respectively. 

Supply Chain Management Services 

Commodity Distribution Services 

We offer a distribution service to bulk suppliers
of precious metals by acting as a sales intermediary, procuring small to medium-sized buyers through our own professional sales team
and channels and distributing to them the bulk precious metals of the suppliers. Upon the execution of a purchase order from our sourced
buyers, we charge the suppliers with a commission fee ranging from 1 to 2 of the distribution order, depending on the size of the order.
For the year ended December 31, 2022, the Company earned commodity distribution commission fees of 1,391,903 from facilitating such
sales transactions with twenty third party customers. For the year ended December 31, 2021, the Company earned commodity distribution
commission fees of 3,180,227 from facilitating such sales transactions with thirty-four third party customers.

through our sales personnel and online promotion. We have registered public accounts on WeChat and Weibo public accounts as well as an
account on Tongdao.com to promote our services. We started to introduce our services via major search engines such as Zhida and Baidu.

Business Strategy 

Commodities Trading Business

varieties of commodities that we trade in, including ore, crude oil and coal in addition to our current focus on non-ferrous metals.

Competition 

Commodities Trading Business 

The Company competes against other large domestic
commodity trade service providers such as Xiamen International Trade and Yijian Shares. Currently, the principal competitive factors
in the non-ferrous metal commodities trading business are price, product availability, quantity, service, and financing terms for purchases
and sales of commodities. In addition, we also believe that our customers will choose among service providers on the basis of leadership
in the commodity trading industry and service quality. 

Competitive Strengths 

Commodities Trading Business 

Our management team has
 accumulated substantial industry expertise through decades of experience in the commodities trading industry. 

Our ability to acquire
 customers through advertising on the promotion channels of major search engines and social media, such as Baidu, 58, Wechat, and
 Weibo, using search engine optimization and search engine marketing to analyze the effectiveness and efficiency of different promotion
 channels. We also promote our services on the Tongdao E-commerce Network, a leading e-commerce platform for non-ferrous metals bulk
 commodities, which provides services including non-ferrous metal price quotes, spot trading and bulk purchasing. 

We have strong risk control
 measures. Through the establishment of a series of safeguard measures, we can ensure the safety of our commodities trading, reducing
 risk factors such as cargo damage, customer default, logistics distribution and supply chain services in the process of commodity
 trading. 

Our customers privacy
 and security are guaranteed. This information is encrypted and can only be accessed by authorized employees for predetermined periods
 of time. 

Our commodity price system
 is transparent. Although commodity prices fluctuate every day, we are able to timely inform our customers of accurate prices to guide
 their transactions. 

Our customer service quality
 is very high and we are constantly upgrading our customer service system. We have a professional commodity consulting service, supply
 chain service and a comprehensive customer satisfaction evaluation mechanism. 

Intellectual Property 

Our intellectual property includes domain names
ir.tdglg.com and tdglg.com. 

Despite our efforts to protect our proprietary
rights, unauthorized parties may attempt to copy or otherwise obtain and use our technology. Monitoring unauthorized use of our technology
is difficult and costly, and we cannot be certain that the steps we have taken will prevent the misappropriation of our technology. From
time to time, we may have to resort to litigation to enforce our intellectual property rights, which could result in substantial costs
and diversion of our resources. 

In addition, although there were no litigations
initiated against us in 2021 by third parties alleging infringement of their proprietary rights or declaring non-infringement of our
intellectual property rights, we cannot guarantee that such litigation will not be initiated in the future. In the event of a successful
claim of infringement and our failure or inability to develop non-infringing technology or license the infringed or similar technology
on a timely basis, our business could be harmed. Moreover, even if we are able to license the infringed or similar technology, license
fees could be substantial and may adversely affect our results of operations.

Council issued the PRC Labor Contract Law Implementing Rules, which became effective as of the date of issuance. The Labor Contract Law
and its Implementing Rules govern the establishment of employment relationships between employers and employees, and the conclusion,
performance, termination of, and the amendment to employment contracts. To establish an employment relationship, a written employment
contract must be signed. In the event that no written employment contract was signed at the time of establishment of an employment relationship,
a written employment contract must be signed within one month after the date on which the employer starts to use the employee s
services. An employer may terminate the labor agreement of an employee under certain specified circumstances and in some cases, such termination
can only be done after fulfillment of certain procedural requirements, such as 30 days prior notice or upon payment of one month s
salary in lieu of such notice. In certain cases, the terminated employee is entitled to receive a severance payment equal to the average
monthly salary during the 12-month period immediately preceding to the termination (inclusive of all monetary income such as base salary,
bonus, allowances, etc.), for each year of service up to the date of termination. If an employer terminates a labor contract in any
circumstance other than those specified under the Labor Contract Law and its implementing rules, including termination without cause,
the employer must either reinstate and continue to perform the employee s employment contract or pay the employee damages calculated
at twice the rate for calculating the severance payment, subject to the employee s own request. In the case that the employee requests
for damages, the employer is not required to pay other severance or the remainder of the amount owed under the employment contract unless
the employment contract has otherwise been provided for. 

In addition, according to the Labor Contract
Law and its implementing rules, in order to enforce the non-compete provision with the employees after the termination or ending of employment

of Enterprise Income Tax Transition Preferential Policy under the Enterprise Income Tax Law of the PRC, or the Transition Preferential
Policy Circular, which became effective simultaneously with the Enterprise Income Tax Law of the PRC. On October 17, 2017, the State
Administration of Taxation promulgated the Announcement of the State Administration of Taxation on Issues Relating to Withholding at
Source of Income Tax of Non-resident Enterprises, which became effective on December 1, 2017 and amended Withholding at Source of Income
Tax of Non-resident Enterprises on June 15, 2018. The Enterprise Income Tax Law of the PRC imposes a uniform enterprise income tax rate
of 25 on all domestic enterprises, including foreign-invested enterprises unless they qualify for certain exceptions, and terminates
most of the tax exemptions, reductions and preferential treatments available under previous tax laws and regulations. 

Moreover, under the Enterprise Income Tax Law
of the PRC, enterprises organized under the laws of jurisdictions outside China with their de facto management bodies located
within China may be considered PRC resident enterprises and therefore subject to PRC enterprise income tax at the rate of 25 on their
worldwide income. The Implementation Rules define the term de facto management body as the management body that exercises
full and substantial control and overall management over the business, productions, personnel, accounts and properties of an enterprise.
In addition, the Circular Related to Relevant Issues on the Identification of a Chinese holding Company Incorporated Overseas as a Residential
Enterprise under the Criterion of De Facto Management Bodies Recognizing issued by the State Administration of Taxation on April 22,
2009 provides that a foreign enterprise controlled by a PRC company or a PRC company group will be classified as a resident enterprise 
with its de facto management bodies located within China if the following requirements are satisfied: (i) the senior management
and core management departments in charge of its daily operations function mainly in China; (ii) its financial and human resources decisions
are subject to determination or approval by persons or bodies in China; (iii) its major assets, accounting books, company seals and minutes
and files of its board and shareholders meetings are located or kept in China; and (iv) more than half of the enterprise s
directors or senior management with voting rights reside in China. Although the circular only applies to offshore enterprises controlled
by PRC enterprises and not those controlled by PRC individuals or foreigners, the determining criteria set forth in the circular may
reflect the State Administration of Taxation s general position on how the de facto management body test should be
applied in determining the tax resident status of offshore enterprises, regardless of whether they are controlled by PRC enterprises,
individuals or foreigners.

Regulations on Foreign Currency Exchange
and Dividend Distribution 

Foreign Currency Exchange 

The principal regulations governing foreign currency
exchange in China are the Foreign Exchange Administration Regulations, which was most recently amended in August 2008. Under the PRC
Foreign Exchange Administration Regulations, Renminbi is freely convertible for payments of current account items, such as distribution
of dividends, interest payments and trade and service-related foreign exchange transactions, can be made in foreign currencies without
prior approval from SAFE. In contrast, approval from or registration with appropriate government authorities is required where Renminbi
is to convert into foreign currency and remitted out of China to pay capital account items, such as direct investments, repayment of
foreign currency-denominated loans, repatriation of investments and investments in securities outside of China. 

In November 2012, SAFE promulgated the Circular
on Improving and Adjusting Foreign Exchange Administration Policies on Foreign Direct Investment, or Circular on Improving and Adjusting
Foreign Exchange Policies, which was latest amended on December 30, 2019. Circular on Improving and Adjusting Foreign Exchange Policies
substantially amends and simplifies the foreign exchange procedure. Pursuant to Circular on Improving and Adjusting Foreign Exchange
Policies, the opening of various foreign exchange accounts for designated purposes, such as pre-establishment expenses accounts, foreign
exchange capital accounts and guarantee accounts, the reinvestment of Renminbi proceeds derived by foreign investors in the PRC, and
remittance of foreign exchange profits and dividends by foreign-invested enterprises to their foreign shareholders, no longer require
approval or verification from SAFE, and the same entity may open multiple capital accounts in different provinces. 

On May 10, 2013, SAFE promulgated the Circular
on Printing and Distributing the Provisions on Foreign Exchange Administration Over Domestic Direct Investment by Foreign Investors and
the Supporting Documents, which specifies that the administration by SAFE or its local branches over foreign direct investment in the
PRC shall be conducted by way of registration. Institutions and individuals shall register with SAFE and/or its branches for their direct
investment in China. Banks shall process foreign exchange business relating to the direct investment in China based on the registration
information provided by SAFE and its branches. 

In February 2015, SAFE promulgated the Circular
of Further Simplifying and Improving the Policies of Foreign Exchange Administration Applicable to Direct Investment, or Circular 13,
which became effective on June 1, 2015 and was amended on December 30, 2019. Upon the implementation of Circular 13, the current foreign
exchange procedures will be further simplified, foreign exchange registrations of direct investment will be handled by designated foreign
exchange settlement banks instead of SAFE and its branches. 

On March 30, 2015, SAFE issued the Circular on
Reform of the Administrative Rules of the Payment and Settlement of Foreign Exchange Capital of Foreign-Invested Enterprises SAFE
Circular 19 ), which became effective on June 1, 2015 and was amended on December 30, 2019. Pursuant to SAFE Circular 19, foreign-invested
enterprises may either continue to follow the current payment-based foreign currency settlement system or elect to follow the conversion-at-will 
regime of foreign currency settlement. Where a foreign-invested enterprise follows the conversion-at-will regime of foreign currency
settlement, it may convert part or all of the amount of the foreign currency in its capital account into Renminbi at any time. The converted
Renminbi will be kept in a designated account labeled as settled but pending payment, and if the foreign-invested enterprise needs to
make payment from such designated account, it still needs to go through the review process with its bank and provide necessary supporting
documents. SAFE Circular 19, therefore, has substantially lifted the restrictions on the usage by a foreign-invested enterprise of its
RMB registered capital converted from foreign currencies. According to SAFE Circular 19, such Renminbi capital may be used at the discretion
of the foreign-invested enterprise and SAFE will eliminate the prior approval requirement and only examine the authenticity of the declared
usage afterwards. Nevertheless, foreign-invested enterprises are still not allowed to extend intercompany loans to PRC consolidated entities.
In addition, as Circular 19 was promulgated recently, there remain substantial uncertainties with respect to the interpretation and implementation
of this circular by relevant authorities. 

14 

On June 9, 2016, SAFE issued the Circular on
Reforming and Regulating Policies on the Control over Foreign Exchange Settlement of Capital Accounts Circular 16 ),
which became effective simultaneously. Pursuant to Circular 16, enterprises registered in the PRC may also convert their foreign debts
from foreign currency to RMB on self-discretionary basis. Circular 16 provides an integrated standard for conversion of foreign exchange
under capital account items (including but not limited to foreign currency capital and foreign debts) on self-discretionary basis which
applies to all enterprises registered in the PRC. Circular 16 reiterates the principle that RMB converted from foreign currency-denominated
capital of a company may not be directly or indirectly used for purpose beyond its business scope or prohibited by PRC Laws or regulations,
while such converted RMB shall not be provide as loans to its non-affiliated entities. 

On January 26, 2017, SAFE issued the Notice of
State Administration of Foreign Exchange on Improving the Check of Authenticity and Compliance to further Promote Foreign Exchange Control,
or SAFE Circular 3, which stipulates several capital control measures with respect to the outbound remittance of profit from domestic
entities to offshore entities, including (i) under the principle of genuine transaction, banks must check board resolutions regarding
profit distribution, the original version of tax filing records and audited financial statements; and (ii) domestic entities must hold
income to account for previous years losses before remitting the profits. Moreover, pursuant to SAFE Circular 3, domestic entities
shall make detailed explanations of the sources of capital and utilization arrangements, and provide board resolutions, contracts and
other proof when completing the registration procedures in connection with an outbound investment. 

Regulations on Dividend Distribution 

The principal regulations governing dividend
distributions of wholly foreign-owned companies include: 

Foreign
Investment Law of the PRC, effective as of January 1, 2020; 

Regulations
for Implementation the Foreign Investment Law of the PRC, effective as of January 1, 2020; 

Company
Law of the PRC, as amended on October 26, 2018; 

Enterprise
Income Tax Law of the PRC, effective as of March 16, 2007, as amended on December 29, 2018; 

Regulations
on the Implementation of the Enterprise Income Tax Law of the PRC, effective as of December 6, 2007, as amended on April 23, 2019. 

Under these laws and regulations, wholly foreign-owned
companies in China may pay dividends only out of their accumulated profits as determined in accordance with PRC accounting standards
and regulations. In addition, these wholly foreign-owned companies are required to set aside no less than 10 of the after-tax profits,
if any, to fund certain reserve funds, until the accumulative amount of such fund reaches 50 of its registered capital. Although the
statutory reserves can be used, among other ways, to increase the registered capital and eliminate future losses in excess of retained
earnings of the respective companies, the reserve funds are not distributable as cash dividends except in the event of liquidation. At
the discretion of these wholly foreign-owned companies, they may allocate a portion of their after-tax profits based on PRC accounting
standards to staff welfare and bonus funds. These reserve funds and staff welfare and bonus funds are not distributable as cash dividends. 

Regulations on Employee Share Incentive Plans
of Overseas Publicly-listed Company 

In February 2012, SAFE promulgated the Circular
of the SAFE on Relevant Issues Concerning Foreign Exchange Administration over Involvement of Domestic Individuals in Equity Incentive
Plans of Overseas Listed Companies, or the 2012 SAFE Notice. Under such notice and other relevant rules and regulations, PRC residents,
including PRC citizens or non-PRC citizens who reside in China for a continuous period of not less than one year, that participate in
any share incentive plan of any overseas publicly-listed company are required to register with SAFE or its local branches and complete
certain other procedures. Participants of a share incentive plan who are PRC residents must retain a qualified PRC agent, which could
be a PRC subsidiary of the overseas publicly-listed company or another qualified institution selected by the PRC subsidiary, to conduct
the SAFE registration and other procedures with respect to the share incentive plan on behalf of the participants. We and our executive
officers and other employees who are PRC residents that have been granted share incentive awards will be subject to these regulations
upon the completion of this offering. Failure by these individuals to complete their SAFE registrations may subject such individuals
and us to fines and other legal sanctions. 

15 

The SAT has issued certain circulars concerning
employee share incentive awards. Under these circulars, our employees working in China who exercise share incentive awards will be subject
to PRC individual income tax. Our PRC subsidiary has the obligation to make filings related to employee share incentive awards with relevant
tax authorities and to withhold individual income taxes of those employees who exercise their share incentive awards. If our employees
fail to pay or we fail to withhold their income taxes according to relevant laws and regulations, we may face sanctions imposed by the
tax authorities or other PRC governmental authorities. 

Regulations on Offshore Investment by PRC
Residents 

Pursuant to the SAFE s Notice on Relevant
Issues Concerning Foreign Exchange Administration for PRC Residents to Engage in Financing and Round Trip Investment via Overseas Special
Purpose Companies and its subsequent amendments, supplements or implementation rules, or SAFE Circular 75, issued on October 21, 2005,
a PRC resident (whether a natural person or legal persons) shall register with the local branch of the SAFE before it establishes or
controls an overseas SPV, with assets or equity interests in a PRC company, for the purpose of overseas equity financing. On July 4,
2014, SAFE issued the SAFE s Notice on Relevant Issues Concerning Foreign Exchange Administration for PRC Residents to Engage in
Outbound Investment and Financing and Inbound Investment via Special Purpose Vehicles SPV ), or SAFE Circular 37,
which has superseded SAFE Circular 75. According to SAFE Circular 37, the PRC domestic resident shall apply for SAFE registration for
overseas investment before paying capital to SPV by using his, her or its legal assets whether overseas or domestic. The SPV is defined
as offshore enterprise directly established or indirectly controlled by the domestic residents (including domestic institutions
and individuals) with their legally owned assets and equity of the domestic enterprise, or legally owned offshore assets or equity, for
the purpose of offshore investment and financing . In addition, in the event that the SPV undergoes changes of its basic information
such as the individual shareholder, name, operation term, etc., or material events including increase or decrease by domestic individual
shareholder in investment amount, equity transfer or swap, merge, spinoff, etc., the domestic resident shall timely complete the change
of foreign exchange registration formality for offshore investment. 

According to SAFE Circular 37, failure to make
such registration or truthfully disclose actual controllers of the round-trip enterprises may subject PRC residents to fines up to RMB300,000
in case of domestic institutions or RMB50,000 in case of domestic individuals. If the registered or beneficial shareholders of the offshore
holding company who are PRC residents do not complete their registration with the local SAFE branches, the PRC subsidiary may be prohibited
from distributing their profits and proceeds from any reduction in capital, share transfer or liquidation to the offshore company, and
the offshore company may be restricted in its ability to contribute additional capital to its PRC subsidiary. Moreover, failure to comply
with SAFE registration and amendment requirements described above could result in liability under PRC law for violating applicable foreign
exchange restrictions. 

Regulations on Cross-border Direct Investment
in Renminbi 

On October 12, 2011, MOFCOM issued the Notice
of the Ministry of Commerce on Issues concerning Cross border Direct Investment in Renminbi which was abolished in 2013 and on December 3,
2013 the MOFCOM promulgated the Announcement on Issues relating to Cross-border Direct Investment in RMB, effective from January 1,
2014. Under this announcement, the cross-border direct investment in RMB shall refer to the direct investment activities
conducted by foreign investors (including the investors from Hong Kong, Macau and Taiwan) in China with offshore RMB funds obtained legally,
including, among other things, the establishment of new enterprises, increase of capital, shareholding or merger and acquisition of domestic
enterprises. The cross-border direct investment in RMB by a foreign investor or reinvestment by its foreign-invested enterprise shall
conform to the requirements of laws, regulations and relevant provisions on foreign investment and comply with the foreign investment
industry policies of China and the provisions on security review of foreign investment mergers and acquisitions and anti-monopoly review.
No foreign-invested enterprise is allowed to use the funds of cross-border direct investment in RMB for investment, directly or indirectly,
in negotiable securities and financial derivatives in China (except for strategic investment in listed companies) or for entrusted loans.
On October 13, 2011, the PBOC issued the Management Rules on the Settlement of Foreign Direct Invested Renminbi, which provide
those foreign invested enterprises with RMB-dominated foreign direct investment must register with the PBOC or its local branch after
obtaining the permit from MOFCOM and the business license. The Management Rules on the Settlement of Foreign Direct Invested Renminbi
was amended on June 5, 2015.

Regulations on Intellectual Property Rights 

China has adopted comprehensive legislation governing
intellectual property rights, including copyright, trademark, patents and domain names. 

The PRC has adopted comprehensive legislation
governing intellectual property rights, including copyrights, patents, trademarks and domain names. 

Copyright. Copyright in the PRC, including
copyrighted software, is principally protected under the Copyright Law and related rules and regulations, which become effective in 2010
and was last amended on November 11, 2020. Under the Copyright Law, the term of protection for copyrighted software is 50 years. 

Patent. The Patent Law, which became effective
in 2009 and was amended on October 17, 2020, provides for patentable inventions, utility models and designs. An invention or utility
model for which patents may be granted must have novelty, creativity and practical applicability. The State Intellectual Property Office

Item 1A. RISK FACTORS 

You should carefully consider the following
material risk factors and other information in this report. If any of the following risks actually occur, our business, financial condition,
results of operations and prospects for growth could be seriously impacted. As a result, the trading price, if any, of our Common Stock
could decline and you could lose part or all of your investment. 

Risk Factors Related to the Our Business and
Industry 

There is no assurance that we will be able
to manage the commodities trading business effectively. 

Operating the commodities trading business is
a significant challenge and there is no assurance that we will be able to manage the integration successfully. If we are unable to efficiently
integrate these businesses, the attention of our management could be diverted from our existing operations and the ability of the management
teams at these business units to meet operational and financial expectations could be adversely impacted, which could impair our ability
to execute our business plans. Failure to successfully integrate the new commodities trading business or to realize the expected benefits
of entry into the business may have an adverse impact on our results of operations and financial condition. 

Investment in our new line of business could
disrupt the Company s ongoing business and present risks not originally contemplated. 

We have deployed a significant amount of proceeds
from our financings in our new commodities business line, Shenzhen Baiyu Jucheng. New ventures are inherently risky and may not be successful.
In evaluating such endeavors, we are required to make difficult judgments regarding the value of business strategies, opportunities,
technologies and other assets, and the risks and cost of potential liabilities. Furthermore, these investments involve certain other
risks and uncertainties, including the risks involved with entering new competitive categories or regions, the difficulty in integrating
the new business, the challenges in achieving strategic objectives and other benefits expected from our investment, the diversion of
our attention and resources from our operations and other initiatives, the potential impairment of acquired assets and liabilities and
the performance of underlying products, capabilities or technologies. 

17 

We may not be able to ensure the successful
implementation of our strategy to diversify our businesses. 

We have entered into the commodities trading business.
Such initiatives involve various risks including but not limited to the investment costs in establishing a distribution network within
the PRC, leasing warehouses, offices and other working capital requirements. There is no assurance that such future plans can be successfully
implemented as the successful execution of such future plans will depend on several factors, some of which are not within our control,
such as retaining and recruiting qualified and skilled staff, and the continued demand for our products by our customers. Failure to implement
any part of our future plans or execute such plan costs effectively, may lead to a material adverse change in our operating environment
or affect our ability to respond to market or industry changes, which may, in turn, adversely affect our business and financial results. 

Our success depends substantially upon the
continued retention of our senior management. 

Our future success is substantially dependent
on the continued service of certain members of our senior management, including Ms. Renmei Ouyang, our Chairwoman and Chief Executive
Officer, Mr. Tianshi (Stanley) Yang, our Chief Financial Officer. These officers play an integral role in determining our strategic direction
and for executing our growth strategy and are important to our brand and culture. The loss of the services of any of these executives
without qualified replacement could have a material adverse effect on our business and prospects, as we may not be able to find suitable
individuals to replace them on a timely basis, if at all. In addition, any such departure could be viewed negatively by investors and
analysts, which could cause the price of our ordinary shares to decline. 

Our business depends on adequate supply and
availability of nonferrous metal commodities. 

Our planned business requires nonferrous metal
commodities that are sourced from third party suppliers. We are affected by industry supply conditions, which generally involve risks
beyond our control, including costs of these materials, transportation costs and market demand. As a result, we may not be able to obtain
an adequate supply of quality nonferrous metal commodities in a timely or cost-effective manner, which would have a material adverse
effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. 

A decline in our key business sectors or a
reduction in consumer demand generally could have a material adverse effect on our business. 

A large portion of our supply chain management
services revenue comes from clients in the energy, material and industrial sectors, which is intensely competitive, very volatile, and
subject to rapid changes and fluctuations in the overall economic conditions. Declines in the overall performance of the energy, material
and industrial sectors have in the past and could in the future, adversely affect the demand for our supply chain management services
and reduce our revenue and profitability from these clients. In addition, industry changes, such as the transition of more collateral
materials from physical form to digital form and changes in marketing channels, could lessen the demand for certain of our services we
currently handle. To the extent recent uncertainty in the economy or other factors result in decreased demand for our clients 
products, we may experience a reduction in volumes of client products that we handle which could have a material adverse effect on our
supply chain management services business, financial position and operating results. 

We operate in a business that is cyclical
and where demand can be volatile, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations. 

We operate in a business that is cyclical and
where demand can be volatile, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition. The timing
and magnitude of the cycles in the business in which we operate are difficult to predict. Purchase prices for the raw materials we purchase,
and selling prices for our products are volatile and beyond our control. While we attempt to respond to changing raw material costs through
adjustments to the sales price of our products, our ability to do so is limited by competitive and other market factors. A significant
reduction in selling prices for our products may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations,
and adversely impact our ability to recover purchase costs from end customers. A decline in market prices for our products between the
date of the sales order and shipment of the product may impact the customer s ability to obtain letters of credit to cover the
full sales amount. A decline in selling prices for our products coupled with customers failing to meet their contractual obligations
may also result in a net realizable value adjustment to the average cost of inventory to reflect the lower of cost or fair market value.
Additionally, changing prices could potentially impact the volume of raw materials available to us, the volume of ore and processed metal
sold by us and inventory levels. The cyclical nature of our businesses tends to reflect and be amplified by changes in general economic
conditions, both domestically and internationally. 

18 

Risk Factors Related to Our General Operations 

The current geographic concentration where
we provide services creates an exposure to local economies, regional downturns or severe weather or catastrophic occurrences that may
materially adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations. 

We currently conduct our commodities trading
business in Shanghai and Shenzhen. We currently hold all our commodities inventory at the warehouses we rent in Shanghai and Shenzhen.
While we have insurance to cover certain losses on those commodities, events such as theft, fire, flood, or hail could adversely impact
our business. 

In addition, our business is currently more susceptible
to regional conditions than the operations of more geographically diversified competitors, and we are vulnerable to economic downturns
in those regions. Any unforeseen events or circumstances that negatively affect these areas could materially adversely affect our revenues
and profitability. These factors include, among other things, changes in demographics and population. In addition, severe weather conditions,
acts of God and other catastrophic occurrences in the area in which we operate or from which we obtain inventory may materially adversely
affect our financial condition and results of operations. Such conditions may result in physical damage to our properties and loss of
inventory. Any of these factors may disrupt our business and materially adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations.
Furthermore, there can be no assurance that we will be able to successfully replicate our business model and achieve levels of success
as we enter new geographic markets. 

Our failure to maintain a reputation of integrity
and to otherwise maintain and enhance our brand could adversely affect our business and results of operations. 

Our business model is based on our ability to
provide customers with commodities trading that we believe will save them time and money. If we fail to build and maintain a positive
reputation, or if an event occurs that damages this reputation, it could adversely affect consumer demand and have a material adverse
effect on our business and results of operations. Even the perception of a decrease in the quality of our brand could negatively impact
results. 

Complaints or negative publicity about our business
practices, marketing and advertising campaigns, compliance with applicable laws and regulations, the integrity of the data that we provide
to users, and other aspects of our business, especially on industry-specific blogs and social media websites, and irrespective of their
validity, could diminish consumer confidence in our services and adversely affect our brand. The growing use of social media increases
the speed with which information and opinions can be shared and, thus, the speed with which reputation can be affected. If we fail to
correct or mitigate misinformation or negative information, including information spread through social media or traditional media channels,
about us, the vehicles we offer, our customer experience, or any aspect of our brand, it could have a material adverse effect on our
business and results of operations. 

Failure to adequately protect our intellectual
property, technology and confidential information could harm our business and operating results. 

Our business depends on our intellectual property,
technology and confidential information, the protection of which is crucial to the success of our business. We attempt to protect our
intellectual property, technology and confidential information by requiring certain of our employees and consultants to enter into confidentiality
agreements and certain third parties to enter into nondisclosure agreements. In addition, these agreements may not effectively prevent
unauthorized use or disclosure of our confidential information, intellectual property or technology and may not provide an adequate remedy
in the event of unauthorized use or disclosure of our confidential information, intellectual property, or technology. Despite our efforts
to protect our intellectual property, unauthorized parties may attempt to copy aspects of our website features, software and functionality
or obtain and use information that we consider proprietary. Changes in the law or adverse court rulings may also negatively affect our
ability to prevent others from using our technology. 

We may be subject to claims asserting that
our employees, consultants or advisors have wrongfully used or disclosed alleged trade secrets of their current or former employees or
claims asserting ownership of what we regard as our own intellectual property. 

Although we try to ensure that our employees,
consultants and advisors do not use the proprietary information or know-how of others in their work for us, we may be subject to claims
that these individuals or we have used or disclosed intellectual property, including trade secrets or other proprietary information,
of any such individual s current or former employer. Litigation may be necessary to defend against these claims. If we fail in
defending any such claims, in addition to paying monetary damages, we may lose valuable intellectual property rights or personnel. Even
if we are successful in defending against such claims, litigation could result in substantial costs and be a distraction to management. 

19 

In addition, while we intend to require our employees
and contractors who may be involved in the conception or development of intellectual property to execute agreements assigning such intellectual
property to us, we may be unsuccessful in executing such an agreement with each party who, in fact, conceives or develops intellectual
property that we regard as our own. The assignment of intellectual property may not be self-executing or the assignment agreement may
be breached, and we may be forced to bring claims against third parties, or defend claims that they may bring against us, to determine
the ownership of what we regard as our intellectual property. 

We may in the future be subject to intellectual
property disputes, which are costly to defend and could harm our business and operating results. 

We may, from time to time, face allegations that
we have infringed the trademarks, copyrights, patents and other intellectual property rights of third parties. We may be unaware of the
intellectual property rights that others may claim cover some or all of our technology or services. Patent and other intellectual property
litigation may be protracted and expensive, the results are difficult to predict and may require us to stop offering some features, purchase
licenses or modify our products and features while we develop non-infringing substitutes or may result in significant settlement costs. 

Even if these matters do not result in litigation,
are resolved in our favor or without significant cash settlements, these matters, and the time and resources necessary to litigate or
resolve them, could harm our business, our operating results and our reputation. 

We may be subject to legal proceedings in
the ordinary course of our business. If the outcomes of these proceedings are adverse to us, they could have a material adverse effect
on our business, results of operations and financial condition. 

We may be subject to various litigation matters
from time to time, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. Claims
arising out of actual or alleged violations of law could be asserted against us by individuals, either individually or through class
actions, by governmental entities in civil or criminal investigations, and proceedings or by other entities. These claims could be asserted
under a variety of laws, including but not limited to consumer finance laws, consumer protection laws, intellectual property laws, privacy
laws, labor and employment laws, securities laws and employee benefit laws. These actions could expose us to adverse publicity and to
substantial monetary damages and legal defense costs, injunctive relief and criminal and civil fines and penalties, including but not
limited to suspension or revocation of licenses to conduct business. 

In the event we are not able to get refund
from Harrison Fund, we will suffer significant losses. 

In May 2019, the Company invested an aggregate
of 1,000,000 to purchase financial products from Harrison Fund, LLC Harrison Fund ), a private equity fund, for
investment return. On April 6, 2020, we filed a law suit against Harrison Fund in California seeking the full refund of the 1,000,000
investment because we identified problematic information in Harrison Fund s brochure. Based on the current stage of the proceedings
in this case, the outcome of this legal proceeding, including the anticipated legal costs, remains uncertain. Therefore, we recorded a
full investment impairment loss of 1,000,000, which was reflected in the consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive income
(loss). We may incur significant legal fees, settlements or damages awards resulting from this or other civil litigation. If this matter
is not resolved in our favor, it could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and cash flows. 

Failure to comply with the United States Foreign
Corrupt Practices Act could subject us to penalties and other adverse consequences. 

We are subject to the United States Foreign Corrupt
Practices Act, or FCPA, which generally prohibits United States companies from engaging in bribery or other prohibited payments to foreign
officials for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business. We have implemented these policies through our Code of Conduct. Corruption,
extortion, bribery, pay-offs, theft and other fraudulent practices occur from time-to-time in China. While we make every effort to comply
with FCPA and our company Code of Conduct, we can make no assurance that our employees or other agents will not engage in such conduct
for which we might be held responsible. If our employees or other agents are found to have engaged in such practices, we could suffer
severe penalties and other consequences that will likely have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results
of operations. 

20 

We have identified material weaknesses in
our internal control over financial reporting, and we cannot provide assurances that these weaknesses will be effectively remediated
or that additional material weaknesses will not occur in the future. If our internal control over financial reporting or our disclosure
controls and procedures are not effective, we may not be able to accurately report our financial results, prevent fraud or file our periodic
reports in a timely manner, which may cause investors to lose confidence in our reported financial information and which may lead to
a decline in our stock price. 

As discussed in Part II, Item 9A. Controls
and Procedures, our management has identified material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting, which were
not remediated as of December 31, 2022. A material weakness is a deficiency, or a combination of deficiencies, in internal control over
financial reporting such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of the registrant s annual or interim
financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis. 

As of the date of this annual report, we are
re-assessing the design of our controls and modifying processes. However, there can be no assurance that we will be able to fully remediate
our existing material weaknesses or that our internal control over financial reporting will not suffer in the future from other material
weaknesses, thus making us unable to prevent or detect on a timely basis material misstatement in our periodic reports with the SEC.
If we fail to remediate these material weaknesses or otherwise maintain effective internal control over financial reporting in the future,
the existence of one or more internal control deficiencies could result in errors in our financial statements, and substantial costs
and resources may be required to rectify internal control deficiencies. If we cannot produce reliable financial reports, we may have
difficulty in filing timely periodic reports with the SEC, investors could lose confidence in our reported financial information, the
market price of our stock could decline significantly, we may be unable to obtain additional financing to operate and expand our business,
and our business and financial condition could be materially harmed. In addition, any failure to remediate the existing material weaknesses
or a failure to maintain effective internal control over financial reporting could negatively impact our results of operations, cash
flows and financial condition, subject us to potential litigation and regulatory inquiry and cause us to incur additional costs in future
periods relating to the implementation of remedial measures. 

Matters relating to or arising from the restatements,
Audit Committee investigation and the associated material weaknesses identified in our internal control over financial reporting, including
adverse publicity, have caused us to incur significant legal, accounting and other professional fees and other costs, have exposed us
to greater risks associated with other civil litigation, regulatory proceedings and government enforcement actions, have diverted resources
and attention that would otherwise be directed toward our operations and implementation of our business strategy and may impact our ability
to attract and retain customers, employees and vendors, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial
condition and results of operations. 

Risks Relating to Our Corporate Structure 

The failure to comply with PRC regulations
relating to mergers and acquisitions of domestic enterprises by offshore SPV may subject us to severe fines or penalties and create other
regulatory uncertainties regarding our corporate structure. 

On August 8, 2006, MOFCOM, joined by the CSRC,
the State-owned Assets Supervision and Administration Commission of the State Council, the SAT, the State Administration for Industry
and Commerce SAIC ), and SAFE, jointly promulgated regulations entitled the Provisions Regarding Mergers and Acquisitions
of Domestic Enterprises by Foreign Investors M A Rules ), which took effect as of September 8, 2006, and as amended
on June 22, 2009. This regulation, among other things, has certain provisions that require offshore SPV formed for the purpose of acquiring
PRC domestic companies and controlled directly or indirectly by PRC individuals and companies, to obtain the approval of MOFCOM prior
to engaging in such acquisitions and to obtain the approval of the CSRC prior to publicly listing their securities on an overseas stock
market. On September 21, 2006, the CSRC published on its official website a notice specifying the documents and materials that are required
to be submitted for obtaining CSRC approval. 

The application of the M A Rules with respect
to our corporate structure remains unclear, with no current consensus existing among leading PRC law firms regarding the scope and applicability
of the M A Rules. We believe that the MOFCOM and CSRC approvals under the M A Rules were not required in the context of our share
exchange transaction because at such time the share exchange was a foreign related transaction governed by foreign laws, not subject
to the jurisdiction of PRC laws and regulations. However, we cannot be certain that the relevant PRC government agencies, including the
CSRC and MOFCOM, would reach the same conclusion, and we cannot be certain that MOFCOM or the CSRC will not deem that the transactions
effected by the share exchange circumvented the M A Rules, and other rules and notices, or that prior MOFCOM or CSRC approval is
required for overseas financing. Further, we cannot rule out the possibility that the relevant PRC government agencies, including MOFCOM,
would deem that the M A Rules required us or our entities in China to obtain approval from MOFCOM or other PRC regulatory agencies
in connection with Hao Limo s control of Beijing Tianxing through contractual arrangements. 

21 

If the CSRC, MOFCOM, or another PRC regulatory
agency subsequently determines that CSRC, MOFCOM or other approval was required for the share exchange transaction and/or the VIE arrangements
between Hao Limo and Beijing Tianxing, or if prior CSRC approval for overseas financings is required and not obtained, we may face severe
regulatory actions or other sanctions from MOFCOM, the CSRC or other PRC regulatory agencies. In such event, these regulatory agencies
may impose fines or other penalties on our operations in the PRC, limit our operating privileges in the PRC, delay or restrict the repatriation
of the proceeds from overseas financings into the PRC, restrict or prohibit payment or remittance of dividends to us or take other actions
that could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, reputation and prospects, as well
as the trading price of our Common Stock. The CSRC or other PRC regulatory agencies may also take actions requiring us, or making it
advisable for us, to delay or cancel overseas financings, to restructure our current corporate structure, or to seek regulatory approvals
that may be difficult or costly to obtain. 

The M A Rules, along with certain foreign
exchange regulations discussed below, will be interpreted or implemented by the relevant government authorities in connection with our
future offshore financings or acquisitions, and we cannot predict how they will affect our acquisition strategy. For example, Beijing
Tianxing s ability to remit its profits to us, or to engage in foreign-currency-denominated borrowings, may be conditioned upon
compliance with the SAFE registration requirements by such Chinese domestic residents, over whom we may have no control. 

Regulations relating to offshore investment
activities by PRC residents may limit our ability to acquire PRC companies and could adversely affect our business. 

In July 2014, SAFE promulgated the Circular
on Issues Concerning Foreign Exchange Administration over the Overseas Investment and Financing and Roundtrip Investment by Domestic Residents
via SPV , or Circular 37, which replaced Relevant Issues Concerning Foreign Exchange Control on Domestic Residents Corporate
Financing and Roundtrip Investment through Offshore SPV , or Circular 75. Circular 37 requires PRC residents to register with local
branches of SAFE in connection with their direct establishment or indirect control of an offshore entity, referred to in Circular 37 as
a SPV for the purpose of holding domestic or offshore assets or interests. Circular 37 further requires amendment to a PRC
resident s registration in the event of any significant changes with respect to the SPV, such as an increase or decrease in the
capital contributed by PRC individuals, share transfer or exchange, merger, division or other material event. Under these regulations,
PRC residents failure to comply with specified registration procedures may result in restrictions being imposed on the foreign
exchange activities of the relevant PRC entity, including the payment of dividends and other distributions to its offshore parent, as
well as restrictions on capital inflows from the offshore entity to the PRC entity, including restrictions on its ability to contribute
additional capital to its PRC subsidiaries. Further, failure to comply with the SAFE registration requirements could result in penalties
under PRC law for evasion of foreign exchange regulations. 

In addition, different local SAFE branches may
have different views and procedures as to the interpretation and implementation of the SAFE regulations, and it may be difficult for
our ultimate shareholders or beneficial owners who are PRC residents to provide sufficient supporting documents required by the SAFE
or to complete the required registration with the SAFE in a timely manner, or at all. Any failure by any of our shareholders who is a
PRC resident, or is controlled by a PRC resident, to comply with relevant requirements under these regulations could subject us to fines
or sanctions imposed by the PRC government. 

Risks Related to Ownership of our Common Stock 

If We have not been in compliance with Nasdaq s
requirements for continued listing and our common stock may be delisted from trading on Nasdaq, which would have a material effect on
us and our stockholders. 

If We were delinquent in the filing of our periodic
reports with the SEC, we will not be in compliance with listing requirements of The Nasdaq Stock Market LLC Nasdaq Listing Rule 5250(c)(1), which requires timely filing of periodic financial reports with the SEC. Under Nasdaq s listing rules,
we would be permitted to submit to Nasdaq a plan to regain compliance with the Nasdaq listing rules. However, there can be no guarantee
that Nasdaq will accept our compliance plan, grant us the extension or that we will be able to file by the extended compliance period,
in which case our common stock may be subject to delisting by Nasdaq. If our common stock is delisted, there can no assurance whether
or when it would be listed for trading on Nasdaq or any other exchange. If our common stock is delisted, the market price of our shares
will likely decline and become more volatile, and our stockholders may find that their ability to trade in our stock will be adversely
affected. Furthermore, institutions whose charters do not allow them to hold securities in unlisted companies might sell our shares,
which could have a further adverse effect on the price of our stock. 

22 

We do not expect to declare or pay dividends
in the foreseeable future. 

We do not expect to declare or pay dividends
in the foreseeable future, as we anticipate that we will invest future earnings in the development and growth of our business. Therefore,
holders of our Common Stock will not receive any return on their investment unless they sell their securities, and holders may be unable
to sell their securities on favorable terms or at all. 

Future issuances of our Common Stock or securities
convertible into, or exercisable or exchangeable for, our common stock Securities ), or the expiration of lock-up agreements
that restrict the issuance of new Common Stock or the trading of outstanding Common Stock, could cause the market price of our Common
Stock to decline and would result in the dilution of your holdings. 

Future issuances of our Securities, or the expiration
of lock-up agreements that restrict the issuance of new Common Stock or the trading of outstanding Common Stock, could cause the market
price of our Common Stock to decline. We cannot predict the effect, if any, of future issuances of our Securities, or the future expirations
of lock-up agreements, on the price of our Common Stock. In all events, future issuances of our Common Stock would result in the dilution
of your holdings. In addition, the perception that new issuances of our Securities could occur, or the perception that locked-up parties
will sell their securities when the lock-ups expire, could adversely affect the market price of our Common Stock. In addition to any
adverse effects that may arise upon the expiration of these lock-up agreements, the lock-up provisions in these agreements may be waived,
at any time and without notice. If the restrictions under the lock-up agreements are waived, our Common Stock may become available for
resale, subject to applicable law, including without notice, which could reduce the market price for our Common Stock. 

The Company has outstanding warrants having
a cashless exercise feature and may cause dilution to existing stockholders. 

As part of its Registered Direct Offerings in
2019, the Company issued warrants to purchase an aggregate of 2,760,000 shares of common stock. The warrants have a cashless exercise
feature giving the holders the option of exercising the warrants on a cashless basis if there is no effective registration statement
covering the common stock issuable upon exercise of these warrants. If the warrant shares are issued in such a cashless exercise, the
warrant shares will take on the characteristics of the warrants being exercised, and the holding period of the warrant shares being issued
may be tacked on to the holding period of the warrants in accordance with Section 3(a)(9). 

The Company would not receive any proceeds from
the exercise of warrants issued to the holder in such a cashless exercise, causing dilution to existing stockholders with no corresponding
influx of capital. This may affect our ability to raise additional equity capital. 

Our common stock may be thinly traded and
our stockholders may be unable to sell at or near ask prices or at all if they need to sell their shares to raise money or otherwise
desire to liquidate their shares. 

Our Common Stock may be thinly-traded ,
meaning that the number of persons interested in purchasing our Common Stock at or near bid prices at any given time may be relatively
small or non-existent. This situation may be attributable to a number of factors, including the fact that we are a small company which
is relatively unknown to stock analysts, stock brokers, institutional investors and others in the investment community that generate
or influence sales volume, and that even if we came to the attention of such persons, they tend to be risk-averse and might be reluctant
to follow an unproven company such as ours or purchase or recommend the purchase of our shares until such time as we became more seasoned.
As a consequence, there may be periods of several days or more when trading activity in our shares is minimal or non-existent, as compared
to a seasoned issuer which has a large and steady volume of trading activity that will generally support continuous sales without an
adverse effect on share price. Broad or active public trading market for our Common Stock may not develop or be sustained. 

23 

The market price for our common stock may be
volatile and subject to wide fluctuations due to factors such as: 

the perception of U.S.
 investors and regulators of U.S. listed Chinese companies; 

actual or anticipated fluctuations
 in our operating results; 

changes in financial estimates
 by securities research analysts; 

negative publicity, studies
 or reports; 

changes in the economic
 performance or market valuations of other microcredit companies; 

announcements by us or
 our competitors of acquisitions, strategic partnerships, joint ventures or capital commitments; 

addition or departure of
 key personnel; 

fluctuations of exchange
 rates between RMB and the U.S. dollar; and 

general economic or political
 conditions in China. 

In addition, the securities market has from time
to time experienced significant price and volume fluctuations that are not related to the operating performance of particular companies.
These market fluctuations may also materially and adversely affect the market price of our common stock. 

Volatility in our common stock price may subject
us to securities litigation. 

The market for our common stock may have, when
compared to seasoned issuers, significant price volatility and we expect that our share price may continue to be more volatile than that
of a seasoned issuer for the indefinite future. In the past, plaintiffs have often initiated securities class action litigation against
a company following periods of volatility in the market price of its securities. We may, in the future, be the target of similar litigation.
Securities litigation could result in substantial costs and liabilities and could divert management s attention and resources. 

Provisions in our by-laws and Delaware laws
might discourage, delay or prevent a change of control of our company or changes in our management and, therefore, depress the trading
price of our common stock. 

Provisions of our by-laws and Delaware laws may
discourage, delay or prevent a merger, acquisition or other change in control that stockholders may consider favorable, including transactions
in which you might otherwise receive a premium for your shares of our common stock. These provisions may also prevent or frustrate attempts
by our stockholders to replace or remove our management. These provisions include: 

the inability of stockholders
 to act by written consent or to call special meetings; 

the ability of our board
 of directors to make, alter or repeal our by-laws; and 

the ability of our board
 of directors to designate the terms of and issue new series of preferred stock without stockholder approval. 

In addition, we are subject to Section 203 of
the Delaware General Corporation Law, which generally prohibits a Delaware corporation from engaging in any of a broad range of business
combinations with an interested stockholder for a period of three years following the date on which the stockholder became an interested
stockholder, unless such transactions are approved by our board of directors. The existence of the foregoing provisions and anti-takeover
measures could limit the price that investors might be willing to pay in the future for shares of our common stock. They could also deter
potential acquirers of our company, thereby reducing the likelihood that you could receive a premium for your common stock in an acquisition. 

24 

We are obligated to develop and maintain proper
and effective internal control over financial reporting. We may not complete our analysis of our internal control over financial reporting
in a timely manner, or these internal controls may not be determined to be effective, which may adversely affect investor confidence
in our company and, as a result, the value of our common stock. 

We will be required, pursuant to Section 404
of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, to furnish a report by management on, among other things, the effectiveness of our internal control over financial
reporting for fiscal 2014, the first fiscal year beginning after our initial public offering. This assessment will need to include disclosure
of any material weaknesses identified by our management in our internal control over financial reporting and, after we cease to be an
 emerging growth company, a statement that our independent registered public accounting firm has issued an opinion on our
internal control over financial reporting. 

We are in the early stages of the costly and
challenging process of compiling the system and processing documentation necessary to perform the evaluation needed to comply with Section
404. We may not be able to complete our evaluation, testing and any required remediation in a timely fashion. During the evaluation and
testing process, if we identify one or more material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting, we will be unable to
assert that our internal controls are effective. 

If we are unable to assert that our internal
control over financial reporting is effective, or if, when required, our independent registered public accounting firm is unable to express
an opinion on the effectiveness of our internal controls, we could lose investor confidence in the accuracy and completeness of our financial
reports, which would cause the price of our Common Stock to decline, and we may be subject to investigation or sanctions by the SEC. 

We will be required to disclose changes made
in our internal controls and procedures on a quarterly basis. 

Risks Related to Doing Business in China 

Changes in China s economic, political
or social conditions or government policies could have a material adverse effect on our business and operations. 

Substantially all of our assets and operations
are located in the PRC. Accordingly, our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects may be influenced to a significant
degree by political, economic and social conditions in the PRC generally. The Chinese economy differs from the economies of most developed
countries in many respects, including the level of government involvement, development, growth rate, control of foreign exchange and
allocation of resources. Although the Chinese government has implemented measures emphasizing the utilization of market forces for economic
reform, the reduction of state ownership of productive assets, and the establishment of improved corporate governance in business enterprises,
a substantial portion of productive assets in the PRC is still owned by the government. In addition, the Chinese government continues
to play a significant role in regulating industry development by imposing industrial policies. The Chinese government also exercises
significant control over the PRC s economic growth through allocating resources, controlling payment of foreign currency-denominated
obligations, setting monetary policy and providing preferential treatment to particular industries or companies. 

While the Chinese economy has experienced significant
growth over past decades, growth has been uneven, both geographically and among various sectors of the economy. Any adverse changes in
economic conditions in the PRC, in the policies of the Chinese government or in the laws and regulations in the PRC could have a material
adverse effect on the overall economic growth of the PRC. Such developments could adversely affect our business and operating results,
lead to a reduction in demand for our services and adversely affect our competitive position. The Chinese government has implemented
various measures to encourage economic growth and guide the allocation of resources. Some of these measures may benefit the overall Chinese
economy, but may have a negative effect on us. For example, our financial condition and results of operations may be adversely affected
by government control over capital investments or changes in tax regulations. In addition, in the past the Chinese government has implemented
certain measures, including interest rate adjustment, to control the pace of economic growth. These measures may cause decreased economic
activity in the PRC, which may adversely affect our business and operating results. 

Uncertainties with respect to the PRC legal
system could adversely affect us. 

The PRC legal system is a civil law system based
on written statutes. Unlike the common law system, prior court decisions under the civil law system may be cited for reference but have
limited precedential value. 

In 1979, the PRC government began to promulgate
a comprehensive system of laws and regulations governing economic matters generally. The overall effect of legislation over the past
three decades has significantly enhanced the protections afforded to various forms of foreign investments in the PRC. However, the PRC
has not developed a fully integrated legal system, and recently enacted laws and regulations may not sufficiently cover all aspects of
economic activities in the PRC. In particular, the interpretation and enforcement of these laws and regulations involve uncertainties.
Since PRC administrative and court authorities have significant discretion in interpreting and implementing statutory provisions and
contractual terms, it may be difficult to evaluate the outcome of administrative and court proceedings and the level of legal protection
we enjoy. These uncertainties may affect our judgment on the relevance of legal requirements and our ability to enforce our contractual
rights or tort claims. In addition, these regulatory uncertainties may be exploited through unmerited or frivolous legal actions or threats
in attempts to extract payments or benefits from us. 

25 

Furthermore, the PRC legal system is based in
part on government policies and internal rules, some of which are not published on a timely basis or at all and may have a retroactive
effect. As a result, we may not be aware of our violation of any of these policies and rules until sometime after the violation. In addition,
any administrative and court proceedings in the PRC may be protracted, resulting in substantial costs and diversion of resources and
management attention. 

Fluctuations in exchange rates could have
a material and adverse effect on our results of operations and the value of your investment. 

The value of the Renminbi against the U.S. dollar
and other currencies may fluctuate and is affected by, among other things, changes in political and economic conditions and the foreign
exchange policy adopted by the PRC government. It is difficult to predict how long such appreciation of RMB against the U.S. dollar may
last and when and how the relationship between the RMB and the U.S. dollar may change again. All of our revenues and substantially
all of our costs are denominated in Renminbi. We rely on dividends paid by our operating subsidiaries in China for our cash needs. Any
significant revaluation of Renminbi may materially and adversely affect our results of operations and financial position reported in
Renminbi when translated into U.S. dollars, and the value of, and any dividends payable on, the common stock in U.S. dollars. To the
extent that we need to convert U.S. dollars into Renminbi for our operations, appreciation of the Renminbi against the U.S. dollar would
have an adverse effect on the Renminbi amount we would receive. Conversely, if we decide to convert our Renminbi into U.S. dollars for
the purpose of making payments for dividends on our common stock or for other business purposes, appreciation of the U.S. dollar against
the Renminbi would have a negative effect on the U.S. dollar amount. 

U.S. regulatory bodies may be limited in their
ability to conduct investigations or inspections of our operations in China. 

Any disclosure of documents or information located
in China by foreign agencies may be subject to jurisdiction constraints and must comply with China s state secrecy laws, which
broadly define the scope of state secrets to include matters involving economic interests and technologies. There is no
guarantee that requests from U.S. federal or state regulators or agencies to investigate or inspect our operations will be honored by
us, by entities who provide services to us or with whom we associate, without violating PRC legal requirements, especially as those entities
are located in China. Furthermore, under the current PRC laws, an on-site inspection of our facilities by any of these regulators may
be limited or prohibited. 

General Risk Factors 

Our business, results of operations
and financial condition may be adversely affected by global public health epidemics, including the strain of coronavirus known as COVID-19.

Our business could be adversely affected
by the effects of health pandemics or epidemics, including the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, the evolution of which continues to be uncertain.
We have taken temporary precautionary measures intended to help minimize the risk of the virus to our employees, our customers, which
could negatively impact our business. As a result of COVID-19, we incurred increased costs for our operations, performed our operations
remotely and experienced difficulty in recruiting personnel. 

In addition, with the extended Chinese
business shutdowns that resulted from the outbreak of COVID-19, we may experience delays or the inability to service our customers on
a timely basis in our commodities trading business. The disruptions to our supply chain and business operations, or to our suppliers 
or customers supply chains and business operations, could include disruptions from the closure of our interruptions in the supply
of commodities, personnel absences, and delivery and storage of commodities, any of which could have adverse ripple effects on our commodities
trading business. If we need to close any of our facilities or a critical number of our employees become too ill to work, our ability
to provide our products and services to our customers could be materially adversely affected in a rapid manner. Similarly, if our customers
experience adverse business consequences due to COVID-19, or any other pandemic, demand for our products and services could also be materially
adversely affected in a rapid manner. Global health concerns, such as COVID-19, could also result in social, economic, and labor instability
in the localities in which we or our suppliers and customers operate within China. 

While the potential economic impact brought
by and the duration of COVID-19 may be difficult to assess or predict, a widespread pandemic could result in significant disruption of
global financial markets, reducing our ability to access capital, which could in the future negatively affect our liquidity. In addition,
a recession or market correction resulting from the spread of COVID-19 could materially affect our business and the value of our common
stock. While it is too early to tell whether COVID-19 will have a material effect on our business over time, we continue to monitor the
situation as it unfolds. The extent to which COVID-19 affects our results will depend on many factors and future developments, including
new information about COVID-19 and any new government regulations which may emerge to contain the virus, among others. 

26 

The elimination of monetary liability against
our directors, officers and employees under our certificate of incorporation and the existence of indemnification of our directors, officers
and employees under Delaware law may result in substantial expenditures by us and may discourage lawsuits against our directors, officers
and employees. 

Our certificate of incorporation contains
provisions which eliminate the liability of our directors for monetary damages to us and our stockholders to the maximum extent permitted
under the corporate laws of Delaware. We may also provide contractual indemnification obligations under agreements with our directors,
officers and employees. These indemnification obligations could result in our incurring substantial expenditures to cover the cost of
settlement or damage awards against directors, officers and employees, which we may be unable to recoup. These provisions and resultant
costs may also discourage us from bringing a lawsuit against directors, officers and employees for breach of their fiduciary duties,
and may similarly discourage the filing of derivative litigation by our shareholders against our directors, officers and employees even
though such actions, if successful, might otherwise benefit the Company and our shareholders. 

We expect that we will require additional
debt and equity capital to pursue our business objectives and respond to business opportunities, challenges and/or unforeseen circumstances.
If such capital is not available to us, or is not available on favorable terms, our business, operating results and financial condition
may be harmed. 

We expect that we will require additional
capital to pursue our business objectives and respond to business opportunities, challenges and/or unforeseen circumstances, including
to increase our marketing expenditures in order to improve our brand awareness, build our non-ferrous metal inventory, develop new customers,
enhance our operating infrastructure and acquire complementary technologies. Accordingly, we may need to engage in equity, debt or other
types of financings to secure additional funds. Additional funds may not be available when we need them on terms that are acceptable
to us, or at all. In addition, any debt financing that we secure in the future could involve restrictive covenants which may make it
more difficult for us to obtain additional capital and to pursue business opportunities. 

Volatility in the credit markets may
also have an adverse effect on our ability to obtain debt financing. If we raise additional funds through further issuances of equity
or convertible debt securities, our existing stockholders could suffer significant dilution, and any new equity securities we issue could
have rights, preferences and privileges superior to those of our Common Stock. If we are unable to obtain adequate financing or financing
on terms satisfactory to us when we require it, our ability to continue to pursue our business objectives and to respond to business
opportunities, challenges or unforeseen circumstances could be significantly limited, and our business, operating results, financial
condition and prospects could be adversely affected. 

Increasing scrutiny and changing expectations
from investors, lenders, customers, and other market participants with respect to our Environmental, Social and Governance ESG policies and activities may impose additional costs on us or expose us to additional risks. 

Companies across all industries and around
the globe are facing increasing scrutiny relating to their ESG policies, initiatives and activities by investors, lenders, customers,
and other market participants. In the U.S., amongst other regulatory efforts, in March 2021, the SEC announced the creation of a Climate
and ESG Task Force in the Division of Enforcement and in March 2022, the SEC proposed rules that would require public companies to disclose
certain climate-related information in periodic filings with the SEC. Our disclosures on these matters or a failure to satisfy evolving
stakeholder expectations for ESG practices and reporting may potentially harm our reputation and impact employee retention and access
to capital. In addition, our failure, or perceived failure, to pursue or fulfill our goals, targets, and objectives or to satisfy various
reporting standards within the timelines we announce, or at all, could expose us to government enforcement actions and private litigation. 

We expect regulatory requirements related
to ESG matters to continue to expand globally and increase our costs of compliance. Our ability to achieve any goal or objective, including
with respect to environmental and diversity initiatives and compliance with ESG reporting standards, is subject to numerous risks, many
of which are outside of our control. Examples of such risks include the availability and cost of technologies and products that meet
sustainability, evolving regulatory requirements affecting ESG standards or disclosures, our ability to recruit, develop, and retain
diverse talent in our labor markets, and our ability to develop reporting processes and controls that comply with evolving standards
for identifying, measuring and reporting ESG metrics. As ESG best-practices, reporting standards, and disclosure requirements continue
to develop, we may incur increasing costs related to maintaining or achieving our ESG goals in addition to ESG monitoring and reporting.
We risk damage to our brand and reputation, impacts to our ability to secure government contracts, or limited access to capital markets
and loans if we fail to adapt to, or comply with, investor, lender, customer or other stakeholder expectations and standards and potential
government regulation with respect to ESG matters, including in areas such as diversity and inclusion, environmental stewardship, support
for local communities and corporate governance and transparency. 

27 

Our business could be negatively impacted
by the inflationary pressures which may decrease our operating margins and increase working capital investments required to operate our
business. 

The U.S. economy has experienced rising
inflation in 2022. A sustained increase in inflation may continue to increase our costs for labor, services, and materials. Further our
customers face inflationary pressures and resulting impacts, such as the tight labor market and supply chain disruptions. The rate and
scope of these various inflationary factors may increase our operating costs and capital expenditures materially, which may not be readily
recoverable in the prices of our services and may have an adverse effect on our costs, operating margins, results of operations and financial
condition. Additionally, Federal Reserve policies to combat inflationary pressures, including the significant increases in prevailing
interest rates that occurred during 2022 as a result of the 425 aggregate basis point increase in the federal funds rate, and the associated
macroeconomic impact on slowdown in economic growth, could negatively impact our business. 

Our information systems or data, or those
of our service providers or customers or users could be subject to cyber-attacks or other security incidents, which could result in data
breaches, intellectual property theft, claims, litigation, regulatory investigations, significant liability, reputational damage and other
adverse consequences . 

We have continued to expand our information technology
systems as our operations grow. While we maintain information technology measures designed to protect us against intellectual property
theft, data breaches, sabotage and other external or internal cyber-attacks or misappropriation, our systems and those of our service
providers are potentially vulnerable to malware, ransomware, viruses, denial-of-service attacks, phishing attacks, social engineering,
computer hacking, unauthorized access, exploitation of bugs, defects and vulnerabilities, breakdowns, damage, interruptions, system malfunctions,
power outages, terrorism, acts of vandalism, security breaches, security incidents, inadvertent or intentional actions by employees or
other third parties, and other cyber-attacks. To the extent any security incident results in unauthorized access or damage to or acquisition,
use, corruption, loss, destruction, alteration or dissemination of our data, it could disrupt our business, harm our reputation, compel
us to comply with applicable data breach notification laws, subject us to time consuming, distracting and expensive litigation, regulatory
investigation and oversight, mandatory corrective action, require us to verify the correctness of database contents, or otherwise subject
us to liability under laws, regulations and contractual obligations, including those that protect the privacy and security of personal
information. This could result in increased costs to us and result in significant legal and financial exposure and/or reputational harm. 

We also rely on service providers, and similar
incidents relating to their information technology systems could also have a material adverse effect on our business. Our service providers,
including our workforce management software provider, may be subject to ransomware and other security incidents, and we cannot guarantee
that our or our service providers systems have not been breached or that they do not contain exploitable defects, bugs, or vulnerabilities
that could result in a security incident, or other disruption to, our or our service providers systems. Our ability to monitor
our service providers security measures is limited, and, in any event, malicious third parties may be able to circumvent those
security measures.

2020 Court Matter with Harrison Fund 

On April 6, 2020, the Company filed a lawsuit
against Harrison Fund in the United States District Court for the Northern District of California (Case No. 3:20-cv-2307). The Company
invested 1,000,000 in Harrison Fund around May 2019. However, Harrison Fund had been reluctant to disclose related investment information
to the Company and it was discovered that certain information presented in Harrison Fund s brochure appeared to be problematic.
The Company demanded a return of its investment from Harrison Fund. When the Company failed to obtain a response from Harrison Fund,
it filed the complaint against Harrison Fund seeking to recover the 1,000,000 investment. 

Due to the uncertainty arising from this pending
legal proceeding, a full impairment has been applied against the Company s investment in financial products.

Dividends 

We did not declare or pay any dividend in 2022
and do not plan to do so in the foreseeable future. Although we intend to retain our earnings, if any, to finance the growth of our business,
our board of directors will have the discretion to declare and pay dividends in the future, subject to applicable PRC regulations and
restrictions as described below. Future payment of dividends will depend upon our earnings, capital requirements, and other factors,
which our board of directors may deem relevant. 

In addition, due to various restrictions under
PRC laws on the distribution of dividends by WFOE, we may not be able to pay dividends to our stockholders. The Foreign Investment Law
of the PRC, as amended, its Implementing Rules and the Company Law of the PRC, as amended, contain the principal regulations governing
dividend distributions of wholly foreign-owned enterprises. Under these regulations, wholly foreign-owned enterprises may pay dividends
only out of their accumulated profits, if any, determined in accordance with PRC accounting standards and regulations. Additionally,
such companies are required to set aside a certain amount of their accumulated profits each year, if any, for certain reserve funds.
Our accumulated reserve funds now reach and remain above 50 of the registered capital amount. These reserves are not distributable as
cash dividends except in the event of liquidation and cannot be used for working capital purposes. Furthermore, if our subsidiaries and
affiliates in China incur debt on their own in the future, the instruments governing the debt may restrict its ability to pay dividends
or make other payments. If we or our subsidiaries and affiliates are unable to receive all of the revenues from our operations through
the current contractual arrangements, we may be unable to pay dividends on our common stock.

Overview 

As of December 31, 2022, the Company had two
business lines, which are the commodities trading business and supply chain management services. 

29 

Commodities Trading Business 

The commodity trading business primarily involves
purchasing non-ferrous metal products, such as aluminum ingots, copper, silver, and gold, from metal and mineral suppliers and then selling
to customers. In connection with the Company s commodity sales, in order to help customers to obtain sufficient funds to purchase
various metal products and also help metal and mineral suppliers to sell their metal products, the Company launched its supply chain
management service in December 2019. The Company primarily generates revenues from bulk non-ferrous commodity products, and from providing
related supply chain management services in the PRC. 

The Company sources bulk commodity products from
non-ferrous metal and mines or its designated distributors and then sells to manufacturers who need these metals in large quantities.
The Company works with suppliers in the sourcing of commodities. Major suppliers include various metal and mineral suppliers such as
Kunsteel Group, Baosteel Group, Aluminum Corporate of China Limited, Yunnan Benyuan, Yunnan Tin, and Shanghai Copper. The Company s
target customers include large infrastructure companies such as China National Electricity, Datang Power, China Aluminum Foshan International
Trade, Tooke Investment (China), CSSC International Trade Co., Ltd., Shenye Group, and Keliyuan. 

Supply Chain Management Services 

We offer a distribution service to bulk suppliers
of precious metals by acting as a sales intermediary, procuring small to medium-sized buyers through our own professional sales team
and channels and distributing to them the bulk precious metals of the suppliers. Upon the execution of a purchase order from our sourced
buyers, we charge the suppliers with a commission fee ranging from 1 to 2 of the distribution order, depending on the size of the order.
For the year ended December 31, 2022, the Company earned commodity distribution commission fees of 1,391,903 from facilitating such
sales transactions with twenty third party customers. For the year ended December 31, 2021, the Company earned commodity distribution
commission fees of 3,180,227 from facilitating such sales transactions with thirty-four third party customers. 

Competition 

The Company mainly competes against other large
domestic commodity metal product trading service providers such as Xiamen International Trade and Yijian Shares. Currently, the principal
competitive factors in the non-ferrous metal commodities trading business are price, product availability, quantity, service, and financing
terms for purchases and sales of commodities. 

Applicable Government Regulations 

Shenzhen Baiyu Jucheng has obtained all material
approvals, permits, licenses and certificates required for our metal product trading operations, including registrations from the local
business and administrative department authorizing the purchase of raw materials. 

Recent developments

Key Factors Affecting Our Results of Operation 

The commodities trading industry is also experiencing
decreasing demand as a result of China s overall economic slowdown. We expect competition in commodities trading business to persist
and intensify. 

We have a limited operating history having just
started our commodities trading business in late December 2019. We believe our future success depends on our ability to significantly
increase sales as well as maintain profitability from our operations. Our limited operating history makes it difficult to evaluate our
business and future prospects. You should consider our future prospects in light of the risks and challenges encountered by a company
with a limited operating history in an emerging and rapidly evolving industry. These risks and challenges include, among other things, 

our ability to continue
 our growth as well as maintain profitability; 

preservation of our competitive
 position in commodities trading industry in China; 

our ability to implement
 our strategies and make timely and effective responses to competition and changes in customer preferences; and 

recruitment, training and
 retaining of qualified managerial and other personnel. 

Our business requires a significant amount of
capital in large part due to needing to purchase a bulk volume of commodities, and expand our business in existing markets and to additional
markets where we currently do not have operations.

due to COVID-19, as well as the depreciation of RMB against USD in 2022. For the year ended December 31, 2022, our operations in Shanghai
were temporarily affected due to the sporadic outbreak of COVID-19, which resulted in a decrease in revenue. But the extent to which COVID-19

Item 9A. Controls and Procedures. 

Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures 

Based on an evaluation under the supervision and
with the participation of the Company s management, the Company s principal executive officer and principal financial officer
have concluded that the Company s disclosure controls and procedures as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange
Act were not effective as of December 31, 2022 to provide reasonable assurance that information required to be disclosed by the Company
in reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is (i) recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods
specified in the Securities and Exchange Commission SEC rules and forms, and (ii) accumulated and communicated
to the Company s management, including its principal executive officer and principal financial officer, as appropriate, to allow
timely decisions regarding required disclosure. 

Inherent Limitations over Internal Controls 

The Company s internal control over financial
reporting is designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial
statements for external purposes in accordance with U.S. GAAP. The Company s internal control over financial reporting includes
those policies and procedures that: 

i) 
 pertain to the maintenance
 of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the Company s assets; 

ii) 
 provide reasonable assurance
 that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with U.S. GAAP, and that
 the Company s receipts and expenditures are being made only in accordance with authorizations of the Company s management
 and directors; and 

iii) 
 provide reasonable assurance
 regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the Company s assets that could
 have a material effect on the financial statements. 

Management, including the Company s principal
executive officer and principal financial officer, does not expect that the Company s internal controls will prevent or detect
all errors and all fraud. A control system, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance
that the objectives of the control system are met. Further, the design of a control system must reflect the fact that there are resource
constraints, and the benefits of controls must be considered relative to their costs. Because of the inherent limitations in all control
systems, no evaluation of internal controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues and instances of fraud, if any, have
been detected. Also, any evaluation of the effectiveness of controls in future periods are subject to the risk that those internal controls
may become inadequate because of changes in business conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may
deteriorate.

Management s Annual Report on Internal
Control over Financial Reporting 

Our management, including our Chief Executive
Officer and our Chief Financial Officer, has assessed the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as defined
in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) of the Exchange Act as of December 31, 2022. Our internal control over financial reporting is a process
designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of our financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements
for external purposes in accordance with U.S. GAAP and includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records
that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of our company; (2) provide
reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of consolidated financial statements in accordance
with U.S. GAAP, and that receipts and expenditures of our company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of our management
and directors; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of the unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition
of our company s assets that could have a material effect on the consolidated financial statements. Because of its inherent limitations,
internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness
of our internal control over financial reporting to future periods are subject to the risks that controls may become inadequate because
of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. 

In making this assessment, management used the
criteria set forth by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO 2013) in Internal Control-Integrated
Framework. Our Management believes that, as of December 31, 2022, our internal control over financial reporting was not effective based
on those criteria. 

A material weakness is defined
under the SEC rules as a deficiency, or a combination of deficiencies, in internal control over financial reporting such that there is
a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of a company s annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented
or detected on a timely basis by our internal controls. A significant deficiency is a deficiency, or a combination of deficiencies, in
internal control over financial reporting that is less severe than a material weakness; yet important enough to merit attention by those
responsible for oversight of the Company s financial reporting. 

As a result of its review, management concluded
that we had material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting process consisting of the following: 

Certain personnel primarily responsible for the
preparation of our financial statements require additional requisite levels of knowledge, experience and training in the application
of U.S. GAAP commensurate with our financial reporting requirements. The management thought that in light of the inexperience of our
accounting staff with respect to the requirements of U.S. GAAP-based reporting and SEC rules and regulations, we did not maintain effective
controls and did not implement adequate and proper supervisory review to ensure that significant internal control deficiencies can be
detected or prevented. 

Management s assessment of the control
deficiency over accounting and finance personnel as of December 31, 2022 including: 

There is a lack of formal
 procedures with handling different types of revenue recognition. 

Company management conducted
 extensive transactions with related parties without adequate control by the Audit Committee and the Board of Directors. 

There is a lack of procedures
 and documentation for dealing with related parties. 

There was no accountant
 with adequate U.S. GAAP knowledge working in the Company s Accounting Department. Part of the Company s U.S. GAAP reporting
 function was outsourced to external consultant; 

The Company has insufficient
 written policies and procedures for accounting and financial reporting, which led to inadequate financial statement closing process. 

Based on the above factors, management concluded
that the control deficiency over accounting and finance personnel was the material weaknesses as of December 31, 2022, as our accounting
staff continues to lack sufficient U.S. GAAP experience and requires further substantial training. 

36 

Management Plan to Remediate Material Weaknesses 

We expect to implement the following measures
in 2023 to continue to remediate the material weaknesses identified: 

To establish additional
 written policies and procedures for accounting and financial reporting to improve the Company s financial statement closing
 process. 

To appoint a monitor to
 oversee corporate governance and legal compliance matters. The monitor should be appointed for a period of at least 18 months, and
 should report directly to the Audit Committee. 

To retain one or two additional
 independent, bilingual Chinese and English-speaking directors. They should assist and augment the efforts of the Company s
 current independent directors. 

To establish an internal
 audit function to assist the Audit Committee with compliance requirements and improvement of overall internal control. 

To establish and maintain
 (i) a control process for the accounting implication assessment of all significant payments, particularly those that are non-routine;
 (ii) a control process for maintaining all supporting documentation regarding all non-routine transactions. 

To continue providing applicable
 training for our financial and accounting staff in the Company s Accounting Department to enhance their understanding of U.S.
 GAAP and internal control over financial reporting. 

To continue providing applicable
 training for the Company s accounting manager to improve the Company s internal review process. 

Changes in Internal Control over Financial
Reporting 

The Company tried to make some changes (excluding
corrective actions with regard to significant deficiencies or material weaknesses) in our internal control over financial reporting during
the fourth quarter of 2022 that have materially affected or are reasonably likely to materially affect our internal control over financial
reporting. 

The Company
 has appointed a new accounting manager to improve the Company s internal review process. 

The Company has established
 additional written policies and procedures for accounting and financial reporting to improve the Company s financial statement
 closing process. 

The Company has established
 and maintained (i) a control process for the accounting implication assessment of all significant payments, particularly those that
 are non-routine; (ii) a control process for maintaining all supporting documentation regarding all non-routine transactions. 

The Company provides applicable
 training for our financial and accounting staff in the Company s Accounting Department to enhance their understanding of U.S.
 GAAP and internal control over financial reporting.

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT
REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM 

To the Board of Directors and Shareholders of 

TD Holdings, Inc and Subsidiaries 

Opinion on the Consolidated Financial Statements 

We have audited the accompanying
consolidated balance sheets of TD Holdings, Inc and its subsidiaries. (the Company as of December 31, 2022 and 2021,
the related consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive income (loss), changes in shareholders equity and cash flows,
for the year ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, and the related notes (collectively referred to as the consolidated financial
statements ). In our opinion, the financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the consolidated financial position
of the Company as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, and the consolidated results of its operations and its cash flows for the year
ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America( U.S.
GAAP ). 

Basis for Opinion 

These consolidated financial statements
are the responsibility of the Company s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these consolidated financial
statements based on our audit. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United
States) PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities
laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. 

We conducted our audit in accordance
with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether
the consolidated financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. The Company is not required to
have, nor were we engaged to perform, an audit of its internal control over financial reporting. As part of our audit, we are required
to obtain an understanding of internal control over financial reporting but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness
of the Company s internal control over financial reporting. Accordingly, we express no such opinion. 

Our audits included performing procedures
to assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing
procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures
in the consolidated financial statements. Our audit also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates
made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the consolidated financial statements. We believe that our audit
provides a reasonable basis for our opinion. 

Critical Audit Matters 

The critical audit matters communicated
below are matters arising from the current period audit of the consolidated financial statements that were communicated or required to
be communicated to the audit committee and that: (1) related to accounts or disclosures that were material to the consolidated financial
statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of the critical audit matter
does not alter in any way our opinion on the consolidated financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the
critical audit matter below, providing a separate opinion on the critical audit matter or on the accounts or disclosures to which they
relate. 

F- 2 

Valuation of Loans Receivable 

As described in Note 4 to the financial
statements, the Company monitors all loans receivable for delinquency and provides for estimated losses for specific receivables
that are not likely to be collected. As disclosed in the Note 4 to the financial statements, the balances of loans receivable from third
parties were 143.17 million as of December 31, 2022. 

The principal considerations for
our determination that auditing management s assessment of impairment of loans receivable is a critical audit matter included the
significant judgment made by management when considering factors in assessing collectability of the loan receivables as described above,
as well as the likelihood of the occurrence of these factors impacting the collectability. In turn, such management s assessment
led to challenging and subjective auditor judgment in performing our audit procedures. 

Our audit of valuation of loans receivable
included, but was not limited to, the following procedures: 

understanding of controls relating
 to management assessment of the loans receivable allowance; 

reviewing management s impairment
 assessment, including its supporting evidence such as subsequent repayments; 

examining original transaction related
 documents; 

confirming balance with the borrowers; 

searching public information for
 the operating and financial conditions of the borrowers; 

evaluating the sufficiency of the
 Company s disclosures to loans receivable. 

Goodwill-Shenzhen
Qianhai Baiyu Supply Chain Co., Ltd. Baiyu and Shenzhen Tongdow Internet Technology Co., Ltd. Tongdow Internet
Technology 

As described in Note 2 and Note 3
to the consolidated financial statements, the Company acquired the Baiyu and Tongdow Internet Technology in 2020 and 2022, respectively.
The goodwill arising on this acquisition amounted to 65.02 million and 95.19 million, respectively, as of December 31,2022. 

Management assessed goodwill for
potential impairment as of December 31 2022 by comparing the carrying amount of the cash-generating unit to which goodwill has been allocated
with the recoverable amount determined by assessing the value-in-use VIU by preparing a discounted cash flow forecast.
Preparing a discounted cash flow forecast involves the exercise of significant management judgement, in particular in forecasting revenue
growth and operating profit and in determining an appropriate discount rate 

The Company s balance of goodwill
allocated to Baiyu and Tongdow Internet Technology as of December 31,2022 was 65.02 million and 95.19 million, respectively. Goodwill
is tested for impairment on an annual basis, or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that it might be impaired.
The Company has elected to perform quantitative assessment. In the quantitative assessment, the Company s evaluation of goodwill
for impairment involves the comparison of the fair value of Baiyu and Tongdow Internet Technology to their carrying value. The Company
used the discounted cash flow model to estimate fair value, which requires management to make significant estimates and assumptions related
to discount rates and forecasts of future revenues and operating margins. Changes in these assumptions could have a significant impact
on either the fair value, the amount of any goodwill impairment charge. Based on the quantitative assessment performed, if it is more
likely than not that the fair value is less than its carrying amount. During the year ended December 31, 2022, no impairment charge on
goodwill was recognized based on the quantitative assessment performed. 

F- 3 

We identified goodwill impairment
for the Baiyu and Tongdow Internet Technology as a critical audit matter because it is the material to the consolidated financial
statements of the Company and certain significant judgments in respect of the assumption made which are inherently uncertain and could
be subject to management bias made by management to estimate the fair value of the Baiyu and Tongdow Internet Technology and the difference
between its fair value and carrying value. This required a high degree of auditor judgment and an increased extent of effort, including
the need to involve our fair value specialists, when performing audit procedures to evaluate the reasonableness of management s
estimates and assumptions related to selection of the discount rate and forecasts of future revenue and operating margin. 

Our audit procedures relating to the discount
rate and forecasts of future revenue and operating margin used by management to estimate the fair value of the Baiyu and Tongdow Internet
Technology included the following, among others: 

We evaluated management s ability to accurately forecast future revenues and operating margins by comparing actual results to management s historical forecasts. 

We evaluated the reasonableness of management s revenue and operating margin forecasts by comparing the forecasts to historical revenues and operating margins. 

With the assistance of our fair value specialists, we evaluated the reasonableness of the (1) valuation methodology and (2) discount rate by: 

a. 
 Testing the source information underlying the determination of the discount rate and the mathematical accuracy of the calculation; 

b. 
 Developing a range of independent estimates and comparing those to the discount rate selected by management.
