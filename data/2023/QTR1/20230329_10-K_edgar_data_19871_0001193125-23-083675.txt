 Form 10-K Summary 
 28 2 PART I ITEM 1 - Business Chicago Rivet Machine Co. (the Company was incorporated under the laws of the State of Illinois in December 1927, as successor to the business of Chicago Rivet Specialty Co. The Company operates in two segments of the fastener industry: fasteners and assembly equipment. The fastener segment consists of the manufacture and sale of rivets, cold-formed fasteners and parts, and screw machine products. The assembly equipment segment consists primarily of the manufacture of automatic rivet setting machines, automatic assembly equipment and parts and tools for such machines. The principal market for the Company s products is the North American automotive industry. Sales are solicited by employees and by independent sales representatives. The segments in which the Company operates are characterized by active and substantial competition. No single company dominates the industry. The Company's competitors include both larger and smaller manufacturers, and segments or divisions of large, diversified companies with substantial financial resources. Principal competitive factors in the market for the Company's products are price, quality and service. The Company serves a variety of customers. Revenues are primarily derived from sales to customers involved, directly or indirectly, in the manufacture of automobiles and automotive components. The level of business activity for the Company is closely related to the overall level of industrial activity in the United States. During 2022 sales to two customers were at least 10 of the Company s consolidated revenues. Sales to Cooper-Standard Holdings Inc. accounted for approximately 14 and 11 of the Company s consolidated revenues in 2022 and 2021, respectively. Sales to TI Group Automotive Systems, LLC accounted for approximately 15 and 13 of the Company s consolidated revenues in 2022 and 2021,respectively. Sales to Parker-Hannifin Corporation accounted for approximately 12 of the Company s consolidated revenues in 2021. The Company's business has historically been stronger during the first half of the year. The Company purchases raw material from a number of sources, primarily within the United States. There are numerous sources of raw material, and the Company does not have to rely on a single source for any of its requirements. Patents, trademarks, licenses, franchises and concessions are not of significant importance to the business of the Company. The Company does not engage in significant research activities, but rather in ongoing product improvement and development. The amounts spent on product development activities in the last two years were not material. At December 31, 2022, the Company employed 208 people. The Company has no foreign operations. Sales to foreign customers represent approximately 16 of the Company's total sales. 3 ITEM 1A - Risk Factors Our business is subject to a number of risks and uncertainties. If any of the events contemplated by the following risks actually occur, then our business, financial condition or results of operations could be materially adversely affected. Additional risks and uncertainties not currently known to us or that we currently deem to be immaterial may also materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. Our business and operations have been, and may continue to be, adversely affected by the COVID-19 pandemic. In March 2020, the World Health Organization characterized the novel coronavirus COVID-19 a pandemic and the President of the United States declared the COVID-19 outbreak a national emergency. On January 30, 2020, the World Health Organization declared a Public Health Emergency of International Concern regarding the outbreak of COVID-19. In response to the resulting pandemic, governments around the world took various preventative measures in order to control the spread of the virus, including restricting travel, full or partial business shutdowns and implementing social distancing policies. As a result, we experienced a significant drop in orders, especially in the second quarter of 2020, and the global economy was plunged into a recession. Although business conditions in our markets had improved by late in the third quarter of that year, the effects of the pandemic have continued to negatively impact our operations and those of our customers and suppliers. The duration of these effects is uncertain and will likely be tied to the course of the pandemic. As we cannot predict the duration or scope of the COVID-19 pandemic, or its broader impact on the global economy, including the demand for automobiles, it is unknown what the impact of COVID-19 and its related effects will be on our business, results of operations or financial condition, but the impact could be material and last for an extended period of time. Labor shortages could prevent us from meeting customer demand. We and some of our third-party suppliers and service providers have experienced and may continue to experience a shortage of qualified labor at our and their facilities. A prolonged shortage of qualified labor could decrease our third-party vendors ability to meet our demands and efficiently operate their facilities. Prolonged labor shortage could also lead to decreased productivity and increased labor costs from higher overtime, the need to hire temporary help to meet demand and higher wages rates in order to attract and retain employees. Any of these developments could materially increase our operating costs and have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. We are dependent on the automotive industry. Demand for our products is directly related to conditions in the global automotive industry, which is highly cyclical and is affected by a variety of factors, including regulatory requirements, international trade policies, and consumer spending and preferences. The automotive industry is characterized by fierce competition and has undergone major restructuring in recent years. The impact of evolving technological changes, including a growing emphasis on electric vehicles, as well as any decline in the automotive industry, domestic or foreign, could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. We face intense competition. We compete with a number of other manufacturers and distributors that produce and sell products similar to ours. Price, quality and service are the primary elements of competition. Our competitors include a large number of independent domestic and international suppliers. We are not as large as a number of these companies and do not have as many financial or other resources. Faced with intense international competition and pressure to reduce costs, many customers have expanded their sourcing of components worldwide. As a result, we have experienced competition from suppliers in other parts of the world that benefit from economic advantages, such as lower labor costs, lower health care costs and fewer regulatory burdens. There can be no assurance that we will be able to compete successfully with existing or new competitors. Increased competition could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. 4 We rely on sales to major customers. Our sales to two customers constituted approximately 29 of our consolidated revenues in 2022. Sales to TI Group Automotive Systems, LLC and Cooper-Standard Holdings Inc. accounted for approximately 15 and 14 of the Company's consolidated revenues in 2022, respectively. The loss of any significant portion of our sales to these customers could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. We are subject to risks related to export sales. Our export sales have increased in recent years, and we are working to continue to expand our business relationships with customers outside of the United States. Export sales are subject to various risks, including risks related to changes in local economic, social and political conditions (particularly in emerging markets), changes in tariffs and trade policies and foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. Increases in our raw material costs or difficulties with our suppliers could negatively affect us. While we currently maintain alternative sources for raw materials, our business is subject to the risk of price fluctuations and periodic delays in the delivery of certain raw materials. At various times in recent years, we have been adversely impacted by increased costs for steel, our principal raw material, which we have been unable to wholly mitigate, as well as increases in other materials prices, including price increases due to inflation. Any continued fluctuation in the price or availability of our raw materials could have a material adverse impact on our business, results of operations and financial condition. We may be adversely affected by supply chain disruptions. Many of our customers depend upon intricate just-in-time supply chain systems. A disruption in a supply chain caused by one or more suppliers, and/or an unrelated supplier, due to part shortages, work stoppages, bankruptcy, raw material shortages, natural disasters, coronavirus, tariffs, etc. could adversely impact our business, or our customers business, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition. We may be adversely affected by labor relations issues. Although none of our employees are unionized, the domestic automakers and many of their suppliers, including many of our customers, have unionized work forces. Work stoppages or slow-downs experienced by automakers or their suppliers could result in slow-downs or closures of assembly plants where our products are included in assembled components. In the event that one or more of our customers or their customers experiences a material labor relations issue, our business, results of operations and financial condition could be materially adversely affected. We may incur losses as a result of product liability, warranty or other claims that may be brought against us. We face risk of exposure to warranty and product liability claims in the event that our products fail to perform as expected or result, or are alleged to have resulted, in bodily injury, property damage or other losses. In addition, if any of our products are or are alleged to be defective, then we may be required to participate in a product recall. We may also be involved from time to time in legal proceedings and commercial or contractual disputes. Any losses or other liabilities related to these exposures could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. 5 We could be adversely impacted by environmental laws and regulations. Our operations are subject to environmental laws and regulations. Currently, environmental costs and liabilities with respect to our operations are not material, but there can be no assurance that we will not be adversely impacted by these costs and liabilities in the future either under present laws and regulations or those that may be adopted or imposed in the future. We could be adversely impacted by the loss of the services of key employees . Successful operations depend, in part, upon the efforts of executive officers and other key employees. Our future success will depend, in part, upon our ability to attract and retain qualified personnel. Loss of the services of any of our key employees, or the inability to attract or retain employees could have a material adverse affect upon our business, financial condition and results of operations. Any significant disruption, interruption or failure of our information systems could disrupt the operation of our business, result in increased costs and decreased revenues and expose us to liability. Cybersecurity threats are growing in number and sophistication and include, among others, malicious software, attempts to gain unauthorized access to data, and other electronic security breaches that could lead to disruptions in critical systems, unauthorized release of confidential or otherwise protected information and corruption of data. In addition to security threats, we are also subject to other systems failures, including network, software or hardware failures, whether caused by us, third-party service providers, natural disasters, power shortages, terrorist attacks or other events. The unavailability of our information systems, the failure of these systems to perform as anticipated or any significant breach of data security could cause loss of data, disrupt our operations, lead to financial losses from remedial actions, require significant management attention and resources, and negatively impact our reputation among our customers, which could have a negative impact on our business, results of operations and financial condition. The price of our common stock is subject to volatility, and our stock is thinly-traded. Various factors, such as general economic changes in the financial markets, announcements or significant developments with respect to the automotive industry, actual or anticipated variations in our or our competitors quarterly or annual financial results, the introduction of new products or technologies by us or our competitors, changes in other conditions or trends in our industry or in the markets of any of our significant customers, changes in governmental regulation, or changes in securities analysts estimates of our competitors or our industry, could cause the market price of our common stock to fluctuate substantially. Our common stock is traded on NYSE American (not registered, trading privileges only). The average daily trading volume for our common stock during 2022 was less than 3,000 shares per day. As a result, shares of our common stock may be difficult to sell, and the price of our common stock may vary significantly based on trading volume. 6 ITEM 1B - Unresolved Staff Comments None. ITEM 2 - Properties The Company's headquarters is located in Naperville, Illinois. The Company conducts its manufacturing and warehousing operations at three additional facilities. The Naperville property was sold during the third quarter of 2022 and was rented for the remainder of the year. Each other facility is owned by the Company and considered suitable and adequate for its present use. Of the properties described below, the Madison Heights, Michigan facility is used entirely in the fastener segment. The Albia, Iowa facility is used exclusively in the assembly equipment segment. The Tyrone, Pennsylvania and the Naperville, Illinois facilities are utilized in both operating segments.

ITEM 3 - Legal Proceedings The Company is, from time to time involved in litigation, including environmental claims, in the normal course of business. While it is not possible at this time to establish the ultimate amount of liability with respect to contingent liabilities, including those related to legal proceedings, management is of the opinion that the aggregate amount of any such liabilities, for which provision has not been made, will not have a material adverse effect on the Company's financial position. ITEM 4 - Mine Safety Disclosures Not applicable. 7 Information about our Executive Officers The names, ages and positions of all executive officers of the Company, as of March 15, 2023, are listed below. Officers are elected annually by the Board of Directors at the meeting of the directors immediately following the Annual Meeting of Shareholders.

As of March 3, 2023 there were approximately 130 shareholders of record of such stock. Under the terms of a stock repurchase authorization originally approved by the Board of Directors of the Company in February of 1990, as amended, the Company is authorized to repurchase up to an aggregate of 200,000 shares of its common stock, in the open market or in private transactions, at prices deemed reasonable by management. Cumulative purchases under the repurchase authorization have amounted to 162,996 shares at an average price of 15.66 per share. The Company has not purchased any shares of its common stock since 2002. ITEM 6 [Reserved] ITEM 7 - Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Forward-Looking Statements This discussion contains certain forward-looking statements which are inherently subject to risks and uncertainties that may cause actual events to differ materially from those discussed herein. Factors which may cause such differences in events include those disclosed above under Risk Factors and elsewhere in this Form 10-K. As stated elsewhere in this filing, such factors include, among other things: risk related to the COVID-19 pandemic and its related adverse effects, conditions in the domestic automotive industry, upon which we rely for sales revenue, the intense competition in our markets, the concentration of our sales with major customers, risks related to export sales, the price and availability of raw materials, supply chain disruptions, labor relations issues, losses related to product liability, warranty and recall claims, costs relating to environmental laws and regulations, information systems disruptions and the loss of the services of our key employees. Many of these factors are beyond our ability to control or predict. Readers are cautioned not to place undue reliance on these forward-looking statements. We undertake no obligation to publish revised forward-looking statements to reflect events or circumstances after the date hereof or to reflect the occurrence of unanticipated events. RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Operating results for 2022 did not meet our expectations. Net sales grew in the first half of the year, but stalled in the third quarter and declined in the fourth quarter as overall demand softened amid recessionary fears and rising interest rates. At the same time, we had difficulties meeting the requirements of certain customers due to staffing shortages. In addition, higher raw material prices and inflationary pressures also negatively impacted our margins. Fourth quarter sales were 6,857,154 compared to 7,749,488 in the fourth quarter of 2021, a decline of 892,334, or 11.5 . The decline in sales, combined with high raw material prices, record-high inflation and the tight labor market contributed to reporting a net loss in the fourth quarter of 1,312,648, or 1.36 per share, compared to net income of 81,178, or 0.08 per share, in the fourth quarter of 2021. For the full year, net sales were 33,646,033 compared to 33,974,558 in 2021, a decline of 328,525, or 1.0 . Net income for the full year was 2,867,629, or 2.97 per share, compared to 1,113,472, or 1.15 per share in 2021. The positive figure for 2022 includes a pre-tax gain on the sale of our Naperville, Illinois property of 4,738,394 that was reported in the third quarter. 9 2022 Compared to 2021 Fastener segment revenues were 6,272,480 in the fourth quarter of 2022 compared to 6,988,047 in the fourth quarter of 2021, a decline of 715,567, or 10.2 . We experienced a general slow-down in demand in the fourth quarter compared to earlier in the year, but at the same time, were unable to meet the requirements of certain automotive customers, where demand remained steady, due to insufficient production staff. During the quarter, sales to automotive customers increased fractionally to 4,185,600 from 4,163,004 in the year earlier quarter. That increase was more than offset by a decline in sales to non-automotive customers, which were 2,086,880 in the fourth quarter of 2022 compared to 2,825,043 a year earlier, a decline of 738,163, or 26.1 . The abrupt decline in sales and production challenges due to staffing shortages resulted in reporting a gross loss in the fourth quarter of 555,641 compared to gross profit of 1,072,310 in the year earlier quarter. Fastener segment revenues for the full year 2022 were 30,291,547 compared to 29,831,388 in 2021, an increase of 460,159, or 1.5 . For the full year 2022, sales to automotive customers were 18,454,238 compared to 17,573,104 in 2021, an increase of 881,134, or 5.0 . Sales to non-automotive customers in 2022 were 11,837,309 compared to 12,258,284 in 2021, a decline of 420,975, or 3.4 . The modest increase in fastener segment sales was more than offset by higher costs as raw material prices remained elevated and general inflation reached record levels. Difficulty achieving proper staffing further negatively impacted margins as operational efficiency suffered. As a result, gross margin for the fastener segment was 3,167,104 in 2022 compared to 5,185,956 in 2021. Assembly equipment segment revenues were 584,674 in the fourth quarter of 2022, compared to 761,441 in the fourth quarter of 2021, a decline of 176,767, or 23.2 . For the full year 2022, assembly equipment segment revenues were 3,354,486, compared to 4,143,170 reported in 2021, a decline of 788,684, or 19.0 . While the decline in sales was significant, it should be noted that 2021 assembly equipment sales were the highest annual total since 2007. The decline in sales, combined with high inflation and some delivery delays for machine parts, resulted in a gross loss of 51,543 for the fourth quarter of 2022 compared to a gross profit of 195,237 in the fourth quarter of 2021. For the full year 2022, assembly equipment segment gross margins declined to 648,220 from 1,279,136 in 2021. Selling and administrative expenses were 4,992,521 in 2022 compared to 5,106,177 in 2021, a decrease of 113,656, or 2.2 . We incurred an increase in outside consulting of 42,498, primarily related to hiring fees to fill certain positions, and rent expense of approximately 33,387, primarily related to the lease agreement entered into upon the sale of the Naperville facility. These, and other smaller increases, were offset by a reduction in salaries of 135,714, related to positions that remained unfilled for an extended period of time during the year, and reductions in commissions and director fees of 44,126 and 43,739, respectively. The remaining net change relates to various smaller items. As a percentage of net sales, selling and administrative expenses were 14.8 in 2022 compared to 15.0 in 2021. As previously disclosed in a Current Report on Form 8-K filed on September 30, 2022, we sold our Naperville, Illinois facility in which the Company s headquarters and warehouse space is located for a selling price of 5,350,000 in cash, less customary closing costs. Concurrently with the completion of the sale, the Company entered into a lease agreement with the purchaser pursuant to which the Company leased the warehouse portion of the Naperville facility from the purchaser until December 31, 2022 and will lease the office portion until June 30, 2023. The monthly rent payable by the Company under the Lease was 12,500 for the period from the closing until December 31, 2022 and is 8,500 for the period from January 1, 2023 to June 30, 2023. The sale was undertaken in order to take advantage of favorable market conditions and to reduce the occupancy space devoted to administrative functions. Other income was 91,433 in 2022 compared to 55,557 in 2021. Other income is primarily comprised of interest income which increased during the year due to higher interest rates and greater invested balances. The Company s effective income tax rates were 21.5 and 21.3 in 2022 and 2021, respectively. DIVIDENDS In determining to pay dividends, the Board considers current profitability, the outlook for longer-term profitability, known and potential cash requirements and the overall financial condition of the Company. The Company paid four regular quarterly dividends in 2022 totaling 0.88 per share. On February 20, 2023, the Board of Directors declared a regular quarterly dividend of 0.22 per share, payable March 20, 2023 to shareholders of record on March 3, 2023. This continues the uninterrupted record of consecutive quarterly dividends paid by the Company to its shareholders that extends over 89 years. PROPERTY, PLANT AND EQUIPMENT Total capital expenditures in 2022 were 969,943. Fastener segment additions accounted for 868,654 of the total, including 92,880 for cold heading and screw machine equipment, 208,028 for equipment to perform secondary operations and inspection of parts and 215,540 for general plant equipment. The remaining 352,206 of fastener segment additions related to building improvements. Assembly equipment segment additions in 2022 were 3,207 for IT equipment. Investments for the benefit of both operating segments, primarily for building improvements, totaled 98,082 during 2022. Capital expenditures during 2021 were 670,898. Of the total, 493,564 related to fastener segment activities, including cold heading equipment additions of 62,600, secondary processing equipment of 360,588 and general plant equipment additions of 70,376. Additional investments of 177,334 were made in 2021 for facilities improvements that benefit both the assembly equipment segment and the fastener segment. Depreciation expense was 1,279,870 in 2022 and 1,318,554 in 2021. 10 LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES Working capital at December 31, 2022 was 20,073,089, an increase of 2,651,504 from the beginning of the year. The improvement was primarily due to the gain realized on the sale of our Naperville property during the third quarter. While working capital also improved due to a decline in net accounts receivable during the year of 672,847, an increase in inventory of 601,450, due to higher material prices and elevated quantities on hand to minimize supply disruptions, and a 585,190 increase in other current assets, had a negative impact on working capital. The Company s investing activities in 2022 included the proceeds from the sale of property and equipment of 5,043,240 and the net maturities of certificates of deposit of 50,000 less capital expenditures of 969,943. The only financing activity during 2022 was the payment of 850,196 in dividends. These changes and other cash flow activity resulted in a balance of cash, cash equivalents and certificates of deposit of 6,736,101 at the end of 2022 compared to 4,777,954 as of the beginning of the year. Management believes that current cash, cash equivalents and operating cash flow will be sufficient to provide adequate working capital for the next twelve months. Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements The Company has not entered into, and has no current plans to enter into, any off-balance sheet financing arrangements. CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES The preparation of financial statements and related disclosures in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting period. We base our estimates and assumptions on historical experience, current trends and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances. We evaluate our estimates and judgments required by our policies on an ongoing basis and update them as appropriate based on changing conditions. A summary of critical accounting policies can be found in Note 1 of the financial statements. Critical accounting estimates are those that require application of management s most difficult, subjective or complex judgments, often as a result of matters that are inherently uncertain and may change in subsequent periods. We have reviewed our accounting estimates, and none were deemed to be considered critical for the accounting periods presented. While we apply our judgment based on assumptions believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, actual results could vary from these assumptions. Additionally, future facts and circumstances could change and impact our estimates and assumptions. 11 NEW ACCOUNTING STANDARDS The Company s financial statements and financial condition were not, and are not expected to be, materially impacted by new, or proposed, accounting standards. A summary of recent accounting pronouncements can be found in Note 1 of the financial statements. OUTLOOK FOR 2023 Operating results for 2022 were negatively impacted by numerous factors. Although demand early in the year was steady for both the fastener segment and the assembly equipment segment, as the year progressed, we experienced a softening in demand which led to a significant drop in sales in the fourth quarter. The tight labor market made maintaining an optimal workforce difficult and those challenges intensified as the year progressed. We endured extended periods where important positions remained unfilled, resulting in inefficiencies and higher costs. We are committed to overcoming these challenges as part of an overall strategic review that is underway and have made investments in the new year in an effort to address the challenges of maintaining efficient operations with a smaller, less experienced workforce. We are also reviewing, and seeking to adjust, our pricing in light of higher operating costs related to the current economic and labor market environment. As always, we will continue to look for additional areas for improvement while pursuing opportunities to increase sales by emphasizing value over price and focusing on our abilities to make more complex parts for which our experience, quality and service are important factors in purchasing decisions. We were saddened to report the passing of Walter W. Morrissey in December 2022. Mr. Morrissey had served as a Director of the Company since 1972 and as Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer since May 2020. His contributions to the success of the Company over the years will be missed. Director James W. Morrissey was named non-executive Chairman of the Board until the Annual Meeting of Shareholders on May 9, 2023. The search for a new Chief Executive Officer is currently underway. Notwithstanding the difficult environment we are operating in, we believe that our sound financial condition and long history of success in a variety of challenging circumstances will provide the basis for improved operating activities in the future. We increased our capital expenditures in 2022 over the previous year and expect to make further investments in 2023. We will also continue our efforts to develop new customer relationships and build on existing ones in all the markets we serve by emphasizing our experience, quality and customer service in a very competitive global marketplace. We are grateful for the contributions of our dedicated employees in what was a uniquely challenging year as well as for the loyalty of our customers and the support of our shareholders.

Naperville, Illinois Opinion on the Financial Statements We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Chicago Rivet Machine Co. (the Company as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, the related consolidated statements of income, shareholders equity, and cash flows for the years then ended, and the related notes (collectively referred to as the financial statements ). In our opinion, the financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for the years then ended, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. Basis for Opinion These financial statements are the responsibility of the Company's management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company's financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. The Company is not required to have, nor were we engaged to perform, an audit of its internal control over financial reporting. As part of our audits we are required to obtain an understanding of internal control over financial reporting but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Company's internal control over financial reporting. Accordingly, we express no such opinion. Our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion. Critical Audit Matters Critical audit matters are matters arising from the current period audit of the financial statements that were communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that: (1) relate to accounts or disclosures that are material to the financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. We determined that there are no critical audit matters. / / We have served as the Company's auditor since 2014. March 29, 2023 14
