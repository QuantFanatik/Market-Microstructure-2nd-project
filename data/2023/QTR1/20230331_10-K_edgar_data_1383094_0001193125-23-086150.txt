Exhibit 33.1 

Management s Assessment of Compliance with SEC Regulation AB Servicing Criteria 

1. 
 Management of Santander Consumer USA Inc. SC is responsible for assessing compliance with the
servicing criteria applicable to it under paragraph (d) of Item 1122 of Regulation AB as of and for the year ended December 31, 2022. The transactions covered by this report are all publicly registered transactions backed by auto loans for
which Santander Consumer USA Inc. is the servicer (the Platform ). See Appendix A. 

2. 
 SC s management has assessed SC s compliance with the applicable servicing criteria as of and for the
year ended December 31, 2022. In making this assessment, management used the criteria set forth in paragraph(d) of Item 1122 of Regulation AB (See Appendix B), except for the following criteria which SC determined are not applicable to the
activities performed by SC or through its vendors with respect to the Platform: 1122(d)(1)(iv), 1122(d)(2)(iii), 1122(d)(2)(vi), 1122(d)(4)(ix), 1122(d)(4)(x), 1122(d)(4)(xi), 1122(d)(4)(xii), and 1122(d)(4)(xiii). 

3. 
 There were no external enhancements as of and for the year ended December 31, 2022, with respect to the
Platform taken as a whole. 

4. 
 With respect to servicing criterion, Item 1122(d)(1)(iii), some of the transactions included in the Platform
require the Company to utilize a backup servicer when certain events, which are specified within the transaction agreements, occur. As of and for the year ended December 31, 2022, the events that would require a backup servicer as listed in the
transaction documents did not occur, and therefore the requirement for a backup servicer does not apply. 

5. 
 SC has engaged vendors that are not servicers as defined in Item 1101(j) of Regulation AB to perform limited or
scripted activities with respect to the servicing criteria applicable to each vendor s activities as set forth in Appendix B of this report. SC elected to take responsibility for assessing compliance with the portion of the servicing criteria
applicable to each such vendor. SC has policies and procedures in place to provide reasonable assurance that the vendors activities comply in all material respects with the portion of the servicing criteria applicable to each vendor. SC s
management is solely responsible for determining that it meets the requirements to apply Interpretation 200.06 of the SEC Compliance and Disclosure Interpretations. 

6. 
 SC has complied, in all material respects, with the applicable servicing criteria for which it is responsible,
as of and for the year ended December 31, 2022, with respect to the Platform taken as a whole. 

7. 
 SC s management has not identified and is not aware of any material instance of noncompliance by the
vendors with regard to the applicable servicing criteria, as of and for the year ended December 31, 2022, with respect to the Platform taken as a whole. 

8. 
 SC s management has not identified any material deficiency in its policies and procedures to monitor the
compliance by the vendors with the applicable servicing criteria, as of and for the year ended December 31, 2022, with respect to the Platform taken as a whole. 

9. 
 PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP, an independent registered public accounting firm, has issued an attestation report
on SC s compliance with the applicable servicing criteria as of and for the year ended December 31, 2022.

 Management Assessment Report 
 Management of Wilmington Trust National Association (the Company) is responsible for assessing compliance with the applicable servicing criteria set forth in
Item 1122(d)(2)(ii), 1122(d)(2)(iv), 1122(d)(2)(v), 1122(d)(3)(i), 1122(d)(3)(ii), 1122(d)(3)(iii) and 1122(d)(3)(iv) of Regulation AB of the Securities and Exchange Commission relating to the servicing of auto related asset-backed transactions
initiated or amended for purposes of Regulation AB on or after January 1, 2006, for which the Company provides trustee services (the Platform) as of and for the year ended December 31, 2022. Management has determined that all other
criteria set forth in Item 1122(d) are not applicable to the servicing activities performed by the Company with respect to the Platform. Appendix A to this report identifies the auto related asset-backed transactions defined by management as
constituting the Platform. The Company s management has assessed the Company s compliance with the applicable servicing criteria as of and for
the year ended December 31, 2022. In making this assessment, management used the criteria set forth by the Securities and Exchange Commission in criterion (d)(2)(ii), (d)(2)(iv), (d)(2)(v), (d)(3)(i), (d)(3)(ii), (d)(3)(iii) and (d)(3)(iv) of
Item 1122 of Regulation AB. The activities the Company performs with respect to the applicable 1122(d) servicing criteria are listed on the attached Appendix A. 
 With respect to the Company s obligation to issue a notification to be included in the client s Form 8-K. 
Form 10-D and Form 10-K under applicable servicing criterion 1122(d)(3)(i), there were no activities performed during the year ended December 31, 2022, with respect
to the Platform, because there were no occurrences of events that would require the Company to perform such activities. Based on such assessment,
management believes that, as of and for the year ended December 31, 2022, the Company has complied in all material respects with the servicing criteria set forth in Item 1122(d)(2)(ii), 1122(d)(2)(iv), 1122(d)(2)(v), 1122(d)(3)(i),
1122(d)(3)(ii), 1122(d)(3)(iii) and 1122(d)(3)(iv) of Regulation AB of the Securities and Exchange Commission relating to the servicing of the Platform. PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP, a registered public accounting firm, has issued an attestation
report with respect to management s assessment of compliance with the applicable servicing criteria as of and for the year ended December 31, 2022.

Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm 
 To the Management of Santander Consumer USA Inc. 
 We have examined management s assertion, included in the accompanying Management s Assessment of Compliance with SEC Regulation AB Servicing
Criteria, that Santander Consumer USA Inc. (the Company complied with the servicing criteria set forth in Item 1122(d) of the Securities and Exchange Commission s Regulation AB for all publicly registered transactions backed by
auto loans for which Santander Consumer USA Inc. is the servicer (the Platform ), as of December 31, 2022 and for the year then ended, excluding criteria 1122(d)(1)(iv), 1122(d)(2)(iii), 1122(d)(2)(vi), 1122(d)(4)(ix), 1122(d)(4)(x),
1122(d)(4)(xi), 1122(d)(4)(xii), and 1122(d)(4)(xiii), which the Company has determined are not applicable to the servicing activities performed by it with respect to the Platform. As described in management s assertion, for servicing criteria
1122(d)(2)(i), 1122(d)(4)(i), 1122(d)(4)(ii), 1122(d)(4)(iv), 1122(d)(4)(vi), 1122(d)(4)(vii) and 1122(d)(4)(viii), the Company has engaged various vendors to perform the activities required by these servicing criteria. The Company has determined
that these vendors are not considered servicers as defined in Item 1101(j) of Regulation AB, and the Company has elected to take responsibility for assessing compliance with the servicing criteria applicable to each vendor as permitted
by Compliance and Disclosure Interpretation 200.06 of the SEC Division of Corporation Finance s interpretations of the rules adopted under Regulation AB and the Securities Act and the Exchange Act Interpretation 200.06 ). As
permitted by Interpretation 200.06, the Company has asserted that it has policies and procedures in place designed to provide reasonable assurance that the vendors activities comply in all material respects with the servicing criteria
applicable to each vendor. The Company is solely responsible for determining that it meets the SEC requirements to apply Interpretation 200.06 for the vendors and related criteria as described in its assertion, and we performed no procedures with
respect to the Company s determination of its eligibility to use Interpretation 200.06. Appendix A to management s assertion identifies the individual asset-backed transactions and securities defined by management as constituting the
Platform. Santander Consumer USA Inc. s management is responsible for its assertion and for the Company s compliance with the applicable servicing criteria. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on management s assertion about
the Company s compliance with the applicable servicing criteria based on our examination. Our examination was conducted in accordance with the
standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) and in accordance with attestation standards established by the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants. Those standards require that we plan and perform the
examination to obtain reasonable assurance about whether management s assertion about compliance with the applicable servicing criteria is fairly stated, in all material respects, and, accordingly, included examining, on a test basis, evidence
about the Company s compliance with the applicable servicing criteria and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. Our examination included testing of selected asset-backed transactions and securities
that comprise the Platform, testing of selected servicing activities related to the Platform, and determining whether the Company processed those selected transactions and performed those selected activities in compliance with the applicable
servicing criteria. Our procedures were limited to the selected transactions and servicing activities performed by the Company during the period covered by this report. Our procedures were not designed to detect noncompliance arising from errors
that may have occurred prior to or subsequent to our tests that may have affected the balances or amounts calculated or reported by the Company during the period covered by this report. We believe that our examination provides, and that the evidence
we obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide, a reasonable basis for our opinion. Our examination does not provide a legal determination on the Company s compliance with the servicing criteria.

aforementioned applicable servicing criteria as of and for the year ended December 31, 2022 for all publicly registered transactions backed by auto loans for which Santander Consumer USA Inc. is the servicer is fairly stated, in all material
respects.
