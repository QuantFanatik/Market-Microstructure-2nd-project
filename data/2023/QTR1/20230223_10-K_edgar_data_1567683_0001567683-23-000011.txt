PART I 
 
 Item 1 Business 
 General 
 Clearway Energy, Inc., together with its consolidated subsidiaries, or the Company, is a publicly-traded energy infrastructure investor with a focus on investments in clean energy and owner of modern, sustainable and long-term contracted assets across North America. The Company is sponsored by GIP and TotalEnergies through the portfolio company, Clearway Energy Group LLC, or CEG, which became equally owned by GIP and TotalEnergies as of September 12, 2022, when TotalEnergies acquired, through its investment in an intermediate holding company, 50 of GIP s interest in CEG. GIP is an independent infrastructure fund manager that makes equity and debt investments in infrastructure assets and businesses. TotalEnergies is a global multi-energy company. 
 The Company is one of the largest renewable energy owners in the U.S. with over 5,500 net MW of installed wind and solar generation projects. The Company s over 8,000 net MW of assets also includes approximately 2,500 net MW of environmentally-sound, highly efficient natural gas-fired generation facilities. Through this environmentally-sound, diversified and primarily contracted portfolio, the Company endeavors to provide its investors with stable and growing dividend income. The majority of the Company s revenues are derived from long-term contractual arrangements for the output or capacity from these assets. The weighted average remaining contract duration of these offtake agreements was approximately 11 years as of December 31, 2022 based on CAFD. 
 On May 1, 2022, the Company completed the sale of 100 of its interests in the Thermal Business to KKR. For further details of the Thermal Disposition, refer to Item 15 Note 3, Acquisitions and Dispositions . 
 The Company consolidates the results of Clearway Energy LLC through its controlling interest, with CEG s interest shown as noncontrolling interest in the consolidated financial statements. The holders of the Company s outstanding shares of Class A and Class C common stock are entitled to dividends as declared. CEG receives its distributions from Clearway Energy LLC through its ownership of Clearway Energy LLC Class B and Class D units. From time to time, CEG may also hold shares of the Company s Class A and/or Class C common stock. 
 A complete listing of the Company s interests in facilities, operations and/or projects owned or leased as of December 31, 2022 can be found in Item 2 Properties. 
 History 
 The Company was formed as a Delaware corporation on December 20, 2012 by NRG. On August 31, 2018, NRG transferred its full ownership interest in the Company to CEG, the holder of NRG s renewable energy development and operations platform, and subsequently sold 100 of its interest in CEG to GIP. On September 12, 2022, GIP sold 50 of its interest in CEG through an intermediate holding company to TotalEnergies. 
 The Company is the sole managing member of Clearway Energy LLC and operates and controls all of its business and affairs and consolidates the financial results of Clearway Energy LLC and its subsidiaries. Clearway Energy LLC is a holding company for the companies that directly and indirectly own and operate the Company s assets. As of December 31, 2022, the Company owned 57.88 of the economic interests of Clearway Energy LLC, with CEG owning 42.12 of the economic interests of Clearway Energy LLC. As a result of the current ownership of the Class B common stock and Class D common stock, CEG controls the Company, and the Company in turn, as the sole managing member of Clearway Energy LLC, controls Clearway Energy LLC and its subsidiaries.

The diagram below represents a summarized structure of the Company as of December 31, 2022: 
 
 Business Strategy 
 The Company s primary business strategy is to focus on the acquisition and ownership of assets with predictable, long-term cash flows in order that it may be able to increase the dividends paid to holders of the Company s Class A and Class C common stock over time without compromising the ongoing stability of the business. 
 The Company s plan for executing its business strategy includes the following key components: 
 Focus on contracted renewable energy and conventional generation. The Company owns and operates utility scale and distributed renewable energy and natural gas-fired generation assets with proven technologies, generally low operating risks and stable cash flows. The Company believes by focusing on this core asset class and leveraging its industry knowledge, it will maximize its strategic opportunities, be a leader in operational efficiency and maximize its overall financial performance. 
 7 

Growing the business through acquisitions of contracted operating assets. The Company believes that its base of operations provides a platform for strategic growth through cash accretive and tax advantaged acquisitions complementary to its existing portfolio. In addition to acquiring generation facilities from third parties where the Company believes its knowledge of the market and operating expertise provides it with a competitive advantage, the Company may consummate future acquisitions from CEG. The Company believes that CEG s project development expertise provides the Company access to a development platform with an extensive pipeline of potential renewable energy and storage projects that are aligned to support the Company s growth. The Company and CEG work collaboratively in considering new assets to be acquired by the Company. The assets listed below, all of which are included in co-investment partnerships, represent the Company s currently committed investments in projects with CEG: 
 Asset Technology Gross Capacity (MW) State COD Status Daggett Solar 3 Solar/Storage 300 CA 1H23 Committed Daggett Solar 2 Solar/Storage 182 CA 2H23 Committed Arica Solar/Storage 263 CA 2H23 Committed Victory Pass Solar/Storage 200 CA 2H23 Committed 
 Primary focus on North America. The Company intends to focus its investments in North America. The Company believes that industry fundamentals in North America present it with significant opportunity to grow its portfolio without creating significant exposure to currency and sovereign risk. By focusing its efforts on North America, the Company believes it will best leverage its regional knowledge of power markets, industry relationships and skill sets to maximize the performance of the Company. 
 Maintain sound financial practices to grow the dividend. The Company intends to maintain a commitment to disciplined financial analysis and a balanced capital structure to enable it to increase its quarterly dividend over time and serve the long-term interests of its stockholders. The Company s financial practices include a risk and credit policy focused on transacting with creditworthy counterparties; a financing policy, which focuses on seeking an optimal capital structure through various capital formation alternatives to minimize interest rate and refinancing risks, ensure stable long-term dividends and maximize value; and a dividend policy that is based on distributing a significant portion of CAFD each quarter that the Company receives from Clearway Energy LLC, subject to available capital, market conditions and compliance with associated laws, regulations and other contractual obligations. The Company intends to evaluate various alternatives for financing future acquisitions and refinancing of existing project-level debt, in each case, to reduce the cost of debt, extend maturities and maximize CAFD. 
 Competition 
 Power generation is a capital-intensive business with numerous and diverse industry participants. The Company competes on the basis of the location of its plants and on the basis of contract price and terms of individual projects. Within the power industry, there is a wide variation in terms of the capabilities, resources, nature and identity of the companies with whom the Company competes depending on the market. Competitors for energy supply are utilities, independent power producers and other providers of distributed generation. The Company also competes to acquire new projects with renewable developers who retain renewable power plant ownership, independent power producers, financial investors and other dividend, growth-oriented companies. Competitive conditions may be substantially affected by capital market conditions and by various forms of energy legislation and regulation considered by federal, state and local legislatures and administrative agencies, including tax policy. Such laws and regulations may substantially increase the costs of acquiring, constructing and operating projects, and it could be difficult for the Company to adapt to and operate under such laws and regulations. 
 Competitive Strengths 
 Stable, high quality cash flows. The Company s facilities have a stable, predictable cash flow profile consisting of predominantly long-life electric generation assets that primarily sell electricity under long-term fixed priced contracts or pursuant to regulated rates with investment-grade and certain other creditworthy counterparties. The majority of the Company s facilities have minimal fuel risk. For the Company s conventional assets currently contracted under tolling agreements, fuel is provided by the toll counterparty or the cost thereof is a pass-through cost under the Contract for Differences. When the tolling agreements expire, the conventional assets will need to procure their own fuel. The Renewable facilities have no fuel costs. The offtake agreements for the Company s conventional and renewable generation facilities have a weighted-average remaining duration, based on CAFD, of approximately 11 years as of December 31, 2022, providing long-term cash flow stability. The Company s generation offtake agreements with counterparties for whom credit ratings are available have a weighted-average Moody s rating of Ba1 based on rated capacity under contract. All of the Company s assets are in the U.S. and accordingly have no currency or repatriation risks. 
 8 

Environmentally well-positioned portfolio of assets. The Company s portfolio of electric generation assets consists of over 5,500 net MW of renewable generation capacity that are non-emitting sources of power generation. Additionally, the Company s California conventional assets consist of efficient gas generation facilities that support electric system reliability. The Company does not anticipate having to expend any significant capital expenditures in the foreseeable future to comply with current environmental regulations applicable to its generation assets. Taken as a whole, the Company believes its strategy will be a net beneficiary of current and potential environmental legislation and regulatory requirements that may serve as a catalyst for capacity retirements and improve market opportunities for environmentally well-positioned assets like the Company s assets once its current offtake agreements expire. 
 High quality, long-lived assets with low operating and capital requirements. The Company benefits from a portfolio of relatively younger assets. The Company s assets are largely comprised of proven and reliable technologies, provided by leading original solar and wind equipment manufacturers such as General Electric, Siemens AG, SunPower Corporation, or SunPower, First Solar Inc., or First Solar, Vestas, Mitsubishi, Trina Solar, JA Solar and Siemens Gamesa. Given the modern nature of the portfolio, which includes a substantial number of relatively low operating and maintenance cost solar and wind generation assets, the Company expects to achieve high fleet availability and expend modest maintenance-related capital expenditures. 
 Significant scale and diversity. The Company is one of the largest renewable energy owners in the U.S. with over 5,500 net MW of installed wind and solar generation projects. The Company s over 8,000 net MW of assets also includes approximately 2,500 net MW of environmentally-sound, highly efficient natural gas-fired generation facilities. The Company s contracted renewable and conventional generation assets benefit from significant diversification in terms of technology, fuel type, counterparty and geography. The Company believes its scale and access to best practices across the fleet improves its business development opportunities through enhanced industry relationships, reputation and understanding of regional power market dynamics. Furthermore, the Company s diversification reduces its operating risk profile and reliance on any single market. 
 Relationship with GIP, TotalEnergies and CEG. The Company believes that its relationship with GIP, TotalEnergies and CEG provides significant benefits. Global Infrastructure Management, LLC, or GIM, the manager of GIP, is an independent infrastructure fund manager that makes equity and debt investments in infrastructure assets and businesses in both the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) and select emerging market countries. GIM has a strong track record of investment and value creation in the renewable energy sector. GIM also has extensive experience with publicly traded yield vehicles and development platforms, ranging from Europe s first application of a yield company/development company model to the largest renewable platform in Asia-Pacific. TotalEnergies is a global multi-energy company that produces and markets energies in more than 130 countries. Additionally, the Company believes that CEG provides the Company access to a highly capable renewable development and operations platform that is aligned to support the Company s growth.

 Policy Incentives 
 U.S. federal, state and local governments have established various policy incentives to support the development, financing, ownership and operation of renewable energy projects. These incentives include PTCs, ITCs, accelerated tax depreciation, cash grants, tax abatements and RPS programs which have the effect of decreasing the costs and risks associated with developing and operating such projects or creating demand for renewable energy assets. In particular, 
 Owners of wind facilities are eligible to claim the PTC, or an ITC in lieu of the PTC, provided that certain requirements are met. Similarly, owners of solar facilities are eligible to claim the ITC or, for facilities placed in service after August 16, 2022, the PTC, or an ITC in lieu of the PTC, provided certain requirements are met. Additionally, owners of energy storage facilities are eligible to claim the ITC for facilities placed in service after December 31, 2022, provided certain requirements are met. The PTC is an annual credit that is based on the amount of electricity sold by the facility during the first ten years after the facility is first placed in service. The ITC is a one-time credit that is based on a percentage of the cost of the facility and is claimed for the tax year in which the facility is first placed in service. Depending on the type of taxpayer, the PTC or ITC may be sold to an unrelated third party for cash, or in certain cases, direct payment from the government may be received. In order to qualify for the full amount of these credits in the case of facilities whose construction begins on or after January 29, 2023, certain prevailing wage and apprenticeship requirements generally must be satisfied, the details of which have been released only in part with additional details expected in future guidance. For facilities that begin construction after December 31, 2024, the PTC and ITC will no longer apply and such facilities may instead be eligible for the clean electricity production credit or clean electricity investment credit, respectively. In order to qualify for these new credits, the facility s greenhouse gas emissions cannot be greater than zero. 
 Pursuant to the U.S. federal Modified Accelerated Cost Recovery System, or MACRS, wind and solar projects are generally depreciable for tax purposes over a five-year period (before taking into account certain conventions) even though the useful life of such projects is generally much longer than five years. The Tax Act also provides for immediate and 100 expensing and deductibility for eligible property acquired and placed in service after September 27, 2017, and before January 1, 2023, with phase downs permitting 80 , 60 , 40 and 20 expensing and deductibility for property acquired and placed in service during 2023, 2024, 2025 and 2026, respectively. 
 RPS programs, currently in place in certain states and territories, require electricity providers in the state or territory to meet a certain percentage of their retail sales with energy from renewable sources. Additionally, other states in the U.S. have set renewable energy goals to reduce GHG emissions from historic levels. The Company believes that these standards and goals will create incremental demand for renewable energy in the future. 
 The elimination of, loss of, or reduction in, the incentives discussed above could decrease the attractiveness of renewable energy projects to developers, including, but not limited to, CEG, which could reduce the Company's acquisition or development opportunities. Such an elimination, loss or reduction could also reduce the Company s willingness to pursue or develop certain renewable energy projects due to higher operating costs or decreased revenues under its PPAs. 
 Regulatory Matters 
 As owners of power plants and participants in wholesale energy markets, certain of the Company s subsidiaries are subject to regulation by various federal and state government agencies. These agencies include FERC and the PUCT, as well as other public utility commissions in certain states where the Company s assets are located. Each of the Company s U.S. generating facilities qualifies as an EWG or QF. In addition, the Company is subject to the market rules, procedures and protocols of the various ISO and RTO markets in which it participates. Likewise, certain of the Company s subsidiaries must also comply with the mandatory reliability requirements imposed by NERC and the regional reliability entities in the regions where the Company has generating facilities subject to NERC s reliability authority. The Company s operations within the ERCOT footprint are not subject to rate regulation by FERC, as they are deemed to operate solely within the ERCOT market and not in interstate commerce. These operations are subject to regulation by PUCT. 
 10 

FERC 
 FERC, among other things, regulates the transmission and the wholesale sale of electricity in interstate commerce under the authority of the FPA. The transmission and sale of electric energy occurring wholly within ERCOT is not subject to FERC s jurisdiction. Under existing regulations, FERC has the authority to determine whether an entity owning a generation facility is an EWG, as defined in the PUHCA. FERC also has the authority to determine whether a generation facility meets the applicable criteria of a QF under the PURPA. Each of the Company s U.S. generating facilities qualifies as either an EWG or QF. 
 The FPA gives FERC exclusive rate-making jurisdiction over the wholesale sale of electricity and transmission of electricity in interstate commerce of public utilities (as defined by the FPA). Under the FPA, FERC, with certain exceptions, regulates owners and operators of facilities used for the wholesale sale of electricity or transmission in interstate commerce as public utilities, and is charged with ensuring that market rules are just and reasonable. 
 Public utilities are required to obtain FERC s acceptance, pursuant to Section 205 of the FPA, of their rate schedules for the wholesale sale of electricity. Several of the Company s QF generating facilities and all of the Company s non-QF generating facilities located in the U.S. outside of ERCOT make sales of electricity pursuant to market-based rates, as opposed to traditional cost-of-service regulated rates. FERC conducts a review of the market-based rates of Company public utilities and potential market power every three years according to a regional schedule established by FERC. 
 In accordance with the Energy Policy Act of 2005, FERC has approved the NERC as the national Energy Reliability Organization, or ERO. As the ERO, NERC is responsible for the development and enforcement of mandatory reliability standards for the wholesale electric power system, with such authority delegated in part to regional reliability entities charged with enforcement of mandatory reliability standards for the region which they are responsible for overseeing. 
 The PURPA was passed in 1978 in large part to promote increased energy efficiency and development of independent power producers. The PURPA created QFs to further both goals, and FERC is primarily charged with administering the PURPA as it applies to QFs. QFs are exempt from certain regulations under the FPA. 
 The PUHCA provides FERC with certain authority over and access to books and records of public utility holding companies not otherwise exempt by virtue of their ownership of EWGs and QFs. The Company is exempt from many of the accounting, record retention, and reporting requirements of the PUHCA. 
 Environmental Matters 
 The Company is subject to a wide range of environmental laws during the development, construction, ownership and operation of facilities. These existing and future laws generally require that governmental permits and approvals be obtained before construction and maintained during operation of facilities. The Company is obligated to comply with all environmental laws and regulations applicable within each jurisdiction and required to implement environmental programs and procedures to monitor and control risks associated with the construction, operation and decommissioning of regulated or permitted energy assets. Federal and state environmental laws have historically become more stringent over time, although this trend could change in the future. 
 A number of regulations that may affect the Company are under review for potential revision or rescission in 2023. The Company will evaluate the impact of the legislation and regulations as they are revised but cannot fully predict the impact of each until anticipated revisions and legal challenges are resolved. To the extent that proposed legislation and new or revised regulations restrict or otherwise impact the Company s operations, the proposed legislation and regulations could have a negative impact on the Company s financial performance. 
 Proposed Federal MBTA Incidental Take Legislation and Regulations On October 4, 2021, U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (FWS) issued the final MBTA rule, effective December 3, 2021, restoring the MBTA to prohibit the incidental take of migratory birds. In 2021, FWS issued an advance notice of proposed rulemaking (ANPR) advising that it intends to gather information necessary to develop proposed regulations to authorize the incidental take of migratory birds under prescribed conditions and prepare a draft environmental review pursuant to the National Environmental Policy Act. Throughout 2022, FWS sought comments on the content of the proposed rule. The Company worked with renewable industry groups to provide comments on the proposed rule development. FWS is currently considering how to draft the rule and expects to issue the notice of proposed rulemaking early in 2023. 
 11 

Proposed Federal Eagle Incidental Take Permit Proposed Rule On September 30, 2022, FWS published in the Federal Register a draft rule revising the eagle incidental take permit program. Comments on the revised rule were due by the end of November 2022, but a 30-day extension was issued with final comments due by December 30, 2022. The Company worked with renewable industry groups to provide comments on the proposed rule in advance of the cut-off date. FWS is currently reviewing comments and it is not clear how the comments will be incorporated into the final rule or how FWS will structure the revisions to the eagle incidental take permit program. 
 Local California Air District Rules Air districts have proposed updates to its respective rules to amend, as applicable, Best Available Control Technology criteria for stationary emissions sources including gas turbines, Toxic Air Contaminant Health Risk reporting and general reporting requirements. Rulemaking in the Los Angeles Air Basin, as regulated by South Coast Air Quality Management District, or SCAQMD, continues to update command-and-control regulations that limit NOx emissions for stationary sources in preparation for sunsetting SCAQMD s Regional Clean Air Market, or RECLAIM, NOx cap and trade program in the next few years. The Company s conventional generation plants meet the district s existing and proposed amendments to command-and-control regulations. Proposed updates to local California Air District Rules are not expected to affect the operations nor compliance of the Company s conventional generation plants. 
 Customers 
 The Company sells its electricity and environmental attributes, including RECs, primarily to local utilities under contractual arrangements. During the year ended December 31, 2022, the Company derived approximately 33 of its consolidated revenue from Southern California Edison, or SCE, and approximately 25 of its consolidated revenue from PG E.

 By leveraging the multitude of backgrounds and perspectives of its team and developing ongoing relationships with diverse vendors, the Company achieves a collective strength that enhances the workplace and makes the Company a better business partner to its customers and others with a stake in the Company s success. 
 The Company also has an Equity, Partnership Inclusion Council, or EPIC. As part of its commitment, the Company provides education on topics related to diversity, inclusion and equity. The Company identified three areas of focus: Our People, Our Product Customers and Our Purchasing. With the involvement of its employees, EPIC is advancing efforts in each of these areas to identify and implement opportunities for the Company to address equity, partnership and inclusion issues in its business activities. 
 Our People focuses on education and training; diversity, equity and inclusion policies and recruitment strategies; community and industry partnerships; and maintaining high employee engagement and retention. 
 
 Our Product Customers focuses on pursuing opportunities that provide more equitable access to renewable energy for low-to-moderate income customers; supporting the diversity, equity and inclusion goals of the Company s offtakers; and meaningfully representing that work in the external market. 
 
 Our Purchasing focuses on establishing a non-discriminatory practices standard for the Company s suppliers, diverse vendor sourcing and benchmarking. 
 12 

In addition to the personnel of CEG, the Company relies on other third-party service providers in the daily operations of its conventional facilities and certain renewable facilities. 
 Environmental, Social and Governance (ESG) 
 The Company is committed to engaging with its stakeholders on environmental, social and governance, or ESG, matters in a proactive, holistic and integrated manner. The Company strives to provide recent, credible and comparable data to ESG agencies while engaging institutional investors and investor advocacy organizations around ESG issues. The Company s Corporate Governance, Conflicts and Nominating Committee reviews developing trends and emerging ESG matters as well as the Company s strategies, activities, policies and communications regarding ESG matters, and makes recommendations to the Company s Board of Directors regarding potential actions by the Company. 
 Aligned with the Company s strategy of owning and acquiring environmentally-sound power generation assets, the Company has issued 2.1 billion of corporate green bonds under a green bond framework that applies the net proceeds to finance or refinance, in part or in full, new and existing projects and assets meeting certain criteria focused on the supply of energy from renewable resources, including solar energy and wind energy. The Company s projects and alignment of its Green Bond Principles (2018) are reviewed by Sustainalytics, an outside consultant with recognized expertise in ESG research and analysis. 
 As discussed in greater detail above, the Company has focused its diversity, equity and inclusion efforts in three areas: Our People, Our Product Customers and Our Purchasing through its launch of EPIC. With the involvement of the Company s employees, EPIC is advancing efforts in each of these areas to identify and implement opportunities for the Company to address equity, partnership and inclusion issues in its business activities.

Item 1A Risk Factors 
 Summary of Risk Factors 
 The Company s business is subject to numerous risks and uncertainties, discussed in more detail in the following section. These risks include among others, the following key risks: 
 Risks Related to the Company s Business 
 The Company s ability to grow and make acquisitions through cash on hand is limited. 
 The Company may not be able to effectively identify or consummate any future acquisitions on favorable terms, or at all, and future acquisitions may not be accretive as a result of incorrect assumptions in the Company s evaluation of such acquisitions, unforeseen consequences or other external events beyond the Company s control. 
 Counterparties to the Company s offtake agreements may not fulfill their obligations and, as the contracts expire, the Company may not be able to replace them with agreements on similar terms in light of increasing competition in the markets in which the Company operates. 
 The Company s ability to effectively consummate future acquisitions will also depend on the Company s ability to arrange the required or desired financing for acquisitions. 
 The Company s indebtedness could adversely affect its ability to raise additional capital to fund the Company s operations or pay dividends. 
 The operation of electric generation facilities depends on suitable meteorological conditions and involves significant risks and hazards customary to the power industry that could have a material adverse effect on the Company s business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. These facilities may operate without long-term power sales agreements. 
 Maintenance, expansion and refurbishment of electric generation facilities involve significant risks that could result in unplanned power outages or reduced output. 
 Supplier and/or customer concentration at certain of the Company s facilities may expose the Company to significant financial credit or performance risks. 
 The Company currently owns, and in the future may acquire, certain assets in which the Company has limited control over management decisions and its interests in such assets may be subject to transfer or other related restrictions. 
 The Company s assets are exposed to risks inherent in the use of interest rate swaps and the Company may be exposed to additional risks in the future if it utilizes other derivative instruments. 
 The Company does not own all of the land on which its power generation assets are located, which could result in disruption to its operations. The Company s use and enjoyment of real property rights for its projects may be adversely affected by the rights of lienholders and leaseholders that are superior to those of the grantors of those real property rights to the Company. 
 The Company s businesses are subject to physical, market and economic risks relating to potential effects of climate change and public and governmental initiatives to address climate change. 
 Risks that are beyond the Company s control, including but not limited to acts of terrorism or related acts of war, natural disaster, pandemics (such as the COVID-19 pandemic), inflation, supply chain disruptions, hostile cyber intrusions or other catastrophic events, could have a material adverse effect on the business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. 
 The operation of the Company s businesses is subject to cyber-based security and integrity risk. 
 The Company relies on electric distribution and transmission facilities that it does not own or control and that are subject to transmission constraints within a number of the Company s regions. If these facilities fail to provide the Company with adequate transmission capacity, it may be restricted in its ability to deliver electric power to its customers and may either incur additional costs or forego revenues. 
 The Company s costs, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows could be adversely impacted by the disruption of the fuel supplies necessary to generate power at its conventional generation facilities. 
 The Company depends on key personnel and its ability to attract and retain additional skilled management and other personnel, the loss of any of which could have a material adverse effect on the Company s financial condition and results of operations. 
 14 

The Company may potentially be adversely affected by emerging technologies that may over time impact capacity markets and the energy industry overall. 
 Risks Related to the Company s Relationship with GIP, TotalEnergies and CEG 
 GIP and TotalEnergies, through their equal ownership of CEG, the Company s controlling stockholder, exercise substantial influence over the Company. The Company is highly dependent on GIP, TotalEnergies and CEG. 
 CEG controls the Company and has the ability to designate a majority of the members of the Company s Board. 
 The Company may not be able to consummate future acquisitions from CEG. 
 The Company may be unable to terminate the CEG Master Services Agreement, in certain circumstances. 
 If CEG terminates the CEG Master Services Agreement or defaults in the performance of its obligations under the agreement, the Company may be unable to contract with a substitute service provider on similar terms, or at all. 
 The Company is a controlled company , controlled by CEG, and as a result, is exempt from certain corporate governance requirements that are designed to provide protection to stockholders of companies that are not controlled companies. 
 Risks Related to Regulation 
 The Company s business is subject to restrictions resulting from environmental, health and safety laws and regulations. 
 The electric generation business is subject to substantial governmental regulation, including environmental laws, and may be adversely affected by changes in laws or regulations, as well as liability under, or any future inability to comply with, existing or future regulations or other legal requirements. 
 The Company s business is subject to complex and evolving U.S. laws and regulations regarding privacy and data protection. 
 Government regulations providing incentives for renewable power generation could change at any time and such changes may negatively impact the Company s growth strategy. 
 Risks Related to the Company s Common Stock 
 The Company may not be able to continue paying comparable or growing cash dividends to holders of its common stock in the future. The Company is a holding company and its only material asset is its interest in Clearway Energy LLC, and the Company is accordingly dependent upon distributions from Clearway Energy LLC and its subsidiaries to pay dividends and taxes and other expenses. 
 Market interest rates may have an effect on the value of the Company s Class A and Class C common stock. 
 Market volatility and reports by securities and industry analysts may affect the price of the Company s Class A and Class C common stock, and the future issuance of additional shares of common stock or sales of common stock by CEG may cause dilution of investors ownership interest or cause the price of the Company s Class A or Class C common stock to fall. 
 Provisions of the Company s charter documents or Delaware law could delay or prevent an acquisition of the Company, even if the acquisition would be beneficial to holders of the Company s Class A and Class C common stock, and could make it more difficult to change management. 
 Risks Related to Taxation 
 The Company s future tax liability may be greater than expected if the Company does not generate NOLs sufficient to offset taxable income, if federal, state and local tax authorities challenge certain of the Company s tax positions and exemptions or if changes in federal, state and local tax laws occur. 
 The Company s ability to use NOLs to offset future income may be limited. 
 A valuation allowance may be required for the Company s deferred tax assets. 
 Distributions to holders of the Company s Class A and Class C common stock may be taxable. 
 Changes in tax laws or policies, including but not limited to changes in corporate income tax rates, as well as judgments and estimates used in the determination of tax-related asset and liability amounts, could materially adversely affect the Company s business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects. 

15 

Risks Related to the Company s Business 
 Pursuant to the Company s cash dividend policy, the Company intends to distribute a significant amount of the CAFD through regular quarterly distributions and dividends, and the Company s ability to grow and make acquisitions through cash on hand is limited. 
 The Company expects to distribute a significant amount of the CAFD each quarter and to rely primarily upon external financing sources, including the issuance of debt and equity securities and, if applicable, borrowings under the Company s revolving credit facility to fund acquisitions and growth capital expenditures. The Company may be precluded from pursuing otherwise attractive acquisitions if the projected short-term cash flow from the acquisition or investment is not adequate to service the capital raised to fund the acquisition or investment, after giving effect to the Company s available cash reserves. To the extent the Company issues additional equity securities in connection with any acquisitions or growth capital expenditures, the payment of dividends on these additional equity securities may increase the risk that the Company will be unable to maintain or increase its per share dividend. The incurrence of bank borrowings or other debt by Clearway Energy Operating LLC or by the Company s project-level subsidiaries to finance the Company s growth strategy will result in increased interest expense and the imposition of additional or more restrictive covenants, which, in turn, may impact the cash distributions the Company receives to distribute to holders of the Company s common stock. 
 The Company may not be able to effectively identify or consummate any future acquisitions on favorable terms, or at all, and future acquisitions may not be accretive as a result of incorrect assumptions in the Company s evaluation of such acquisitions, unforeseen consequences or other external events beyond the Company s control. 
 The Company s business strategy includes growth through the acquisitions of additional generation assets (including through corporate acquisitions). This strategy depends on the Company s ability to successfully identify and evaluate acquisition opportunities and consummate acquisitions on favorable terms. However, the number of acquisition opportunities is limited. In addition, the Company will compete with other companies for these limited acquisition opportunities, which may increase the Company s cost of making acquisitions or cause the Company to refrain from making acquisitions at all. Some of the Company s competitors for acquisitions are much larger than the Company with substantially greater resources. These companies may be able to pay more for acquisitions and may be able to identify, evaluate, bid for and purchase a greater number of assets than the Company s financial or human resources permit. If the Company is unable to identify and consummate future acquisitions, it will impede the Company s ability to execute its growth strategy and limit the Company s ability to increase the amount of dividends paid to holders of the Company s common stock. 
 The Company s ability to acquire future renewable facilities may depend on the viability of renewable assets generally. These assets currently are largely contingent on public policy mechanisms including ITCs, cash grants, loan guarantees, accelerated depreciation, RPS and carbon trading plans. These mechanisms have been implemented at the state and federal levels to support the development of renewable generation, demand-side and smart grid and other clean infrastructure technologies. The availability and continuation of public policy support mechanisms will drive a significant part of the economics and viability of the Company s growth strategy and expansion into clean energy investments. 
 The acquisition of companies and assets are subject to substantial risks, including the failure to identify material problems during due diligence (for which the Company may not be indemnified post-closing) and the risk of overpaying for assets (or not making acquisitions on an accretive basis). The integration and consolidation of acquisitions requires substantial human, financial and other resources and, ultimately, the Company s acquisitions may divert management s attention from the Company s existing business concerns, disrupt the Company s ongoing business or not be successfully integrated. There can be no assurances that any future acquisitions will perform as expected or that the returns from such acquisitions will support the financing utilized to acquire them or maintain them. A failure to achieve the financial returns the Company expects when it acquires generation assets could have a material adverse effect on the Company s ability to grow its business and make cash distributions to its stockholders. Any failure of the Company s acquired generation assets to be accretive or difficulty in integrating such acquisition into the Company s business could have a material adverse effect on the Company s ability to grow its business and make cash distributions to its stockholders. As a result, the consummation of acquisitions could have a material adverse effect on the Company s business, financial condition, results of operations, cash flows and ability to pay dividends to holders of the Company s common stock. 
 16 

Counterparties to the Company s offtake agreements may not fulfill their obligations and, as the contracts expire, the Company may not be able to replace them with agreements on similar terms in light of increasing competition in the markets in which the Company operates. 
 A significant portion of the electric power the Company generates is sold under long-term offtake agreements with public utilities or industrial or commercial end-users, with a weighted average remaining duration, based on CAFD, of approximately 11 years. As of December 31, 2022, the largest customers of the Company s power generation assets, including assets in which the Company has less than a 100 membership interest, were SCE and PG E, which represented 33 and 25 , respectively, of total consolidated revenues generated by the Company during the year ended December 31, 2022. 
 If, for any reason, any of the purchasers of power under these agreements are unable or unwilling to fulfill their related contractual obligations or if they refuse to accept delivery of power delivered thereunder or if they otherwise terminate such agreements prior to the expiration thereof, the Company s assets, liabilities, business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows could be materially and adversely affected. Furthermore, to the extent any of the Company s power purchasers are, or are controlled by, governmental entities, the Company s facilities may be subject to legislative or other political action that may impair their contractual performance. 
 The power generation industry is characterized by intense competition and the Company s electric generation assets encounter competition from utilities, industrial companies and independent power producers, in particular with respect to uncontracted output. In recent years, there has been increasing competition among generators for offtake agreements and this has contributed to a reduction in electricity prices in certain markets characterized by excess supply above designated reserve margins. In light of these market conditions, the Company may not be able to replace an expiring or terminated agreement with an agreement on equivalent terms and conditions, including at prices that permit operation of the related facility on a profitable basis. In addition, the Company believes many of its competitors have well-established relationships with the Company s current and potential suppliers, lenders and customers, and have extensive knowledge of its target markets. As a result, these competitors may be able to respond more quickly than the Company to evolving industry standards and changing customer requirements. The adoption of more advanced technology could reduce its competitors power production costs resulting in their having a lower cost structure than is achievable with the technologies currently employed by the Company and adversely affect its ability to compete for offtake agreement renewals. If the Company is unable to replace an expiring or terminated offtake agreement, the affected facility may temporarily or permanently cease operations. External events, such as a severe economic downturn or force majeure events, could also impair the ability of some counterparties to the Company s offtake agreements and other customer agreements to pay for energy and/or other products and services received. 
 The Company s inability to enter into new or replacement offtake agreements or to compete successfully against current and future competitors in the markets in which the Company operates could have a material adverse effect on the Company s business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. 
 The Company s ability to effectively consummate future acquisitions will also depend on the Company s ability to arrange the required or desired financing for acquisitions. 
 The Company may not have sufficient availability under the Company s credit facilities or have access to project-level financing on commercially reasonable terms when acquisition opportunities arise. An inability to obtain the required or desired financing could significantly limit the Company s ability to consummate future acquisitions and effectuate the Company s growth strategy. If financing is available, utilization of the Company s credit facilities or project-level financing for all or a portion of the purchase price of an acquisition could significantly increase the Company s interest expense, impose additional or more restrictive covenants and reduce CAFD. Similarly, the issuance of additional equity securities as consideration for acquisitions could cause significant stockholder dilution and reduce the Company s dividends if the acquisitions are not sufficiently accretive. The Company s ability to consummate future acquisitions may also depend on the Company s ability to obtain any required regulatory approvals for such acquisitions. 
 The Company s indebtedness could adversely affect its ability to raise additional capital to fund the Company s operations or pay dividends. It could also expose the Company to the risk of increased interest rates and limit the Company s ability to react to changes in the economy or the Company s industry as well as impact the Company s results of operations, financial condition and cash flows. 
 As of December 31, 2022, the Company had approximately 6,870 million of total consolidated indebtedness, 4,745 million of which was incurred by the Company s non-guarantor subsidiaries. In addition, the Company s share of its unconsolidated affiliates total indebtedness and letters of credit outstanding as of December 31, 2022, totaled approximately 325 million and 37 million, respectively (calculated as the Company s unconsolidated affiliates total indebtedness as of such date multiplied by the Company s percentage membership interest in such assets). 
 17 

The Company s substantial debt could have important negative consequences on the Company s financial condition, including: 
 increasing the Company s vulnerability to general economic and industry conditions; 
 requiring a substantial portion of the Company s cash flow from operations to be dedicated to the payment of principal and interest on the Company s indebtedness, therefore reducing the Company s ability to pay dividends to holders of the Company s capital stock (including the Class A and Class C common stock) or to use the Company s cash flow to fund its operations, capital expenditures and future business opportunities; 
 limiting the Company s ability to enter into long-term power sales or fuel purchases which require credit support; 
 limiting the Company s ability to fund operations or future acquisitions; 
 restricting the Company s ability to make certain distributions with respect to the Company s capital stock (including the Class A and Class C common stock) and the ability of the Company s subsidiaries to make certain distributions to it, in light of restricted payment and other financial covenants in the Company s credit facilities and other financing agreements; 
 exposing the Company to the risk of increased interest rates because certain of the Company s borrowings, which may include borrowings under the Company s revolving credit facility, are at variable rates of interest; 
 limiting the Company s ability to obtain additional financing for working capital including collateral postings, capital expenditures, debt service requirements, acquisitions and general corporate or other purposes; and 
 limiting the Company s ability to adjust to changing market conditions and placing it at a competitive disadvantage compared to the Company s competitors who have less debt. 
 The Company s revolving credit facility contains financial and other restrictive covenants that limit the Company s ability to return capital to stockholders or otherwise engage in activities that may be in the Company s long-term best interests. The Company s inability to satisfy certain financial covenants could prevent the Company from paying cash dividends, and the Company s failure to comply with those and other covenants could result in an event of default which, if not cured or waived, may entitle the related lenders to demand repayment or enforce their security interests, which could have a material adverse effect on the Company s business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. In addition, failure to comply with such covenants may entitle the related lenders to demand repayment and accelerate all such indebtedness. 
 The agreements governing the Company s project-level financing contain financial and other restrictive covenants that limit the Company s project subsidiaries ability to make distributions to the Company or otherwise engage in activities that may be in the Company s long-term best interests. The project-level financing agreements generally prohibit distributions from the project entities to the Company unless certain specific conditions are met, including the satisfaction of certain financial ratios. The Company s inability to satisfy certain financial covenants may prevent cash distributions by the particular project(s) to it and, the Company s failure to comply with those and other covenants could result in an event of default which, if not cured or waived may entitle the related lenders to demand repayment or enforce their security interests, which could have a material adverse effect on the Company s business, results of operations and financial condition. In addition, failure to comply with such covenants may entitle the related lenders to demand repayment and accelerate all such indebtedness. If the Company is unable to make distributions from the Company s project-level subsidiaries, it would likely have a material adverse effect on the Company s ability to pay dividends to holders of the Company s common stock. 
 Letter of credit facilities to support project-level contractual obligations generally have a limited term that may require future renewal, at which time the Company or relevant project-level subsidiary will need to satisfy applicable financial ratios and covenants. If the Company is unable to renew the Company s letters of credit as expected or replace them with letters of credit under different facilities on favorable terms or at all, the Company may experience a material adverse effect on its business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. Furthermore, such inability may constitute a default under certain project-level financing arrangements, restrict the ability of the project-level subsidiary to make distributions to it and/or reduce the amount of cash available at such subsidiary to make distributions to the Company. 
 18 

In addition, the Company s ability to arrange financing, either at the corporate level or at a non-recourse project-level subsidiary, and the costs of such capital, are dependent on numerous factors, including: 
 general economic and capital market conditions; 
 credit availability from banks and other financial institutions; 
 investor confidence in the Company, its partners, GIP and TotalEnergies, through CEG, the Company s principal stockholder (on a combined voting basis), and the regional wholesale power markets; 
 the Company s financial performance and the financial performance of the Company subsidiaries; 
 the Company s level of indebtedness and compliance with covenants in debt agreements; 
 maintenance of acceptable project credit ratings or credit quality; 
 cash flow; and 
 provisions of tax and securities laws that may impact raising capital. 
 The Company may not be successful in obtaining additional capital for these or other reasons. Furthermore, the Company may be unable to refinance or replace project-level financing arrangements or other credit facilities on favorable terms or at all upon the expiration or termination thereof. The Company s failure, or the failure of any of the Company s projects, to obtain additional capital or enter into new or replacement financing arrangements when due may constitute a default under such existing indebtedness and may have a material adverse effect on the Company s business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. 
 Certain of the Company s long-term bilateral contracts result from state-mandated procurements and could be declared invalid by a court of competent jurisdiction. 
 A portion of the Company s revenues are derived from long-term bilateral contracts with utilities that are regulated by their respective states and have been entered into pursuant to certain state programs. Certain long-term contracts that other companies have with state-regulated utilities have been challenged in federal court and have been declared unconstitutional on the grounds that the rate for energy and capacity established by the contracts impermissibly conflicts with the rate for energy and capacity established by FERC pursuant to the FPA. If certain of the Company s state-mandated agreements with utilities are ever held to be invalid or unenforceable due to the financial conditions or other conditions of such utility, the Company may be unable to replace such contracts, which could have a material adverse effect on the Company s business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. 
 The generation of electric energy from solar and wind energy sources depends heavily on suitable meteorological conditions. 
 If solar or wind conditions are unfavorable, the Company s electricity generation and revenue from renewable generation facilities may be substantially below the Company s expectations. The electricity produced and revenues generated by a solar or wind energy generation facility is highly dependent on suitable solar or wind conditions, as applicable, and associated weather conditions, which are beyond the Company s control. Disruption in the generation of solar or wind energy could limit a facility s ability to generate electricity at its desired level. Should a generation facility fail to perform at the required levels, or other unplanned disruptions occur, the facility may be forced to fulfill an underlying contractual obligation by purchasing electricity at higher prices. In addition, the Company s facilities may be exposed, based on specific contractual terms, to a locational basis risk resulting from a difference in the price received for generation sold at the location where the power is generated and the price paid for generation purchased at the contracted delivery point, which could lead to potential lower revenues in circumstances where the price received is lower than the price that is paid. Furthermore, components of the Company s systems, such as solar panels and inverters, could be damaged by severe weather, such as wildfires, hailstorms, lightning, tornadoes or freezing temperatures and other winter weather conditions. In addition, replacement and spare parts for key components may be difficult or costly to acquire or may be unavailable. Unfavorable weather and atmospheric conditions could impair the effectiveness of the Company s assets or reduce their output beneath their rated capacity or require shutdown of key equipment, impeding operation of the Company s renewable assets. For example, in February 2021, the Company s wind projects in Texas were unable to operate and experienced outages for a few days as a result of the extreme winter weather conditions. In addition, climate change may have the long-term effect of changing wind patterns at the Company s projects. Changing wind patterns could cause changes in expected electricity generation. These events could also degrade equipment or components and the interconnection and transmission facilities lives or maintenance costs.

Although the Company bases its investment decisions with respect to each renewable generation facility on the findings of related wind and solar studies conducted on-site prior to construction or based on historical conditions at existing facilities, actual climatic conditions at a facility site, particularly wind conditions, may not conform to the findings of these studies and may be affected by variations in weather patterns, including any potential impact of climate change. Therefore, the Company s solar and wind energy facilities may not meet anticipated production levels or the rated capacity of the Company s generation assets, which could adversely affect the Company s business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. 
 Operation of electric generation facilities involves significant risks and hazards customary to the power industry that could have a material adverse effect on the Company s business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. 
 The ongoing operation of the Company s facilities involves risks that include the breakdown or failure of equipment or processes or performance below expected levels of output or efficiency due to wear and tear, latent defect, design error or operator error or force majeure events, among other things. The Company s facilities are subject to the risks inherent with power generation facilities, including, but not limited to, degradation of equipment in excess of the Company s expectations, system failures and outages, which could impair the ability of the facilities to meet the Company s performance expectations. Operation of the Company s facilities also involves risks that the Company will be unable to transport its products to its customers in an efficient manner due to a lack of transmission capacity. Unplanned outages of generating units, including extensions of scheduled outages due to mechanical failures or other problems, occur from time to time and are an inherent risk of the business. Unplanned outages typically increase operation and maintenance expenses, capital expenditures and may reduce revenues as a result of selling fewer MWh or require the Company to incur significant costs as a result of obtaining replacement power from third parties in the open market to satisfy forward power sales obligations. The Company s inability to operate its electric generation assets efficiently, manage capital expenditures and costs and generate earnings and cash flow from the Company s asset-based businesses could have a material adverse effect on the Company s business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. While the Company maintains insurance, obtains warranties from vendors and obligates contractors to meet certain performance levels, the proceeds of such insurance, warranties or performance guarantees may not cover the Company s lost revenues, increased expenses or liquidated damages payments should it experience equipment breakdown or non-performance by contractors or vendors. The Company maintains an amount of insurance protection that it considers adequate but cannot provide any assurance that the Company s insurance will be sufficient or effective under all circumstances and against all hazards or liabilities to which the Company may be subject. Furthermore, the Company s insurance coverage is subject to deductibles, caps, exclusions and other limitations. A loss for which the Company is not fully insured (which may include a significant judgment against any facility or facility operator) could have a material adverse effect on the Company s business, financial condition, results of operations or cash flows. Further, due to rising insurance costs and changes in the insurance markets, the Company cannot provide any assurance that its insurance coverage will continue to be available at all or at rates or on terms similar to those presently available. Any losses not covered by insurance could have a material adverse effect on the Company s business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. 
 Power generation involves hazardous activities, including acquiring, transporting and unloading fuel, operating large pieces of rotating equipment and delivering electricity to transmission and distribution systems. In addition to natural risks such as earthquake, flood, lightning, hurricane and wind, other hazards, such as fire, explosion, structural collapse and machinery failure are inherent risks in the Company s operations. These and other hazards can cause significant personal injury or loss of life, severe damage to and destruction of property, plant and equipment and contamination of, or damage to, the environment and suspension of operations. To the extent an event was not covered by insurance policies, such incidents could subject the Company to substantial liabilities arising from emergency response, environmental cleanup and restoration costs, claims made by neighboring landowners and other third parties for personal injury and property damage, and fines or penalties for any related violations of environmental laws or regulations. 
 The Company s facilities may operate, wholly or partially, without long-term power sales agreements. 
 The Company s facilities may operate without long-term power sales agreements for some or all of their generating capacity and output and therefore be exposed to market fluctuations. Without the benefit of long-term power sales agreements for the facilities, the Company cannot be sure that it will be able to sell any or all of the power generated by the facilities at commercially attractive rates or that the facilities will be able to operate profitably. This could lead to less predictable revenues, future impairments of the Company s property, plant and equipment or to the closing of certain of its facilities, resulting in economic losses and liabilities, which could have a material adverse effect on the Company s results of operations, financial condition or cash flows. 
 20 

Maintenance, expansion and refurbishment of electric generation facilities involve significant risks that could result in unplanned power outages or reduced output. 
 The Company s facilities may require periodic upgrading and improvement. Any unexpected operational or mechanical failure, including failure associated with breakdowns and forced outages, could reduce the Company s facilities generating capacity below expected levels, reducing the Company s revenues and jeopardizing the Company s ability to pay dividends to holders of its common stock at expected levels or at all. Degradation of the performance of the Company s solar facilities above levels provided for in the related offtake agreements may also reduce the Company s revenues. Unanticipated capital expenditures associated with maintaining, upgrading or repairing the Company s facilities may also reduce profitability. 
 If the Company makes any major modifications to its conventional power generation facilities, it may be required to install the best available control technology or to achieve the lowest achievable emission rates as such terms are defined under the new source review provisions of the Clean Air Act in the future. Any such modifications could likely result in substantial additional capital expenditures. The Company may also choose to repower, refurbish or upgrade its facilities based on its assessment that such activity will provide adequate financial returns. Such facilities require time for development and capital expenditures before commencement of commercial operations, and key assumptions underpinning a decision to make such an investment may prove incorrect, including assumptions regarding construction costs, timing, available financing and future fuel and power prices. These events could have a material adverse effect on the Company s business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. 
 Supplier and/or customer concentration at certain of the Company s facilities may expose the Company to significant financial credit or performance risks. 
 The Company often relies on a single contracted supplier or a small number of suppliers for the provision of fuel, transportation of fuel, equipment, technology and/or other services required for the operation of certain facilities. In addition, certain of the Company s suppliers provide long-term warranties with respect to the performance of their products or services. If any of these suppliers cannot perform under their agreements with the Company, or satisfy their related warranty obligations, the Company will need to utilize the marketplace to provide or repair these products and services. There can be no assurance that the marketplace can provide these products and services as, when and where required. The Company may not be able to enter into replacement agreements on favorable terms or at all. If the Company is unable to enter into replacement agreements to provide for fuel, equipment, technology and other required services, it would seek to purchase the related goods or services at market prices, exposing the Company to market price volatility and the risk that fuel and transportation may not be available during certain periods at any price. The Company may also be required to make significant capital contributions to remove, replace or redesign equipment that cannot be supported or maintained by replacement suppliers, which could have a material adverse effect on the business, financial condition, results of operations, credit support terms and cash flows. 
 In addition, potential or existing customers at the Company s district energy centers and combined heat and power plants, or the Energy Centers, may opt for on-site systems in lieu of using the Company s Energy Centers, either due to corporate policies regarding the allocation of capital, unique situations where an on-site system might in fact prove more efficient, because of previously committed capital in systems that are already on-site, or otherwise. At times, the Company relies on a single customer or a few customers to purchase all or a significant portion of a facility s output, in some cases under long-term agreements that account for a substantial percentage of the anticipated revenue from a given facility. 
 The failure of any supplier to fulfill its contractual obligations to the Company or the Company s loss of potential or existing customers could have a material adverse effect on its financial results. Consequently, the financial performance of the Company s facilities is dependent on the credit quality of, and continued performance by, the Company s suppliers and vendors and the Company s ability to solicit and retain customers. 
 21 

The Company currently owns, and in the future may acquire, certain assets in which the Company has limited control over management decisions and its interests in such assets may be subject to transfer or other related restrictions. 
 As described in Item 15 Note 5, Investments Accounted for by the Equity Method and Variable Interest Entities , the Company has limited control over the operation of certain of its assets, because the Company beneficially owns less than a majority of the membership interests in such assets. The Company may seek to acquire additional assets in which it owns less than a majority of the related membership interests in the future. In these investments, the Company will seek to exert a degree of influence with respect to the management and operation of assets in which it owns less than a majority of the membership interests by negotiating to obtain positions on management committees or to receive certain limited governance rights, such as rights to veto significant actions. However, the Company may not always succeed in such negotiations. The Company may be dependent on its co-venturers to operate such assets. The Company s co-venturers may not have the level of experience, technical expertise, human resources management and other attributes necessary to operate these assets optimally. In addition, conflicts of interest may arise in the future between the Company and its stockholders, on the one hand, and the Company s co-venturers, on the other hand, where the Company s co-venturers business interests are inconsistent with the interests of the Company and its stockholders. Further, disagreements or disputes between the Company and its co-venturers could result in litigation, which could increase expenses and potentially limit the time and effort the Company s officers and directors are able to devote to the business. 
 The approval of co-venturers may also be required for the Company to receive distributions of funds from assets or to sell, pledge, transfer, assign or otherwise convey its interest in such assets, or for the Company to acquire CEG s interests in such co-ventures as an initial matter. Alternatively, the Company s co-venturers may have rights of first refusal or rights of first offer in the event of a proposed sale or transfer of the Company s interests in such assets. These restrictions may limit the price or interest level for interests in such assets, in the event the Company wants to sell such interests. 
 Furthermore, certain of the Company s facilities are operated by third-party operators. To the extent that third-party operators do not fulfill their obligations to manage operations of the facilities or are not effective in doing so, the amount of CAFD may be adversely affected. 
 The Company s assets are exposed to risks inherent in the use of interest rate swaps and the Company may be exposed to additional risks in the future if it utilizes other derivative instruments. 
 The Company uses interest rate swaps to manage interest rate risk. As a result, changes in the underlying assumptions or use of alternative valuation methods could affect the reported fair value of these contracts. If the values of these financial contracts change in a manner that the Company does not anticipate, or if a counterparty fails to perform under a contract, it could harm the business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. 
 The Company does not own all of the land on which its power generation assets are located, which could result in disruption to its operations. 
 The Company does not own all of the land on which its power generation assets are located, and the Company is, therefore, subject to the possibility of less desirable terms and increased costs to retain necessary land use if it does not have valid leases or rights-of-way or if such rights-of-way lapse or terminate. Although the Company has obtained rights to construct and operate these assets pursuant to related lease arrangements, the rights to conduct those activities are subject to certain exceptions, including the term of the lease arrangement. The Company is also at risk of condemnation on land it owns. The loss of these rights, through the Company s inability to renew right-of-way contracts, condemnation or otherwise, may adversely affect the Company s ability to operate its generation assets. 
 The Company s use and enjoyment of real property rights for its projects may be adversely affected by the rights of lienholders and leaseholders that are superior to those of the grantors of those real property rights to the Company. 
 Solar and wind projects generally are, and are likely to be, located on land occupied by the project pursuant to long-term easements and leases. The ownership interests in the land subject to these easements and leases may be subject to mortgages securing loans or other liens (such as tax liens) and other easement and lease rights of third parties (such as leases of oil or mineral rights) that were created prior to the project s easements and leases. As a result, the project s rights under these easements or leases may be subject, and subordinate, to the rights of those third parties. The Company performs title searches and obtains title insurance to protect itself against these risks. Such measures may, however, be inadequate to protect the Company against all risk of loss of its rights to use the land on which the wind projects are located, which could have a material adverse effect on the Company s business, financial condition and results of operations. 
 22 

The Company s businesses are subject to physical, market and economic risks relating to potential effects of climate change and public and governmental initiatives to address climate change. 
 Climate change creates uncertainty in weather and other environmental conditions, including temperature and precipitation levels, and thus may affect consumer demand for electricity. For example, deviations from normal weather may reduce demand or availability of electricity and gas distribution services. In addition, the potential physical effects of climate change, such as increased frequency and severity of storms, cloud coverage, precipitation, floods and other climatic events, could disrupt the Company s operations and supply chain, and cause them to incur significant costs in preparing for or responding to these effects. These or other meteorological changes could lead to increased operating costs, capital expenses or power purchase costs. 
 Furthermore, governmental, scientific and public concern over the threat of climate change arising from GHG emissions may limit the Company s access to natural gas or decrease demand for energy generated by the Company s conventional assets. State, national and foreign governments and agencies continue to evaluate, and in some instances adopt, climate-related legislation and other regulatory initiatives that would restrict GHG emissions. Changes in environmental requirements related to GHG, climate change and alternative energy sources may impact demand for the Company s services. For example, recently enacted H.R. 5376, commonly known as the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022, or IRA, includes incentives to increase wind and solar electric generation and encourage consumers to use these alternative energy sources. While this could benefit the Company by increasing the demand for the Company s solar or wind energy, the Company could experience delayed or cancelled projects and/or reduced production and demand for energy generated by the Company s conventional assets. However, the clean energy incentives included in the IRA or similar state or federal initiatives to incentivize a shift away from fossil fuels could reduce demand for energy generated by fossil fuels, and therefore have an adverse effect on the Company s natural gas generation business, financial condition and results of operations. 
 Lastly, companies across all industries are facing increased scrutiny from the public, stakeholders and government agencies related to their environmental, social, and governance (ESG) practices and commitments to address climate change. In recent years, investor advocacy groups, institutional investors, investment funds, and other influential investors have placed increasing importance on ESG practices. Increased focus and activism related to ESG and similar matters may hinder access to capital, as investors may decide to reallocate capital or to not commit capital as a result of their assessment of a company s ESG practices. While the Company is committed to engaging with its stakeholders on ESG practices in a proactive, holistic and integrated manner, changes in the public or stakeholder sentiment could impact the Company s ability to fund its conventional assets or decrease the demand for the energy generated by these assets. 
 Risks that are beyond the Company s control, including but not limited to acts of terrorism or related acts of war, natural disaster, pandemics (such as the COVID-19 pandemic), inflation, supply chain disruptions, hostile cyber intrusions or other catastrophic events, could have a material adverse effect on the business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. 
 The Company s generation facilities that were acquired or those that the Company otherwise acquires or constructs and the facilities of third parties on which they rely may be targets of terrorist activities, as well as events occurring in response to or in connection with them, that could cause environmental repercussions and/or result in full or partial disruption of the facilities ability to generate, transmit, transport or distribute electricity or natural gas. Strategic targets, such as energy-related facilities, may be at greater risk of future terrorist activities than other domestic targets. Inflation, disruption in global and domestic supply chains, and other economic conditions could negatively impact the Company s business in a manner that could adversely affect the Company s results of operations and financial condition. Hostile cyber intrusions, including those targeting information systems as well as electronic control systems used at the generating plants and for the related distribution systems, could severely disrupt business operations and result in loss of service to customers, as well as create significant expense to repair security breaches or system damage. 
 23 

Furthermore, certain of the Company s power generation assets are located in active earthquake zones in California and Arizona, and certain project companies and suppliers conduct their operations in the same region or in other locations that are susceptible to natural disasters. In addition, California and some of the locations where certain suppliers are located, from time to time, have experienced shortages of water, electric power and natural gas. Catastrophic events, such as an earthquake, wildfire, drought, flood, pandemics (such as the COVID-19 pandemic) or localized extended outages of critical utilities or transportation systems, or any critical resource shortages, affecting the Company or its suppliers, could cause a significant interruption in the business, damage or destroy the Company s facilities or those of its suppliers or the manufacturing equipment or inventory of the Company s suppliers. The Company has a limited number of highly skilled employees for some of its operations and relies on certain independent contractors and other service providers. If a large proportion of the Company s employees in those critical positions, or independent contractors or other service providers to the Company or its customers were to be negatively impacted by a catastrophic event at the same time, the Company would rely upon its business continuity plans in an effort to continue operations at its facilities, but there is no certainty that such measures will be sufficient to mitigate the adverse impact to its operations that could result from shortages of highly skilled employees, independent contractors or service providers. Any such terrorist acts, environmental repercussions or disruptions or natural disasters could result in a significant decrease in revenues or significant reconstruction or remediation costs, beyond what could be recovered through insurance policies, which could have a material adverse effect on the business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. 
 The operation of the Company s businesses is subject to cyber-based security and integrity risk. 
 Numerous functions affecting the efficient operation of the Company s businesses depend on the secure and reliable storage, processing and communication of electronic data and the use of sophisticated computer hardware and software systems. The operation of the Company s generating assets relies on cyber-based technologies and has been the target of disruptive actions. In addition, our business is dependent upon the computer systems of third-party providers to process certain data necessary to conduct our business, including sensitive employee information, credit card transaction information and other sensitive data. 
 Potential disruptive actions could result from cyber-attack or cyber intrusion, including by computer hackers, foreign governments and cyber terrorists, or otherwise be compromised by unintentional events with respect to the Company or any of its contractors or customers. As a result, operations could be interrupted, property could be damaged and sensitive employee, customer or supplier information could be lost or stolen, causing the Company to incur significant losses of revenues, other substantial liabilities and damages, costs to replace or repair damaged equipment and damage to the Company s reputation. Our insurance may not fully protect us against such losses. In addition, the Company may experience increased capital and operating costs to implement increased security for its cyber systems and generating assets. 
 In addition, cyberattacks against us or others in our industry could result in additional regulations, which could lead to increased regulatory compliance costs, insurance coverage cost or capital expenditures. Any failure by us to comply with these additional regulations could result in significant penalties and liability to us. We cannot predict the potential impact to our business or the energy industry resulting from such additional regulations. 
 24 

The Company relies on electric distribution and transmission facilities that it does not own or control and that are subject to transmission constraints within a number of the Company s regions. If these facilities fail to provide the Company with adequate transmission capacity, it may be restricted in its ability to deliver electric power to its customers and may either incur additional costs or forego revenues. 
 The Company depends on electric distribution and transmission facilities owned and operated by others to deliver the wholesale power it will sell from its electric generation assets to its customers. A failure or delay in the operation or development of these facilities or a significant increase in the cost of the development of such facilities could result in lost revenues. Such failures or delays could limit the amount of power the Company s operating facilities deliver or delay the completion of the Company s construction projects. Additionally, such failures, delays or increased costs could have a material adverse effect on the business, financial condition and results of operations. If a region s power transmission infrastructure is inadequate, the Company s recovery of wholesale costs and profits may be limited. If restrictive transmission price regulation is imposed, the transmission companies may not have a sufficient incentive to invest in expansion of transmission infrastructure. The Company also cannot predict whether distribution or transmission facilities will be expanded in specific markets to accommodate competitive access to those markets. In addition, certain of the Company s operating facilities generation of electricity may be curtailed without compensation due to transmission limitations or limitations on the electricity grid s ability to accommodate intermittent and other electricity generating sources, reducing the Company s revenues and impairing its ability to capitalize fully on a particular facility s generating potential. Such curtailments could have a material adverse effect on the business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. Furthermore, economic congestion on transmission networks in certain of the markets in which the Company operates may occur and the Company may be deemed responsible for congestion costs. If the Company were liable for such congestion costs, its financial results could be adversely affected. 
 The Company s costs, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows could be adversely impacted by the disruption of the fuel supplies necessary to generate power at its conventional power generation facilities. 
 Delivery of fossil fuels to fuel the Company s conventional generation facilities is dependent upon the infrastructure (including natural gas pipelines) available to serve each such generation facility as well as upon the continuing financial viability of contractual counterparties. As a result, the Company is subject to the risks of disruptions or curtailments in the production of power at these generation facilities if a counterparty fails to perform or if there is a disruption in the fuel delivery infrastructure. 
 The Company depends on key personnel and its ability to attract and retain additional skilled management and other personnel, the loss of any of which could have a material adverse effect on the Company s financial condition and results of operations. 
 The Company believes its current operations and future success depend largely on the continued services of key personnel that it employs. Although the Company currently has access to the resources of CEG, the loss of key personnel employed by the Company or CEG could have a material adverse effect on the Company s financial condition and results of operations. 
 The Company may potentially be adversely affected by emerging technologies that may over time impact capacity markets and the energy industry overall. 
 Research and development activities are ongoing in the Company s industry to provide alternative and more efficient technologies to produce power, including wind, photovoltaic (solar) cells, hydrogen, energy storage, and improvements in traditional technologies and equipment, such as more efficient gas turbines. Advances in these or other technologies could reduce the costs of power production to a level below what the Company has currently forecasted, which could adversely affect its cash flows, results of operations or competitive position. 
 Some emerging technologies, such as distributed renewable energy technologies, broad consumer adoption of electric vehicles and energy storage devices, could affect the price of energy. These emerging technologies may affect the financial viability of utility counterparties and could have significant impacts on market prices, which could ultimately have a material adverse effect on the Company s financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. 
 25 

Risks Related to the Company s Relationships with GIP, TotalEnergies and CEG 
 GIP and TotalEnergies, through their equal ownership of CEG, the Company s controlling stockholder, exercise substantial influence over the Company. The Company is highly dependent on GIP, TotalEnergies and CEG. 
 CEG owns all of the Company s outstanding Class B and Class D common stock. The Company s outstanding Class B and Class D common stock is entitled to one vote per share and 1/100th of a vote per share, respectively. As a result of its ownership of the Class B and Class D common stock, CEG owns 54.91 of the combined voting power of the Company s common stock as of December 31, 2022. CEG is equally owned by GIP and TotalEnergies. As a result of this ownership, GIP and TotalEnergies have substantial influence on the Company s affairs and CEG s voting power will constitute a large percentage of any quorum of the Company s stockholders voting on any matter requiring the approval of the Company s stockholders. Such matters include the election of directors, the adoption of amendments to the Company s amended and restated certificate of incorporation and fourth amended and restated bylaws and approval of mergers or sale of all or substantially all of its assets. This concentration of ownership may also have the effect of delaying or preventing a change in control of the Company or discouraging others from making tender offers for the Company s shares. In addition, CEG has the right to elect all of the Company s directors. GIP and TotalEnergies, through CEG, may cause corporate actions to be taken that do not fully align with the interests of the Company s other stockholders (including holders of the Company s Class A and Class C common stock). 
 Furthermore, the Company depends on certain services provided by or under the direction of CEG under the CEG Master Services Agreement, including numerous processes related to the Company s internal control over financial reporting. CEG personnel and support staff that provide services to the Company under the CEG Master Services Agreement are not required to, and the Company does not expect that they will, have as their primary responsibility the management and administration of the Company or to act exclusively for the Company and the CEG Master Services Agreement does not require any specific individuals to be provided by CEG. Under the CEG Master Services Agreement, CEG has the discretion to determine which of its employees perform assignments required to be provided to the Company. Any failure to effectively manage the Company s processes related to internal controls over financial reporting, operations or to implement its strategy could have a material adverse effect on the business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. The CEG Master Services Agreement will continue in perpetuity, until terminated in accordance with its terms. 
 The Company also depends upon CEG and third parties for the provision of management, administration, O M and certain other services at certain of the Company s facilities. Any failure by CEG or third parties to perform its requirements under these arrangements or the failure by the Company to identify and contract with replacement service providers, if required, could adversely affect the operation of the Company s facilities and have a material adverse effect on the business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. 
 CEG controls the Company and has the ability to designate a majority of the members of the Company s Board. 
 Due to CEG s approximate 54.91 combined voting power in the Company, the ability of other holders of the Company s Class A and Class C common stock to exercise control over the corporate governance of the Company is limited. GIP and TotalEnergies, through their equal ownership of CEG, have a substantial influence on the Company s affairs and CEG s voting power constitutes a large percentage of any quorum of the Company s stockholders voting on any matter requiring the approval of the Company s stockholders. It is possible that the interests of GIP, TotalEnergies and their respective affiliates may in certain circumstances differ from the interests of the Company or other holders of the Company s Class A and Class C common stock. 
 The Company may not be able to consummate future acquisitions from CEG. 
 The Company s ability to grow through acquisitions depends, in part, on CEG s ability to identify and present the Company with acquisition opportunities. Although CEG has agreed, pursuant to the CEG ROFO Agreement, to grant the Company a right of first offer with respect to certain power generation assets that CEG may elect to sell in the future, CEG is under no obligation to sell any such power generation assets or to accept any related offers from the Company. In addition, CEG has not agreed to commit any minimum level of dedicated resources for the pursuit of renewable power-related acquisitions. There are a number of factors which could materially and adversely impact the extent to which suitable acquisition opportunities are made available from CEG, including that the same professionals within CEG s organization that are involved in acquisitions that are suitable for the Company have responsibilities within CEG s broader asset management business, which may include sourcing acquisition opportunities for CEG. Limits on the availability of such individuals will likewise result in a limitation on the availability of acquisition opportunities for the Company. In making these determinations, CEG may be influenced by factors that result in a misalignment with the Company s interests or conflict of interest. 
 26 

The Company may be unable to terminate the CEG Master Services Agreement, in certain circumstances. 
 The CEG Master Services Agreement provides that the Company may terminate the agreement upon 30 days prior written notice to CEG upon the occurrence of any of the following: (i) CEG defaults in the performance or observance of any material term, condition or covenant contained therein in a manner that results in material harm to the Company and the default continues unremedied for a period of 30 days after written notice thereof is given to CEG; (ii) CEG engages in any act of fraud, misappropriation of funds or embezzlement that results in material harm to the Company; (iii) CEG is grossly negligent in the performance of its duties under the agreement and such negligence results in material harm to the Company; or (iv) upon the happening of certain events relating to the bankruptcy or insolvency of CEG. Furthermore, if the Company requests an amendment to the scope of services provided by CEG under the CEG Master Services Agreement and is not able to agree with CEG as to a change to the service fee resulting from a change in the scope of services within 180 days of the request, the Company will be able to terminate the agreement upon 30 days prior notice to CEG. The Company will not be able to terminate the agreement for any other reason, including if CEG experiences a change of control, and the agreement continues in perpetuity, until terminated in accordance with its terms. If CEG s performance does not meet the expectations of investors, and the Company is unable to terminate the CEG Master Services Agreement, the market price of the Class A and Class C common stock could suffer. 
 If CEG terminates the CEG Master Services Agreement or defaults in the performance of its obligations under the agreement, the Company may be unable to contract with a substitute service provider on similar terms, or at all. 
 The Company relies on CEG to provide certain services under the CEG Master Services Agreement. The CEG Master Services Agreement provides that CEG may terminate the agreement upon 180 days prior written notice of termination to the Company if the Company defaults in the performance or observance of any material term, condition or covenant contained in the agreement in a manner that results in material harm and the default continues unremedied for a period of 30 days after written notice of the breach is given. If CEG terminates the Management Services Agreement or defaults in the performance of its obligations under the agreement, the Company may be unable to contract with CEG or a substitute service provider on similar terms or at all, and the costs of substituting service providers may be substantial. In addition, in light of CEG s familiarity with the Company s assets, a substitute service provider may not be able to provide the same level of service due to lack of pre-existing synergies. 
 The liability of CEG is limited under the Company s arrangements with it and the Company has agreed to indemnify CEG against claims that it may face in connection with such arrangements, which may lead CEG to assume greater risks when making decisions relating to the Company than it otherwise might if acting solely for its own account. 
 Under the CEG Master Services Agreement, CEG does not assume any responsibility other than to provide or arrange for the provision of the services described in the CEG Master Services Agreement in good faith. In addition, under the CEG Master Services Agreement, the liability of CEG and its affiliates is limited to the fullest extent permitted by law to conduct involving bad faith, fraud, willful misconduct or gross negligence or, in the case of a criminal matter, action that was known to have been unlawful. In addition, the Company has agreed to indemnify CEG to the fullest extent permitted by law from and against any claims, liabilities, losses, damages, costs or expenses incurred by an indemnified person or threatened in connection with the Company s operations, investments and activities or in respect of or arising from the CEG Master Services Agreement or the services provided by CEG, except to the extent that the claims, liabilities, losses, damages, costs or expenses are determined to have resulted from the conduct in respect of which such persons have liability as described above. These protections may result in CEG tolerating greater risks when making decisions than otherwise might be the case, including when determining whether to use leverage in connection with acquisitions. The indemnification arrangements to which CEG is a party may also give rise to legal claims for indemnification that are adverse to the Company and holders of its common stock. 
 27 

Certain of the Company s PPAs and project-level financing arrangements include provisions that would permit the counterparty to terminate the contract or accelerate maturity in the event GIP, TotalEnergies or their respective affiliates cease to control or own, directly or indirectly, a majority of the voting power of the Company. 
 Certain of the Company s PPAs and project-level financing arrangements contain change in control provisions that provide the counterparty with a termination right or the ability to accelerate maturity in the event of a change of control of the Company without the counterparty s consent. These provisions are triggered in the event GIP, TotalEnergies or their respective affiliates cease to own, directly or indirectly, capital stock representing more than 50 of the voting power of the Company s capital stock outstanding on such date, or, in some cases, if GIP, TotalEnergies or their respective affiliates cease to be the majority owner, directly or indirectly, of the applicable project subsidiary. As a result, if GIP, TotalEnergies or their respective affiliates cease to control, or in some cases, own a majority of the voting power of the Company, the counterparties could terminate such contracts or accelerate the maturity of such financing arrangements. The termination of any of the Company s PPAs or the acceleration of the maturity of any of the Company s project-level financing could have a material adverse effect on the Company s business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flow. 
 The Company is a controlled company , controlled by CEG, and as a result, is exempt from certain corporate governance requirements that are designed to provide protection to stockholders of companies that are not controlled companies. 
 As of December 31, 2022, CEG controls 54.91 of the Company s combined voting power and is able to elect all of the Company s board of directors. As a result, the Company is considered a controlled company for the purposes of the NYSE listing requirements. As a controlled company, the Company is permitted to, and the Company may, opt out of the NYSE listing requirements that would require (i) a majority of the members of the Company s board of directors to be independent, (ii) that the Company establish a compensation committee and a nominating and governance committee, each comprised entirely of independent directors, or (iii) an annual performance evaluation of the nominating and governance and compensation committees. The NYSE listing requirements are intended to ensure that directors who meet the independence standards are free of any conflicting interest that could influence their actions as directors. While the Company has elected to have a Corporate Governance, Conflicts and Nominating Committee consisting entirely of independent directors and to conduct an annual performance evaluation of this committee, the majority of the members of the Company s board of directors are not considered independent and the Company s compensation committee is not comprised entirely of independent directors. Therefore, the Company s stockholders may not have the same protections afforded to stockholders of companies that are subject to all of the applicable NYSE listing requirements. 
 Risks Related to Regulation 
 The Company s business is subject to restrictions resulting from environmental, health and safety laws and regulations. 
 The Company is subject to various federal, state and local environmental and health and safety laws and regulations. In addition, the Company may be held primarily or jointly and severally liable for costs relating to the investigation and clean-up of any property where there has been a release or threatened release of a hazardous regulated material as well as other affected properties, regardless of whether the Company knew of or caused the release. In addition to these costs, which are typically not limited by law or regulation and could exceed an affected property s value, the Company could be liable for certain other costs, including governmental fines and injuries to persons, property or natural resources. Further, some environmental laws provide for the creation of a lien on a contaminated site in favor of the government as security for damages and any costs the government incurs in connection with such contamination and associated clean-up. Although the Company generally requires its operators to undertake to indemnify it for environmental liabilities they cause, the amount of such liabilities could exceed the financial ability of the operator to indemnify the Company. The presence of contamination or the failure to remediate contamination may adversely affect the Company s ability to operate the business. 
 Greenhouse gas (GHG) regulation could also increase the cost of electricity generated by fossil fuels, and such increases could reduce demand for the power the Company s conventional assets generate and market. Legislative and regulatory measures to address climate change and GHG emissions are in various phases of discussion or implementation. The EPA regulates GHG emissions from new and modified facilities that are potential major sources of criteria pollutants under the Clean Air Act s Prevention of Significant Deterioration and Title V programs and has adopted regulations that require, among other things, preconstruction and operating permits for certain large stationary sources and the monitoring and reporting of GHGs from certain onshore oil and natural gas production sources on an annual basis. The United States Environmental Protection Agency has proposed strict new methane emissions regulations for certain oil and gas facilities. The IRA establishes a charge on methane emissions above certain limits from the same facilities. 
 28 

In addition, in 2015, the U.S., Canada and the U.K. participated in the United Nations Conference on Climate Change, which led to the creation of the Paris Agreement. The Paris Agreement, which was signed by the U.S. in April 2016, requires countries to review and represent a progression in their intended nationally determined contributions (which set GHG emission reduction goals) every five years beginning in 2020. In November 2020, the U.S. officially withdrew from the Paris Agreement in November 2020. However, on January 20, 2021, President Biden signed an Acceptance on Behalf of the United States of America that will allow the U.S. to rejoin the Paris Agreement. The newly signed acceptance, deposited with the United Nations on January 20, reverses the prior withdrawal. The U.S. officially rejoined the Paris Agreement on February 19, 2021. 
 The U.S. Congress, along with federal and state agencies, has also considered measures to reduce the emissions of GHGs. Legislation or regulation that restricts carbon emissions could increase the cost of environmental compliance for the Company s conventional assets by requiring the Company to install new equipment to reduce emissions from larger facilities and/or purchase emission allowances. Climate change and GHG legislation or regulation could also delay or otherwise negatively affect efforts to obtain and maintain permits and other regulatory approvals for the Company s conventional assets existing and new facilities, impose additional monitoring and reporting requirements or adversely affect demand for the natural gas the Company gathers, transports and stores. Conversely, legislation or regulation that sets a price on or otherwise restricts carbon emissions could also benefit the Company by increasing demand for solar or wind energy sources. In addition, governmental, scientific and public concern over the threat of climate change arising from GHG emissions has resulted in increasing political risks in the U.S, including climate change related pledges made by the Biden Administration. Shortly after taking office in January 2021, President Biden issued a series of executive orders designed to address climate change and suspend, revise, or rescind, prior agency actions that are identified as conflicting with the Biden Administration s climate policies. Furthermore, as part of rejoining the Paris Agreement, President Biden announced that the United States would commit to a 50 to 52 percent reduction from 2005 levels of GHG emissions by 2030 and set the goal of reaching net-zero GHG emissions by 2050. Reentry into the Paris Agreement and President Biden s executive orders may result in the development of additional regulations or changes to existing regulations. The effect on the Company of any new legislative or regulatory measures will depend on the particular provisions that are ultimately adopted. 
 The electric generation business is subject to substantial governmental regulation and may be adversely affected by changes in laws or regulations, as well as liability under, or any future inability to comply with, existing or future regulations or other legal requirements. 
 The Company s electric generation business is subject to extensive U.S. federal, state and local laws and regulations. Compliance with the requirements under these various regulatory regimes may cause the Company to incur significant additional costs, and failure to comply with such requirements could result in the shutdown of the non-complying facility, the imposition of liens, fines, and/or civil or criminal liability. Public utilities under the FPA are required to obtain FERC acceptance of their rate schedules for wholesale sales of electric energy, capacity and ancillary services. Except for generating facilities located in Hawaii or in Texas within the footprint of ERCOT, all of the Company s generating companies are public utilities under the FPA with market-based rate authority unless exempt from FPA public utility rate regulation. FERC s orders that grant market-based rate authority to wholesale power sellers reserve the right to revoke or revise that authority if FERC subsequently determines that the seller can exercise market power in transmission or generation, create barriers to entry, or engage in abusive affiliate transactions. In addition, public utilities are subject to FERC reporting requirements that impose administrative burdens and that, if violated, can expose the company to criminal and civil penalties or other risks. 
 The Company s market-based sales are subject to certain rules prohibiting manipulative or deceptive conduct, and if any of the Company s generating companies with market-based rate authority are deemed to have violated those rules, they could be subject to potential disgorgement of profits associated with the violation, penalties, suspension or revocation of market-based rate authority. If such generating companies were to lose their market-based rate authority, such companies would be required to obtain FERC s acceptance of a cost-of-service rate schedule and could become subject to the significant accounting, record-keeping, and reporting requirements that are imposed on utilities with cost-based rate schedules. This could have a material adverse effect on the rates the Company is able to charge for power from its facilities. 
 All of the Company s generating assets are operating either as EWGs as defined under the PUHCA, or as QFs as defined under the PURPA, as amended, and therefore are exempt from certain regulation under the PUHCA and the FPA. If a facility fails to maintain its status as an EWG or a QF or there are legislative or regulatory changes revoking or limiting the exemptions to the PUHCA and/or the FPA, then the Company may be subject to significant accounting, record-keeping, access to books and records and reporting requirements, and failure to comply with such requirements could result in the imposition of penalties and additional compliance obligations. 
 29 

Substantially all of the Company s generation assets are also subject to the reliability standards promulgated by the designated Electric Reliability Organization (currently the North American Electric Reliability Corporation, or NERC) and approved by FERC. If the Company fails to comply with the mandatory reliability standards, it could be subject to sanctions, including substantial monetary penalties and increased compliance obligations. The Company will also be affected by legislative and regulatory changes, as well as changes to market design, market rules, tariffs, cost allocations and bidding rules that occur in the existing regional markets operated by RTOs or ISOs, such as PJM. The RTOs/ISOs that oversee most of the wholesale power markets impose, and in the future may continue to impose, mitigation, including price limitations, offer caps, non-performance penalties and other mechanisms to address some of the volatility and the potential exercise of market power in these markets. These types of price limitations and other regulatory mechanisms may have a material adverse effect on the profitability of the Company s generation facilities acquired in the future that sell energy, capacity and ancillary products into the wholesale power markets. The regulatory environment for electric generation has undergone significant changes in the last several years due to state and federal policies affecting wholesale competition and the creation of incentives for the addition of large amounts of new renewable generation and, in some cases, transmission assets. These changes are ongoing, and the Company cannot predict the future design of the wholesale power markets or the ultimate effect that the changing regulatory environment will have on the Company s business. In addition, in some of these markets, interested parties have proposed to re-regulate the markets or require divestiture of electric generation assets by asset owners or operators to reduce their market share. Other proposals to re-regulate may be made and legislative or other attention to the electric power market restructuring process may delay or reverse the deregulation process. If competitive restructuring of the electric power markets is reversed, discontinued, or delayed, the Company s business prospects and financial results could be negatively impacted. 
 The Company is subject to environmental laws and regulations that impose extensive and increasingly stringent requirements on its operations, as well as potentially substantial liabilities arising out of environmental contamination. 
 The Company s assets are subject to numerous and significant federal, state and local laws, including statutes, regulations, guidelines, policies, directives and other requirements governing or relating to, among other things: protection of wildlife, including threatened and endangered species; air emissions; discharges into water; water use; the storage, handling, use, transportation and distribution of dangerous goods and hazardous, residual and other regulated materials, such as chemicals; the prevention of releases of hazardous materials into the environment; the prevention, presence and remediation of hazardous materials in soil and groundwater, both on and offsite; land use and zoning matters; and workers health and safety matters. The Company s facilities could experience incidents, malfunctions and other unplanned events that could result in spills or emissions in excess of permitted levels and result in personal injury, penalties and property damage. Any failure to comply with applicable environmental laws and regulations, including those relating to equipment failures, or obtain required governmental approvals and permits, may result in the assessment of administrative, civil or criminal penalties, imposition of investigatory or remedial activities and, in certain, less common circumstances, issuance of temporary or permanent injunctions, or construction or operation bans or delays. As such, the operation of the Company s facilities carries an inherent risk of environmental, health and safety liabilities (including potential civil actions, compliance or remediation orders, fines and other penalties), and may result in the assets being involved from time to time in administrative and judicial proceedings relating to such matters. The Company has implemented environmental, health and safety management programs designed to continually improve environmental, health and safety performance. Environmental laws and regulations have generally become more stringent over time. Significant costs may be incurred for capital expenditures under environmental programs to keep the assets compliant with such environmental laws and regulations. If it is not economical to make those expenditures, it may be necessary to retire or mothball facilities or restrict or modify the Company s operations to comply with more stringent standards. These environmental requirements and liabilities could have a material adverse effect on the business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. 
 The Company s business is subject to complex and evolving U.S. laws and regulations regarding privacy and data protection data protection laws ). Many of these laws and regulations are subject to change and uncertain interpretation, and could result in claims, increased cost of operations, or otherwise harm the Company s business. 
 The regulatory environment surrounding data privacy and protection is constantly evolving and can be subject to significant change. New data protection laws pose increasingly complex compliance challenges and potentially elevate the Company s costs. Complying with varying jurisdictional requirements could increase the costs and complexity of compliance, and violations of applicable data protection laws can result in significant penalties. Any failure, or perceived failure, by the Company to comply with applicable data protection laws could result in proceedings or actions against the Company by governmental entities or others, subject the Company to significant fines, penalties, judgments, and negative publicity, require the Company to change its business practices, increase the costs and complexity of compliance, and adversely affect the Company s business. As noted above, the Company is also subject to the possibility of cyberattacks, which themselves may result in a violation of these laws. Additionally, if the Company acquires a company that has violated or is not in compliance with applicable data protection laws, the Company may incur significant liabilities and penalties as a result. 
 30 

Government regulations providing incentives for renewable power generation could change at any time and such changes may negatively impact the Company s growth strategy. 
 The Company s growth strategy depends in part on government policies that support renewable generation and energy storage and enhance the economic viability of owning renewable power generation assets. Renewable power generation assets currently benefit from various federal, state and local governmental incentives such as ITCs, PTCs, loan guarantee programs, RPS, programs and accelerated depreciation for tax purposes. These laws, regulations and policies have had a significant impact on the development of renewable power generation projects and they could be changed, reduced or eliminated at any time. These incentives make the development of renewable power generation projects more competitive by providing tax credits or grants and accelerated depreciation for a portion of the development costs, decreasing the costs and risks associated with developing such projects or creating demand for renewable power assets through RPS programs. 
 The elimination or loss of, or reduction in, such incentives could (i) decrease the attractiveness of renewable power generation projects to developers, including, but not limited to, CEG, which could reduce the Company s acquisition opportunities, (ii) reduce the Company s willingness to pursue or develop certain renewable power projects due to higher operating costs or decreased revenues under its PPAs, (iii) cause the market for future renewable energy PPAs to be smaller and the prices for future renewable energy PPAs to be lower and/or (iv) result in increased financing costs and difficulty in obtaining financing on acceptable terms. 
 Any of the foregoing could have a material adverse effect on the Company s business, financial condition, results of operations and ability to grow its business and make cash distributions. 
 Revenue earned by the Company s GenConn assets is established each year in a rate case; accordingly, the profitability of these assets is dependent on regulatory approval. 
 Revenues related to the GenConn assets are established each year by the Connecticut Public Utilities Regulatory Authority. While such regulatory oversight is generally premised on the recovery of prudently incurred costs and a reasonable rate of return on invested capital, the rates that the Company may charge, or the revenue that the Company may earn with respect to this capacity are subject to authorization of the applicable regulatory authorities. There can be no assurance that such regulatory authorities will consider all of the costs to have been prudently incurred or that the regulatory process by which rates or revenues are determined will always result in rates or revenues that achieve full recovery of costs or an adequate return on the Company s capital investments. While the Company s rates and revenues are generally established based on an analysis of costs incurred in a base year, the rates the Company is allowed to charge, and the revenues the Company is authorized to earn, may or may not match the costs at any given time. If the Company s costs are not adequately recovered through these regulatory processes, it could have a material adverse effect on the business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. 
 Risks Related to the Company s Common Stock 
 The Company may not be able to continue paying comparable or growing cash dividends to holders of its common stock in the future. 
 The amount of CAFD principally depends upon the amount of cash the Company generates from its operations, which will fluctuate from quarter to quarter based on, among other things: 
 the level and timing of capital expenditures the Company makes; 
 the level of operating and general and administrative expenses, including reimbursements to CEG for services provided to the Company in accordance with the CEG Master Services Agreement; 
 variations in revenues generated by the business, due to seasonality, weather, unplanned plant outages, contractual pricing structures or otherwise; 
 debt service requirements and other liabilities; 
 the Company s ability to borrow funds and access capital markets; 
 restrictions contained in the Company s debt agreements (including project-level financing and, if applicable, corporate debt); and 
 other business risks affecting cash levels. 
 As a result of all these factors, the Company cannot guarantee that it will have sufficient cash generated from operations to pay a specific level of cash dividends to holders of its Class A or Class C common stock. Furthermore, holders of the Company s Class A or Class C common stock should be aware that the amount of CAFD depends primarily on operating cash flow, and is not solely a function of profitability, which can be affected by non-cash items. 
 31 

The Company may incur other expenses or liabilities during a period that could significantly reduce or eliminate its CAFD and, in turn, impair its ability to pay dividends to holders of the Company s Class A or Class C common stock during the period. Because the Company is a holding company, its ability to pay dividends on the Company s Class A or Class C common stock is restricted and further limited by the ability of the Company s subsidiaries to make distributions to the Company, including restrictions under the terms of the agreements governing the Company s corporate debt and project-level financing. For example, as a result of the bankruptcy of PG E, between early 2019 and mid-2020, certain of the Company s unconsolidated investments were unable to distribute project distributions to the Company. The project-level financing agreements generally prohibit distributions from the project entities prior to COD and thereafter prohibit distributions to the Company unless certain specific conditions are met, including the satisfaction of financial ratios. The Company s revolving credit facility also restricts the Company s ability to declare and pay dividends if an event of default has occurred and is continuing or if the payment of the dividend would result in an event of default. 
 Clearway Energy LLC s CAFD will likely fluctuate from quarter to quarter, in some cases significantly, due to seasonality. As a result, the Company may cause Clearway Energy LLC to reduce the amount of cash it distributes to its members in a particular quarter to establish reserves to fund distributions to its members in future periods for which the cash distributions the Company would otherwise receive from Clearway Energy LLC would be insufficient to fund its quarterly dividend. If the Company fails to cause Clearway Energy LLC to establish sufficient reserves, the Company may not be able to maintain its quarterly dividend with respect to a quarter adversely affected by seasonality. 
 Finally, dividends to holders of the Company s Class A or Class C common stock will be paid at the discretion of the Company s board of directors. The Company s board of directors may decrease the level, or entirely discontinue payment, of dividends. 
 The Company is a holding company and its only material asset is its interest in Clearway Energy LLC, and the Company is accordingly dependent upon distributions from Clearway Energy LLC and its subsidiaries to pay dividends and taxes and other expenses. 
 The Company is a holding company and has no material assets other than its ownership of membership interests in Clearway Energy LLC, a holding company that has no material assets other than its interest in Clearway Energy Operating LLC, whose sole material assets are the project companies. None of the Company, Clearway Energy LLC or Clearway Energy Operating LLC has any independent means of generating revenue. The Company intends to continue to cause Clearway Energy Operating LLC s subsidiaries to make distributions to Clearway Energy Operating LLC and, in turn, make distributions to Clearway Energy LLC, and, in turn, to make distributions to the Company in an amount sufficient to cover all applicable taxes payable and dividends, if any, declared by the Company. To the extent that the Company needs funds for a quarterly cash dividend to holders of the Company s Class A and Class C common stock or otherwise, and Clearway Energy Operating LLC or Clearway Energy LLC is restricted from making such distributions under applicable law or regulation or is otherwise unable to provide such funds (including as a result of Clearway Energy Operating LLC s operating subsidiaries being unable to make distributions), it could materially adversely affect the Company s liquidity and financial condition and limit the Company s ability to pay dividends to holders of the Company s Class A and Class C common stock. 
 Market interest rates may have an effect on the value of the Company s Class A and Class C common stock. 
 One of the factors that influences the price of shares of the Company s Class A and Class C common stock is the effective dividend yield of such shares (i.e., the yield as a percentage of the then market price of the Company s shares) relative to market interest rates. An increase in market interest rates may lead investors of shares of the Company s Class A and Class C common stock to expect a higher dividend yield and the Company s inability to increase its dividend as a result of an increase in borrowing costs, insufficient CAFD or otherwise, could result in selling pressure on, and a decrease in the market prices of the Company s Class A and Class C common stock as investors seek alternative investments with higher yield. 
 32 

Market volatility and reports by securities or industry analysts may affect the price of the Company s Class A and Class C common stock. 
 The market price of the Company s Class A and Class C common stock may fluctuate significantly in response to a number of factors, most of which the Company cannot predict or control, including general market and economic conditions, disruptions, downgrades, credit events and perceived problems in the credit markets; actual or anticipated variations in its quarterly operating results or dividends; natural disasters, wildfires and other weather-related events; changes in the Company s investments or asset composition; write-downs or perceived credit or liquidity issues affecting the Company s assets; market perception of GIP, TotalEnergies or CEG, the Company s business and the Company s assets; the Company s level of indebtedness and/or adverse market reaction to any indebtedness that the Company may incur in the future; the Company s ability to raise capital on favorable terms or at all; loss of any major funding source; changes in market valuations of similar power generation companies; and speculation in the press or investment community regarding the Company, GIP, TotalEnergies or CEG. 
 Securities markets in general have experienced extreme volatility that has often been unrelated to the operating performance of particular companies. Any broad market fluctuations may adversely affect the trading price of the Company s Class A and Class C common stock. 
 Furthermore, any significant disruption to the Company s ability to access the capital markets, or a significant increase in interest rates, could make it difficult for the Company to successfully acquire attractive projects from third parties and may also limit the Company s ability to obtain debt or equity financing to complete such acquisitions. If the Company is unable to raise adequate proceeds when needed to fund such acquisitions, the ability to grow the Company s project portfolio may be limited, which could have a material adverse effect on the Company s ability to implement its growth strategy and, ultimately, its business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. 
 The trading market for the Company s Class A and Class C common stock is influenced by the research and reports that industry or securities analysts may publish about the Company, the Company s business, the Company s market or the Company s competitors. If any of the analysts who may cover the Company change their recommendation regarding the Company s Class A and/or Class C common stock adversely or provide more favorable relative recommendations about the Company s competitors, the price of the Company s Class A and/or Class C common stock could decline. If any analyst who covers the Company were to cease coverage of the Company or fail to regularly publish reports on the Company, the Company could lose visibility in the financial markets, which in turn could cause the stock price or trading volume of the Company s Class A and/or Class C common stock to decline. 
 Provisions of the Company s charter documents or Delaware law could delay or prevent an acquisition of the Company, even if the acquisition would be beneficial to holders of the Company s Class A and Class C common stock, and could make it more difficult to change management. 
 Provisions of the Company s amended and restated certificate of incorporation and fourth amended and restated bylaws may discourage, delay or prevent a merger, acquisition or other change in control that holders of the Company s Class A and Class C common stock may consider favorable, including transactions in which such stockholders might otherwise receive a premium for their shares. This is because these provisions may prevent or frustrate attempts by stockholders to replace or remove members of the Company s management. These provisions include: 
 a prohibition on stockholder action through written consent; 
 a requirement that special meetings of stockholders be called upon a resolution approved by a majority of the Company s directors then in office; 
 advance notice requirements for stockholder proposals and nominations; and 
 the authority of the board of directors to issue preferred stock with such terms as the board of directors may determine. 
 33 

Section 203 of the Delaware General Corporation Law prohibits a publicly held Delaware corporation from engaging in a business combination with an interested stockholder, generally a person that together with its affiliates owns or within the last three years has owned 15 of voting stock, for a period of three years after the date of the transaction in which the person became an interested stockholder, unless the business combination is approved in a prescribed manner. Additionally, the Company s restated certificate of incorporation prohibits any person and any of its associate or affiliate companies in the aggregate, public utility or holding company from acquiring, other than secondary market transactions, an amount of the Company s Class A or Class C common stock sufficient to result in a transfer of control without the prior written consent of the Company s board of directors. Any such change of control, in addition to prior approval from the Company s board of directors, would require prior authorization from FERC. Similar restrictions may apply to certain purchasers of the Company s securities which are holding companies regardless of whether the Company s securities are purchased in offerings by the Company or NRG, in open market transactions or otherwise. A purchaser of the Company s securities which is a holding company will need to determine whether a given purchase of the Company s securities may require prior FERC approval. 
 Investors may experience dilution of ownership interest due to the future issuance of additional shares of the Company s Class A or Class C common stock. 
 The Company is in a capital intensive business and may not have sufficient funds to finance the growth of the Company s business, future acquisitions or to support the Company s projected capital expenditures. As a result, the Company may require additional funds from further equity or debt financings, including tax equity financing transactions, sales under the ATM Program or sales of preferred shares or convertible debt to complete future acquisitions, expansions and capital expenditures and pay the general and administrative costs of the Company s business. In the future, the Company may issue shares under its ATM Program and the Company s previously authorized and unissued securities, resulting in the dilution of the ownership interests of purchasers of the Company s Class A and Class C common stock. Under the Company s restated certificate of incorporation, the Company is authorized to issue 500,000,000 shares of Class A common stock, 500,000,000 shares of Class B common stock, 1,000,000,000 shares of Class C common stock, 1,000,000,000 shares of Class D common stock and 10,000,000 shares of preferred stock with preferences and rights as determined by the Company s board of directors. The potential issuance of additional shares of common stock or preferred stock or convertible debt may create downward pressure on the trading price of the Company s Class A and Class C common stock. 
 Future sales of the Company s Class A or Class C common stock by CEG may cause the price of the Company s Class A or Class C common stock to fall. 
 The market price of the Company s Class A or Class C common stock could decline as a result of sales by CEG of such shares (issuable to CEG upon the exchange of some or all of its Clearway Energy LLC Class B or Class D units, respectively) in the market, or the perception that these sales could occur. 
 The market price of the Company s Class A or Class C common stock may also decline as a result of CEG disposing or transferring some or all of the Company s outstanding Class B or Class D common stock, which disposals or transfers would reduce CEG s ownership interest in, and voting control over, the Company. These sales might also make it more difficult for the Company to sell equity securities at a time and price that the Company deems appropriate. CEG and certain of its affiliates have certain demand and piggyback registration rights with respect to shares of the Company s Class A common stock issuable upon the exchange of Clearway Energy LLC s Class B units and/or Class C common stock issuable upon the exchange of Clearway Energy LLC s Class D units. The presence of additional shares of the Company s Class A and/or Class C common stock trading in the public market, as a result of the exercise of such registration rights, could have a material adverse effect on the market price of the Company s securities. 
 Risks Related to Taxation 
 The Company s future tax liability may be greater than expected if the Company does not generate NOLs sufficient to offset taxable income, if federal, state and local tax authorities challenge certain of the Company s tax positions and exemptions or if changes in federal, state and local tax laws occur. 
 The Company expects to (i) generate NOLs and carryforward prior year NOL balances to offset future taxable income and (ii) generate tax credits and carryforward prior year tax credits to offset future income tax liabilities. Based on the Company s current portfolio of assets, which include renewable assets that benefit from accelerated tax depreciation deductions and federal tax credits, and taking into account the taxable gain on the Thermal Disposition which closed May 1, 2022, the Company estimates it will not pay material federal income tax through 2027, but does expect to pay material state income tax across certain jurisdictions beginning in 2023. 
 34 

While the Company expects its NOLs and tax credits will be available as a future benefit, in the event that they are not generated as expected, successfully challenged by the IRS or state and local jurisdictions (in a tax audit or otherwise) or subject to future limitations from a potential change in ownership, the Company s ability to realize these benefits may be limited. In addition, the Company s ability to realize state and local tax exemptions, including property or sales and use tax exemptions, is subject to various tax laws. If these exemptions are successfully challenged by state and local jurisdictions or if a change in tax law occurs, the Company s ability to realize these exemptions could be affected. A reduction in the Company s expected NOLs, a limitation on the Company s ability to use such losses or tax credits, and challenges by tax authorities to the Company s tax positions may result in a material increase in the Company s estimated future income, sales/use and property tax liability and may negatively impact the Company s liquidity and financial condition. 
 The Company s ability to use NOLs to offset future income may be limited. 
 The Company s ability to use NOLs could be substantially limited if the Company is unable to generate future taxable income or were to experience an ownership change as defined under Section 382 of the Code. In general, an ownership change would occur if the Company s 5-percent shareholders, as defined under Section 382 of the Code, collectively increased their ownership in the Company by more than 50 percentage points over a rolling three-year period. A corporation that experiences an ownership change will generally be subject to an annual limitation on the use of its pre-ownership change deferred tax assets equal to the equity value of the corporation immediately before the ownership change, multiplied by the long-term tax-exempt rate for the month in which the ownership change occurs. Future sales of any class of the Company s common stock by CEG, as well as future issuances by the Company, could contribute to a potential ownership change. 
 A valuation allowance may be required for the Company s deferred tax assets. 
 The Company s expected NOLs and tax credits will be reflected as a deferred tax asset as they are generated until utilized to offset income. Valuation allowances may need to be maintained for deferred tax assets that the Company estimates are more likely than not to be unrealizable, based on available evidence at the time the estimate is made. Valuation allowances related to deferred tax assets can be affected by changes to tax laws, statutory tax rates and future taxable income levels. In the event that the Company was to determine that it would not be able to realize all or a portion of the net deferred tax assets in the future, the Company would reduce such amounts through a charge to income tax expense in the period in which that determination was made, which could have a material adverse impact on the Company s financial condition and results of operations. 
 Distributions to holders of the Company s Class A and Class C common stock may be taxable. 
 The amount of distributions that will be treated as taxable for U.S. federal income tax purposes will depend on the amount of the Company s current and accumulated earnings and profits. It is difficult to predict whether the Company will generate earnings or profits as computed for federal income tax purposes in any given tax year. Generally, a corporation s earnings and profits are computed based upon taxable income, with certain specified adjustments. Distributions will constitute ordinary dividend income to the extent paid from the Company s current or accumulated earnings and profits. Distributions in excess of the Company s current and accumulated earnings and profits will constitute a nontaxable return of capital to the extent of a stockholder s basis in his or her Class A or Class C common stock. Distributions in excess of the Company s current and accumulated earnings and profits and in excess of a stockholder s basis will be treated as gain from the sale of the common stock. 
 For U.S. tax purposes, the Company s distributions to its stockholders in 2022 were classified as taxable dividends, while the 2021 distributions were classified as a nontaxable return of capital and reduction of a U.S. stockholder s tax basis, to the extent of a U.S. stockholder s tax basis in each of the Company s common shares, with any remaining amount being taxed as a capital gain. The Company anticipates that, largely due to the Thermal Disposition in 2022, it will be in a cumulative earnings and profits surplus position as of the end of 2022. As a result, a portion of any distributions made to holders of the Company s Class A and Class C Common stock in 2023 and beyond may be treated as taxable for U.S. federal income tax purposes. The portion of distributions that will be treated as taxable dividends will depend upon a number of factors, including but not limited to, the Company s overall performance and the gross amount of any distributions made to stockholders in 2023 and beyond. 
 
 35 

Changes in tax laws or policies, including but not limited to changes in corporate income tax rates, as well as judgments and estimates used in the determination of tax-related asset and liability amounts, could materially adversely affect the Company s business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects. 
 The Company s provision for income taxes and reporting of tax-related assets and liabilities require significant judgments and the use of estimates. Amounts of tax-related assets and liabilities involve judgments and estimates of the timing and probability of recognition of income, deductions and tax credits, including, but not limited to, estimates for potential adverse outcomes regarding tax positions that have been taken and the ability to utilize tax benefit carryforwards, such as NOL and tax credit carryforwards. Actual income taxes could vary significantly from estimated amounts due to the future impacts of, among other things, changes in tax laws, guidance or policies, including changes in corporate income tax rates, the financial conditions and results of operations of the Company, and the resolution of audit issues raised by taxing authorities. These factors, including the ultimate resolution of income tax matters, may result in material adjustments to tax-related assets and liabilities, which could materially adversely affect the Company s business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects. 
 The recently enacted IRA contains a number of revisions to the Internal Revenue Code, including (i) a 15 corporate minimum income tax for certain taxpayers, (ii) a 1 excise tax on corporate stock repurchases in tax years beginning after December 31, 2022 and (iii) business tax credits and incentives for the development of clean energy projects and the production of clean energy. In order to qualify for the full amount of business tax credits and incentives for clean energy projects whose construction begins on or after January 30, 2023, certain wage and apprenticeship requirements must be met, the details of which have been released only in part with additional details expected in future guidance. The Company continues to analyze the potential impact of the IRA and monitor guidance to be issued by the United States Department of the Treasury.

Executive Summary 
 Introduction and Overview 
 Clearway Energy, Inc., together with its consolidated subsidiaries, or the Company, is a publicly-traded energy infrastructure investor with a focus on investments in clean energy and owner of modern, sustainable and long-term contracted assets across North America. The Company is sponsored by GIP and TotalEnergies through the portfolio company, Clearway Energy Group LLC, or CEG, which became equally owned by GIP and TotalEnergies as of September 12, 2022, when TotalEnergies acquired, through its investment in an intermediate holding company, 50 of GIP s interest in CEG. GIP is an independent infrastructure fund manager that makes equity and debt investments in infrastructure assets and businesses. TotalEnergies is a global multi-energy company. 
 The Company is one of the largest renewable energy owners in the U.S. with over 5,500 net MW of installed wind and solar generation projects. The Company s over 8,000 net MW of assets also includes approximately 2,500 net MW of environmentally-sound, highly efficient natural gas-fired generation facilities. Through this environmentally-sound, diversified and primarily contracted portfolio, the Company endeavors to provide its investors with stable and growing dividend income. The majority of the Company s revenues are derived from long-term contractual arrangements for the output or capacity from these assets. The weighted average remaining contract duration of these offtake agreements was approximately 11 years as of December 31, 2022 based on CAFD.

Management s discussion of the results of operations for the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021 
 Operating Revenues 
 Operating revenues decreased by 96 million for the year ended December 31, 2022, compared to the same period in 2021, due to a combination of the drivers summarized in the table below: 
 (In millions) Renewables Segment Increase for solar acquisitions due to the 2021 acquisitions of the Utah Solar Portfolio and Agua Caliente and the 2022 acquisition of Mililani I, slightly offset by the 2022 disposition of Kawailoa. 88 Increase for wind acquisitions due to the 2021 acquisitions of Mt. Storm, Mesquite Sky and Black Rock and the 2022 acquisition of the Capistrano Wind Portfolio, along with the 2021 repowering of the Pinnacle wind project. 48 Favorable impact from the loss in February 2021 related to net settlements of obligations for wind facilities that were unable to produce the required output during extreme weather conditions in Texas. 50 Increase primarily driven by higher average realized prices at the wind facilities. 4 Decrease primarily driven by lower wind generation. (7) Thermal Segment Decrease primarily driven by the sale of the Thermal Business on May 1, 2022. (130) Conventional Segment Decrease primarily driven by forced outages at the El Segundo and Walnut Creek facilities in 2022, resulting in lower capacity revenue. (23) Mark-to-market economic hedges Increase in unrealized losses due to changes in the fair value of commodity contracts, primarily driven by the acquisition of Mesquite Sky in 2021 and mark-to-market losses of the Langford commodity contract, which previously qualified for the NPNS exception. (76) Increase in unrealized losses due to increases in forward power prices in the ERCOT and PJM markets. (19) Contract amortization Increase primarily driven by amortization of the intangible assets for PPAs related to the 2021 acquisitions of Agua Caliente and the Utah Solar Portfolio and the 2022 acquisition of the Capistrano Wind Portfolio. (31) (96) 
 Cost of Fuels

Liquidity and Capital Resources 
 The Company s principal liquidity requirements are to meet its financial commitments, finance current operations, fund capital expenditures, including acquisitions from time to time, service debt and pay dividends. As a normal part of the Company s business, depending on market conditions, the Company will from time to time consider opportunities to repay, redeem, repurchase or refinance its indebtedness. Changes in the Company s operating plans, lower than anticipated sales, increased expenses, acquisitions or other events may cause the Company to seek additional debt or equity financing in future periods. There can be no guarantee that financing will be available on acceptable terms or at all. Debt financing, if available, could impose additional cash payment obligations and additional covenants and operating restrictions. 
 Current Liquidity Position 
 As of December 31, 2022 and 2021 , the Company s liquidity was approximately 1.37 billion and 821 million, respectively, comprised of cash, restricted cash and availability under the Company s revolving credit facility.

 The Company s liquidity includes 339 million and 475 million of restricted cash balances as of December 31, 2022 and 2021 , respectively.

As of December 31, 2022, these restricted funds were comprised of 109 million designated to fund operating expenses, approximately 55 million designated for current debt service payments, and 105 million restricted for reserves including debt service, performance obligations and other reserves, as well as capital expenditures. The remaining 70 million is held in distribution reserve accounts.

 Management believes that the Company s liquidity position, cash flows from operations and availability under its revolving credit facility will be adequate to meet the Company s financial commitments; debt service obligations; growth, operating and maintenance capital expenditures; and to fund dividends to holders of the Company s Class A common stock and Class C common stock. Management continues to regularly monitor the Company s ability to finance the needs of its operating, financing and investing activity within the dictates of prudent balance sheet management.

NOLs, Deferred Tax Assets and Uncertain Tax Position Implications, under ASC 740 
 As of December 31, 2022, the Company has a cumulative federal NOL carry forward balance of 481 million for financial statement purposes, of which 88 million will begin expiring in 2037 if unutilized. The Company does not anticipate material federal income tax payments until 2027. Additionally, as of December 31, 2022, the Company has a cumulative state NOL carryforward balance of 64 million for financial statement purposes, which will expire between 2023 to 2040 if unutilized. In addition, the Company has PTC and ITC carryforward balances totaling 18 million, which will expire between 2034 and 2042 if unutilized. 
 As a result of the sale of the Thermal Business, the Company, after the utilization of various state NOL carryforwards, has paid 9 million in state income taxes through December 31, 2022, and expects to pay approximately 19 million of additional state income taxes by April 15, 2023. The Company does not anticipate being subject to the corporate minimum tax on financial statement income as enacted by the recently passed the IRA, which is discussed in further detail below. 
 On March 27, 2020, the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security (CARES) Act, or the CARES Act, was signed into law, which includes modifications to the business interest expense disallowance and net operating loss provisions. While the Company utilized previously disallowed interest expense during 2020 as a result of the modifications, the CARES Act did not have a material impact on the consolidated financial statements. The Company will continue to assess the effects of the CARES Act and ongoing government guidance related to COVID-19 and its variants that may be issued. 
 On February 9, 2022, the governor of California signed Senate Bill 113, or SB 113, removing the suspension of California NOL utilization for tax year 2022. After assessing the law change, the Company expects SB 113 to have an immaterial impact on the consolidated financial statements. 
 The recently enacted IRA contains a number of revisions to the Internal Revenue Code, including a 15 corporate minimum income tax for certain taxpayers, a 1 excise tax on corporate stock repurchases in tax years beginning after December 31, 2022 and business tax credits and incentives for the development of clean energy projects and the production of clean energy. The Company continues to analyze the potential impact of the IRA and monitor guidance to be issued by the United States Department of the Treasury, but it does not anticipate the corporate minimum tax will apply to it or that the IRA will otherwise have a material impact on its consolidated financial statements 
 The Company is subject to examination by taxing authorities for income tax returns filed in the U.S. federal and various state jurisdictions. All tax returns filed by the Company for the year ended December 31, 2013 and forward remain subject to audit. As of December 31, 2022, the U.S. federal partnership returns of three of the Company s subsidiaries are under audit by the IRS. The IRS has issued proposed adjustments with respect to one of the subsidiaries under audit. The Company believes that such proposed adjustments are incorrect and, in any case, would not impact the Company s tax liability or the tax liability of such subsidiary. The IRS has not yet issued any proposed adjustments with respect to the other two subsidiaries under audit. In any case, the Company believes that the ultimate settlement of each of these audits will not be material to the Company s financial condition, results of operations or liquidity. The Company believes that an adequate provision has been made for any adjustments that may result from tax examinations. However, the outcome of tax audits cannot be predicted with certainty. If any issues addressed in tax audits of the Company are resolved in a manner inconsistent with its expectations, the Company could be required to adjust its provision for income taxes in the period such resolution occurs. 
 The Company has no material uncertain tax benefits.

 The Company s discussion and analysis of the financial condition and results of operations are based upon the consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with GAAP. The preparation of these financial statements and related disclosures in compliance with GAAP requires the application of appropriate technical accounting rules and guidance as well as the use of estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses, and related disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities. The application of these policies necessarily involves judgments regarding future events, including the likelihood of success of particular projects, legal and regulatory challenges and the fair value of certain assets and liabilities. These judgments, in and of themselves, could materially affect the financial statements and disclosures based on varying assumptions, which may be appropriate to use. In addition, the financial and operating environment may also have a significant effect, not only on the operation of the business, but on the results reported through the application of accounting measures used in preparing the financial statements and related disclosures, even if the nature of the accounting policies has not changed. 
 On an ongoing basis, the Company evaluates these estimates, utilizing historic experience, consultation with experts and other methods the Company considers reasonable. Actual results may differ substantially from the Company s estimates. Any effects on the Company s business, financial position or results of operations resulting from revisions to these estimates are recorded in the period in which the information that gives rise to the revision becomes known. 
 The Company s significant accounting policies are summarized in Item 15 Note 2, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies . The Company identifies its most critical accounting policies as those that are the most pervasive and important to the portrayal of the Company s financial position and results of operations, and that require the most difficult, subjective and/or complex judgments by management regarding estimates about matters that are inherently uncertain. The Company s critical accounting policies include income taxes and valuation allowance for deferred tax assets, accounting utilizing Hypothetical Liquidation at Book Value, or HLBV, acquisition accounting and determining the fair value of financial instruments. 
 57 

Accounting Policy Judgments/Uncertainties Affecting Application Income Taxes and Valuation Allowance for Deferred Tax Assets 
 Ability to withstand legal challenges of tax authority decisions or appeals Anticipated future decisions of tax authorities Application of tax statutes and regulations to transactions Ability to utilize tax benefits through carry backs to prior periods and carry forwards to future periods Hypothetical Liquidation at Book Value (HLBV) Estimates of taxable income (loss) and tax capital accounts Estimated calculation of specified target investor returns Application of liquidation provisions of operating agreements Acquisition Accounting Identification of assets acquired Inputs for fair values of assets and liabilities acquired Application of appropriate fair value methodologies Financial Instruments Use of unobservable market inputs such as future electricity prices, future interest rates and discount rates 
 Income Taxes and Valuation Allowance for Deferred Tax Assets 
 In determining whether a valuation allowance is required for deferred tax assets, the Company must assess whether it believes it is more likely than not that the results of future operations will generate sufficient taxable income which includes the future reversal of existing taxable temporary differences to realize deferred tax assets. The Company considers the timing and future realization of net deferred tax assets, the profit before tax generated in recent years as well as projections of future earnings and estimates of taxable income in arriving at this conclusion. The realization of deferred tax assets is primarily dependent upon earnings in federal and various state and local jurisdictions. Judgment is also required to continually assess changing tax regulations, interpretations and new legislation to determine the impact on the Company s tax position. 
 Hypothetical Liquidation at Book Value (HLBV) 
 Certain portions of the Company s redeemable noncontrolling interest and noncontrolling interest represent third-party interests in the net assets under certain tax equity arrangements, which are consolidated by the Company, that were established to finance the cost of facilities eligible for certain tax credits and benefits. The Company has determined that the provisions in the contractual agreements of these structures represent substantive profit sharing arrangements. Further, the Company has determined that the appropriate methodology for calculating the redeemable noncontrolling interest and noncontrolling interest that reflects the substantive profit sharing arrangements is a balance sheet approach utilizing the HLBV method. Under the HLBV method, the amounts reported as redeemable noncontrolling interest and noncontrolling interest represent the amounts the investors to the tax equity arrangements would hypothetically receive at each balance sheet date under the liquidation provisions of the contractual agreements, assuming the net assets of the funding structures were liquidated at their recorded amounts determined in accordance with GAAP. The investors interests in the results of operations of the funding structures are determined as the difference in redeemable noncontrolling interest and noncontrolling interest at the start and end of each reporting period, after taking into account any capital transactions between the structures and the funds investors. The calculations utilized to apply the HLBV method include estimated calculations of taxable income or losses for each reporting period as well as estimated calculations of tax capital accounts based on the relevant provisions of each agreement and the related tax guidance. In addition, these calculations often take into account the stipulated targeted investor return specified in the subsidiaries operating agreement and agreed by the members of the arrangement. In certain circumstances, the Company and its partners in the tax equity arrangements agree that certain tax benefits are to be utilized outside of the tax equity arrangements, which may result in differences in the amount an investor would hypothetically receive at the initial balance sheet date calculated strictly in accordance with related contractual agreements. These differences are recognized in the consolidated statement of income using a systematic and rational method over the period during which the investor is expected to achieve its target return. In certain cases, the Company must apply judgment in determining the methodology for applying these concepts in the HLBV method and changes in certain factors may have a significant impact on the amounts that an investor would receive upon a hypothetical liquidation. The use of the HLBV method to allocate income (loss) to the noncontrolling interest holders may create volatility in the consolidated statements of income. 
 58 

Acquisition Accounting 
 The Company applies ASC 805, Business Combinations , when accounting for acquisitions, with identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed recorded at their estimated fair values at acquisition date. For many of the Company s acquisitions, the Company applies ASC 805-50, which provides that acquisitions of entities under common control are recorded at historical cost, except in the case where the ultimate parent has a different basis, such as when an acquiree did not elect to apply pushdown accounting. In those circumstances, the Company may also be required to record its acquired assets and liabilities at acquisition date fair value. 
 Significant judgment is required in determining the acquisition date fair value of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed, predominantly with respect to property, plant and equipment, power purchase agreements, asset retirement obligations and other contractual arrangements for third-party acquisitions. Evaluations include numerous inputs including forecasted cash flows that incorporate the specific attributes of each asset including age, useful life, equipment condition and technology as well as current replacement costs for similar assets. Other key inputs that require judgment include discount rates, comparable market transactions, estimated useful lives and probability of future transactions. The Company evaluates all available information as well as all appropriate methodologies, when determining the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed in a business combination. In addition, once the appropriate fair values are determined, the Company must determine the remaining useful life for property, plant and equipment and the amortization period and method of amortization for each finite-lived intangible asset. 
 Financial Instruments 
 The Company records its financial instruments, which primarily consist of derivative financial instruments, at fair value. The Company determines the fair value of its financial instruments using discounted cash flow models that require the use of assumptions concerning the amount of estimated future cash flows. The assumptions are determined using external, observable market inputs when available. When observable market inputs are not available, the Company must apply significant judgment to determine market participant assumptions such as future electricity prices, future interest rates and discount rates. As these inputs are based on estimates, fair values may not reflect the amounts actually realized from the related transaction.

Item 7A Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk 
 The Company is exposed to several market risks in its normal business activities. Market risk is the potential loss that may result from market changes associated with the Company s power generation or with an existing or forecasted financial or commodity transaction. The types of market risks the Company is exposed to are commodity price risk, interest rate risk, liquidity risk, and credit risk. 
 Commodity Price Risk 
 Commodity price risks result from exposures to changes in spot prices, forward prices, volatilities, and correlations between various commodities, such as electricity and emissions credits. The Company manages the commodity price risk of its merchant generation operations by entering into derivative or non-derivative instruments to hedge the variability in future cash flows from forecasted power sales. The portion of forecasted transactions hedged may vary based upon management s assessment of market, weather, operation and other factors. See Item 15 Note 7 , Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities , for more information. 
 Based on a sensitivity analysis using simplified assumptions, the impact of a 0.50 per MWh increase or decrease in power prices across the term of the derivative contracts would cause a change of approximately 7 million to the net value of power derivatives as of December 31, 2022. 
 Interest Rate Risk 
 The Company is exposed to fluctuations in interest rates through its issuance of variable rate debt. Exposures to interest rate fluctuations may be mitigated by entering into derivative instruments known as interest rate swaps, caps, collars and put or call options. These contracts reduce exposure to interest rate volatility and result in primarily fixed rate debt obligations when taking into account the combination of the variable rate debt and the interest rate derivative instrument. See Item 15 Note 7 , Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities , for more information. 
 Most of the Company s project subsidiaries enter into interest rate swaps, intended to hedge the risks associated with interest rates on non-recourse project level debt. See Item 15 Note 10 , Long-term Debt , for more information about interest rate swaps of the Company s project subsidiaries. 
 If all of the above swaps had been discontinued on December 31, 2022 , the counterparties would have owed the Company 93 million. Based on the credit ratings of the counterparties, the Company believes its exposure to credit risk due to nonperformance by counterparties to its hedge contracts to be insignificant. 
 The Company has long-term debt instruments that subject it to the risk of loss associated with movements in market interest rates. As of December 31, 2022 , a 1 change in interest rates would result in an approximately 1 million change in interest expense on a rolling twelve-month basis. 
 As of December 31, 2022 , the fair value of the Company s debt was 6,288 million and the carrying value was 6,874 million. The Company estimates that a 1 decrease in market interest rates would have increased the fair value of its long-term debt by 358 million. 
 Liquidity Risk 
 Liquidity risk arises from the general funding needs of the Company s activities and in the management of the Company s assets and liabilities. 
 Counterparty Credit Risk 
 Credit risk relates to the risk of loss resulting from non-performance or non-payment by counterparties pursuant to the terms of their contractual obligations. The Company monitors and manages credit risk through credit policies that include: (i) an established credit approval process, and (ii) the use of credit mitigation measures such as prepayment arrangements or volumetric limits. Risks surrounding counterparty performance and credit could ultimately impact the amount and timing of expected cash flows. The Company seeks to mitigate counterparty risk by having a diversified portfolio of counterparties. See Item 15 Note 6 , Fair Value of Financial Instruments , for more information about concentration of credit risk.

 Item 9A Controls and Procedures 
 Conclusion Regarding the Effectiveness of Disclosure Controls and Procedures and Internal Control Over Financial Reporting 
 Under the supervision and with the participation of the Company s management, including its principal executive officer, principal financial officer and principal accounting officer, the Company conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of the design and operation of its disclosure controls and procedures, as such term is defined in Rules 13a-15(e) or 15d-15(e) of the Exchange Act. Based on this evaluation, the Company s principal executive officer, principal financial officer and principal accounting officer concluded that the disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of the end of the period covered by this Annual Report on Form 10-K. 
 Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting 
 There were no changes in the Company s internal control over financial reporting (as such term is defined in Rule 13a-15(f) under the Exchange Act) during the quarter ended December 31, 2022, that materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, the Company s internal control over financial reporting. 
 Inherent Limitations over Internal Controls 
 The Company s internal control over financial reporting is designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of consolidated financial statements for external purposes in accordance with GAAP. The Company s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that: 
 1. Pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the Company s assets; 
 2. Provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of consolidated financial statements in accordance with GAAP, and that the Company s receipts and expenditures are being made only in accordance with authorizations of its management and directors; and 
 3. Provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of the Company s assets that could have a material effect on the consolidated financial statements. 
 Internal control over financial reporting cannot provide absolute assurance of achieving financial reporting objectives because of its inherent limitations, including the possibility of human error and circumvention by collusion or overriding of controls. Accordingly, even an effective internal control system may not prevent or detect material misstatements on a timely basis. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. 
 Management s Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting 
 The Company s management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting, as such term is defined in Exchange Act Rule 13a-15(f). Under the supervision and with the participation of the Company s management, including its principal executive officer, principal financial officer and principal accounting officer, the Company conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of its internal control over financial reporting based on the framework in Internal Control Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. Based on the Company s evaluation under the framework in Internal Control Integrated Framework (2013) , the Company s management concluded that its internal control over financial reporting was effective as of December 31, 2022. 
 The effectiveness of the Company s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2022, has been audited by Ernst Young LLP, the Company s independent registered public accounting firm, as stated in its report which is included in this Form 10-K.

 Definition and Limitations of Internal Control Over Financial Reporting 
 A company s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements. 
 Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm 
 To the Stockholders and the Board of Directors of Clearway Energy, Inc. 
 Opinion on the Financial Statements 
 We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Clearway Energy, Inc. (the Company) as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, the related consolidated statements of income, comprehensive income, stockholders equity, and cash flows for each of the two years in the period ended December 31, 2022, and the related notes and financial statement schedules listed in the Index at Item 15(a)(2) (collectively referred to as the consolidated financial statements ). In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company at December 31, 2022 and 2021 and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the two years in the period ended December 31, 2022, in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. 
 We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the Company s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2022, based on criteria established in Internal Control-Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (2013 framework), and our report dated February 23, 2023, expressed an unqualified opinion thereon. 
 Basis for Opinion 
 These financial statements are the responsibility of the Company's management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company s financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. 
 We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. Our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion. 
 Critical Audit Matters 
 The critical audit matters communicated below are matters arising from the current period audit of the financial statements that were communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that: (1) relate to accounts or disclosures that are material to the financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective or complex judgments. The communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion on the consolidated financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matters below, providing separate opinions on the critical audit matters or on the accounts or disclosures to which they relate. 
 Allocation of earnings to noncontrolling interests in tax equity arrangements Description of the Matter As described in Note 5 to the consolidated financial statements, during 2022, tax equity investors purchased noncontrolling interests in Mililani TE Holdco LLC and Waiawa TE Holdco LLC (the new tax equity arrangements ). Each tax equity investor received Class A membership interests in the respective entity. The Company utilizes the output of a hypothetical liquidation at book value (HLBV) model to determine the earnings allocated to the tax equity noncontrolling interest holders as the contractual agreements between the parties represent substantive profit-sharing arrangements. 
 
 Auditing the allocation of earnings using the HLBV method to the new tax equity arrangements was complex due to the judgments required at the inception of the arrangement to evaluate whether the HLBV model appropriately reflects the unique substantive profit-sharing terms and features within each arrangement. A greater extent of audit effort and specialized skill and knowledge was required with respect to evaluating the appropriateness of the tax capital account balances used in the HLBV model for compliance with the provisions of the Internal Revenue Code, as well as compliance with the contractual provisions in each agreement. 
 
 69 

How We Addressed the Matter in Our Audit We obtained an understanding, evaluated the design and tested the operating effectiveness of the control over the Company s process for establishing the HLBV model for the new tax equity arrangements. For example, we tested a control over management s review of the substantive profit-sharing terms and features within each arrangement and evaluated whether they are properly reflected in each HLBV model. 
 
 To test the allocation of earnings to noncontrolling interest holders in the new tax equity arrangements, we read the related agreements to understand the business purpose and the substantive profit-sharing provisions. We evaluated each HLBV model for consistency with the contractual provisions in the related agreements and tested the initial recognition of the noncontrolling interest balance by agreeing capital contributions to supporting documentation. We involved tax subject matter professionals to assist in evaluating the calculation of the tax capital accounts used in each HLBV model for compliance with the provisions of the Internal Revenue Code, as well as compliance with the contractual provisions in the agreements. Additionally, we tested the year end noncontrolling interest balances for the new tax equity arrangements by agreeing contributions and distributions to supporting documentation and recalculating the allocation of earnings using each HLBV model. 
 Fair value of Level 3 energy related commodity contracts Description of the Matter As described in Note 6 to the consolidated financial statements, as of December 31, 2022, the aggregate fair value of energy related commodity contracts classified as Level 3 derivative instruments was million. The Company s determination of the fair value of long-term power commodity contracts executed in illiquid markets are considered Level 3 fair value measurements as they contain significant unobservable inputs, including forward market energy pricing curves. The Company uses a discounted cash flow valuation technique to determine the fair value of its energy related commodity contracts. 
 
 Auditing the fair value measurement of energy related commodity contracts classified as Level 3 financial instruments was complex due to the judgmental nature of the forward market energy pricing curve assumptions used as an input into the valuation models. 
 How We Addressed the Matter in Our Audit We obtained an understanding, evaluated the design and tested the operating effectiveness of controls over the Company s processes for reviewing the key assumptions in estimating Level 3 fair values. For example, we tested controls over management s review of the specific forward market energy pricing curves used as an input into the valuation models. To test the fair value of Level 3 energy related commodity contracts, our audit procedures included, among others, evaluating the valuation methodologies used by the Company and testing significant inputs, estimates and the mathematical accuracy of the calculations. In certain instances, with the assistance of our valuation specialists, we independently determined the significant assumptions, calculated the resultant fair values and compared them to the Company s estimates. We obtained forward market energy prices from independent sources, including pricing service providers and counterparty fair values, and evaluated the Company s assumptions related to their forward curves and confirmed key inputs with counterparties. We also performed sensitivity analyses using independent sources of market data to evaluate the significance of the change in fair value of Level 3 energy related commodity contracts that would result from changes in underlying assumptions.

million, million and million, respectively. See Note 17, Leases, for additional information related to the Company s PPAs accounted for as leases. 
 Renewable Energy Credits, or RECs 
 Renewable energy credits, or RECs, are usually sold through long-term PPAs or through REC contracts with counterparties. Revenue from the sale of self-generated RECs is recognized when the related energy is generated and simultaneously delivered even in cases where there is a certification lag as it has been deemed to be perfunctory. 
 In a bundled contract to sell energy, capacity and/or self-generated RECs, all performance obligations are deemed to be delivered at the same time and hence, timing of recognition of revenue for all performance obligations is the same and occurs over time. In such cases, it is often unnecessary to allocate transaction price to multiple performance obligations.

 Derivative and Financial Instruments Fair Value Measurements 
 The Company s contracts are non-exchange-traded and valued using prices provided by external sources. The Company uses quoted observable forward prices to value its energy contracts. To the extent that observable forward prices are not available, the quoted prices reflect the average of the forward prices from the prior year, adjusted for inflation. As of December 31, 2022, contracts valued with prices provided by models and other valuation techniques make up of derivative liabilities and of other financial instruments. 
 The Company s significant positions classified as Level 3 include physical commodity contracts executed in illiquid markets. The significant unobservable inputs used in developing fair value include illiquid power tenors and location pricing, which is derived by extrapolating pricing as a basis to liquid locations. The tenor pricing and basis spread are based on observable market data when available or derived from historic prices and forward market prices from similar observable markets when not available.

 The fair value of each contract is discounted using a risk-free interest rate. In addition, a credit reserve is applied to reflect credit risk, which is, for interest rate swaps, calculated based on credit default swaps using the bilateral method. For commodities, to the extent that the Net Exposure under a specific master agreement is an asset, the Company uses the counterparty s default swap rate. If the Net Exposure under a specific master agreement is a liability, the Company uses a proxy of its own default swap rate. For interest rate swaps and commodities, the credit reserve is added to the discounted fair value to reflect the exit price that a market participant would be willing to receive to assume the liabilities or that a market participant would be willing to pay for the assets. As of December 31, 2022, the non-performance reserve was a million gain recorded primarily to total operating revenues in the consolidated statement of income. It is possible that future market prices could vary from those used in recording assets and liabilities and such variations could be material. 
 Concentration of Credit Risk 
 In addition to the credit risk discussion as disclosed in Note 2, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies , the following item is a discussion of the concentration of credit risk for the Company s financial instruments. Credit risk relates to the risk of loss resulting from non-performance or non-payment by counterparties pursuant to the terms of their contractual obligations. The Company monitors and manages credit risk through credit policies that include: (i) an established credit approval process; (ii) monitoring of counterparties credit limits on as needed basis; (iii) as applicable, the use of credit mitigation measures such as margin, collateral, prepayment arrangements, or volumetric limits; (iv) the use of payment netting agreements; and (v) the use of master netting agreements that allow for the netting of positive and negative exposures of various contracts associated with a single counterparty. Risks surrounding counterparty performance and credit could ultimately impact the amount and timing of expected cash flows. The Company seeks to mitigate counterparty risk by having a diversified portfolio of counterparties. 
 Counterparty credit exposure includes credit risk exposure under certain long-term agreements, including solar and other PPAs. As external sources or observable market quotes are not available to estimate such exposure, the Company estimates the exposure related to these contracts based on various techniques including, but not limited to, internal models based on a fundamental analysis of the market and extrapolation of observable market data with similar characteristics. A significant portion of these commodity contracts are with utilities with strong credit quality and public utility commission or other regulatory support. However, such regulated utility counterparties can be impacted by changes in government regulations or adverse financial conditions, which the Company is unable to predict. Certain subsidiaries of the Company sell the output of their facilities to PG E, a significant counterparty of the Company, under long-term PPAs, and PG E s credit rating is below investment-grade.

 Prior to the Thermal Disposition, which is further described in Note 3, Acquisitions and Dispositions , a portion of the Company s derivative commodity contracts were related to its Thermal Business for the purchase of fuel/electricity commodities based on the forecasted usage of the thermal district energy centers. Realized gains and losses on these contracts were reflected in the fuel costs that were permitted to be billed to customers through the related customer contracts or tariffs and, accordingly, no gains or losses were reflected in the consolidated statements of income for these contracts through the period that the Company owned the Thermal Business.

 2020 Impairment Losses 
 The impairment analysis indicated that the projected future cash flows for several wind projects within the Renewables segment no longer supported the recoverability of the carrying value of the related long-lived assets. As such, the Company recorded an impairment loss of million, which primarily related to property, plant, and equipment to reflect the assets at fair market value. The fair value of the facilities was determined using an income approach by applying a discounted cash flow methodology to the updated long-term budgets for each respective plant. The income approach included key inputs such as forecasted merchant power prices, operations and maintenance expense, and discount rates. The resulting fair value is a Level 3 fair value measurement. 
 Additionally, during the fourth quarter of 2020, as the Company updated its estimated cash flows in connection with the preparation and review of the Company s annual budget, the Company determined that there was a significant decrease in the estimated future cash flows for its equity method investment in San Juan Mesa, a facility in the Renewables segment located in Elida, New Mexico. The decrease in the forecasted cash flows which was primarily driven by a decline in forecasted revenue in future merchant periods, was significant enough to be considered an indication of a decline in value of the investment that was not temporary. The Company concluded there was an other-than-temporary impairment of its investment and recorded an impairment loss of million to reflect the investment at fair market value. The resulting fair value is a Level 3 fair value measurement.

 Contingencies 
 The Company s material legal proceeding is described below. The Company believes that it has a valid defense to this legal proceeding and intends to defend it vigorously. The Company records reserves for estimated losses from contingencies when information available indicates that a loss is probable and the amount of the loss, or range of loss, can be reasonably estimated. As applicable, the Company has established an adequate reserve for the matter discussed below. In addition, legal costs are expensed as incurred. Management assesses such matters based on current information and makes a judgment concerning its potential outcome, considering the nature of the claim, the amount and nature of damages sought and the probability of success. The Company is unable to predict the outcome of the legal proceeding below or reasonably estimate the scope or amount of any associated costs and potential liabilities. As additional information becomes available, management adjusts its assessment and estimate of the contingency accordingly. Because litigation is subject to inherent uncertainties and unfavorable rulings or developments, it is possible that the ultimate resolution of the Company s liabilities and contingencies could be at amounts that are different from its currently recorded reserves and that such difference could be material. 
 In addition to the legal proceeding noted below, the Company and its subsidiaries are party to other litigation or legal proceedings arising in the ordinary course of business. In management s opinion, the disposition of these ordinary course matters will not materially adversely affect the Company s consolidated financial position, results of operations, or cash flows.

On November 15, 2019, Buckthorn Westex filed an original answer and counterclaims (i) denying Georgetown s claims, (ii) alleging Georgetown has breached its contracts with Buckthorn Westex by failing to pay amounts due, and (iii) seeking relief in the form of (x) declaratory judgment that Georgetown s alleged failure to pay amounts due constitute breaches of and an event of default under the PPA and that Buckthorn did not commit any events of default under the PPA, (y) recovery of costs, expenses, interest, and attorneys fees, and (z) such other relief to which it is entitled at law or in equity. The case is currently in discovery and is expected to proceed to trial in June 2023. Buckthorn Westex believes the allegations of Georgetown are meritless, and Buckthorn Westex is vigorously defending its rights under the PPA.

 Voting Rights

 Mandatory Redemption 
 Shares of Class D common stock are subject to redemption at a price per share equal to par value upon the conversion of Class D units of Clearway LLC. Shares of Class D common stock so redeemed are automatically cancelled and are not available to be reissued. 
 Authorized but Unissued Capital Stock 
 Delaware law does not require stockholder approval for any issuance of authorized shares. However, the listing requirements of the NYSE, which would apply so long as the shares of Class A common stock and Class C common stock remain listed on the NYSE, require stockholder approval of certain issuances equal to or exceeding 20 of the then outstanding voting power or the then outstanding number of shares of Class A common stock and Class C common stock. These additional shares may be used for a variety of corporate purposes, including future public offerings, to raise additional capital or to facilitate acquisitions. 
 One of the effects of the existence of unissued and unreserved common stock or preferred stock may be to enable the Board of Directors to issue shares to persons friendly to current management, which issuance could render more difficult or discourage an attempt to obtain control of Clearway Inc. by means of a merger, tender offer, proxy contest or otherwise, and thereby protect the continuity of Clearway Inc. s management and possibly deprive the stockholders of opportunities to sell their shares at prices higher than prevailing market prices. 

Exhibit 4.29 

 Preferred Stock 
 Under Clearway Inc. s amended and restated certificate of incorporation, Clearway Inc. will continue to be authorized to issue up to 10,000,000 shares of preferred stock, par value 0.01 per share, none of which is issued and outstanding. 
 The Board of Directors is authorized to provide for the issuance of shares of preferred stock in one or more series and to fix the preferences, powers and relative, participating, optional or other special rights, and qualifications, limitations or restrictions thereof, including the dividend rate, conversion rights, voting rights, redemption rights and liquidation preference and to fix the number of shares to be included in any such series without any further vote or action by Clearway Inc. s stockholders. Any preferred stock so issued may rank senior to Clearway Inc. s common stock with respect to the payment of dividends or amounts upon liquidation, dissolution or winding up, or both. The issuance of preferred stock may have the effect of delaying, deferring or preventing a change in control of Clearway Inc. without further action by the stockholders and may adversely affect the voting and other rights of the holders of common stock. The issuance of preferred stock with voting and conversion rights may adversely affect the voting power of the holders of common stock, including the loss of voting control to others. At present, Clearway Inc. has no plans to issue any preferred stock. 
 Antitakeover Effects of Delaware Law and Clearway Inc. s Certificate of Incorporation and Bylaws 
 In addition to the disproportionate voting rights that Global Infrastructure Investors III, LLC GIP and TotalEnergies SE TotalEnergies have a result of their indirect ownership of Class B common stock and Class D common stock through their joint ownership of Clearway Energy Group LLC CEG ), some provisions of Delaware law contain, and Clearway Inc. s amended and restated certificate of incorporation and Clearway Inc. s fourth amended and restated bylaws described below contain, a number of provisions which may have the effect of encouraging persons considering unsolicited tender offers or other unilateral takeover proposals to negotiate with the Board of Directors rather than pursue non-negotiated takeover attempts, which Clearway Inc. believes may result in an improvement of the terms of any such acquisition in favor of Clearway Inc. s stockholders. However, they also give the Board of Directors the power to discourage acquisitions that some stockholders may favor. 
 Undesignated Preferred Stock 
 The ability to authorize undesignated preferred stock will make it possible for the Board of Directors to issue preferred stock with superior voting, special approval, dividend or other rights or preferences on a discriminatory basis that could impede the success of any attempt to acquire Clearway Inc.. These and other provisions may have the effect of deferring, delaying or discouraging hostile takeovers, or changes in control or management of the company. 
 Meetings and Elections of Directors 
 Special Meetings of Stockholders. Clearway Inc. s amended and restated certificate of incorporation provides that a special meeting of stockholders may be called only by the Board of Directors by a resolution adopted by the affirmative vote of a majority of the total number of directors then in office. 
 Elimination of Stockholder Action by Written Consent. Clearway Inc. s amended and restated certificate of incorporation and its fourth amended and restated bylaws provide that holders of Clearway Inc. s common stock cannot act by written consent in lieu of a meeting. 
 Vacancies. Any vacancy occurring on the Board of Directors and any newly created directorship may be filled only by a majority of the directors remaining in office (even if less than a quorum), subject to the rights of holders of any series of preferred stock. 

Exhibit 4.29 

 Amendments 
 Amendments of Certificate of Incorporation. The provisions described above under Special Meetings of Stockholders, Elimination of Stockholder Action by Written Consent and Vacancies may be amended only by the affirmative vote of holders of at least two-thirds of the combined voting power of outstanding shares of Clearway Inc. s capital stock entitled to vote in the election of directors, voting together as a single class. 
 Amendment of Bylaws. The Board of Directors has the power to make, alter, amend, change or repeal Clearway Inc. s bylaws or adopt new bylaws by the affirmative vote of a majority of the total number of directors then in office. 
 Notice Provisions Relating to Stockholder Proposals and Nominees 
 Clearway Inc. s fourth amended and restated bylaws also impose some procedural requirements on stockholders who wish to make nominations in the election of directors or propose any other business to be brought before an annual or special meeting of stockholders. 
 Specifically, a stockholder may (i) bring a proposal before an annual meeting of stockholders, (ii) nominate a candidate for election to the Board of Directors at an annual meeting of stockholders, or (iii) nominate a candidate for election to the Board of Directors at a special meeting of stockholders that has been called for the purpose of electing directors, only if such stockholder delivers timely notice to Clearway Inc. s corporate secretary. The notice must be in writing and must include certain information and comply with the delivery requirements as set forth in the bylaws. 
 To be timely, a stockholder s notice must be received at Clearway Inc. s principal executive offices 
 in the case of a nomination or other business in connection with an annual meeting of stockholders, not later than the close of business on the 90th day nor earlier than the close of business on the 120th day prior to the first anniversary of the previous year s annual meeting of stockholders provided, however , that if the date of the annual meeting is advanced more than 30 days before or delayed more than 70 days after the first anniversary of the preceding year s annual meeting, notice by the stockholder must be delivered not earlier than the close of business on the 120th day prior to such annual meeting and not later than the close of business on the later of the 90th day prior to such annual meeting or the 10th day following the day on which public announcement of the date of such meeting is first made by Clearway Inc. 
 in the case of a nomination in connection with a special meeting of stockholders, not earlier than the 120th day prior to such special meeting and not later than the close of business on the later of the 90th day before such special meeting or the 10th day following the day on which public announcement of the date of such meeting is first made by Clearway Inc.. 
 With respect to special meetings of stockholders, Clearway Inc. s fourth amended and restated bylaws provide that only such business shall be conducted as shall have been stated in the notice of the meeting. 
 Delaware Antitakeover Law 
 Clearway Inc. is presently subject to Section 203 of the DGCL. Section 203 provides that, subject to certain exceptions specified in the law, a Delaware corporation shall not engage in certain business combinations with any interested stockholder for a three-year period following the time that the stockholder became an interested stockholder unless 
 prior to such time, the Board of Directors approved either the business combination or the transaction that resulted in the stockholder becoming an interested stockholder 
 upon consummation of the transaction that resulted in the stockholder becoming an interested stockholder, the interested stockholder owned at least 85 of the voting stock outstanding at the time the transaction commenced, excluding certain shares or 

Exhibit 4.29 

 at or subsequent to that time, the business combination is approved by the Board of Directors and by the affirmative vote of holders of at least 66 2 3 of the outstanding voting stock that is not owned by the interested stockholder. 
 Generally, a business combination includes a merger, asset or stock sale or other transaction resulting in a financial benefit to the interested stockholder. Subject to certain exceptions, an interested stockholder is a person who, together with that person s affiliates and associates, owns, or within the previous three years did own, 15 or more of Clearway Inc. s voting stock. 
 Under certain circumstances, Section 203 makes it more difficult for a person who would be an interested stockholder to effect various business combinations with a corporation for a three-year period. The provisions of Section 203 may encourage companies interested in acquiring Clearway Inc. to negotiate in advance with the Board of Directors because the stockholder approval requirement would be avoided if the Board of Directors approves either the business combination or the transaction that results in the stockholder becoming an interested stockholder. These provisions also may make it more difficult to accomplish transactions that stockholders may otherwise deem to be in their best interests. 
 Amendments 
 Any amendments to Clearway Inc. s amended and restated certificate of incorporation, subject to the rights of holders of Clearway Inc. s preferred stock, regarding the provisions thereof summarized under Antitakeover Effects of Delaware Law and Clearway Inc. s Certificate of Incorporation and Bylaws will require the affirmative vote of at least 66 2 3 of the voting power of all shares of common stock then outstanding. 
 Fourth Amended and Restated Limited Liability Company Agreement of Clearway Energy LLC 
 The following is a description of the material terms of the fourth amended and restated limited liability company agreement of Clearway LLC. 
 Governance 
 Clearway Inc. serves as the sole managing member of Clearway LLC. As such, Clearway Inc., and effectively the Board of Directors, controls the business and affairs of Clearway LLC and is responsible for the management of its business. No other member of Clearway LLC, in its capacity as such, has any authority or right to control the management of Clearway LLC or to bind it in connection with any matter. Any amendment, supplement or waiver of the Clearway LLC operating agreement must be approved by a majority of Clearway Inc. s independent directors. 
 Voting and Economic Rights of Members 
 Clearway LLC has issued four classes of units Class A units and Class C units, which may only be issued to Clearway Inc., as the sole managing member, and Class B units and Class D units, which may only be issued to CEG and held by CEG or its permitted transferees. Units of each of the four classes have equivalent economic and other rights, except that upon issuance, each holder of a Class B unit will also be issued a share of Clearway Inc. s Class B common stock and each holder of a Class D unit will also be issued a share of Clearway Inc. s Class D common stock. Each Class B unit is exchangeable for a share of Clearway Inc. s Class A common stock, subject to equitable adjustments for stock splits, dividends and reclassifications in accordance with the terms of the Amended and Restated Exchange Agreement (as described below), and each Class D unit is exchangeable for a share of Clearway Inc. s Class C common stock, subject to equitable adjustments for stock splits, dividends and reclassifications in accordance with the terms of the Amended and Restated Exchange Agreement. When CEG or its permitted transferee exchanges a Class B unit of Clearway LLC for a share of Clearway Inc. s Class A common stock, Clearway Inc. will automatically redeem and cancel a corresponding share of Class B common stock, and the Class B unit will automatically convert into a Class A unit of Clearway LLC issued to Clearway Inc. When CEG or its permitted transferee exchanges a Class D unit of Clearway LLC for a share of Clearway Inc. s Class C common stock, Clearway Inc. will automatically redeem and cancel a corresponding share of Clearway Inc. s Class D common stock, and the Class D unit will automatically convert into a Class C unit of Clearway LLC issued to us. None of the units have any voting rights. 

Exhibit 4.29 

 Net profits and net losses and distributions by Clearway LLC are allocated and made to holders of units in accordance with the respective number of membership units of Clearway LLC held. Clearway LLC will make distributions to Clearway Inc. and CEG for the purpose of funding tax obligations in respect of income of Clearway LLC that is allocated to the members of Clearway LLC. However, Clearway LLC may not make any distributions to its members if doing so would violate any agreement to which it is then a party or any law then applicable to it, have the effect of rendering it insolvent or result in it having net capital lower than that required by applicable law. Additionally, because all of Clearway Inc. s operations are conducted through Clearway Energy Operating LLC Clearway Operating LLC ), a wholly owned subsidiary of Clearway LLC, and Clearway Operating LLC s Amended and Restated Credit Agreement restricts the ability of Clearway Operating LLC to make distributions to Clearway LLC, Clearway LLC may not have any funds available to make distributions to Clearway Inc. and CEG (including with respect to tax obligations). 
 Coordination of Clearway Inc. and Clearway LLC 
 At any time Clearway Inc. issues a share of its Class A common stock or Class C common stock for cash, the net proceeds therefrom will promptly be transferred to Clearway LLC and Clearway LLC will either 
 transfer a newly issued Class A unit of Clearway LLC to Clearway Inc. in the case of the issuance of a share of Class A common stock, or transfer a newly issued Class C unit of Clearway LLC to Clearway Inc. in the case of the issuance of a share of Class C common stock or 
 use the net proceeds to purchase a Class B unit of Clearway LLC from CEG in the case of the issuance of a share of Class A common stock, which Class B unit will automatically convert into a Class A unit of Clearway LLC when transferred to Clearway Inc. or use the net proceeds to purchase a Class D unit of Clearway LLC from CEG in the case of the issuance of a share of Class C common stock, which Class D unit will automatically convert into a Class C unit of Clearway LLC when transferred to Clearway Inc. 
 In the event Clearway LLC purchases a Class B unit or a Class D unit of Clearway LLC from CEG, Clearway Inc. will concurrently redeem and cancel the corresponding share of its Class B common stock or Class D common stock, as applicable. 
 If Clearway Inc. issues other classes or series of equity securities, Clearway LLC will issue, and Clearway Inc. will use the net proceeds therefrom to purchase, an equal amount of units with designations, preferences and other rights and terms that are substantially the same as Clearway Inc. s newly-issued equity securities. Conversely, if Clearway Inc. elects to redeem any shares of its Class A common stock or Class C common stock (or its equity securities of other classes or series) for cash, Clearway LLC will, immediately prior to such redemption, redeem an equal number of Class A units or Class C units (or its units of the corresponding classes or series) held by Clearway Inc. upon the same terms and for the same price, as the shares of Class A common stock or Class C common stock (or equity securities of such other classes or series) so redeemed. 
 Issuances and Transfer of Units 
 Class A units and Class C units may only be issued to Clearway Inc., as the sole managing member of Clearway LLC, and are non-transferable except upon redemption by Clearway LLC. Class B units and Class D units may only be issued to CEG.

Exhibit 4.29 

 Amended and Restated Exchange Agreement 
 Clearway Inc. entered into an amended and restated exchange agreement pursuant to which CEG (as successor-in-interest to NRG Energy, Inc.) (and certain permitted assignees and permitted transferees who acquire Class B units or Class D units of Clearway LLC) may from time to time cause Clearway LLC to exchange its Class B units for shares of Clearway Inc. s Class A common stock on a one-for-one basis, subject to adjustments for stock splits, stock dividends and reclassifications, or to exchange its Class D units for shares of Clearway Inc. s Class C common stock on a one-for-one basis, subject to adjustments for stock splits, stock dividends, and reclassifications (the Amended and Restated Exchange Agreement ). The Amended and Restated Exchange Agreement also provides that, subject to certain exceptions, holders do not have the right to cause Clearway LLC to exchange Class B or Class D units if Clearway LLC determines that such exchange would be prohibited by law or regulation or would violate other agreements to which Clearway Inc. may be subject, and Clearway Inc. may impose additional restrictions on exchange that it determines necessary or advisable so that Clearway LLC is not treated as a publicly traded partnership for U.S. federal income tax purposes. 
 When CEG or its permitted transferee exchanges a Class B unit of Clearway LLC for a share of Clearway Inc. s Class A common stock, Clearway Inc. will automatically redeem and cancel a corresponding share of Clearway Inc. s Class B common stock and the Class B unit will automatically convert into a Class A unit when issued to Clearway Inc. Similarly, when CEG or its permitted transferee exchanges a Class D unit of Clearway LLC for a share of Clearway Inc. s Class C common stock, Clearway Inc. will automatically redeem and cancel a corresponding share of Clearway Inc. s Class D common stock and the Class D unit will automatically convert into a Class C unit when issued to Clearway Inc. As a result, when a holder exchanges its Class B units for shares of Clearway Inc. s Class A common stock, or its Class D units for shares of Clearway Inc. s Class C common stock, Clearway Inc. s interest in Clearway LLC will be correspondingly increased. Clearway Inc. has reserved for issuance 42,738,750 shares of Clearway Inc. s Class A common stock, which is the aggregate number of shares of Class A common stock expected to be issued over time upon the exchange of all Class B units of Clearway LLC currently outstanding, and 42,738,750 shares of Clearway Inc. s Class C common stock, which is the aggregate number of shares of Class C common stock expected to be issued over time upon the exchange of all Class D units of Clearway LLC currently outstanding. 
 Indemnification and Exculpation 
 To the extent permitted by applicable law, Clearway LLC will indemnify its managing member, Clearway Inc. s authorized officers and Clearway Inc. s other employees and agents from and against any losses, liabilities, damages, costs, expenses, fees or penalties incurred in connection with serving in such capacities, provided that the acts or omissions of these indemnified persons are not the result of fraud, intentional misconduct or a violation of the implied contractual duty of good faith and fair dealing, or any lesser standard of conduct permitted under applicable law. 
 Such authorized officers and other employees and agents will not be liable to Clearway LLC, its members or their affiliates for damages incurred as a result of any acts or omissions of these persons, provided that the acts or omissions of these exculpated persons are not the result of fraud, intentional misconduct or a violation of the implied contractual duty of good faith and fair dealing, or any lesser standard of conduct permitted under applicable law. 
 Amended and Restated Registration Rights Agreement 
 Clearway Inc. entered into an amended and restated registration rights agreement with CEG (as successor-in-interest to NRG) pursuant to which CEG and its affiliates will be entitled to demand registration rights, including the right to demand that a shelf registration statement be filed, and piggyback registration rights, for shares of Clearway Inc. s Class A common stock that are issuable upon exchange of Class B units of Clearway LLC that it owns, and for shares of Clearway Inc. s Class C common stock that are issuable upon exchange of Class D units of Clearway LLC that it owns.
