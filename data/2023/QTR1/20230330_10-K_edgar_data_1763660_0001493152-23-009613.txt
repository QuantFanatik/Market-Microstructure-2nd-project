ICT industry pain points caused by technical insufficiencies, inappropriate financial modelling and weak strategic positioning within
a competitive environment. The program aims to improve the technical exposure of our clients and to improve their sustainability in the
ICT industry community through a combination of mentorship programs. Currently, our clients are mainly Malaysia based ICT companies with
future prospects in other ASIAN countries.

ICT
Industry in Asia 

Asia
has become a hotbed for adoption of some new technologies in recent years, especially in the field of Internet of things (IoT) and robotics.
This is partly driven by manufacturing firms, most notably in China, which are rapidly deploying these solutions. It also reflects commitments
from Asian governments and business leaders to leverage new technologies as a solution to the region s economic and demographic
challenges, such as robotics as a response to curb labor shortages in Japan. Smart city investments in the region are also eye-catching,
with the high penetration rate of mobile devices allowing some countries to leapfrog legacy technologies. The challenge
will be to increase broader adoption of software solutions which have the potential to deliver a more transformative economic impact 1 . 

Driven
by the rapid growth of IoT in recent years, coupled with the investments in the manufacturing and transportation industries, new technologies
are already approaching 1 trillion in annual revenue. Over the next few years, other new categories such as robots/drones and AR/VR
headsets in addition to related software and services will see similar growth. This increasing proportion of spending targeted at new
categories will drive the overall industry to a new growth surge over the next decade as businesses move beyond prototyping into broader
deployments of technologies such as augmented reality viewers and AI-enabled robots.

ICT
Industry Hong Kong 

Hong
Kong s role as a leading business center in the Asia region can be evidenced by its advanced telecommunications infrastructure.
According to Global Information Technology Report 2016 by the World Economic Forum, Hong Kong is in the third rank in Asia (12th in the
world) in the Networked Readiness Index, indicating Hong Kong s advanced position in telecommunications infrastructure, regulatory
environment, and business readiness of using information technology. 2 The ICT sector of Hong Kong is among the most advanced
in the world. According to the annual global ICT Development Index published by ITU in November 2017, Hong Kong ranked second in Asia
after Korea, and sixth in the world. 3 

The
industry of information and communications in Hong Kong had generated HK 84.1 billion (US 10.7 billion) of value added during 2016, contributing
to 3.5 of GDP. In term of industry data, Hong Kong had household broadband penetration rate at 92.6 (as at February 2018). 4 The
Hong Kong Internet connection speeds are among the highest in the world, according to the Office of the Communication Authority. In Hong
Kong, IT products and services suppliers were the largest category of IT users, accounting for 34.2 of total IT employment, followed
by the wholesale, retail, import/export, restaurants and hotels sector (28.8 ), the financing, insurance, real estate and business services
sector (17.9 ), and the community, social and personal services sector (11.4 ). 4 

Hong
Kong s ICT spending is on track to grow 3.8 in 2018 to HK 144.42 billion, according to the latest projections from Gartner. Total
spending on technology and products in the market is projected to turnaround following a 9.2 decline in spending in 2017, and grow a
further 1.9 in 2019 to reach HK 147.19 billion. Communications services will remain the largest category overall, but total spending
in this category is projected to decline slightly from 2017 to HK 49 billion. Spending on devices by contrast will increase significantly
to HK 47.9 billion, taking it closer to becoming the top spending category in the Hong Kong market. Spending on software will also increase
by 9.2 to HK 13.15 billion, and the IT services segment will grow 3.5 to HK 28.4 billion. Data center systems spending will by contrast
stay mostly flat at HK 5.89 billion. 5 

3 

Hong
Kong government has put in place initiatives to foster the ICT industry development, which included funding support, provision of infrastructure,
international cooperation and manpower development. One of the example will be The Smart City Blueprint, which unveiled in December 2017,
maps out development plans for the next five years to enhance Hong Kong sustainability by making use of innovation and technology. The
Hong Kong government s Innovation and Technology Fund (ITF) has provided an alternative source of funding for the IT industry.
As of end-March 2018, the ITF had approved 7,359 funding applications on projects with a total of HK 14 billion. Last but not least,
Hong Kong has a large pool of skilled ICT professionals, providing services to clients spanning a wide range of businesses. According
to the 2016 Manpower Survey Report conducted by the VTC, 87,794 persons were employed in principal jobs of the IT sector. 6

ICT
Industry in ASEAN 

The
economy in Southeast Asia region is expected to grow at a yearly average of 5.2 from 2018 to 2022 7 , with studies projecting
the Association of Southeast Asia Nations (ASEAN) to become the fourth largest single market in the world by 2030 8 - putting
it behind only the US, China and the European Union. The region s steady growth is fueled by an increasingly well-educated workforce,
a wealth of natural resources, rapid urbanization and growing infrastructure spending. In addition, ASEAN is in a strategic location
in the confluence of major trade routes, with US 5.3 trillion of global trade passing through each year 9 . Our company sees
that the opportunity of ASEAN s strong and vibrant economy, favorable demographics, ICT investments, and ongoing economic integration
have laid the foundation for rapid growth in the digital economy. 

10 The
six largest economies in ASEAN (Indonesia, Thailand, Malaysia, Singapore, Philippines, and Vietnam) contribute 99 of the total ASEAN
GDP. Many of the fundamentals are already in place: 

Robust
 economy generating GDP of 2.5 trillion and growing at 6 percent per year 

Literate
 population of more than 600 million people, with 40 percent under 30 years of age 

Well-developed
 information and communications technology (ICT) cluster with a track record of innovation and investment in new technology

ICT
Industry in Malaysia 

Malaysia,
where our company is based in, is the fourth largest economy in Southeast Asia and is known for its high labor productivity and diversified
economy. Over the years, the country has transformed itself from being a primary commodities exporter into a leading exporter of electrical
appliances, electronic parts, and components. Moving up the industrial value chain, it has also established itself as an attractive regional
ICT hub for services, information and technology, and e-commerce. 

The
ICT industry has contributed recorded 18.3 to the national economy in 2017 as compared to 16.5 in 2010. This industry showed an increasing
average annual growth rate of 9.0 over a seven-year period. The contribution of ICT comprised 13.2 while the rest is contributed by
e-commerce in non-ICT industries. The contribution of the ICT industry to Gross Domestic Product (GDP) recorded a growth of 8.4 with
a value of US 45 billion. This information can be found at https://www.dosm.gov.my/v1/index.php. 

In
March 2017, Malaysia launched the world s first Digital Free Trade Zone (DFTZ) 11 outside of China that aims to capitalize
the confluence and exponential growth of the internet economy and cross-border e-commerce activities. The DFTZ is expected to double
the growth rate of small and medium enterprises goods exports to reach US 38 billion and facilitate US 65 billion of goods movement
via the DFTZ (exports, imports, transshipments) by 2025. More than 2,000 small and medium enterprises stand to get easier access to the
global market, especially the Chinese market, through the DFTZ. The DFTZ is also expected to generate 60,000 new jobs in the country
by 2025. 

In
its 2018 budget 12 , the government announced wide-ranging incentives to support businesses, including capital allowance for
ICT equipment and software, tax relief on services provided by the local authorities, and extended application period for principal hub
tax incentive among others. The principal hub tax incentive aims to increase Malaysia s competitiveness as the global operations
hub for multinational companies by offering tax exemptions to companies that set up their global operation centers in Malaysia. The budget
also announced National Transformation 2050 vision that aims to improve the qualitative growth factors of the economy such as labor force
skills by preparing its citizens for future challenges such as the fourth industrial revolution - artificial intelligence, robotics,
digitalization, etc.

ICT
Industry in Indonesia 

Meanwhile
in Indonesia, the country has the fastest growing mobile market in the Asia-Pacific region, while globally, it is the 4th largest mobile
market in the world. The country has an extremely high penetration rate in mobile device at 112 , meaning 260 million of the country s
population has access to a mobile device 13 . This, combined with drivers like mass consumption of products, urbanization, and
a tech-hungry young population, has resulted in rapid development in the ICT industry in the country. 

Currently,
the country s ICT industry has a primary focus on Software-as-a-Service (SaaS) and cloud computing, providing solution such as
data analytics, data center management, and managed services. In July 2019, Softbank has announced a 2 billion investment in Indonesia,
aimed to upgrade the digital infrastructure of the country. 

5 

The
government of Indonesia has also introduced different initiatives and national programs, including Go Digital Vision 2020, e-smart IKM
and 100 Smart City Movement to drive the country s economy towards the digital edge. These programs aim to develop local startups,
support small to medium enterprises (SMEs) as well as to prepare and embrace internet of things (IoT). Most notably, the Making Indonesia
4.0 road map launched in April 2019 seeks to diversify the economy away from a reliance on natural resources by developing higher-tech
export industries. The plan will focus on areas like 3D printing, artificial intelligence, human-machine interface, robotics and sensor
technology, all of which require advanced digital capacity. As such, the government expects to create between 7 million and 19 million
new jobs between 2018 and 2030 to support the development of the industry. The government also expects a growth in the industrial sector s
gross domestic product contribution from 20 percent to 30 percent over the same period. 14 

Indonesia
has already achieved its goal to become largest digital economy in South East Asia by 2020, valued at US 40 billion. Driven by the socio-demographic
and fiscal factors, the market value of Indonesia s digital economy is expected to reach 130 billion by 2025.

ICT
Industry in Thailand 

Whereas
in Thailand, the industrial hub of South East Asia, the country is still in the starting/developing stage in its ICT industry. The country s
ICT industry is dominated by the hardware market, including CCTV and smart Bluetooth, which account for 67 of the industry value 15 .
Meanwhile, software and digital services account for the remaining. As such, the potential of the industry is still largely untapped
and more advancement into digital spectrum can be expected. 

The
government of Thailand is also stepping up its effort to encourage development of new start-ups with tech focus. It has set up the Board
of Investment (BOI), a government agency to promote Foreign Direct Investment into the country by providing information, services, and
incentives. Some of the incentives include permission for 100 foreign ownership, up to 15 years exemption in corporate income tax, and
permission to bring in experts and skilled workers and their families. The initiative aims to encourage firms like venture capitals and
corporate incubators to enter the local market, provide mentorships and accelerator programs that will help to get startup off the ground
and contribute to the growth of technology 16 . The BOI is also targeting to increase funding of national research and development
to at least 1 of Thailand s GDP with the targeted ratio of public to private R D investment of 30:70, which private firms
will enjoy higher benefits of this initiatives 17 . 

Looking
forward, International Data Corporation (IDC) Thailand predicts that from 2019 to 2022, IT-related spending in the country will reach
US 72 billion. 60 of Thailand s IT spending will also be on 3rd platform technologies with 30 of enterprises will seek to build
 digital-native IT environments. Also, by 2024, it is expected that AI-enabled user interfaces and process automation will
replace one-third of today s screen-based apps in Thailand. The IDC also expects 61 of the country GDP, roughly U 317 billion
(based on 2019 GDP level) will be digitalized by 2022 18 .

ICT
industry in Vietnam 

Vietnam
has enjoyed its own economic miracle in recent years, showing the world how it turned the country from one of the poorest nations in
the world to become a middle-income nation. The Southeast Asia country has grown its GDP for an average 6.8 19 over the past
two decades to reach US 255 billion in 2019, rivalling China s result during this period 20 . 

Along
with the economy, the country s ICT industry has also experienced substantial growth of average 31.1 per year from 2014 to 2019.
The industry s revenue reached US 110 billion in 2019, driven by government s initiatives, rising middle class, growing internet
usage, and a young population 21 . 

Similar
to Thailand, the hardware segment dominates the Vietnam ICT industry, accounting for 86 of the industry revenue in 2017. However, in
recent years, the industry has seen tremendous potential in areas like software and services, evidenced from increased adoption of software
and service by the private and public sectors. At the same time, the country has emerged as a destination of software outsourcing, competing
directly with India, China, and Philippines. It is currently the eight largest provider of IT services globally. 

Various
government incentives have been introduced to encourage further development in the ICT industry. Amongst the incentives, government has
exempted 100 of corporate income tax for IT companies for up to four years, followed by 50 tax exemption for up to nine years. Subsequently,
the corporate income tax rate for IT Company will stay at 10 , compared to a 20 tax rate for traditional companies. The government has
also implemented a zero percent value-added tax for computer programming activities. 

On
the other side, new hi-tech parks will be constructed across the country from 2015 to 2030 though a combined effort by central and local
government, and private capital 22 . The hi-tech parks will offer various benefits to investors to move into the hi-tech parks.
For example, the Da Nang High-tech Park offers CIT incentives, import duty exemptions, as well as one-stop administrative procedures
for investors located in the park 23 .

ICT
industry in Philippines 

The
ICT industry in Philippines is relatively young compare to other countries, but the country has started to receive growing attention
and foreign investment in recent years. One of main reasons is the relatively low standard in the country s telecoms sector, as
a result of lack of competition and limited investment. 24 

In
order to overhaul the broadband capabilities, the Department of Information and Communications Technology (DICT) Philippines has introduced
the National Broadband Plan (NPL) in 2017, an US 4 billion initiative to deploy fiber optic cables and wireless technology to further
expand 3G, 4G, and LTE services throughout the country 25 . Since then, steady progress in 4G availability has been made and
is set to make further progress. 

Currently,
Business process outsourcing (BPO) is one of the country s leading generators of income. In fact, DICT has projected around 38.9
billion revenue will be generated in the BPO service in the next six years25. In the past year, the ICT sector has also become top investment
contributor for the country in 2019, attracting US 6 billion of foreign investment 26 . Moving forward, the focus of the country
will remain in upgrading the network capabilities. The development in passive telecommunication infrastructure such as fibre optic cables,
cable landing stations and submarine fibre optic is expected to contribute an annual investment inflow of US 1.9 billion until 2022.

Our
Solutions and Services 

Mentoring 

We
believe that tech-based entrepreneurs are the vital agents of positive and transformational change across every aspect of our society
and economy. It is our intention to offer mentoring programs to our clients through which we hope to create a sense of community, wherein
our members will be able to grow their companies exponentially through leveraging skillsets and potential capital provided by our organization.
Through creating a sense of community, we have the potential to become one of the IT Corporate Venture Capital (CVC) Companies in the
ASIA region. Our mentors, for the time being and in the foreseeable future, will comprise of the Company s officers, whom have
extensive experience in the information and computer technology industry. Additionally, our mentors possess, extensive corporate experience,
corporate management skills, professional networking, and industry knowledge which are necessary to guide tech-based entrepreneurs to
the path of success. 

The
exact details of our mentoring program will be adjusted on a case-by-case basis, but will follow a certain basic structure. Our primary
focus will be to provide domain knowledge in delivering ICT-enriched learning experiences and best practices through our years of experience
in the ICT and tech-based industry. We intend to provide professional industry-based advice, conduct market analysis, track performance
metrics and corporate development advisory on ASIA-wide ICT aspects. The Company intends to conduct feasibility report based on the industry
average using comparison of common firms performance within the ICT industry. 

The
feasibility reports cover seven main areas to clearly identify the pain points that entrepreneurs may encounter within the ICT market: 

-
Direction and Strategy 

 -
Team and Execution 

 -
Culture and Brand 

 -
Creativity and Innovation 

 -
Business Modelling 

 -
Sustainability 

 -
Profitability 

Match-Making
 Business Opportunities 

The
strength and ability of ASIA entrepreneurs are evolving and improving; hence our Company s mission is to assist these entrepreneurs
to grow globally. SEATech targets emerging-growth entrepreneurs and assist them to sustain their economic positions in the Asia-Pacific
region, as we believe the multilateral business relationship between the countries in these regions has shown a trend of increasing strength
which will continue in the future. We intend to identify emerging-growth entrepreneurs, initially, through word of mouth and existing
industry contacts of our officers and directors, we may also evaluate the possibility of organizing programs or events in future and
to provide a venture pitching platform for tech-based companies seeking venture capital funding. Plans regarding the organizing of events
is in the growth stage, and currently we have not taken measures to finalize such plans. Once entrepreneurs are identified, we will create
linkages between the ecosystem players within the information and communications technology (ICT) industry and assist in solving critical
issue for the continued development of ICT sectors.

Technology
Team 

It
is the Company s belief that digital products and services are transforming industries, enriching lives, and propelling progress.
We strongly believe that our team with years of experience in the ICT industry will be able to reinforce the importance of digitization
and incubate promising entrepreneurs in the ICT industry who can shape the country s future. With the experience of our officers
and directors in this industry, we believe that we are able to benefit our members by making recommendations pursuant to the digital
economy, conducting market analysis, and tracking digital progress metrics throughout Southeast Asia. 

Financial
and Corporate Advisory Team 

Growing
strong regional entrepreneurs is not our sole aim, we also aspire to build an ICT ecosystem in the region through the tool of securitization
that could assist our clients to compete on the world stage. As such, we have entered into a memorandum of understanding with the National
ICT Association of Malaysia (PIKOM), and GreenPro Capital Corp (NASDAQ: GRNQ) to enter into a partnership to create greater value for
the high-growth emerging companies in the ASIA region. In collaboration with Greenpro, our corporate development advisory services can
be flexible arrangement, custom fitted for members and their needs. We provide advisory services to ascertain that our clients are well
structured and have clearly delineated funding options available in the capital marketplace. 

Corporate
Program 

Despite
the technological advancements, many small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) in ASIA are still low in both technology and skillsets.
With our Corporate Programs, we intend to match and enhance performance of ICT entrepreneurs based upon a spectrum of availability, innovation
environment, regulatory environment, and digital literacy. It is our intention to create corporate programs through which our community
clients may have an opportunity to attend seminars, workshops, promotional events that showcase industry expertise during key cross-countries
Southeast Asia events. All such plans remain in development and we have yet to determine a timeline when such programs will become available. 

Future
Plan 

Marketing 

We
plan to explore tech-based marketplaces and attract IT startup entrepreneurs around ASIA countries through building our corporate image
and awareness through corporate seminars, website and pitching events. Further, we had developed a corporate website which will introduce
our SEATech Corporate Ventures Program. 

At
this time, we intend for the SEATech Corporate Ventures Program to be comprised of the following: 

1.
Mentorship on Pitching - Participate in SEATech s corporate accelerator programs which will mentor ICT entrepreneur s pitching
skills and educate their mind-set of current business environment. 

2.
Corporate Event Opportunity to attend seminars / workshops where they will be provided with professional ICT advisory solutions
by our experienced officer and director. 

3.
Roadshow and Fund-Raising Advisory Opportunity to participate in event to provide entrepreneurs with knowledge of options available within
the capital market and to enhance their understanding of compliance requirements to respective capital market rules and regulations. 

4.
Matchmaking Business Opportunities Potential collaborations for local entrepreneurs to meet some of the region s most innovative
start-ups. 

We
market our advisory services through this corporate website and utilize search engine marketing to improve the visibility of our corporate
website. At this point in time, our website was in place and accessible at: https://www.seatech-ventures.com/. 

10 

Expansion
and Targeted Market 

In
the next financial year from 2022 onwards, we plan to recruit three to five engagement partners in every country that we operate .
 The Company anticipates expanding into the ASIA market initially to Thailand, Indonesia, Singapore, Philippines, Vietnam, Myanmar,
Cambodia, Taiwan, China and Hong Kong. The qualifications and capabilities are individuals with vast experiences in the ICT industry,
able to provide in-depth analysis, corporate management advice and developing business solutions for ICT companies that intend to grow,
as well as to carry out performance assessment, strategic planning and implementation of pre-set goals and plans. 

In
addition, we will hire additional staff in Malaysia within a year of the public listing of the Company. We believe that hiring fifteen
to twenty employees, which may include accountants, public relations and ICT business consultants, will be sufficient in order to support
our operations. It will also be necessary for us to acquire office space from which we can conduct operations and conduct meetings with
potential clients. We also plan to allocate funds to support our ICT Incubator Program. However, such development will require intensive
research, development and testing so we cannot accurately determine a concrete timeline at present nor have we determined an appropriate
budget for these future activities. We may also evaluate potential acquisitions and venture opportunities in the future which we feel
may have some synergy with our current operations when the Company is successfully listed in the US capital market. 

Competition 

SEATech
focuses on providing mentoring and advisory services to ICT companies in ASIA. The venture capital industry in ASEAN or even the ASIAN
region has grown substantially over the years, as more start-ups, especially those with ICT focus, will require mentoring and incubation
services in order to move to the next level. Henceforth, the venture capital industry is getting more competitive and SEATech intends
to improve its visibility and the provision of its advisory services in order to stand out from the competition. The Company will seek
to improve its competency in ICT so as to create a competitive advantage over our existing and/or potential competitors.

Penny
Stock Regulations 

The
Securities and Exchange Commission has adopted regulations which generally define penny stock to be an equity security
that has a market price of less than 5.00 per share. Our Common Stock, when and if a trading market develops, may fall within the definition
of penny stock and be subject to rules that impose additional sales practice requirements on broker-dealers who sell such securities
to persons other than established customers and accredited investors (generally those with assets in excess of 1,000,000, or annual
incomes exceeding 200,000 individually, or 300,000, together with their spouse). 

For
transactions covered by these rules, the broker-dealer must make a special suitability determination for the purchase of such securities
and have received the purchaser s prior written consent to the transaction. Additionally, for any transaction, other than exempt
transactions, involving a penny stock, the rules require the delivery, prior to the transaction, of a risk disclosure document mandated
by the Securities and Exchange Commission relating to the penny stock market. The broker-dealer also must disclose the commissions payable
to both the broker-dealer and the registered representative, current quotations for the securities and, if the broker-dealer is the sole
market-maker, the broker-dealer must disclose this fact and the broker-dealer s presumed control over the market. Finally, monthly
statements must be sent disclosing recent price information for the penny stock held in the account and information on the limited market
in penny stocks. Consequently, the penny stock rules may restrict the ability of broker-dealers to sell our Common Stock
and may affect the ability of investors to sell their Common Stock in the secondary market. 

In
addition to the penny stock rules promulgated by the Securities and Exchange Commission, the Financial Industry Regulatory
Authority FINRA has adopted rules that require that in recommending an investment to a customer, a broker-dealer must
have reasonable grounds for believing that the investment is suitable for that customer. Prior to recommending speculative low-priced
securities to their non-institutional customers, broker-dealers must make reasonable efforts to obtain information about the customer s
financial status, tax status, investment objectives and other information. Under interpretations of these rules, FINRA believes that
there is a high probability that speculative low-priced securities will not be suitable for at least some customers. The FINRA requirements
make it more difficult for broker-dealers to recommend that their customers buy our common stock, which may limit the investors 
ability to buy and sell our stock. 

Dividend
Policy 

Any
future determination as to the declaration and payment of dividends on shares of our Common Stock will be made at the discretion of our
board of directors out of funds legally available for such purpose. We are under no obligations or restrictions to declare or pay dividends
on our shares of Common Stock. In addition, we currently have no plans to pay such dividends. Our board of directors currently intends
to retain all earnings for use in the business for the foreseeable future.

Revenue
recognition 

Financial
Accounting Standards Board, or FASB, issued ASC 606. The standard is a comprehensive new revenue recognition model that requires revenue
to be recognized in a manner to depict the transfer of goods or services to a customer at an amount that reflects the consideration expected
to be received in exchange for those goods or services. 

Revenue
is measured at the fair value of the consideration received or receivable, net of discounts and taxes applicable to the revenue. The
Company derives its revenue from provision of business mentoring, nurturing, incubating and corporate development advisory services to
ICT and technology-based companies. 

Cost
of revenue 

Cost
of revenue includes the cost of services and product in providing business mentoring, nurturing, incubating and corporate development
advisory services 

Income
taxes 

Income
taxes are determined in accordance with the provisions of ASC Topic 740, Income Taxes ASC Topic 740 ).
Under this method, deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between
the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax basis. Deferred tax assets and liabilities
are measured using enacted income tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the periods in which those temporary differences are
expected to be recovered or settled. Any effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in income
in the period that includes the enactment date. 

ASC
740 prescribes a comprehensive model for how companies should recognize, measure, present, and disclose in their financial statements
uncertain tax positions taken or expected to be taken on a tax return. Under ASC 740, tax positions must initially be recognized in the
financial statements when it is more likely than not the position will be sustained upon examination by the tax authorities. Such tax
positions must initially and subsequently be measured as the largest amount of tax benefit that has a greater than 50 likelihood of
being realized upon ultimate settlement with the tax authority assuming full knowledge of the position and relevant facts. 

17 

Net
income/(loss) per share 

The
Company calculates net loss per share in accordance with ASC Topic 260 Earnings per share . Basic loss per share is computed
by dividing the net loss by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding during the period. Diluted loss per share is computed
similar to basic loss per share except that the denominator is increased to include the number of additional common shares that would
have been outstanding if the potential common stock equivalents had been issued and if the additional common shares were dilutive. 

Foreign
currencies translation 

The
reporting currency of the Company and its subsidiaries in Labuan and Hong Kong, are United States Dollars US ), while
its subsidiaries in Malaysia, maintains the books and record in Ringgit Malaysia MYR ), being the primary currency of the
economic environment in which these entities operate. 

Transactions
denominated in currencies other than the functional currency are translated into the functional currency at the exchange rates prevailing
at the dates of the transaction. Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in currencies other than the functional currency are translated
into the functional currency using the applicable exchange rates at the balance sheet dates. The resulting exchange differences are recorded
in the statements of operations. 

In
general, for consolidation purposes, assets and liabilities of its subsidiary whose functional currency is not the US are translated
into US , in accordance with ASC Topic 830-30, Translation of Financial Statement , using the exchange rate on the
balance sheet date. Revenues and expenses are translated at average rates prevailing during the period. The gains and losses resulting
from translation of financial statements of foreign subsidiary are recorded as a separate component of accumulated other comprehensive
income within the statement of stockholders equity.

the other party or exercise significant influence over the other party in making financial and operating decisions. Companies are also

Fair
value of financial instruments: 

The
carrying value of the Company s financial instruments: cash and cash equivalents, accounts payable and accrued liabilities, and
amount due to a director approximate at their fair values because of the short-term nature of these financial instruments. 

The
Company also follows the guidance of the ASC Topic 820-10, Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures ASC 820-10 ),
with respect to financial assets and liabilities that are measured at fair value. ASC 820-10 establishes a three-tier fair value hierarchy
that prioritizes the inputs used in measuring fair value as follows: 

Level
 1: Observable inputs such as quoted prices in active markets; 

Level
 2: Inputs, other than the quoted prices in active markets, that are observable either directly or indirectly; and 

Level
 3: Unobservable inputs in which there is little or no market data, which require the reporting entity to develop its own assumptions. 

Recent
accounting pronouncements 

The
Company has reviewed all recently issued, but not yet effective, accounting pronouncements and do not believe the future adoption of
any such pronouncements may be expected to cause a material impact on its financial condition or the results of its operations. 

In May 2019, the FASB issued ASU
2019-05, which is an update to ASU Update No. 2016-13, Financial Instruments Credit Losses (Topic 326): Measurement of Credit Losses
on Financial Instruments, which introduced the expected credit losses methodology for the measurement of credit losses on financial assets
measured at amortized cost basis, replacing the previous incurred loss methodology. The amendments in Update 2016-13 added Topic 326,
Financial Instruments Credit Losses, and made several consequential amendments to the Codification. The amendments in this Update
address those stakeholders concerns by providing an option to irrevocably elect the fair value option for certain financial assets
previously measured at amortized cost basis. For those entities, the targeted transition relief will increase comparability of financial
statement information by providing an option to align measurement methodologies for similar financial assets. Furthermore, the targeted
transition relief also may reduce the costs for some entities to comply with the amendments in Update 2016-13 while still providing financial
statement users with decision-useful information. In November 2019, the FASB issued ASU No. 2019-10, which to update the effective date
of ASU No. 2016-13 for private companies, not-for-profit organizations and certain smaller reporting companies applying for credit losses,
leases, and hedging standard. The new effective date for these preparers is for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2022. ASU 2019-05
is effective for the Company for annual and interim reporting periods beginning January 1, 2023 as the Company is qualified as a smaller
reporting company. The Company is currently evaluating the impact ASU 2019-05 may have on its consolidated financial statements.

Control and Procedures 

19 

Our
management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting. Internal control over
financial reporting is defined in Rule 13a-15(f) or 15d-15(f) promulgated under the Exchange Act as a process designed by, or under the
supervision of, the company s principal executive and principal financial officers and effected by the company s board of
directors, management and other personnel, to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation
of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America
and includes those policies and procedures that: 

Pertain
 to the maintenance of records that in reasonable detail accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets
 of the company; 

Provide
 reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with
 accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being
 made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and 

Provide
 reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of the company s
 assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements. 

Because
of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Projections of any evaluation
of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that
the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. All internal control systems, no matter how well designed,
have inherent limitations. Therefore, even those systems determined to be effective can provide only reasonable assurance with respect
to financial statement preparation and presentation. Because of the inherent limitations of internal control, there is a risk that material
misstatements may not be prevented or detected on a timely basis by internal control over financial reporting. However, these inherent
limitations are known features of the financial reporting process. Therefore, it is possible to design into the process safeguards to
reduce, though not eliminate, this risk. 

As
of December 31, 2022, management assessed the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting based on the criteria for
effective internal control over financial reporting established in Internal Control Integrated Framework issued by the Committee
of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission COSO and SEC guidance on conducting such assessments. Based on
such evaluation, the Company s management concluded that, during the period covered by this Report, internal controls and procedures
over were not effective. This was due to deficiencies that existed in the design or operation of our internal controls over financial
reporting that adversely affected our internal controls and that may be considered to be material weaknesses. 

Identified
Material Weakness 

A
material weakness in internal control over financial reporting is a control deficiency, or combination of control deficiencies, that
results in more than a remote likelihood that a material misstatement of the financial statements will not be prevented or detected. 

Management
identified the following material weakness during its assessment of internal controls over financial reporting as of December 31, 2022. 

We
do not have adequate segregation of duties and effective risk assessment Lack of segregation of duties and effective risk
assessment may cause the Company to face the likelihood of fraud or theft, due to poor oversight, governance and review to detect errors. 

Accordingly,
the Company concluded that these control deficiencies resulted in a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of the annual
or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis by the company s internal controls. 

20 

As
a result of the material weaknesses described above, management has concluded that the Company did not maintain effective internal control
over financial reporting as of December 31, 2022 based on criteria established in Internal Control Integrated Framework issued
by COSO. 

Management s
Remediation Initiatives 

In
an effort to remediate the identified material weaknesses and other deficiencies and enhance our internal controls, we have initiated,
or plan to initiate, the following series of measures: 

1. 
 We
 plan to create a position to segregate duties consistent with control objectives and will increase our personnel resources and technical
 accounting expertise within the accounting function. The accounting personnel is responsible for reviewing the financing activities,
 facilitate the approval of the financing, record the information regarding the financing, and submit SEC filing related documents
 to our legal counsel in order to comply with the filing requirements of SEC. 

2. 
 We
 intend to add staff members to our management team for making sure that information required to be disclosed in our reports filed
 and submitted under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported as and when required and will the staff members
 will have segregated responsibilities with regard to these responsibilities. 

We
anticipate that these initiatives will be at least partially, if not fully, implemented by the end of fiscal year 2022. 

Changes
in internal controls over financial reporting 

There
was no change in our internal controls over financial reporting that occurred during the period covered by this Report, which has materially
affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal controls over financial reporting: 

This
annual report does not include an attestation report of the Company s registered independent public accounting firm regarding internal
control over financial reporting. Management s report was not subject to attestation by the Company s registered independent
public accounting firm pursuant to rules of the Securities and Exchange Commission that permit the Company to provide only management s
report in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.

officer, principal financial officer and principal accounting officer. The code addresses, among other things, honesty and ethical conduct,
conflicts of interest, compliance with laws, regulations and policies, including disclosure requirements under the federal securities
laws, confidentiality, trading on inside information, and reporting of violations of the code. The code of ethics is available on the

Shareholder
Proposals 

Our
Company does not have any defined policy or procedural requirements for shareholders to submit recommendations or nominations for Directors.
The Board of Directors believes that, given the stage of our development, a specific nominating policy would be premature and of little
assistance until our business operations develop to a more advanced level. Our Company does not currently have any specific or minimum
criteria for the election of nominees to the Board of Directors and we do not have any specific process or procedure for evaluating such
nominees. The Board of Directors will assess all candidates, whether submitted by management or shareholders, and make recommendations
for election or appointment. 

A
shareholder who wishes to communicate with our Board of Directors may do so by directing a written request addressed to our President,
at the address appearing on the first page of this Information Statement.

Executive
Compensation Philosophy 

Our
Board of Directors determines the compensation given to our executive officers in their sole determination. Our Board of Directors reserves
the right to pay our executive or any future executives a salary, and/or issue them shares of common stock in consideration for services
rendered and/or to award incentive bonuses which are linked to our performance, as well as to the individual executive officer s
performance. This package may also include long-term stock-based compensation to certain executives, which is intended to align the performance
of our executives with our long-term business strategies. Additionally, while our Board of Directors has not granted any performance
base stock options to date, the Board of Directors reserves the right to grant such options in the future, if the Board in its sole determination
believes such grants would be in the best interests of the Company. 

Incentive
Bonus 

The
Board of Directors may grant incentive bonuses to our executive officer and/or future executive officers in its sole discretion, if the
Board of Directors believes such bonuses are in the Company s best interest, after analyzing our current business objectives and
growth, if any, and the amount of revenue we are able to generate each month, which revenue is a direct result of the actions and ability
of such executives. 

Long-term,
Stock Based Compensation 

In
order to attract, retain and motivate executive talent necessary to support the Company s long-term business strategy we may award
our executive and any future executives with long-term, stock-based compensation in the future, at the sole discretion of our Board of
Directors, which we do not currently have any immediate plans to award.

Beneficial
ownership has been determined in accordance with Rule 13d-3 under the Exchange Act. Under this rule, certain shares may be deemed to
be beneficially owned by more than one person (if, for example, persons share the power to vote or the power to dispose of the shares).
In addition, shares are deemed to be beneficially owned by a person if the person has the right to acquire shares (for example, upon
exercise of a n option or warrant) within 60 days of the date as of which the information is provided.
In computing the percentage ownership of any person, the amount of shares is deemed to include the amount of shares beneficially owned
by such person by reason of such acquisition rights. As a result, the percentage of outstanding shares of any person as shown in the
following table does not necessarily reflect the person s actual voting power at any particular date.

 Beneficial
 ownership is determined in accordance with the rules of the Securities and Exchange Commission and generally includes voting or investment
 power with respect to securities. Beneficial ownership also includes shares of stock subject to options and warrants currently exercisable
 or exercisable within 60 days of the date of this table. In determining the percent of common stock owned by a person or entity as
 of the date of this Report, (a) the numerator is the number of shares of the class beneficially owned by such person or entity, including
 shares which may be acquired within 60 days on exercise of warrants or options and conversion of convertible securities, and (b)
 the denominator is the sum of (i) the total shares of common stock outstanding on as of the date of this Annual Report (92,519,843
 shares), and (ii) the total number of shares that the beneficial owner may acquire upon exercise of the derivative securities. Unless
 otherwise stated, each beneficial owner has sole power to vote and dispose of its shares.

 Jalan

Opinion
on the Financial Statements 

We
have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of SEATech Ventures Corp. (the Company as of December 31, 2022
and 2021, and the related consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive loss, stockholders equity, and cash flows
for the each of two years in the year ended of December 31, 2022 and 2021, and the related notes (collectively referred to as the financial
statements ). In our opinion, the financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the
Company as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of two years in the year ended
December 31, 2022 and 2021, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. 

Basis for Opinion 

These financial statements are the responsibility
of the Company s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company s financial statements based on our
audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable
rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. 

We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards
of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements
are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. The Company is not required to have, nor were we engaged to perform,
an audit of its internal control over financial reporting. As part of our audits, we are required to obtain an understanding of internal
control over financial reporting but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Company s internal
control over financial reporting. Accordingly, we express no such opinion. 

Our audits included performing procedures to assess
the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond
to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial
statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well
as evaluating the overall presentation of the consolidated financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis
for our opinion. 

Going
Concern 

The financial statements have been prepared assuming
that the Company will continue as a going concern. As discussed in Note 2 to the financial statements, the Company had incurred a net
loss of 94,157 during the year, had an accumulated deficit of 594,080 and negative operating cash flows of 59,529 as of December 31,
2022. These factors raise substantial doubt about its ability to continue as a going concern. Management s plans regarding those
matters also are described in Note 2. The financial statements do not include any adjustments that might result from the outcome of this
uncertainty. 

Critical
Audit Matters 

Critical
audit matters are matters arising from the current period audit of the financial statements that were communicated or required to be
communicated to those charged with governance that: (1) relate to accounts or disclosures that are material to the financial statements
and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgements. We determined that there are no critical matters.

ownership, and for which the Company does not have the ability to exercise
significant influence, using ASU 2016-01, Financial Instruments Overall: Recognition and Measurement of Financial Assets and
Financial Liabilities . The Company measure investments in equity securities without a readily determinable fair value using a measurement
alternative that measures these securities at the cost method minus impairment, if any, plus or minus changes resulting from observable
price changes on a non-recurring basis. Gains and losses on these securities are recognized in other income and expenses. At December
31, 2022, the Company had four investments in equity securities with carrying value of . At December 31, 2021, the Company had
five investments in equity securities with carrying value of (see Note 6). 

, suffered an accumulated deficit of and negative operating
cash flow of . These factors raise substantial doubt about the Company s ability to continue as a going concern within one
year of the date that the financial statements are issued. The financial statements do not include any adjustments that might be necessary
if the Company is unable to continue as a going concern. 

The
Company s ability to continue as a going concern is dependent upon improving its profitability and the continuing financial support
from its Chief Executive Officer cum shareholder. Management believes the existing shareholders or external financing will provide the additional cash to
meet the Company s obligations as they become due. No assurance can be given that any future financing, if needed, will be available
or, if available, that it will be on terms that are satisfactory to the Company. Even if the Company is able to obtain additional financing,
if needed, it may contain undue restrictions on its operations, in the case of debt financing, or cause substantial dilution for its
stockholders, in the case of equity financing.
