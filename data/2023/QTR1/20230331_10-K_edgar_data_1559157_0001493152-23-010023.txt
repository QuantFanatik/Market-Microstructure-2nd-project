1. Business 

Summary 

Sunstock,
Inc. Sunstock or the Company was incorporated on July 23, 2012, as Sandgate Acquisition Corporation, under
the laws of the State of Delaware to engage in any lawful corporate undertaking, including, but not limited to, selected mergers and
acquisitions. In July 2013, the Company implemented a change of control by issuing shares to new shareholders, redeeming shares of existing
shareholders, electing new officers and directors and accepting the resignations of its then existing officers and directors. In connection
with the change of control, the shareholders of the Company and its board of directors unanimously approved the change of the Company s
name from Sandgate Acquisition Corporation to Sunstock, Inc. On July 18, 2013, Jason Chang and Dr. Ramnik S Clair were named as directors
of the Company. 

On
October 22, 2018, Sunstock, Inc. acquired all assets and liabilities of Mom s Silver Shop, Inc. (the Retail Store located in Sacramento, California. 

The
Company s business plan includes the buying, selling and distribution of precious metals, primarily gold. The Company pursues a
 ground to coin strategy, whereby it seeks to acquire mining assets as well as rights to purchase mining production and
to sell these metals primarily through retail channels including their own branded coins. The Company emphasizes investment in enduring
assets that we believe may provide resource to retail conversion upside. Our goal is to provide our shareholders with an
exceptional opportunity to capture value in the precious metals sector without incurring many of the costs and risks associated with
actual mining operations.

The
Business: Precious Metals and Coins - Sunstock 

Silver
and other precious metals, may be used as an investment. A traditional way of investing in silver is by buying actual bullion bars. In
some countries, like Switzerland and Liechtenstein, bullion bars can be bought or sold over the counter at major banks. Another means
of buying and trading silver is through silver coins. Silver coins include the one ounce 99.99 pure Canadian Silver Maple Leaf and the
one ounce 99.93 pure American Silver Eagle. Likewise, an increasing popular method of trading in silver and precious metals is through
exchange-traded products, such as exchange-traded funds, exchange-traded notes and closed-end funds that aim to track the price of silver.
Silver exchange-traded products are traded on the major stock exchanges including the London and New York Stock Exchanges. 

Investors
typically look to precious metals as a safe and reliable store of value and as a way to protect their assets from the influence of inflation,
devaluation, and potential bond and equity market crashes. They act as safe haven investments, particularly in times of elevated political
and economic uncertainty. The flow of investment capital into commodity-related sectors has increased more than tenfold over the past
decade. Stable precious metal prices compared to increasing stock market volatility have elevated investments in precious metals to a
standalone asset class, forming part of almost all diversified asset portfolios. 

At
the present time, the Company does not anticipate or foresee a material effect on this line of its business from existing or probable
governmental regulations except as follows. The recent COVID-19 pandemic has resulted in many governments around the world enacting various
social distancing orders and directives, which have resulted in decreased foot traffic to many businesses, as well as accommodative fiscal
and monetary measures that have been viewed as inflationary by some markets, which has resulted in increased demand for physical precious
metals bullion and coins. This recent increased demand has occurred at the same time in supply constraints from mints and refiners as
a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. As a result, premiums on precious metal bullion and coins available for immediate delivery have recently
increased, affecting both our revenues and our ability to resupply our inventories of our precious metals. We expect price, demand and
supply volatility to continue as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic and the actions governments are taking to address it. 

Services
and Products 

The
Company has established positions in precious metals. As of December 31, 2022, the Company held 27,317 ounces of silver and 80 ounces
of gold. 

Competition 

The
Company s Retail Store has a number of small coin shop competitors in the Sacramento, California area, as well as online precious
metals dealer competitors such as monex.com and apmex.com. 

Sales
and Marketing Strategy 

The
Company s goal is to achieve vertical integration within the precious metal industry. To achieve this goal, the Company is investigating
the acquisition of mineral rights and assets to complement its already established precious metal business. We intend to first focus
on projects that already own significant amounts of unrefined but already mined gold ore and other precious metals.

3. Legal Proceedings 

On
August 21, 2020, Boustead Securities, LLC Boustead filed suit against Sunstock, Inc. Sunstock in the
County of Orange, California. Boustead is an investment banking firm engaged by Sunstock on September 19, 2019 to raise equity. Boustead
maintained that Sunstock owes it 87,179 shares of Preferred Stock Warrants and 9,231 shares of Common Stock Warrants. Boustead also sought
general damages, interest, and costs of the suit. Sunstock believed that Boustead had not fulfilled its obligations in raising equity
and vigorously contested the suit. Sunstock hired an arbitrator but there was no resolution between Sunstock and Boustead. The matter
went to trial in September 2021 and on November 2, 2021 the Court determined that Sunstock owed Boustead 260,308 for warrants issued
that Sunstock did not honor. 260,308 was accrued and is shown in operating expenses in the audited and consolidated statement of operations.
The warrants are no longer outstanding (see Note 10). All other monetary claims by Boustead were dismissed by the Court. The 260,308
is to be paid in cash. The Company filed an appeal of the judgment on December 9, 2021. There has been no change as of the date of this
report. 

In
December 2020, a former employee of Sunstock filed a claim with the California Labor Commission regarding claimed back pay owed. A preliminary
hearing was held on January 4, 2021 and the Company is currently awaiting the next step.

As
of December 31, 2022, there are 4,815,857 shares of common stock outstanding of which 3,386,509 shares are owned by officers and directors
of the Company. There are approximately 77 holders of our common stock. 

The
future sale of the Company s presently outstanding unregistered and restricted common stock by present
members of management and persons who own more than five percent of the Company s outstanding voting securities may have an adverse
effect on any established trading market that may develop in the shares of the Company s common stock. 

In
general, securities may be sold pursuant to Rule 144 after being fully-paid and held for more than 6 months. While affiliates of the
Company are subject to certain limits in the amount of restricted securities, they can sell under Rule 144, there are no such limitations
on sales by persons who are not affiliates of the Company. In the event non-affiliated holders elect to sell such shares in the public
market, there is likely to be a negative effect on the market price of the Company s securities. There is no dividend policy currently
in place. 

Recent
Sales of Unregistered Securities. 

During
the quarter ended December 31, 2022, we have issued 689,470 securities which were not registered under the Securities Act and not previously
disclosed in the Company s Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q or Current Reports on Form 8-K.

Overview 

You
should read the following discussion and analysis in conjunction with our Consolidated Financial Statements and related Notes thereto
included in Part II, Item 8 of this Report before deciding to purchase, hold or sell our common stock. 

Sunstock,
Inc. Sunstock or the Company was incorporated on July 23, 2012, as Sandgate Acquisition Corporation, under
the laws of the State of Delaware to engage in any lawful corporate undertaking, including, but not limited to, selected mergers and
acquisitions. In July 2013, the Company implemented a change of control by issuing shares to new shareholders, redeeming shares of existing
shareholders, electing new officers and directors and accepting the resignations of its then existing officers and directors. In connection
with the change of control, the shareholders of the Company and its board of directors unanimously approved the change of the Company s
name from Sandgate Acquisition Corporation to Sunstock, Inc. On July 18, 2013, Jason Chang and Dr. Ramnik S Clair were named as directors
of the Company. 

On
October 22, 2018, Sunstock, Inc. acquired all assets and liabilities of Mom s Silver Shop, Inc. (the Retail Store located in Sacramento, California. 

Critical
Accounting Policies 

The
consolidated financial statements of the Company have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the
United States. The preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires making estimates and judgments that affect the reported
amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses, and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. The estimates are
based on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results
of which form the basis of making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other
sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions. 

Revenue
Recognition 

The
Company s principal activities from which it generates revenue are product sales. Revenue is measured based on considerations specified
in a contract with a customer. A contract exists when it becomes a legally enforceable agreement with a customer. These contracts define
each party s rights, payment terms and other contractual terms and conditions of the sale. Consideration is typically paid at time
of sale via credit card, check, or cash when products are sold direct to consumers. 

A
performance obligation is a promise in a contract to transfer a distinct product to the customer, which for the Company is transfer of
a product to customers. Performance obligations promised in a contract are identified based on the goods that will be transferred to
the customer that are both capable of being distinct and are distinct in the context of the contract, whereby the transfer of the goods
is separately identifiable from other promises in the contract. The Company has concluded the sale of product and related shipping and
handling are accounted for as the single performance obligation. 

The
transaction price of a contract is allocated to each distinct performance obligation and recognized as revenue when or as the customer
receives the benefit of the performance obligation. The transaction price is determined based on the consideration to which the Company
will be entitled to receive in exchange for transferring goods to the customer. We do not issue refunds. 

The
Company recognizes revenue when it satisfies a performance obligation in a contract by transferring control over a product to a customer
when product is shipped based on fulfillment by the Company or when a point-of-sale transaction is completed. Taxes assessed by a governmental
authority that are both imposed on and concurrent with a specific revenue-producing transaction, that are collected by the Company from
a customer, are excluded from revenue. Shipping and handling costs associated with outbound freight after control over a product has
transferred to a customer are accounted for as a fulfillment cost and are included in cost of product sales. The Company does not accept
returns. 

7 

Stock-Based
Compensation: 

All
share-based payments are recognized in the consolidated financial statements based upon their fair values. 

The
Company recognizes stock-based compensation expense in accordance with the provisions of ASC 718, Compensation Stock Compensation
 ASC 718 ). ASC 718 requires the measurement and recognition of compensation expense for all stock-based awards made
to employees, directors and non-employees based on the grant date fair value of the awards. The measurement date for the fair value of
the equity instruments issued is determined at the earlier of (i) the date at which a commitment for performance by the consultant or
vendor is reached or (ii) the date at which the consultant or vendor s performance is complete. In the case of equity instruments
issued to consultants, the fair value of the equity instrument is primarily recognized over the term of the consulting agreement. In
accordance with FASB guidance, an asset acquired in exchange for the issuance of fully vested, non-forfeitable equity instruments should
not be presented or classified as an offset to equity on the grantor s balance sheet once the equity instrument is granted for
accounting purposes.

December 31, 2022, the Company used net cash of 273,164 in operations. During the year ended December 31, 2022, 259,657 in net cash
was provided by financing activities from notes payable from related parties. 

The
Company has not posted net income from inception. It has an accumulated deficit of 65,915,978 of December 31, 2022. Therefore, there
is substantial doubt about the Company s ability to continue as a going concern. The Company s continuation as a going concern
is dependent on its ability to generate sufficient cash flows from stockholders and/or third parties.

9. Changes in and Disagreements with Accountants on Accounting and Financial Disclosure 

On
February 15, 2022, the Board of Directors of Sunstock, Inc. Sunstock approved the engagement of Fruci Associates
II, PLLC as the Company s independent registered public accounting firm for the Company s fiscal year ended December 31,
2021, effective immediately. 

On
February 15, 2022, the audit practice of Macias Gini O Connell LLP MGO notified Sunstock, Inc. Sunstock that Sunstock no longer fit in with the future direction of MGO s practice and, therefore, that
Sunstock should seek another audit firm. There were no disagreements with MGO on any matter of accounting principles or practices,
financial statement disclosure or auditing scope or procedure. 

Item
9A. Controls and Procedures 

The
management of the Company is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting. Management
must evaluate its internal controls over financial reporting, as required by Sarbanes-Oxley Act, Section 404 (a). The Company s
internal control over financial reporting is a process designed under the supervision of the Company s Chief Executive Officer
and Chief Financial Officer to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of the
Company s financial statements for external purposes in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles or GAAP. 

As
of December 31, 2022, management assessed the effectiveness of the Company s internal control over financial reporting based on
the criteria for effective internal control over financial reporting established in the 2013 Internal Control Integrated Framework issued
by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission and SEC guidance on conducting such assessments. Based on that
evaluation, they concluded that, during the period covered by this report, such internal controls and procedures were not effective to
detect the inappropriate application of GAAP rules as more fully described below. This was due to deficiencies that existed in the design
or operation of the Company s internal controls over financial reporting that adversely affected its internal controls and that
may be considered to be material weaknesses. 

9 

Material
Weaknesses : 

A
material weakness is a deficiency, or a combination of deficiencies, in internal control over financial reporting, such that there is
a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of the company s annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented
or detected on a timely basis. 

The
material weaknesses identified are: 

1.
the Company does not have accounting personnel that have adequate technical accounting skills to identify terms in agreements that would
have material accounting implications on the Company s consolidated financial statements in accordance with US GAAP, such as permanent
vs. temporary equity treatment of the Company s preferred stock in accordance with ASC 480. 

2.
the Company does not obtain and retain supporting documentation over the precious metal trade dates and quantities traded and does not
properly record the realized gain/loss on the trade according to the fair market value of the items traded on a given date. 

3.
the Company has an inadequate number of personnel that could accurately and timely record and report the Company s consolidated
financial statements in accordance with US GAAP. 

4.
the Company does not perform formal risk assessments over financial reporting and does not evaluate its internal control processes. 

Notwithstanding
the existence of these material weaknesses in internal control over financial reporting, we believe that the financial statements in
this Annual Report on Form 10-K fairly present, in all material respects, our financial condition in conformity with U.S. generally accepted
accounting principles (GAAP). Further, we do not believe the material weaknesses identified had an impact on prior financial statements. 

Remediation: 

As
part of our ongoing remedial efforts, we have and will continue to, among other things: 

1.
Expand our accounting policy and controls organization by hiring qualified accounting and finance personnel; 

2.
Increase our efforts to educate both our existing and expanded accounting policy and control organization on the application of the internal
control structure; 

3.
Emphasize with management the importance of our internal control structure; 

4.
Seek outside consulting services where our existing accounting policy and control organization believes the complexity of the existing
exceeds our internal capabilities. 

5.
Plan to implement improved accounting systems. 

We
believe that the foregoing actions will improve our internal control over financial reporting, as well as our disclosure controls and
procedures. When funds permit, we intend to perform such procedures and commit such resources as necessary to continue to allow us to
overcome or mitigate these material weaknesses such that we can make timely and accurate quarterly and annual financial filings until
such time as those material weaknesses are fully addressed and remediated. 

Changes
in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting 

There
have been no changes in the Company s internal controls over financial reporting during its fourth fiscal quarter that have materially
affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, its internal control over financial reporting.

 Vice
 President, Director 

Management
of Sunstock 

The
Company has three employees and two consultants. Jason C. Chang and Dr. Ramnik S. Clair are the officers and directors of the Company
and shareholders. Mr. Chang, as president, and Mr. Clair as senior vice president, have allocated time to the activities of the Company
with minimal cash compensation. 

There
are no agreements or understandings for the officer or director to resign at the request of another person and the above- named officer
and director is not acting on behalf of nor will act at the direction of any other person. 

Set
forth below are the names of the directors and officers of the Company, all positions and offices with the Company held, the period during
which they have served as such, and the business experience during at least the last five years: 

Jason
C. Chang, serves as a director, Chief Executive Officer and President of Sunstock. Mr. Chang began his career in the hospitality industry
as a child and continuing as an adult working in the family business operating several hotels throughout California. Mr. Chang has now
had over 20 years of hospitality management experience. In addition, as an entrepreneur, Mr. Chang has helped fund numerous startup companies,
primarily related to the technology sector. 

Dr.
Ramnik Clair serves as a director and Senior Vice President of Sunstock. Dr. Clair received his medical degree in India and immigrated
to the United States in 1983. He completed his medical residency in New York and has subsequently served in his medical practice as a
solo practitioner. Dr. Clair intends to assist the Company in building long term relationships with its client base. 

Conflicts
of Interest 

Messrs.
Chang and Clair are not directors of, or sole beneficial shareholders of any other companies which have filed registration statements
on Form 10 for the registration of their common stock pursuant to the Securities Exchange Act. 

There
are no binding guidelines or procedures for resolving potential conflicts of interest. Failure by management to resolve conflicts of
interest in favor of the Company could result in liability of management to the Company. However, any attempt by shareholders to enforce
a liability of management to the Company would most likely be prohibitively expensive and time consuming. 

Code
of Ethics. The Company has not at this time adopted a Code of Ethics pursuant to rules described in Regulation S-K. The Company has two
persons who are the only shareholders and who serve as the directors and officers. The Company has limited operations and business actually
does not receive any revenues or investment capital. The adoption of an Ethical Code at this time would not serve the primary purpose
of such a code to provide a manner of conduct as the development, execution and enforcement of such a code would be by the same persons
and only persons to whom such code applied. Furthermore, because the Company does not have any activities, there are activities or transactions
which would be subject to this code. At the time the Company enters into a business combination or other corporate transaction, the current
officers and directors will recommend to any new management that such a code be adopted. The Company does not maintain an Internet website
on which to post a code of ethics.

Narrative
to Summary Compensation Table 

1. 

On
 July 18, 2013, Mr. Chang was appointed as a director, and Chief Executive Officer and President
 of the Company. 

2. 
 During the year ended December
 31, 2022, the Company issued 689,470 shares of common stock to our chief executive office in settlement of 406,787 of notes payable
 related party. 3,867,927 was recorded as stock issued below market. 

3. 
 During the year ended December 31, 2021, the Company
 issued 784,570 shares of common stock to our chief executive officer in settlement of 230,500 of notes payable and 4,870 accrued
 interest related party. 1,775,668 was recorded as stock issued below market. 

4. 
 On
 July 18, 2013, Dr. Clair was appointed as Senior Vice President and Director of the Company. 

No
retirement, pension, profit sharing, stock option or insurance programs or other similar programs have been adopted by the Company for
the benefit of its employees. 

The
Company currently does not compensate its directors with cash. 

12 

Corporate
Governance. 

For
reasons similar to those described above, the Company does not have a nominating, compensation nor audit committee of the board of directors.
At this time, the Company consists of two shareholders who serve as the corporate directors and officers. The Company has no activities,
and receives no revenues. At such time that the Company enters into a business combination and/or has additional shareholders and a larger
board of directors and commences activities, the Company will propose creating committees of its board of directors, including both a
nominating and an audit committee. Because there are only two shareholders of the Company, there is no established process by which shareholders
to the Company can nominate members to the Company s board of directors. Similarly, however, at such time as the Company has more
shareholders and an expanded board of directors, the new management of the Company may review and implement, as necessary, procedures
for shareholder nomination of members to the Company s board of directors. 

Compliance
with Section 16(A) of the Exchange Act 

Section
16(a) of the Exchange Act requires the Company s directors, executive officers and persons who beneficially own 10 or more of
a class of securities registered under Section 12 of the Exchange Act to file reports of beneficial ownership and changes in beneficial
ownership with the SEC. Directors, executive officers and greater than 10 stockholders are required by the rules and regulations of
the SEC to furnish the Company with copies of all reports filed by them in compliance with Section 16(a). 

Delinquent
Section 16(a) Reports 

Based
solely on our review of certain reports filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission pursuant to Section 16(a) of the Securities
Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, the reports required to be filed with respect to transactions in our common stock by each person who,
at any time during the 2021 and 2022 fiscal years, was a director, officer, or beneficial owner of more than 10 of our common stock,
were timely. 

Item
12. Security Ownership of Certain Beneficial Owners and Management and Related Stockholder Matters 

The
following table sets forth certain information regarding beneficial ownership of our common stock as of March 31, 2023, by (i) each
person known by us to be the beneficial owner of more than 5 of our outstanding Common Stock, (ii) each director and each of our
named executive officers and (iii) all executive officers and directors as a group. 

The
number of shares of Common Stock beneficially owned by each person is determined under the rules of the SEC and the information is not
necessarily indicative of beneficial ownership for any other purpose. Under such rules, beneficial ownership includes any shares as to
which such person has sole or shared voting power or investment power and also any shares which the individual has the right to acquire
within 60 days after the date hereof, through the exercise of any stock option, warrant or other right. Unless otherwise indicated, each
person has sole investment and voting power (or shares such power with his or her spouse) with respect to the shares set forth in the
following table. The inclusion herein of any shares deemed beneficially owned does not constitute an admission of beneficial ownership
of those shares.

During
the year ended December 31, 2022, the Company recorded compensation to its CEO for the following. 

During
 the year ended December 31, 2022, the Company s chief executive officer received 689,470 shares of common stock below market
 value in exchange for 406,787 in notes payable related party. 3,867,927 in stock issued below market was recorded in
 loss from settlement of debt with related party. 

During

 value in exchange for 235,371 in notes payable related party. 1,775,668 in stock issued below market was recorded in

Sunstock
is not currently required to maintain an independent director as defined by in Rule 4200 of the Nasdaq Capital Market nor does it anticipate
that it will be applying for listing of its securities on an exchange in which an independent directorship is required. It is likely
that neither Mr. Chang nor Dr. Clair would not be considered independent directors if it were to do so.

REPORT
OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM 

To
the Board of Directors and Shareholders of Sunstock, Inc. 

Opinion
on the Financial Statements 

We
have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Sunstock, Inc. the Company as of December 31, 2022 and 2021,
and the related consolidated statements of operations, convertible preferred stock and changes in stockholders equity, and cash
flows for each of the years in the two-year period ended December 31, 2022, and the related notes (collectively referred to as the financial
statements). In our opinion, the financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company
as of December 31, 2022 and 2021 and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the years in the two-year period ended
December 31, 2022, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. 

Going
Concern 

The
accompanying financial statements have been prepared assuming that the Company will continue as a going concern. As discussed in Note
2 to the financial statements, the Company has had insufficient cash flows from operations and has been unable to secure financing from
third parties. These factors, among others, raise substantial doubt about the Company s ability to continue as a going concern.
Management s plans in regard to these matters are also described in Note 2. The financial statements do not include any adjustments
that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty. 

Basis
for Opinion 

These
financial statements are the responsibility of the Company s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company s
financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board
(United States) (PCAOB) and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities
laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. 

We
conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain
reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. The Company
is not required to have, nor were we engaged to perform, an audit of its internal control over financial reporting. As part of our audits,
we are required to obtain an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion
on the effectiveness of the Company s internal control over financial reporting. Accordingly, we express no such opinion. 

Our
audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error
or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding
the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant
estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe that our audits
provide a reasonable basis for our opinion. 

Critical
Audit Matters 

The
critical audit matters communicated below are matters arising from the current period audit of the financial statements that were communicated
or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that: (1) relate to accounts or disclosures that are material to the financial
statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of critical audit matters
does not alter in any way our opinion on the financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit
matters below, providing separate opinions on the critical audit matters or on the accounts or disclosures to which they relate. 

Identification
and evaluation of related party transactions and disclosures 

As
discussed in Note 6 to the consolidated financial statements, Jason C. Chang, the Chief Executive Officer, Chief Financial Officer and
Director, is the majority beneficial owner of the Company and a related party. Historically, the Company has entered into numerous transactions
with Mr. Chang, including various debt and equity agreements. We identified the identification and evaluation of related party transactions
and disclosures as a critical audit matter. Auditor judgment was involved in assessing the sufficiency of the procedures performed to
identify related parties, and related party transactions and disclosures. 

The
following are the primary procedures we performed to address this critical audit matter. 

Evaluated
 debt and equity transactions between the Company and the related party; 

Analyzed
 cash activity for additional months throughout the year for large, unusual, or nonrecurring
 transactions that may not have been identified as related party; 

Reviewed
 confirmation with stock transfer agent for all related party common and preferred stock outstanding
 at December 31, 2022; 

Evaluated
 the price at which common stock was issued to the related party for the settlement of debt
 during the year ended December 31, 2022 and obtained the fair market value of the common
 stock from an independent source; 

/s/

We
 have served as the Company s auditor since 2022.

NOTE
1 - NATURE OF OPERATIONS AND SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (CONTINUED) 

at December 31, 2022 compared to at December 31, 2021. 

At
each balance sheet date, the Company evaluates its ending inventory quantities on hand and on order and records a provision for excess
quantities and obsolescence. Among other factors, the Company considers historical demand and forecasted demand in relation to the inventory
on hand, competitiveness of product offerings, market conditions and product life cycles when determining obsolescence and net realizable
value. In addition, the Company considers changes in the market value of components in determining the net realizable value of its inventory.
Provisions are made to reduce excess or obsolete inventories to their estimated net realizable values. Once established, write-downs
are considered permanent adjustments to the cost basis of the excess or obsolete inventories. 

of gold and silver bullion and bullion coins and
 at December 31, 2021 and are acquired and initially recorded at fair market value. The fair market value of the bullion and
bullion coins is comprised of two components: 1) published market values attributable to the costs of the raw precious metal, and 2)
a published premium paid at acquisition of the metal. The premium is attributable to the additional value of the product in its finished
goods form and the market value attributable solely to the premium may be readily determined, as it is published by multiple reputable
sources such as Kitco and Apmex. The Company s inventory is subsequently recorded at fair market values on a quarterly basis. The
fair value of the inventory is determined using pricing and data derived from the markets on which the underlying commodities are traded.
Precious metals commodities inventories are classified in Level 1 of the valuation hierarchy as defined later in this section. The Company
has continuously experienced a shortage of cash and has had significantly past due obligations. While the Company s preference
is to hold the silver and gold bullion to achieve long-term gains, the bullion is available to pay current obligations should the Company
not be able to raise cash through issuance of stock or notes payable. Thus, the Company believes that including the silver bullion in
current assets under inventory is appropriate. 

The
change in fair value of the precious metals was included in the financial statements herein as recorded on the Company s Statements
of Operations as an unrealized gain in precious metal of for the year ended December 31, 2022 and an unrealized loss of 
for the year ended December 31, 2021. 

to years.
Any leasehold improvements are amortized at the lesser of the useful life of the asset or the lease term. 

impairment charges were incurred during the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021. There can be no assurance, however, that market
conditions will not change or demand for the Company s services will continue, which could result in impairment of long-lived assets
in the future.

NOTE

reverse split of its common shares (see Note 10). 

as of December 31, 2022. The Company s
continuation as a going concern is dependent on its ability to generate sufficient cash flows from operations to meet its obligations,
which it has not been able to accomplish to date, and /or obtain additional financing from its stockholders and/or other third parties.
Therefore, there is substantial doubt about the Company s ability to continue as a going concern. 

These
audited and consolidated financial statements have been prepared on a going concern basis, which implies the Company will continue is
dependent upon financial support from its stockholders, the ability of the Company to obtain necessary equity financing to continue operations,
successfully locating and negotiate with a entity for the combination of that target company with the Company. 

There
is no assurance that the Company will ever be profitable. The audited and consolidated financial statements do not include any adjustments
to reflect the possible future effects on the recoverability and classification of assets or the amounts and classifications of liabilities
that may result should the Company be unable to continue as a going concern. 

In
the first quarter of 2020, outstanding convertible notes payable balances as of December 31, 2019, were either converted to common stock
or paid off. In relation to that, the Company had discussions with a third party in regards to raising funds through a private placement
of equity. Those discussions with that third party have since been terminated. The Company intends to initiate discussions with an undetermined
third party in regards to raising funds through a private placement of equity which, if it occurs, will provide the Company with funds
to expand its operations and likely eliminate the going concern issue.

COVID
19 

The
full impact of the COVID-19 outbreak continues to evolve as of the date of this report. Management is actively monitoring the global
situation on its financial condition, liquidity operations, suppliers, industry, and workforce. Given the daily evolution of the COVID-19
outbreak and the global responses to curb its spread, the Company is not able to estimate the effects of the COVID-19 outbreak on its
results of operations, financial condition or liquidity for the fiscal year 2023. However, to date there has not been a decrease in sales.
The Company believes that in this time of uncertainty, individuals are buying collectible coins as a safe haven. The Company is unable
to predict if such buying will continue during this time of uncertainty or if the buying will decrease as events change and evolve.

On
August 21, 2020, Boustead Securities, LLC Boustead filed suit against Sunstock, Inc. Sunstock in the
County of Orange, California. Boustead is an investment banking firm engaged by Sunstock on September 19, 2019 to raise equity. Boustead
