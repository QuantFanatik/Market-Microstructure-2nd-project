PART I 
 Item 1. Business 
 Overview 
 USCB Financial Holdings, Inc., 
a Florida corporation (the Company ), was formed on December 17, 2021, to serve as 
 the holding company for U.S. Century Bank, a Florida state-chartered bank (the Bank ), and is a bank holding company (a 
 BHC 
registered 
with 
the 
Board 
of 
Governors 
of 
the 
Federal 
Reserve 
System 
(the Federal 
Reserve 
under 
the 
Bank 
 Holding Company Act 
of 1956, as 
amended (the BHC Act ). 
The Company is 
headquartered in Miami, Florida, 
and, through 
 the Bank, its sole 
subsidiary, operates 10 banking centers in South Florida providing a wide 
range of personal and business 
 banking products and services. As of December 31, 2022, 
the Company had total consolidated assets of 2.1 billion. 
 The Bank commenced operations 
on October 28, 2002 and 
is a Florida state-chartered, non-Federal 
Reserve System 
 member bank. Over the course 
of 2021, the Bank 
simplified its capitalization structure 
by exchanging and/or repurchasing 
 all of 
its issued 
and outstanding 
preferred shares, 
including Class 
C, Class 
D, and 
Class E 
preferred stock. 
In December 
 2021, the 
Bank reached agreements 
with holders 
of its 
Class B 
common stock, to 
exchange all 
outstanding Class B 
common 
 stock for Class A common stock in a 1-for-5 stock 
exchange. 
 On July 27, 
2021, the Bank 
completed an initial 
public offering of 4,600,000 
shares of its 
Class A common stock. 
Shares 
 of the Bank s Class A 
common stock were sold 
at a price to 
the public of 10.00 
per share and began 
trading on the Nasdaq 
 Stock Market under ticker symbol USCB . 

 On December 
30, 2021 
(the 
 Effective 
Date ), 
the Company 
acquired 
all of 
the 
issued 
and 
outstanding 
stock 
of 
the 
 Bank in a 
share exchange 
(the Reorganization 
effected under 
the Florida 
Business Corporation 
Act and 
in accordance 
 with the 
terms of an 
Agreement and Plan 
of Share Exchange 
dated December 27, 
2021 between the 
Bank and 
the Company 
 (the Share Exchange Agreement ). The Reorganization and 
the Share Exchange Agreement were approved 
by the Bank s 
 stockholders at a special meeting of the Bank s stockholders held on December 20, 
2021. Pursuant to the Share Exchange 
 Agreement, on the Effective 
Date each issued and 
outstanding share of the 
Bank s Class A common 
stock was converted 
 into and exchanged 
for one share 
of the Company s Class 
A common stock. 
As a result, 
the Bank became the 
wholly owned 
 subsidiary 
of 
the 
Company, 
the 
Company 
became 
the 
holding 
company 
for 
the 
Bank 
and 
the 
stockholders 
of 
the 
Bank 
 became stockholders of the Company. 
 Prior 
the 
Effective 
Date, 
the 
Bank s 
Class 
A 
common 
stock 
was 
registered 
under 
Section 
12(b) 
of 
the 
Securities 
 Exchange Act of 1934 (the Exchange 
Act ), and the Bank was subject to 
the information requirements of the Exchange 
Act 
 and, in 
accordance with Section 
12(i) thereof, filed 
quarterly reports, proxy 
statements and other 
information with the 
Federal 
 Deposit Insurance Corporation FDIC ). 
As a result of the Reorg 
anization, pursuant to Rule 
12g-3(a) under the Exchange 
 Act, the Company became the successor registrant to the Bank, the Company s Class A common stock was deemed to be 
 registered under Section 12(b) 
of the Exchange Act, 
and the Company became 
subject to the information 
requirements of 
 the Exchange Act and 
is now required to 
file reports, proxy statements 
and other information with 
the U. S. Securities 
and 
 Exchange Commission SEC ). The 
trading symbol 
for the 
Company s 
Class A 
Common Stock 
is USCB , 
which is 
the 
 same as the Bank s former trading symbol. 
 Prior to 
the Reorganization, 
the Company 
had no material 
assets and 
had not conducted 
any business 
or operations 
 except for activities related to its incorporation and the 
Reorganization. 
 Our strategy 
in becoming 
a publicly 
traded company 
and forming 
a BHC 
was to continue 
pursuing organic 
growth as 
 well as strategic acquisitions if the opportunity arises, 
which efforts will be further facilitated by access 
to public capital and 
 the added flexibility provided by a holding company structure. 
 In this Annual Report on Form 10-K, unless the context indicated otherwise, references to we, us, , and our refer to 
 the Company and the Bank, 
as the contest dictates. However, if the discussion 
relates to a period before 
the Effective Date, 
 the terms refer only to the Bank.

 Credit Practices 
 Our underwriting process is informed by a conservative credit culture 
that encourages prudent lending. We 
believe our 
 strong asset quality 
is due 
to our understanding 
of and experience 
with businesses within 
Florida, 
in particular South 
Florida, 
 our 
long-standing 
relationships 
with 
clients 
and 
our 
disciplined 
underwriting 
processes. 
Our 
thorough 
underwriting 
 processes 
collaboratively 
engage 
our 
seasoned 
business 
bankers, 
credit 
underwriters 
and 
portfolio 
managers 
in 
the 
 analysis of each loan request. 

 We manage our credit risk by analyzing metrics related 
to our different lines of business, which allows us to 
maintain a 
 conservative 
and 
well-diversified 
loan portfolio 
reflective 
of 
our assessment 
of 
various industry 
sectors. 
Based 
upon our 
 aggregate exposure to any given borrower relationship, we undertake 
a scaled review of loan originations that may involve 
 senior credit officers, our Chief Credit Officer, 
our Credit Committee or, ultimately, 
our Board of Directors Board ). 
 Deposit Products 
 We 
offer 
traditional deposit 
products including 
commercial 
and consumer 
checking accounts, 
money market 
deposit 
 accounts, savings accounts and certificates of deposit with a 
variety of terms and rates as well

 commercial payments and cash 
management services. Additionally,

Seasonality 
 We do not believe our business to be seasonal 
in nature. 
 Markets 
 Our primary banking market is South 
Florida. Due to the recent 
acceptance and expected ongoing emphasis on remote 
 work, coupled 
with a 
low tax 
environment, warm 
weather and 
a strong 
real estate 
market has 
encouraged companies 
to 
 relocate some or all of their 
operations to South Florida. We 
believe this trend is further demonstrated 
by recent relocation 
 initiatives undertaken by large financial institutions such as Blackstone Group Inc., Goldman Sachs Group Inc., and Citadel 
 Advisors 
LLC, 
all 
of 
which 
have 
established 
operations 
in 
South 
Florida. 
We 
believe 
Florida 
offers 
long-term 
attractive 
 banking opportunities. 
Our largest concentration is in the Miami metropolitan statistical area; however, we are also focused 
 on growth in other urban Florida markets in which we 
have a presence, such as Broward and Palm Beach counties 
. 

 According to the 2020 
United States Census Bureau, 
Florida was the third most 
populous state in the country 
and the 
 three 
largest 
population 
centers 
were 
in 
Miami-Dade, 
Broward, 
and 
Palm 
Beach 
counties, 
all 
located 
in 
South 
Florida. 
 According to estimates 
from the 
United States Census 
Bureau, from 
2010 to 2021, 
Florida s population 
increased to 21.8 
 million residents 
, 
an increase 
of 3.0 
million new 
residents. 
The percentage 
change 
in Florida s 
population between 
April 
 2020 and July 2021 alone was 1.1 according to the 
United States Census Bureau. 

 Competition 
 Our markets are highly competitive, 
and we compete with a wide range of lenders and other financial institutions within 
 our markets, 
including local, 
regional, 
national, 
and international 
commercial 
banks 
and credit 
unions. We 
also compete 
 with mortgage companies, brokerage 
firms, trust service providers, consumer 
finance companies, mutual funds, 
securities 
 firms, 
insurance 
companies, 
third-party 
payment 
processors, 
financial 
technology 
companies, 
or 
Fintechs, 
and 
other 
 financial intermediaries on various 
of our products and 
services. Some of our competitors 
are not subject to the 
regulatory 
 restrictions 
and 
the 
level 
of 
regulatory 
supervision 
applicable 
to 
us. 
Many 
of 
our 
competitors 
are 
much 
larger 
financial 
 institutions that have greater financial 
resources than we do 
and compete aggressively for market 
share. These competitors 
 attempt to gain market share through their financial product 
mix, pricing strategies and larger banking center networks. 
 Interest rates 
on both 
loans and 
deposits and 
prices of 
fee-based services 
are significant 
competitive factors 
among 
 financial 
institutions 
generally. 
Other 
important 
competitive 
factors 
include 
convenience, 
quality 
of 
customer 
service, 
 availability and quality of digital offerings, community 
reputation, and continuity of personnel and services. 

 Emerging Growth Company 
 We are an emerging growth 
company, or 
 EGC , as defined in the Jumpstart 
Our Business Startups Act of 2012 (the 
 JOBS Act ). As such, we are eligible to take advantage of certain exemptions from various reporting requirements that are 
 applicable 
to 
other 
public 
companies 
that 
are 
not 
 emerging 
growth 
companies, 
including, 
but 
not 
limited 
to, 
not 
being 
 required to comply with the auditor 
attestation requirements of Section 
404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, 
reduced disclosure 
 obligations 
regarding 
executive 
compensation 
in 
our 
periodic 
reports 
and 
proxy 
statements, 
and 
exemptions 
from 
the 
 requirements of 
holding a 
non-binding advisory 
vote on 
executive compensation 
and shareholder 
approval of 
any golden 
 parachute payments not previously approved. 
 In addition, 
Section 
107 
of 
the 
JOBS 
Act 
also 
provides 
that 
an 
EGC can 
take 
advantage 
of 
the 
extended 
transition 
 period provided 
in Section 
7(a)(2)(B) of 
the Securities 
Act of 
1933, as 
amended (the 
 Securities Act ), 
for complying 
with 
 new or revised accounting standards. In other 
words, an EGC can delay the adoption of 
certain accounting standards until 
 those standards would otherwise apply to private 
companies. We intend to take 
advantage of the benefits of this extended 
 transition period, for as long as it is available. 

 Human Capital Resources 
 We respect the values 
and diversity throughout our organization 
and the community. Diversity and inclusion are integral 
 parts of 
our organization s 
culture. We 
seek the active 
engagement and 
participation of 
people with 
diverse backgrounds 
 and 
ethnicities. 
We 
are 
taking 
steps 
to 
create 
programs 
to 
ensure 
that 
we 
are 
organized 
in 
a 
way 
where 
the 
unique 
 contributions of each individual in our Company is 
recognized and supported. Each team member is to be 
treated fairly with 
 equal access to opportunities and resources for success. Additionally, 
we run homebuyer educational and financial literacy 
 workshops in an effort 
to reach the financing 
needs of the 
sectors of our 
communities in which 
these workshops are 
most 
 needed.

At December 31, 2022, 
we had 191 full 
-time equivalent employees. 
None of our 
employees are parties 
to a collective 
 bargaining agreement. We believe that our employees are our greatest asset and vital to our success. As such, we seek to 
 hire and retain the best 
candidate for each position, without regard to 
age, gender, ethnicity, or other protected class status, 
 but 
with 
an 
appreciation 
for 
a 
diversity 
of 
perspectives 
and 
experiences. 
We 
have 
designed 
a 
compensation 
structure 
 including an array of benefit plans and programs 
that we believe is attractive to our current and prospective employees. 
 Regulation and Supervision 
 Bank 
holding 
companies, 
banks, 
and 
their 
affiliates 
are 
extensively 
regulated 
under 
federal 
and 
state 
law. 
These 
 regulations have a material 
effect on the operations 
of USCB Financial Holdings, 
Inc. and its 
direct and indirect subsidiaries, 
 including U.S. Century Bank. 
 Statutes, regulations and 
regulatory policies limit 
the activities in 
which we 
may engage and 
the conduct of 
our permitted 
 activities and establish capital requirements with which we must comply. The regulatory framework 
is intended primarily for 
 the 
protection 
of 
depositors, 
borrowers, 
customers 
and 
clients, 
the 
Federal 
Deposit 
Insurance 
Corporation FDIC 
 insurance funds 
and the 
banking system 
as a 
whole, and 
not for 
the protection 
of our 
shareholders or 
creditors. In 
many 
 cases, the applicable regulatory 
authorities have broad enforcement 
power over bank holding 
companies, banks and their 
 subsidiaries, including the power to impose substantial fines 
and other penalties for violations of laws and regulations. 

 Further, 
the 
regulatory 
system 
imposes 
reporting 
and 
information 
collection 
obligations. 
Banking 
statutes 
and 
 regulations are subject 
to change, 
and additional statutes, 
regulations, and corresponding 
guidance may 
be adopted. We 
 are unable to predict these future changes or the effects, if any, that these changes could have on the business, prospects, 
 revenues, and results of operations of our Bank and Company. 
 The material 
statutory and 
regulatory requirements 
that are 
applicable to 
us are 
summarized below. 
The description 
 below is not 
intended to summarize 
all laws and 
regulations applicable to us. 
These summary descriptions are 
not complete, 
 and you should refer to the full text of the statutes, regulations, 
and corresponding guidance for more information. 
 Bank and Bank Holding Company Regulation 
 As 
a 
Florida 
state 
bank, 
U.S. 
Century 
Bank 
is 
subject 
to 
ongoing 
and 
comprehensive 
supervision, 
regulation, 
 examination, and enforcement by the FDIC and the Florida Office 
of Financial Regulation FOFR ). The FOFR supervises 
 and regulates 
all areas 
of our 
operations including, 
without limitation, 
the making 
of loans, 
the issuance 
of securities, 
the 
 conduct 
of 
our 
corporate 
affairs, 
the 
satisfaction 
of 
capital 
adequacy 
requirements, 
the 
payment 
of 
dividends, 
and 
the 
 establishment or closing 
of banking centers. 
In addition, our 
deposit accounts 
are insured 
by the Deposit 
Insurance Fund 
 administered by the FDIC to the maximum extent permitted by law, and the FDIC has certain supervisory 
and enforcement 
 powers over us. 
 Any entity 
that directly 
or indirectly 
controls a 
bank must 
be approved 
by the 
Federal Reserve 
Board under 
the Bank 
 Holding 
Company 
Act 
of 
1956 
(the 
 BHC 
Act 
to 
become 
a 
bank 
holding 
company. 
BHCs 
are 
subject 
to 
regulation, 
 inspection, 
examination, 
supervision 
and 
enforcement 
by 
the 
Federal 
Reserve 
Board 
under 
the 
BHC 
Act. 
The 
Federal 
 Reserve Board's jurisdiction also extends to any company 
that is directly or indirectly controlled by a BHC. 
 USCB Financial 
Holdings, 
Inc, which 
controls 
U.S. Century 
Bank, 
is a 
BHC and, 
as such, 
is subject 
to ongoing 
and 
 comprehensive supervision, regulation, examination and 
enforcement by the Federal Reserve Board. 
 Notice and Approval Requirements Related to Control 
 Banking 
laws 
impose 
notice, 
approval, 
and 
ongoing 
regulatory 
requirements 
on 
any shareholder 
or 
other 
party 
that 
 seeks to acquire direct 
or indirect "control" 
of an FDIC-insured 
depository institution. These 
laws include the 
BHC Act and 
 the Change in Bank Control Act. Among other things, 
these laws require regulatory filings by individuals 
or companies that 
 seek to 
acquire direct or 
indirect "control" of 
an FDIC-insured depository 
institution. The determination 
of whether an 
investor 
 "controls" a depository 
institution is based 
on all of 
the facts and 
circumstances surrounding 
the investment. 
As a general 
 matter, a party 
is deemed to control 
a depository institution or 
other company if the 
party owns or controls 
25 or more of 
 any class of voting stock. Subject to rebuttal, a party may be presumed 
to control a depository institution or other company 
 if the investor owns or controls 10 
or more of any class of voting 
stock (and the entity s securities are registered under the 
 Exchange 
Act 
or, 
if 
not, 
the 
investor 
would 
be 
the 
largest 
shareholder). 
Except 
under 
limited 
circumstances, 
BHCs 
are 
 prohibited from acquiring, without prior approval, 
control of any other bank 
or BHC or substantially all the assets 
thereof or 
 more than 5 of the voting shares of a bank or BHC 
which is not already a subsidiary.

Source of Strength 
 All companies, including BHCs, that directly 
or indirectly control an insured depository 
institution, are required to serve 
 as a 
source 
of 
strength 
for 
the 
institution. 
Under 
this 
requirement, 
USCB 
Financial 
Holdings, 
Inc. 
in 
the 
future 
could 
be 
 required to provide financial assistance 
to U.S. Century Bank should 
it experience financial distress. 
Such support may be 
 required at times when, 
absent this statutory and 
Federal Reserve Policy 
requirement, a BHC 
may not be 
inclined to provide 
 it. 
 Safety and Soundness Regulation 
 As an insured depository 
institution, we are subject to 
prudential regulation and supervision 
and must undergo regular 
 on-site examinations by our state and federal banking agencies. The cost of examinations of insured depository institutions 
 and any affiliates are assessed 
by the appropriate agency against 
each institution or affiliate that 
is subject to examination 
 as it deems 
necessary or appropriate. 
We file 
quarterly consolidated 
reports of 
condition and income, 
or call reports, 
with 
 the FDIC and FOFR. 
 The federal banking 
agencies have also 
adopted guidelines establishing safety 
and soundness standards for 
all insured 
 depository institutions including 
the Bank. The safety 
and soundness guidelines 
relate to, among other 
things, our internal 
 controls, information systems, internal audit systems, loan underwriting and documentation, anti-money laundering policies 
 and 
procedures, 
transactions 
with 
insiders, 
risk 
management, 
compensation, 
asset 
growth, 
and 
interest 
rate 
exposure. 
 These 
standards 
assist 
the 
federal 
banking 
agencies 
with 
early 
identification 
and 
resolution 
of 
problems 
at 
insured 
 depository institutions. 
If we 
were to fail 
to meet or 
otherwise comply 
with any of 
these standards, the 
FDIC could require 
 us 
to 
submit 
a 
plan 
for 
achieving 
and 
maintaining 
compliance. 
If 
a 
financial 
institution 
fails 
to 
submit 
an 
acceptable 
 compliance plan, or fails 
in any material respect 
to implement a compliance 
plan that has been 
accepted by the FDIC, 
the 
 FDIC is 
required to 
issue an 
order directing 
the institution 
to cure 
the deficiency. 
Until the 
deficiency cited 
in the 
order is 
 cured, the FDIC 
may restrict the 
financial institution s 
rate of growth, 
require the financial 
institution to increase 
its capital, 
 restrict the rates the institution pays on 
deposits or require the institution to take any 
action the regulator deems appropriate 
 under the circumstances. Noncompliance with the standards established by the safety and soundness guidelines may also 
 constitute grounds 
for other 
enforcement action, 
including cease 
and desist 
orders and civil 
money penalty 
assessments. 
 In 
addition, 
the 
FDIC 
could 
terminate 
our 
deposit 
insurance 
if 
it 
determines 
that 
our 
financial 
condition 
was 
unsafe 
or 
 unsound or that we engaged in unsafe or unsound practices that violated applicable rules, regulations, orders or conditions 
 enacted or imposed on us by our regulators. 
 During 
the 
past 
decade, 
the 
bank 
regulatory 
agencies 
have 
increasingly 
emphasized 
the 
importance 
of 
sound 
risk 
 management processes and 
strong internal 
controls when 
evaluating the 
activities of 
the financial 
institutions they 
supervise. 
 Properly managing risks has been identified as critical to the conduct of safe and sound banking activities and has become 
 even more 
important as 
new technologies, product 
innovation and 
the size 
and speed 
of financial 
transactions have 
changed 
 the nature of 
banking markets. The 
agencies have identified 
a spectrum 
of risks facing 
a banking institution 
including, but 
 not limited 
to, credit, 
market, liquidity, interest rate, 
cybersecurity, operational, legal and 
reputational risk. In 
particular, recent 
 regulatory pronouncements 
have focused 
on operational 
risk, which 
arises from 
the potential that 
inadequate information 
 systems, 
operational problems, 
breaches in 
internal 
controls, fraud 
or unforeseen 
catastrophes 
will result 
in unexpected 
 losses. New 
products and 
services, use 
of outside 
vendors and 
cybersecurity are 
critical sources 
of operational 
risk that 
 financial institutions 
are expected 
to address 
in the 
current environment. 
We 
have active 
Board and 
senior management 
 oversight 
policies, 
procedures 
and 
risk 
limits; 
adequate 
risk 
measurement 
and 
monitoring 
and 
adequate 
management 
 information systems; and comprehensive internal controls 
to address these various risks. 
 Permissible Activities and Investments 
 Banking 
laws 
generally 
restrict 
the 
ability 
of 
USCB 
Financial 
Holdings, 
Inc. 
to 
engage 
in 
activities 
other 
than 
those 
 determined by the 
Federal Reserve Board 
to be 
so closely 
related to banking 
as to be 
a proper incident 
thereto. The Gramm-
 Leach-Bliley Act (the GLB Act expanded the scope of permissible activities for a BHC that qualifies as a financial holding 
 company. Under the regulations implementing the GLB Act, a financial 
holding company may engage in additional 
activities 
 that are 
financial 
in nature 
or incidental 
or complementary 
to a 
financial 
activity. 
USCB Financial 
Holdings, 
Inc., is 
not a 
 financial holding company. 
 In addition, as 
a general matter, the establishment or 
acquisition by USCB Financial 
Holdings, Inc., of a 
non-bank entity, 
 or 
the 
initiation 
of 
a 
non-banking 
activity, 
requires 
prior 
regulatory 
approval. 
In 
approving 
acquisitions 
or 
the 
addition 
of 
 activities, the Federal Reserve Board considers, among other things, whether the acquisition or the additional activities can 
 reasonably be expected 
to produce benefits 
to the public, such 
as greater convenience, 
increased competition or 
gains in 
 efficiency, 
that 
outweigh 
such 
possible 
adverse 
effects 
as 
undue 
concentration 
of 
resources, 
decreased 
or 
unfair 
 competition, conflicts of interest or unsound banking practices.

Regulatory Capital Requirements 
 The federal banking 
regulators have adopted 
risk-based capital 
adequacy guidelines for 
bank holding companies 
and 
 their subsidiary banks and 
banks without bank holding 
companies based on the 
Basel III standards. 
Under these guidelines, 
 assets and off-balance sheet items are assigned to specific risk categories, each with designated risk weightings. The risk-
 based capital guidelines are designed to make regulatory 
capital requirements more sensitive to differences 
in risk profiles 
 among banks and bank holding 
companies, to account for off-balance sheet 
exposure, to minimize disincentives for holding 
 liquid assets, and 
to achieve greater 
consistency in 
evaluating the 
capital adequacy 
of major 
banks throughout the 
world. 
 The resulting 
capital ratio requirements 
represent capital as 
a percentage of 
total risk-weighted assets 
and off-balance sheet 
 items. Final 
rules implementing the 
capital adequacy guidelines 
became effective, with 
various phase-in periods, 
on January 
 1, 2015 
for 
community 
banks 
such 
as us. 
All 
of 
the 
rules 
were 
fully 
phased 
in 
as of 
January 
1, 
2019. 
These 
final 
rules 
 represent a significant change to the prior general risk-based capital rules and are 
designed to substantially conform to the 
 Basel III international standards. 
 In computing 
total risk-weighted 
assets, bank 
and bank 
holding company 
assets are 
given risk-weights 
of 0 , 
20 , 
 50 , 100 
and 150 . 
In addition, 
certain 
off-balance 
sheet items 
are given 
similar 
credit conversion 
factors 
to convert 
 them to asset 
equivalent amounts 
to which an 
appropriate risk-weight 
will apply. 
Most loans will 
be assigned to 
the 100 
 risk 
category, 
except 
for 
performing 
first 
mortgage 
loans 
fully 
secured 
by 1-to 
-4 
family or 
certain 
multi-family 
residential 
 properties, which carry 
a 50 
risk rating. Most 
investment securities (including, 
primarily, general obligation claims on 
states 
 or 
other 
political 
subdivisions 
of 
the 
United 
States) 
will 
be 
assigned 
to 
the 
20 
category, 
except 
for 
municipal 
or 
state 
 revenue bonds, which have a 50 risk-weight, 
and direct obligations of the U.S. 
Treasury or obligations backed 
by the full 
 faith 
and 
credit 
of 
the 
U.S. 
government, 
which 
have 
a 
0 
risk-weight. 
In 
covering 
off-balance 
sheet 
items, 
direct 
credit 
 substitutes, 
including 
general 
guarantees 
and 
standby 
letters 
of 
credit 
backing 
financial 
obligations, 
are 
given 
a 
100 
 conversion 
factor. 
Transaction-related 
contingencies 
such 
as 
bid 
bonds, 
standby 
letters 
of 
credit 
backing 
nonfinancial 
 obligations, 
and undrawn 
commitments 
(including commercial 
credit lines 
with 
an initial 
maturity 
of more 
than one 
year) 
 have 
a 
50 
conversion 
factor. 
Short-term 
commercial 
letters 
of 
credit 
are 
converted 
at 
20 
and 
certain 
short-term 
 unconditionally cancelable commitments have a 0 factor. 
 Under 
the 
final 
rules, 
minimum 
requirements 
increased 
for 
both 
the 
quality 
and 
quantity 
of 
capital 
held 
by 
banking 
 organizations. In this respect, the final rules 
implement strict eligibility criteria for regulatory capital instruments and improve 
 the methodology for 
calculating risk-weighted 
assets to enhance 
risk sensitivity. 
Consistent with the 
international Basel III 
 framework, the rules include a new 
minimum ratio of Common 
Equity Tier 1 Capital to Risk 
-Weighted Assets of 4.5 . The 
 rules also create a Common Equity Tier 1 Capital conservation 
buffer of 2.5 of risk-weighted assets. This 
buffer is added 
 to each of the three risk-based capital 
ratios to determine whether an institution 
has established the buffer. 
The rules raise 
 the minimum ratio of Tier 1 Capital to Risk-Weighted Assets from 4 to 6 and 
include a minimum leverage ratio of 4 for 
 all banking 
organizations. If 
a financial 
institution s 
capital conservation 
buffer 
falls below 
2.5 
e.g., if 
the institution s 
 Common 
Equity Tier 
1 Capital 
to Risk 
-Weighted 
Assets is 
less than 
7.0 
then capital 
distributions 
and 
discretionary 
 payments 
will 
be 
limited 
or 
prohibited 
based 
on 
the 
size 
of 
the 
institution s 
conservation 
buffer. 
The 
types 
of 
payments 
 subject to this limitation include 
dividends, share buybacks, discretionary payments on 
Tier 1 instruments, and discretionary 
 bonus payments. 
 The 
capital 
regulations 
may 
also 
impact 
the 
treatment 
of 
accumulated 
other 
comprehensive 
income, 
or, 
AOCI, 
for 
 regulatory capital purposes. Under 
the rules, AOCI generally 
flows through to regulatory 
capital, however, community banks 
 and their holding companies (if any) were allowed to make a 
one-time irrevocable opt-out election to continue to treat AOCI 
 the same 
as under 
the old 
regulations for 
regulatory capital 
purposes. This 
election was 
required to 
be made 
on the 
first 
 call report 
filed after 
January 1, 
2015. We 
made the 
opt-out election. 
Additionally, 
the rules 
also permit 
community banks 
 with less than 
 15 billion in 
total assets to 
continue to count 
certain non-qualifying 
capital instruments 
issued prior to 
May 
 19, 2010 as Tier 1 capital, including trust preferred securities 
and cumulative perpetual preferred stock (subject to a limit of 
 25 of Tier 1 capital). However, non-qualifying 
capital instruments issued on or after May 19, 2010 do not qualify for Tier 1 
 capital treatment. 
 On September 17, 2019, the 
federal banking agencies jointly finalized 
a rule intended to simplify 
the regulatory capital 
 requirements described above for qualifying community banking organizations 
that opt into the Community Bank Leverage 
 Ratio, or 
CBLR, 
framework, 
as required 
by Section 
201 of 
the Regulatory 
Relief 
Act. The 
final rule 
became 
effective 
on 
 January 1, 
2020, 
and the 
CBLR framework 
became 
available for 
banks 
to use 
beginning 
with their 
March 
31, 2020 
call 
 reports. Under 
the final 
rule, if 
a qualifying 
community banking 
organization opts 
into the 
CBLR framework 
and meets 
all 
 requirements under the 
framework, it will 
be considered to 
have met the 
well-capitalized ratio requirements 
under the 
prompt 
 corrective action regulations described elsewhere 
in this Form 10-K 
and will not be 
required to report or

consolidated assets, and trading assets and 
liabilities of 5 or less of total consolidated 
assets. However, Section 
4012 of 
 the Coronavirus Aid, 
Relief and Economic 
Security Act (the 
 CARES Act required 
that the CBLR 
be temporarily lowered 
 to 8 . The federal regulators issued a 
rule implementing the lower CBLR effective April 23, 2020. The 
rule also established 
 a two-quarter grace period for a qualifying institution whose leverage ratio falls below the 8 CBLR requirement so long as 
 the 
bank 
maintains 
a 
leverage 
ratio 
of 
7 
or 
greater. 
Another 
rule 
was 
issued 
to 
transition 
back 
to 
the 
9 
CBLR 
by 
 increasing the ratio to 8.5 
for calendar year 2021 and 
9 thereafter. Although the Bank is a 
qualifying community banking 
 organization, the Bank has elected 
not to opt in to the CBLR framework 
at this time and will continue to follow 
the Basel III 
 capital requirements as described above. 
 As of 
December 31, 
2022 
and 
2021, the 
Bank 
qualified 
as a 
 well capitalized 
institution.

 Regulatory 
 Matters of the Consolidated Financial Statements 
included in this Annual Report Form 10-K for further details. 
 Prompt Corrective Action 
 Under the Federal 
Deposit Insurance Act FDIA ), the 
federal bank regulatory 
agencies must 
take "prompt corrective 
 action" 
against 
undercapitalized 
U.S. 
depository 
institutions. 
The 
capital-based 
regulatory 
framework 
contains 
five 
 categories 
of 
compliance 
with 
regulatory 
capital 
requirements, 
including 
"well 
capitalized," 
"adequately 
capitalized," 
 "undercapitalized," 
"significantly 
undercapitalized," 
and 
"critically 
undercapitalized," 
and 
are 
subjected 
to 
differential 
 regulation corresponding to the capital category within which the 
institution falls. 

 As of December 
31, 2021, a 
depository institution 
was deemed to 
be "well capitalized" 
if the banking 
institution had 
a 
 total risk-based 
capital 
ratio 
of 
10.0 
or greater, 
a tier 
1 risk-based 
capital 
ratio 
of 
8.0 
or 
greater, 
a 
CET1 
risk-based 
 capital 
ratio 
of 
6.5 
and 
a 
leverage 
ratio 
of 
5.0 
or 
greater, 
and 
the 
institution 
was 
not 
subject 
to 
an 
order, 
written 
 agreement, 
capital 
directive, 
or 
prompt 
corrective 
action 
directive 
to 
meet 
and 
maintain 
a 
specific 
level 
for 
any 
capital 
 measure. 
Under 
certain 
circumstances, 
a 
well-capitalized, 
adequately 
capitalized 
or 
undercapitalized 
institution 
may 
be 
 treated as 
if the 
institution were 
in the 
next lower 
capital category 
if it s 
determined 
that the 
institution is 
in an 
unsafe or 
 unsound condition or 
is engaging in 
an unsafe or 
unsound practice. The 
degree of regulatory 
scrutiny of a 
financial institution 
 will 
increase, 
and 
the 
permissible 
activities 
of 
the 
institution 
will 
decrease, 
as 
it 
moves 
downward 
through 
the 
capital 
 categories. 
A 
banking 
institution 
that 
is 
undercapitalized 
is required 
to 
submit 
a 
capital restoration 
plan. 
Failure 
to 
meet 
 capital guidelines 
could subject 
the institution 
to a 
variety of 
enforcement 
remedies by 
federal bank 
regulatory agencies, 
 including: termination 
of deposit insurance 
by the FDIC, 
restrictions on certain 
business activities, and 
appointment of 
the 
 FDIC as conservator or receiver. 
 Commercial Real Estate Concentration Guidelines 
 The federal 
banking regulators 
have implemented 
guidelines to 
address increased 
concentrations in 
commercial real 
 estate 
loans. 
These 
guidelines 
describe 
the 
criteria 
regulatory 
agencies 
will 
use 
as 
indicators 
to 
identify 
institutions 
 potentially 
exposed 
to 
commercial 
real 
estate 
concentration 
risk. 
An 
institution 
that 
has 
(i) 
experienced 
rapid 
growth 
in 
 commercial real 
estate lending, 
(ii) notable 
exposure to 
a specific 
type of 
commercial real 
estate, (iii) 
total reported 
loans 
 for construction, land development, 
and other land representing 
100 or more of 
total capital, or (iv) total 
commercial real 
 estate 
(including 
construction) 
loans 
representing 
300 
or 
more 
of 
total 
capital 
and 
the 
outstanding 
balance 
of 
the 
 institution s 
commercial 
real estate 
portfolio has 
increased 
by 50 
or more 
in the 
prior 36 
months, 
may be 
identified for 
 further supervisory analysis of a potential concentration 
risk. 
 As of December 
31, 2022, our 
ratio of construction 
loans to total 
risk-based capital 
was 27 , and 
therefore, we 
were 
 under 
the 
100 
threshold 
set 
forth 
in 
clause 
(iii) 
in 
the 
paragraph 
above. 
However, 
with 
respect 
to 
clause 
(iv) 
in 
the 
 paragraph above, as 
of December 
31, 2022, our 
ratio of total 
commercial real 
estate loans 
to total 
risk-based capital 
was 
 390 and the outstanding balance of 
the institution s commercial real estate portfolio increased by 50 
or more in the prior 
 36 months. 
As a 
result, we 
are deemed 
to have 
a concentration 
in commercial 
real estate 
lending under 
applicable regulatory 
 guidelines. 

 If a 
concentration is 
present, under 
the federal 
banking regulator 
guidance, management 
should employ 
heightened 
 risk management practices that address key elements, 
including board and management oversight and strategic 
planning, 
 portfolio management, 
development 
of underwriting 
standards, 
risk 
assessment and 
monitoring 
through 
market analysis 
 and stress 
testing, and 
maintenance of 
increased capital 
levels as 
needed to 
support the 
level of 
commercial real 
estate 
 lending. 
To address the commercial real estate lending concentration, 
USCB Financial Holdings has 
previously established 
 a commercial 
real estate 
lending framework 
to monitor 
specific exposures 
and limits 
by types 
within the 
commercial real 
 estate 
portfolio, 
including, 
among 
other 
things, 
annual 
stress 
testing 
of 
the 
commercial 
real 
estate 
portfolio, 
and 
takes 
 appropriate actions, as necessary.

Payment of Dividends 
 The ability of 
the board of 
directors of an 
insured depository 
institution to declare 
a cash dividend 
or other distribution 
 with respect to capital 
is subject to statutory 
and regulatory restrictions 
that limit the 
amount available for 
such distribution 
 depending 
upon 
earnings, 
financial 
condition 
and 
cash 
needs 
of 
the 
institution, 
as 
well 
as 
general 
business 
conditions. 
 Insured depository institutions are also prohibited from 
paying management fees to any controlling persons 
or, with certain 
 limited exceptions, 
making 
capital distributions, 
including dividends, 
if after 
such transaction 
the institution 
would be 
less 
 than 
adequately 
capitalized. 
We 
may 
generally 
declare 
a 
dividend 
from 
retained 
net 
profits 
which 
accrued 
prior 
to 
the 
 preceding two years, but we must, before the declaration of a dividend on our common stock, under applicable Florida law, 
 carry 20 of our net profits for such preceding period as is 
covered by the dividend to our surplus fund, until the same shall 
 at least equal the amount of our common stock and preferred stock, if 
any, then issued and outstanding. Under Florida law, 
 we are prohibited 
from declaring 
a dividend 
at any time 
at which 
our net 
income from 
the current 
year combined 
with the 
 retained net 
income 
from 
the preceding 
two 
years is 
a loss 
or which 
would cause 
our capital 
accounts 
to fall 
below the 
 minimum amount required by law, 
regulation, order, or 
any written agreement with a state or federal regulatory agency.
 In addition, 
because 
we are 
a BHC, 
we are 
dependent 
upon the 
payment 
of dividends 
by the 
Bank 
as our 
principal 
 source of funds 
to pay dividends 
in the future, 
if any, 
and to make 
other payments. It 
is the policy 
of the Federal 
Reserve 
 Board that BHCs 
should pay cash 
dividends on common 
stock only out 
of income available 
over the past 
year and only 
if 
 prospective earnings retention 
is consistent with 
the organization s expected future 
needs and 
financial condition. The 
policy 
 provides that BHCs should not maintain a level of cash dividends that undermines the BHC s ability to serve as a source of 
 strength to its banking subsidiaries. 
 Incentive Compensation 
 Guidelines adopted by 
the federal banking 
agencies pursuant to 
the FDIA 
prohibit excessive compensation 
as an 
unsafe 
 and 
unsound 
practice 
and 
describe 
compensation 
as 
excessive 
when 
the 
amounts 
paid 
are 
unreasonable 
or 
 disproportionate to the services performed by an executive 
officer, employee, director 
or principal shareholder. 
 In June 2010, 
the federal banking 
agencies jointly 
adopted the 
Guidance on Sound 
Incentive Compensation 
Policies, 
 or GSICP. 
The GSICP intended to 
ensure that banking organizations 
do not undermine the 
safety and soundness of 
such 
 organizations 
by 
encouraging 
excessive 
risk-taking. 
This 
guidance, 
which 
covers 
all 
employees 
that 
have 
the 
ability 
to 
 expose the 
organization 
to material 
amounts of 
risk, either 
individually or 
as part 
of a 
group, is 
based upon 
a set 
of key 
 principles relating to 
a banking organization s 
incentive compensation arrangements. 
Specifically, 
incentive compensation 
 arrangements should (i) 
provide employee incentives 
that appropriately balance risk 
in a manner that does 
not encourage 
 employees to expose their 
organizations to imprudent risk, 
(ii) be compatible with effective 
controls and risk management, 
 and (iii) be supported by 
strong corporate governance, 
including active and effective 
oversight by the organization s 
board 
 of directors. Any deficiencies in our compensation practices 
could lead to supervisory or enforcement actions 
by the FDIC. 
 The 
Dodd-Frank 
Act 
requires 
the 
federal 
banking 
agencies 
and 
the 
SEC 
to 
establish 
joint 
regulations 
or 
guidelines 
 prohibiting incentive-based 
payment arrangements 
at specified regulated 
entities, such 
as us, 
having at least 
 1 billion in 
 total 
assets 
that 
encourage 
inappropriate 
risk-taking 
by 
providing 
an 
executive 
officer, 
employee, 
director 
or 
principal 
 shareholder 
with 
excessive 
compensation, 
fees, 
or 
benefits 
or 
that 
could 
lead 
to 
material 
financial 
loss 
to 
the 
entity. 
In 
 addition, these regulators must establish regulations or guidelines requiring enhanced disclosure to regulators of incentive-
 based compensation 
arrangements. The 
federal banking 
agencies proposed 
such regulations 
in April 
2011 
and issued 
a 
 second proposed 
rule in 
April 2016. 
The second 
proposed rule 
would apply to 
all banks, 
among other 
institutions, with 
at 
 least 1 billion in average total 
consolidated assets. Final regulations have not been adopted as 
of the date of this Form 10-
 K. 
If 
adopted, 
these 
or 
other 
similar 
regulations 
would 
impose 
limitations 
on 
the 
manner 
in 
which 
we 
may 
structure 
 compensation for our executives and other 
employees that go beyond the requirements 
of GSICP. 
The scope and content 
 of the 
federal banking 
agencies policies 
on incentive 
compensation are 
continuing 
to develop 
and are 
likely to 
continue 
 evolving, but the timeframe for finalization of such policies 
is not known at this time. 
 Limits on Transactions with Affiliates and 
Insiders 
 Insured depository institutions are subject to restrictions 
on their ability to conduct transactions 
with affiliates and other 
 related parties. Section 23A of the Federal Reserve Act imposes quantitative limits, qualitative requirements, 
and collateral 
 requirements on certain transactions by 
an insured depository institution with, 
or for the benefit 
of, its affiliates. Transactions 
 covered by Section 23A include loans, 
extensions of credit, investment 
in securities issued by an affiliate, 
and acquisitions 
 of assets from 
an affiliate. Section 
23B of the 
Federal Reserve 
Act requires that 
most types of 
transactions by 
an insured 
 depository 
institution 
with, 
or 
for 
the 
benefit 
of, 
an 
affiliate 
be 
on 
terms 
at 
least 
as 
favorable 
to 
the 
insured 
depository 
 institution as if the transaction were conducted with an 
unaffiliated third party.

 FDIC Deposit Insurance 
 The FDIC is 
an independent 
federal agency 
that insures the 
deposits of federally 
insured depository 
institutions up 
to 
 applicable limits. The FDIC also has certain regulatory, 
examination and enforcement powers with respect to FDIC-insured 
 institutions. 
The 
deposits 
are 
insured 
by 
the 
FDIC 
up 
to 
applicable 
limits. 
As 
a 
general 
matter, 
the 
maximum 
deposit 
 insurance amount is 250 thousand per depositor. 
 Additionally, FDIC 
-insured depository institutions are required 
to pay deposit insurance assessments 
to the FDIC. The 
 amount of 
a particular 
institution's deposit 
insurance assessment 
is based 
on that 
institution's risk 
classification under 
an 
 FDIC risk-based assessment system. An institution's 
risk classification is assigned based on 
its capital levels and the level 
 of supervisory concern the institution poses to the regulators. 
 Under the current 
system, deposit 
insurance assessments 
are based 
on a bank s 
assessment base, 
which is defined 
 as average total assets minus 
average tangible equity. 
For established small institutions, 
such as the Bank, the 
FDIC sets 
 deposit 
assessment 
rates 
based 
on 
the 
Financial 
Ratios 
Method, 
which 
takes 
into 
account 
several 
ratios 
that 
reflect 
 leverage, asset quality, 
and earnings at 
each individual institution 
and then applies 
a pricing multiplier that 
is the same 
for 
 all institutions. An 
institution s rate must 
be within a 
certain minimum and 
a certain maximum, 
and the range varies 
based 
 on the 
institution s 
composite CAMELS 
rating. The 
deposit insurance 
assessment 
is calculated 
by multiplying 
the bank s 
 assessment base by the total base assessment 
rate. 
 In October 
2022, the 
FDIC finalized 
a rule 
that will 
increase the 
initial base 
deposit insurance 
assessment rates 
by 2 
 basis points, beginning 
with the first quarterly 
assessment period of 
2023 (January 1, 
2023 through March 
31, 2023). The 
 FDIC, as required 
under the Federal 
Deposit Insurance 
Act, established 
a plan in 
September 2020 to 
restore the Deposit 
 Insurance Fund DIF reserve ratio to meet or exceed 
the statutory minimum of 1.35 percent within eight 
years. This plan 
 did not 
include an 
increase in 
the deposit 
insurance assessment 
rate. Based 
on the 
FDIC s recent 
projections, however, 
 the FDIC determined that the DIF reserve 
ratio is at risk of not reaching 
the statutory minimum by the statutory 
deadline of 
 September 30, 2028 without increasing 
the deposit insurance assessment rates. The 
increased assessment would improve 
 the likelihood 
that the 
DIF reserve 
ratio would 
reach the 
required minimum 
by the 
statutory deadline, 
consistent 
with the 
 FDIC s Amended Restoration 
Plan. The FDIC also 
concurrently maintained the 
Designated Reserve Ratio DDR for the 
 DIF at 2 percent for 2023. The new assessment rate 
schedules will remain in effect unless and until the reserve ratio meets 
 or exceeds 2 percent 
in order to support 
growth in the DIF 
in progressing toward 
the FDIC s long-term 
goal of a 2 percent 
 DRR. Progressively lower assessment 
rate schedules will take effect 
when the reserve ratio reaches 
2 percent, and again 
 when it reaches 
2.5 percent. The 
revised assessment 
rate schedule will remain 
in effect unless 
and until the 
reserve ratio 
 meets or exceeds 2 percent, absent further action by the FDIC. 
 Under the 
FDIA, the 
FDIC may 
terminate deposit 
insurance upon 
a finding 
that the 
institution has 
engaged in 
unsafe 
 and unsound 
practices, 
is in 
an unsafe 
or unsound 
condition 
to continue 
operations, 
or has 
violated any 
applicable 
law, 
 regulation, rule, order, or condition 
imposed by the FDIC. 
 Depositor Preference 
 The FDIA provides 
that, in the 
event of the 
"liquidation or other 
resolution" of an 
insured depository institution, the 
claims 
 of depositors 
of the institution 
(including the 
claims of 
the FDIC as 
subrogee of 
insured depositors) 
and certain 
claims for 
 administrative 
expenses 
of 
the 
FDIC 
as 
a 
receiver 
will 
have 
priority 
over 
other 
general 
unsecured 
claims 
against 
the 
 institution. Insured and 
uninsured depositors, 
along with the 
FDIC, will have 
priority in payment 
ahead of unsecured, 
non-
 deposit creditors, 
including U.S. 
Century Bank, 
with respect 
to any 
extensions of 
credit they 
have made 
to such 
insured 
 depository institution.

Overdraft Fee Regulation 
 The Electronic Fund Transfer Act prohibits 
financial institutions from charging consumers 
fees for paying overdrafts on 
 automated teller machines, or 
ATMs, 
and one-time debit card transactions, 
unless a consumer consents, 
or opts in, to the 
 overdraft service for those types 
of transactions. If a consumer does 
not opt in, any 
ATM transaction or debit that overdraws 
 the consumer s 
account will 
be denied. Overdrafts 
on the payment 
of checks 
and regular electronic 
bill payments 
are not 
 covered 
by 
this 
new 
rule. 
Before 
opting 
in, 
the 
consumer 
must 
be 
provided 
with 
a 
notice 
that 
explains 
the 
financial 
 institution s 
overdraft 
services, 
including 
the 
fees 
associated 
with 
the 
service, 
and 
the 
consumer s 
choices. 
Financial 
 institutions 
must 
provide consumers 
who do 
not 
opt 
in 
with 
the 
same 
account 
terms, 
conditions 
and 
features 
(including 
 pricing) that they provide to consumers who do opt in.

of 
account 
relationships 
to 
guard 
 against money laundering 
and to report transactions 
that meet certain 
dollar amount thresholds 
as well as 
any suspicious 
 transactions. Recent laws, 
such as 
the USA PATRIOT Act, enacted in 
2001 and renewed 
through 2019, as 
described below, 
 provide law enforcement authorities with increased access 
to financial information maintained by banks. 

 Anti-money laundering 
obligations have 
been substantially 
strengthened 
as a 
result of 
the USA 
PATRIOT 
Act. Bank 
 regulators routinely examine institutions for compliance with these obligations, and this area has become a particular focus 
 of 
the 
regulators 
in 
recent 
years. 
In 
addition, 
the 
regulators 
are 
required 
to 
consider 
compliance 
in 
connection 
with 
the 
 regulatory 
review 
of 
certain 
applications. 
In 
recent 
years, 
regulators 
have 
expressed 
concern 
over 
banking 
institutions 
 compliance 
with 
anti-money 
laundering 
requirements 
and, 
in 
some 
cases, 
have 
delayed 
approval 
of 
their 
expansionary 
 proposals. The regulators and other 
governmental authorities have 
been active in imposing 
 cease and desist orders 
and 
 significant money penalty sanctions against institutions 
found to be in violation of the anti-money laundering regulations. 
 USA PATRIOT 
Act 
 The USA PATRIOT Act became effective on October 26, 2001 and amended 
the BSA. The USA PATRIOT Act requires 
 banks to establish anti-money laundering programs 
that include, at a minimum: 
 
a bank 
compliance 
program 
that contains 
internal 
policies, 
procedures 
and 
controls 
designed 
to 
implement 
and 
 maintain the 
bank s compliance 
with all 
of the 
requirements 
of the 
USA PATRIOT 
Act, the 
BSA and 
related laws 
 and regulations; 
bank wide 
systems 
and procedures 
for monitoring 
and reporting 
of suspicious 
transactions 
and 
 activities; 
 
a designated compliance officer; 
 
employee training for bank employees; 
 
an independent audit function to test the efficacy 
of the bank s anti-money laundering program; 
 
procedures to verify the identity of each bank customer upon 
the opening of accounts; 
 
heightened due diligence policies, 
procedures and controls applicable to 
certain foreign accounts and 
relationships; 
 and

required reports to law enforcement and/or financial regulators to assist in the deterrence and prevention of money 
 laundering activities. 
 Additionally, 
the USA PATRIOT 
Act requires each financial 
institution to develop a 
customer identification program, 
or 
 CIP, as part of its anti-money 
laundering program. The key 
components of the 
CIP are identification 
verification, government 
 list comparison, 
notice and 
record retention. 
The purpose 
of the 
CIP is 
to enable 
the financial 
institution to 
determine the 
 true identity 
and anticipated 
account activity 
of each 
customer. 
To 
make this 
determination, the 
financial institution 
must, 
 among other things, collect certain information from customers at the time they enter 
into the customer relationship with the 
 financial institution. 
This information must 
be verified 
within a 
reasonable time. Furthermore, 
all customers 
must be 
screened 
 against any CIP-related government lists of known or suspected terrorists or other sanctioned persons. On May 11, 2018, 
 the U.S. Treasury s 
Financial Crimes Enforcement 
Network, or FinCEN, issued 
a final rule under 
the BSA requiring 
banks 
 to identify and verify the 
identity of the natural persons behind 
their customers that are legal entities the beneficial owners. 
 We 
and 
our 
affiliates 
have 
adopted 
policies, 
procedures 
and 
controls 
designed 
to 
comply 
with 
the 
BSA 
and 
the 
USA 
 PATRIOT 
Act. 
 The Office of Foreign Assets Control 
 The Office of Foreign Assets Control (the OFAC 
is responsible for helping to ensure that U.S. entities do not engage 
 in transactions with 
 enemies of 
the United States, 
as defined by 
various Executive Orders 
and Acts of 
Congress. OFAC 
 publishes lists of 
names of 
persons and organizations 
suspected of aiding, 
harboring or 
engaging in terrorist 
acts; owned 
 or 
controlled 
by, 
or 
acting 
on 
behalf 
of 
target 
countries; 
and 
narcotics 
traffickers. 
Such 
persons 
are 
referred 
to 
as 
 sanctioned persons. 

 If a bank 
finds a name on 
any transaction, account 
or wire transfer 
that is on an 
OFAC list, 
it must freeze 
the account 
 and/or block the transaction or wire transfer. We utilize an outside vendor to oversee 
the inspection of our accounts and the 
 filing of any notifications. 
We also monitor 
high-risk OFAC 
areas such as new 
accounts, wire transfers 
and customer files. 
 These checks are performed using software that is updated each time 
a modification is made to the lists provided by 
OFAC 
 and other agencies of Specially Designated Nationals 
and Blocked Persons. 
 Consumer Laws and Regulations 
 Our activities 
are subject 
to a 
variety of 
federal and 
state statutes 
and regulations 
designed to 
protect consumers 
in 
 transactions with 
banks. Interest 
and other 
charges collected 
or contracted 
for by 
us are 
subject to 
state usury 
laws and 
 federal laws concerning interest rates. Our loan 
operations are also subject to federal laws 
applicable to credit transactions, 
 such as: 
 
the 
Truth-In-Lending 
Act, 
or 
TILA, 
and 
Regulation 
Z, 
governing 
disclosures 
of 
credit 
and 
servicing 
terms 
to 
 consumer borrowers and including substantial new requirements for mortgage lending and servicing, as mandated 
 by the Dodd-Frank Act 
 
the Home Mortgage Disclosure Act of 1975 and Regulation C, requiring 
financial institutions to provide information 
 to enable the 
public and public 
officials to 
determine whether 
a financial institution 
is fulfilling its 
obligation to help 
 meet the housing needs of the communities they serve; 
 
the Equal Credit 
Opportunity Act and 
Regulation B, prohibiting 
discrimination on the 
basis of race, 
color, religion, 
 or other prohibited factors in extending credit; 
 
the Fair 
Credit Reporting Act 
of 1978, 
as amended by 
the Fair 
and Accurate Credit 
Transactions Act, and Regulation 
 V, as well as the rules and 
regulations of the FDIC governing the 
use and provision of information 
to credit reporting 
 agencies, certain identity theft protections and certain 
credit and other disclosures; 
 
the Fair 
Debt Collection 
Practices Act 
and Regulation 
F, 
governing the 
manner in 
which consumer 
debts may 
be 
 collected by collection agencies; and 
 
the Real Estate Settlement Procedures Act, or RESPA, and Regulation X, which governs aspects of the settlement 
 process for residential mortgage loans. 
 Our deposit operations are also subject to federal laws, 
such as: 
 
the FDIA, which, among other things, limits the amount of 
deposit insurance available per account to 250,000 and 
 imposes other limits on deposit-taking; 
 
the Right to 
Financial Privacy Act, 
which imposes a 
duty to 
maintain the confidentiality 
of consumer financial 
records 
 and prescribes procedures for complying with administrative subpoenas 
of financial records; 
 
the Electronic 
Funds Transfer 
Act and 
Regulation E, 
which governs 
automatic 
deposits to 
and withdrawals 
from 
 deposit accounts 
and customers 
rights and 
liabilities arising 
from 
the use 
of ATMs 
and other 
electronic 
banking 
 services; and 

Table of Contents 

15 
USCB Financial Holdings, Inc. 
2022 10-K 

the Truth 
in Savings 
Act and 
Regulation DD, 
which requires 
depository institutions 
to provide 
disclosures so 
that 
 consumers can make meaningful comparisons about depository 
institutions and accounts. 
 These 
laws 
and 
regulations 
mandate 
certain 
disclosure 
requirements 
and 
regulate 
the 
manner 
in 
which 
financial 
 institutions must deal with clients when 
taking deposits or making loans to 
such clients. We must comply with the applicable 
 provisions of these consumer protection laws and regulations as part of both 
our ongoing client relations and our regulatory 
 compliance obligations. 
 Financial Privacy and Cybersecurity 
 Banking organizations 
are 
subject to 
many federal 
and state 
laws and 
regulations 
governing the 
collection, 
use and 
 protection 
of 
customer 
information. Under 
the 
privacy 
protection 
provisions 
of 
the 
Gramm-Leach-Bliley 
Act 
of 
1999 and 
 related regulations, 
we are 
limited in 
our ability 
to disclose 
non-public 
information 
about consumers 
to nonaffiliated 
third 
 parties. These limitations require disclosure of privacy policies to 
consumers and, in some circumstances, allow consumers 
 to prevent disclosure 
of certain personal 
information to a 
nonaffiliated third 
party. 
Federal banking agencies, 
including the 
 FDIC, have adopted 
guidelines for establishing information 
security standards and cybersecurity 
programs for implementing 
 safeguards. 
These 
guidelines, 
along 
with 
related 
regulatory 
materials, 
increasingly 
focus 
on 
risk 
management 
and 
 processes related to information technology and the use 
of third parties in the provision of financial services. 
 In addition to federal laws and regulations, we are subject 
to state laws governing customer privacy and cybersecurity. 
 The Florida Information Protection Act of 2014 Florida Act requires notification of the 
Florida Department of Legal Affairs 
 of any breach involving 
personal information that 
affects more than 
500 people as 
well as requiring notification 
of affected 
 individuals of 
a breach. 
The Florida 
Act also 
requires us to 
take reasonable measures 
to protect 
and secure 
data in 
electronic 
 form containing personal information and take all reasonable measures to dispose, or arrange for the disposal, of 
customer 
 records containing 
personal information 
within our 
custody or 
control when 
the records 
are no 
longer to 
be retained. 
We 
 incur 
significant 
costs 
and 
expenses 
in 
order 
to 
address 
compliance 
with 
the 
federal 
and 
state 
customer 
privacy 
and 
 cybersecurity laws and regulations, and we expect such 
costs and expenses will continue into the future. 
 Consumer Financial Protection Bureau 
 The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau CFPB is 
an independent regulatory authority housed within the Federal 
 Reserve Board. The CFPB has broad authority to regulate the offering and provision of consumer 
financial products and to 
 prevent institutions subject to its authority from engaging in unfair 
and deceptive or abusive acts or practices with respect 
 to their 
offering of consumer 
financial products or 
services. The CFPB 
has the 
authority to 
supervise and examine 
depository 
 institutions with more than 
 10 billion in assets for 
compliance with federal consumer 
laws. The authority to supervise 
and 
 examine depository 
institutions with 
 10 billion or 
less in assets, 
such as the 
Bank, for 
compliance with federal 
consumer 
 laws remains largely with those institutions primary 
federal regulators. However, the CFPB may participate in examinations 
 of these smaller institutions 
on a sampling basis 
and may refer potential 
enforcement actions against 
such institutions to 
 their primary regulators. 
As such, the 
CFPB may participate 
in examinations of 
the Bank. In 
addition, states are 
permitted 
 to adopt consumer 
protection laws and 
regulations that are stricter 
than the regulations promulgated 
by the CFPB, 
and state 
 attorneys general are permitted to enforce consumer 
protection rules adopted by the CFPB against certain institutions. 
 The Volcker Rule 
 The Dodd-Frank Act 
prohibits (subject to 
certain exceptions) us 
and our 
affiliates from engaging 
in short term 
proprietary 
 trading in securities and derivatives and from 
investing in and sponsoring certain investment companies defined 
in the rule 
 as covered 
funds (including 
not only 
hedge funds, 
commodity pools 
and private 
equity funds, 
but also 
a range 
of asset 
 securitization structures 
that do not 
meet exemptive 
criteria in the 
final rules). This 
statutory provision 
is commonly 
called 
 the Volcker Rule. At December 31, 2022, we are not 
subject to the Volcker Rule because of our asset 
size, which is below 
 the 10.0 billion Volcker 
Rule threshold. 
 Community Reinvestment Act and Fair Lending Requirements 
 As 
previously 
noted, 
we 
are 
subject 
to 
certain 
fair 
lending 
requirements 
and 
reporting 
obligations 
involving 
home 
 mortgage 
lending 
operations. 
We 
are 
also 
subject 
to 
certain 
requirements 
and 
reporting 
obligations 
under 
the 
federal 
 Community Reinvestment Act CRA ). 
The CRA and 
its corresponding regulations are 
intended to encourage banks 
to help 
 meet the credit needs of 
the communities they serve, 
including low- 
and moderate-income neighborhoods, 
consistent with 
 safe and sound banking practices. 

 Accordingly, 
the 
CRA 
generally 
requires 
federal 
banking 
agencies 
to 
evaluate 
the 
record 
of 
a 
financial 
institution 
in 
 meeting applicable 
CRA requirements. 
The CRA 
further requires 
the agencies 
to take 
into account our 
record of 
meeting 

Table of Contents

2022 10-K 

community 
credit 
needs 
when 
evaluating 
applications 
for, 
among 
other 
things, 
new 
branches 
or 
mergers. 
We 
are 
also 
 subject to analogous state CRA requirements 
in Florida and certain other states 
in which we may establish branch 
offices. 
 In 
connection 
with 
their 
assessments 
of 
CRA 
performance, 
the 
FDIC 
and 
FOFR 
assign 
a 
rating 
of 
 outstanding, 
 satisfactory, 
 needs to 
improve, or 
 substantial 
noncompliance. We 
received a 
 satisfactory CRA 
Assessment 
Rating 
 from 
both regulatory 
agencies 
in our 
most 
recent CRA 
examinations. 
In addition 
to substantive 
penalties 
and corrective 
 measures that may 
be required for 
a violation of 
certain fair lending 
laws, the federal 
banking agencies may 
take compliance 
 with such 
laws and 
CRA into 
account when 
regulating and 
supervising other 
activities of 
the bank, 
including in 
acting on 
 expansionary proposals such as when a bank submits 
an application to establish bank branches, merge with 
another bank, 
 or acquire 
the assets 
and assume 
the liabilities 
of another 
bank. An 
unsatisfactory 
CRA and/or 
fair lending 
record could 
 substantially delay 
or block 
any such 
transaction. The 
regulatory agency's 
assessment of 
the institution's 
record is 
made 
 available to the 
public at 
www.ffiec.gov/craratings. 
Following its most 
recent CRA performance 
evaluation in March 
2020, 
 U.S. Century Bank received an overall rating of "Satisfactory." 
 Call Reports and Examination Cycle 
 All institutions, regardless of size, submit 
a quarterly call report that includes 
data used by federal banking agencies 
to 
 monitor the condition, performance, and 
risk profile of individual institutions 
and the industry as a 
whole. In June 2019, the 
 federal banking agencies issued a 
final rule to permit insured depository 
institutions with total assets of 
less than 5 billion 
 that 
do 
not 
engage 
in 
certain 
complex 
or international 
activities 
to 
file 
the 
most 
streamlined 
version 
of 
the 
quarterly 
call 
 report, and to reduce data reportable on certain streamlined 
call report submissions. 
 Effect of Governmental Monetary Policies 
 The commercial banking 
business is affected 
not only by 
general economic conditions, 
but also by 
the monetary policies 
 of the 
Federal Reserve 
Board. Changes 
in the 
discount 
rate on 
member 
bank borrowing, 
availability of 
borrowing at 
the 
 discount 
window, 
open market 
operations, changes 
in the 
Fed Funds 
target 
interest rate, 
the 
imposition of 
changes in 
 reserve requirements 
against 
member 
banks 
deposits 
and 
assets 
of 
foreign 
banking 
centers 
and 
the 
imposition 
of 
and 
 changes in 
reserve requirements 
against certain 
borrowings by 
banks 
and their 
affiliates 
are some 
of the 
instruments 
of 
 monetary 
policy 
available 
to 
the 
Federal 
Reserve 
Board. 
These 
monetary 
policies 
are 
used 
in 
varying 
combinations 
to 
 influence overall growth and distributions of bank loans, investments and deposits, 
which may affect interest rates charged 
 on 
loans 
or 
paid 
on 
deposits. 
The 
monetary 
policies 
of 
the 
Federal 
Reserve 
Board 
have 
had 
a 
significant 
effect 
on the 
 operating results 
of commercial 
banks and 
are expected 
to continue 
to do 
so in 
the future. 
The Federal 
Reserve Board s 
 policies are primarily influenced by the dual mandate of price stability and 
full employment, and to a lesser degree by short-
 term 
and 
long-term 
changes 
in 
the 
international 
trade 
balance 
and 
in 
the 
fiscal 
policies 
of 
the 
U.S. 
government. 
Future 
 changes in monetary policy and the effect of such changes on our business and earnings in the future cannot be 
predicted. 
 Future Legislation and Regulation 
 Congress may enact legislation from time to time that affects 
the regulation of the financial services industry, 
and state 
 legislatures may enact legislation from time to time affecting the regulation of financial institutions chartered by or operating 
 in those states. 
Federal and state 
regulatory agencies 
also periodically propose 
and adopt changes 
to their regulations 
or 
 change the manner 
in which existing 
regulations are 
applied or 
interpreted. The 
substance or 
impact of pending 
or future 
 legislation or regulation, or 
the application thereof, cannot 
be predicted, although enactment 
of proposed legislation has 
in 
 the past 
and may 
in the 
future affect 
the regulatory 
structure under 
which we 
operate and 
may significantly 
increase our 
 costs, impede the efficiency 
of our internal business 
processes, require us to 
increase our regulatory capital 
or modify our 
 business 
strategy, 
or 
limit 
our 
ability 
to 
pursue 
business 
opportunities 
in 
an 
efficient 
manner. 
Our 
business, 
financial 
 condition, results 
of operations 
or prospects 
may be 
adversely affected, 
perhaps materially, 
as a 
result of 
any such 
new 
 legislation or regulations. 
 The CARES Act and Initiatives Related to COVID-19
 On March 27, 2020, the CARES Act was signed into law and provided for approximately 2.2 trillion in direct economic 
 relief in 
response to 
the public 
health and 
economic impacts 
of COVID-19. 
Many of 
the CARES 
Act s programs 
are, and 
 remain, dependent 
upon the 
direct involvement 
of financial 
institutions like 
us. These 
programs 
have been 
implemented 
 through rules and guidance adopted by federal 
departments and agencies, including the U.S. 
Department of Treasury, 
the 
 Federal Reserve and 
other federal bank 
regulatory authorities, including 
those with direct 
supervisory jurisdiction 
over us. 
 Furthermore, as the COVID-19 pandemic 
evolves, federal regulatory authorities continue 
to issue additional guidance with 
 respect 
to 
the 
implementation, 
life 
cycle, 
and 
eligibility 
requirements 
for 
the 
various 
CARES 
Act 
programs, 
as 
well 
as 
 industry-specific 
recovery 
procedures 
for 
COVID-19. 
In 
addition, 
it 
is 
possible 
that 
Congress 
will 
enact 
supplementary 
 COVID-19 response legislation, including 
amendments to the CARES 
Act or new bills comparable 
in scope to the CARES 
 Act. We 
continue to 
assess 
the 
impact 
of 
the 
CARES 
Act, 
the 
Consolidated 
Appropriations 
Act, 
2021 
and 
the 
potential

impact 
of 
new 
COVID-19 
legislation 
and 
other 
statutes, 
regulations 
and 
supervisory 
guidance 
related 
to 
the 
COVID-19 
 pandemic. 
 A 
principal 
provision 
of 
the 
CARES 
Act 
amended 
the 
SBA s 
loan 
program 
to 
create 
a 
guaranteed, 
unsecured 
loan 
 program, the Paycheck Protection 
Program, or PPP, to fund operational costs 
of eligible businesses, organizations 
and self-
 employed persons impacted by COVID-19. These loans are eligible to be forgiven if 
certain conditions are satisfied and are 
 fully guaranteed by the SBA. Additionally, 
loan payments will also be deferred 
for the first six months of the 
loan term. The 
 PPP commenced on 
April 3, 
2020 and was 
available to qualified 
borrowers through August 
8, 2020. 
No collateral 
or personal 
 guarantees were required. On December 27, 2020, 
President Trump signed the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2021 into 
 law which included the Economic Aid to Hard-Hit Small Businesses, 
Nonprofits, and Venues Act, or 
the HHSB Act. Among 
 other things, the HHSB Act renewed the 
PPP, 
allocating 284.45 billion for both new first time PPP 
loans under the existing 
 PPP and 
the expansion 
of existing 
PPP loans 
for certain 
qualified, existing 
PPP borrowers. 
In addition 
to extending 
and 
 amending the PPP, 
the HHSB Act also creates 
a new grant program 
for shuttered venue operators. 
As of December 31, 
 2022, we had 6 active PPP loans remaining totaling 1.3 
million. 
 The 
CARES 
Act, 
as 
extended 
by certain 
provisions 
of 
the 
Consolidated 
Appropriations 
Act, 
2021, 
permits 
banks 
to 
 suspend 
requirements 
under 
GAAP 
for 
loan 
modifications 
to 
borrowers 
affected 
by 
COVID-19 
that 
may 
otherwise 
be 
 characterized as troubled 
debt restructurings and 
suspend any determination 
related thereto if (i) 
the borrower was 
not more 
 than 30 
days past 
due as 
of December 
31, 2019, 
(ii) the 
modifications are 
related to 
COVID-19, and 
(iii) the 
modification 
 occurs between March 1, 2020 and 
the earlier of 60 days after the 
date of termination of the national emergency or 
January 
 1, 
2022. 
Federal 
bank 
regulatory 
authorities 
also 
issued 
guidance 
to 
encourage 
banks 
to 
make 
loan 
modifications 
for 
 borrowers affected by 
COVID-19. As of 
December 31, 2022, there 
were no 
loans in 
our portfolio 
in deferral 
status associated 
 with the COVID-19 pandemic.

Item 1A. Risk Factors 
 This 
section 
contains 
a 
description 
of 
the 
material 
risk 
and 
uncertainties 
identified 
by 
management 
that 
could, 
 individually or in combination, harm our business, results of 
operations, liquidity and financial condition. The risks described 
 below are not all inclusive. We may face other 
risks that are not presently known, or that we presently 
deem immaterial. 

 Summary of Risk Factors 
 Our business is subject to 
a number of risks 
that could cause actual results 
to differ materially from 
those indicated by 
 forward-looking statements 
made in 
this Form 
10-K or presented 
elsewhere from 
time to 
time. These 
risks are 
discussed 
 more fully in this Item 1A and include, without limitation, the 
following: 
 Risks Related to our Business and Operations 
 
Our 
business 
operations 
and 
lending 
activities 
are concentrated 
in 
South 
Florida, 
and 
we 
are more 
sensitive 
to 
 adverse changes in the local economy than our more geographically 
diversified competitors. 
 
The small- to medium-sized businesses 
to which we lend may have 
fewer resources to weather adverse 
business 
 developments, which may impair a borrower's ability to 
repay a loan. 
 
The continuing 
COVID-19 pandemic 
has, and may 
continue to, 
adversely affect 
our business, 
financial condition, 
 liquidity, capital and 
results of operations. 
 
Inflationary pressures and rising prices may affect 
our results of operations and financial condition. 
 
Financial challenges 
at other 
banking institutions 
could lead 
to depositor 
concerns that 
spread within 
the banking 
 industry causing disruptive deposit outflows and other destabilizing 
results. 
 
Changes in U.S. trade policies and other global political 
factors beyond our control may adversely impact us. 

Our lending business is subject to credit risk, which could 
lead to unexpected losses. 

The potential for the replacement or discontinuation of London Inter-bank Offered Rate, or LIBOR, as a benchmark 
 interest rate could present operational problems 
and result in market disruption. 

Natural disasters and severe weather events in Florida 
could have a material adverse impact on us. 

Our business is subject to interest rate risk. 
 
A failure or the perceived risk 
of a failure to raise the statutory 
debt limit of the U.S. 
could have a material adverse 
 effect on our business, financial condition and results 
of operations. 
 
Our allowance for credit losses may not be sufficient 
to absorb potential losses in our loan portfolio. 

Our commercial loan portfolio may expose us to increased 
credit risk. 

The imposition of limits by the bank regulators 
on commercial real estate lending 
activities could curtail our growth 
 and adversely affect our earnings. 
 
Our SBA lending program depends on our status as a participant in the SBA's Preferred Lenders Program, and we 
 face specific risks associated with originating SBA loans 
and selling the guaranteed portion thereof. 

The SBA may not honor its guarantees if we do not originate 
loans in compliance with SBA guidelines. 

Global banking is an important part of our business, which creates 
increased BSA/AML risk. 

We may not recover all amounts that are contractually 
owed to us by our borrowers. 

Non-performing assets take significant time to resolve and 
adversely affect us.

We engage in 
lending secured by 
real estate and 
may foreclose on 
the collateral and 
own the underlying 
real estate, 
 subjecting us to the costs and potential risks associated 
with the ownership of real property and other risks. 

We are subject to certain operational risks, 
such as fraud and data processing system failures and errors. 

We are subject to liquidity risk, which could adversely 
affect our financial condition and results of 
operations. 

We have several large depositor relationships, the 
loss of which could adversely affect 
us. 

The value of our securities in our investment portfolio 
may decline in the future. 

We may not effectively execute on our expansion 
strategy. 

New lines of business, products, product enhancements 
or services may subject us to additional risk. 

Additional capital we need may not be available on terms 
acceptable to us or may dilute our shareholders. 

Our strategy to grow through mergers or acquisitions may not be 
successful or, if successful, 
may produce risks in 
 successfully integrating and managing the merged companies 
or acquisitions and may dilute our shareholders. 

We may lose one or more of our key personnel 
or fail to attract and retain other highly qualified personnel. 

Damage to our reputation could significantly harm our 
businesses. 

We face strong competition and must respond 
to rapid technological changes to remain competitive. 

A 
 failure, interruption, or breach in the security of our or our contracted vendors systems could adversely affect us. 

We rely on other companies to provide key components 
of our business infrastructure. 

Litigation and regulatory actions could subject us to significant 
liabilities or restrictions. 

Certain of our directors may have conflicts of interest 
in presenting business opportunities to us. 

 Risks Related to Our Tax, Accounting 
and Regulatory Compliance 

We may be unable to recognize the benefits of deferred 
tax assets. 
 
The accuracy of our financial statements could be affected 
by our judgments, assumptions or estimates. 

As a new public company, 
we may not create an effective internal control 
environment. 
 
We operate in a highly regulated environme 
nt. 
 
Our participation in the SBA PPP loan program exposes 
us to noncompliance risk and litigation risk. 

We face a risk of noncompliance with the Bank 
Secrecy Act and other anti-money laundering laws. 
 
We are subject to capital adequacy requirements 
that may become more stringent. 
 
We are periodically subject to examination and scrutiny 
by a number of banking agencies. 
 
We are subject to numerous laws and regulations 
of certain regulatory agencies designed to protect consumers. 
 
Climate change 
and related 
legislative and 
regulatory initiatives 
may materially 
affect our 
business and 
results of 
 operations. 
 Risks Related to Our Class A Common Stock 
 
Ability to pay dividends on our common stock 
is subject to restrictions. 

Table of Contents

2022 10-K 

The market price and trading volume of our Class A common 
stock may be volatile. 
 
There are significant restrictions in our Articles of Incorporation 
that restrict the ability to sell our capital stock. 
 
We 
are 
an 
emerging 
growth 
company 
and 
have 
decided 
to 
take 
advantage 
of 
certain 
exemptions 
from 
various 
 reporting and other requirements applicable to emerging growth 
companies. 
 
We have existing investors that 
own a significant amount of 
our common stock whose individual 
interests may differ 
 from yours. 

Provisions in our governing documents and Florida 
law may have an anti-takeover effect 
and there are substantial 
 regulatory limitations on changes of control of the Company.
 Risks Related to our Business and Operations 
 Our business 
operations and 
lending activities 
are concentrated 
in South 
Florida, and 
we are 
more sensitive 
 to adverse changes in the local economy than our 
more geographically diversified competitors. 

 Unlike many of 
our larger competitors 
that maintain significant 
operations located 
outside of our 
market area, most 
of 
 our customers are concentrated in South Florida. In addition, we have 
a high concentration of loans secured by real estate 
 located in 
South Florida. 
Therefore, our 
success depends 
upon the 
general economic 
conditions in 
South Florida, 
which 
 may differ from the economic conditions in other areas 
of the U.S. or the U.S. generally. 
 Our real estate 
collateral provides 
an alternate source 
of repayment in 
the event 
of default by 
the borrower; 
however, 
 the value of the collateral may decline during the time the credit is outstanding. The concentration of our loans in the South 
 Florida area subjects us to 
risk that a downturn in the 
local economy or recession in 
this area could result in 
a decrease in 
 loan originations and increases in delinquencies and foreclosures, which would have a greater negative effect on us than if 
 our lending 
were more 
geographically diversified. 
If we 
are required 
to liquidate 
our real 
estate collateral 
securing a 
loan 
 during 
a 
period 
of 
reduced 
real 
estate 
values 
to 
satisfy 
the 
debt, 
our 
earnings 
and 
capital 
could 
be 
adversely 
affected. 
 Moreover, since 
a large portion 
of our loan 
portfolio is secured 
by properties located 
in South Florida, 
the occurrence of 
a 
 natural disaster, such 
as a hurricane, or a man-made disaster 
could result in a decline in loan originations, 
a decline in the 
 value or 
destruction 
of mortgaged 
properties 
and an 
increase 
in the 
risk 
of delinquencies, 
foreclosures 
or loss 
on loans 
 originated by 
us. We 
may suffer 
further losses 
due to 
the decline 
in the 
value of 
the properties 
underlying our 
mortgage 
 loans, which would have an adverse impact on our results 
of operations and financial condition. 
 A downturn in the local economy generally may lead to loan losses that are not offset by operations in other markets; it 
 may also reduce the ability 
of our customers to grow 
or maintain their deposits with 
us. For these reasons, any 
regional or 
 local economic 
downturn 
that 
affects 
South Florida, 
or existing 
or prospective 
borrowers 
or 
depositors 
in 
South Florida, 
 could have a material adverse effect on our business, 
financial condition and results of operations. 
 In addition, there are 
continuing concerns related 
to, among other things, 
the level of 
U.S. government debt 
and fiscal 
 actions that may 
be taken to 
address that debt, 
price fluctuations of key 
natural resources, inflation, the 
potential resurgence 
 of economic and political tensions with China, the Russian invasion of Ukraine and 
continuing high oil prices due to, among 
 other things, Russian supply disruptions, each of 
which may have a destabilizing effect 
on financial markets and economic 
 activity. 
Economic 
pressure 
on 
consumers 
and 
overall 
economic 
uncertainty 
may 
result 
in 
changes 
in 
consumer 
and 
 business spending, 
borrowing 
and saving 
habits. These 
economic 
conditions and/or 
other negative 
developments 
in the 
 domestic 
or international 
credit markets 
or economies 
may significantly 
affect 
the markets 
in which 
we do 
business, the 
 value of our loans and investments, and our ongoing 
operations, costs and profitability. 
 The 
small- 
to 
medium-sized 
businesses 
to 
which 
we 
lend 
may 
have 
fewer 
resources 
to 
weather 
adverse 
 business developments, which may impair a borrower's 
ability to repay a loan. 
 We 
target our 
business 
development 
and 
marketing 
strategies 
primarily 
to 
serve 
the 
banking 
and 
financial 
services 
 needs of small- to 
medium-sized businesses, or SMBs, and 
the owners and operators of 
those businesses. SMBs generally 
 have fewer financial resources in terms of capital or borrowing capacity than larger entities, frequently have smaller market 
 shares than their competition, may be 
more vulnerable to economic 
downturns, often need substantial additional 
capital to 
 expand 
or 
compete, 
and 
may 
experience 
substantial 
volatility 
in 
operating 
results, 
any 
of 
which, 
individually 
or 
in 
the 
 aggregate, may impair 
their ability as 
a borrower to 
repay a loan. 
These factors may 
impact SMBs significantly 
more as a 
 result of the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic. In addition, the success of SMBs often depends on the management skills, 
 talents and efforts of a small group of 
key people, and the death, disability or 
resignation of one or more of these individuals 
 could have 
an adverse 
impact on 
the business 
and its 
ability to 
repay its 
loan. If 
general economic 
conditions negatively 

Table of Contents

2022 10-K 

impact the markets in which we operate 
or any of our borrowers otherwise are 
affected by adverse business developments, 
 our 
SMB 
borrowers 
may 
be 
disproportionately 
affected 
and 
their 
ability 
to 
repay 
outstanding 
loans 
may 
be 
negatively 
 affected, which could have a material adverse effect 
on our business, financial condition and results of operations. 
 The 
continuing 
COVID-19 
pandemic 
has, 
and 
may 
continue 
to, 
adversely 
affect 
our 
business, 
financial 
 condition, liquidity, capital and results 
of operations. 
 The extent and duration 
to which the 
continuing COVID-19 pandemic 
will affect our 
business in the 
future is unknown 
 and will depend 
on future developments, 
which are highly 
uncertain and outside 
our control. These 
developments include 
 the 
duration 
and 
severity 
of 
the 
pandemic 
(including 
the 
possibility 
of 
further 
surges 
of 
COVID-19 
variants 
of 
concern), 
 supply chain disruptions, decreased demand for our products and services or those of our borrowers, which could increase 
 our credit 
risk, 
rising inflation, 
our ability 
to maintain 
sufficient 
qualified personnel 
due to 
labor shortages, 
talent attrition, 
 employee illness, quarantine, 
willingness to return 
to work, face-coverings 
and other safety 
requirements, or travel 
and other 
 restrictions, and the actions taken 
by governments, businesses and individuals 
to contain the impact of 
COVID-19, as well 
 as 
further 
actions 
taken 
by 
governmental 
authorities 
to 
limit 
the 
resulting 
economic 
impact. 
It 
is 
also 
possible 
that 
the 
 pandemic 
and 
its 
aftermath 
will 
lead 
to 
a 
prolonged 
economic 
slowdown 
in 
sectors 
disproportionately 
affected 
by 
the 
 pandemic or recession in the U.S. economy or the world 
economy in general. 
 Inflationary pressures and rising prices may affect 
our results of operations and financial condition. 
 Inflation 
has 
risen 
sharply 
since 
the 
end 
of 
2021 
to 
levels 
not 
seen 
in 
more 
than 
40 
years. 
Small 
to 
medium-sized 
 businesses may be 
impacted more during 
periods of high 
inflation, as they are 
not able to leverage 
economics of scale 
to 
 mitigate cost pressures compared 
to larger businesses. Consequently, 
the ability of our business 
customers to repay their 
 loans may deteriorate, and in some cases this deterioration may occur quickly, which would adversely impact our results of 
 operations and financial 
condition. Furthermore, 
a prolonged period 
of inflation could 
cause wages 
and other of 
our costs 
 to increase, which could adversely affect our results 
of operations and financial condition. 
 Financial 
challenges 
at 
other 
banking 
institutions 
could 
lead 
to 
depositor 
concerns 
that 
spread 
within 
the 
 banking industry causing disruptive deposit outflows 
and other destabilizing results. 
 In March 2023, certain specialized banking institutions with elevated concentrations of uninsured deposits experienced 
 large deposit outflows, 
resulting in the 
institutions being placed 
into FDIC receiverships. 
In the aftermath, 
there has been 
 substantial 
market 
disruption 
and 
indications 
that 
deposit 
concerns 
could 
spread 
within 
the 
banking 
industry, 
leading 
to 
 deposit outflows 
and other 
destabilizing results. 
U.S. Century 
Bank maintains 
a well-diversified 
deposit base. 
Our top 15 
 depositors only 
hold 12 
of our 
total portfolio. 
As of 
December 31, 
2022, 39 of 
our deposits 
are estimated 
to be FDIC-
 insured. Our public funds 
are 11 
of total deposits and 
are partially collateralized. 
The estimated average account 
size of 
 our deposit 
portfolio is 
 95 thousand. In 
addition, the Bank 
was qualified 
as a 
 well capitalized institution 
as of 
December 31, 
 2022 and 2021. 

 Changes in 
U.S. trade 
policies and 
other global 
political factors 
beyond our 
control, including 
the imposition 
 of tariffs, retaliatory tariffs, or other sanctions, may adversely impact our business, financial condition and results 
 of operations. 

There have 
been, and 
may be 
in the 
future, changes 
with respect 
to U.S. 
and international 
trade policies, 
legislation, 
 treaties and tariffs, embargoes, sanctions and other trade restrictions. Tariffs, 
retaliatory tariffs or other trade restrictions on 
 products 
and 
materials 
that 
customers 
import 
or export, 
or a 
trade 
war or 
other 
related governmental 
actions 
related 
to 
 tariffs, 
international 
trade 
agreements 
or 
policies 
or 
other 
trade 
restrictions 
have 
the 
potential 
to 
negatively 
impact 
our 
 customers' costs, demand 
for our products, 
or the U.S. 
economy or 
certain sectors thereof 
and, thus, could 
adversely impact 
 our business, 
financial condition 
and results 
of operations. 
As a 
result of 
Russia's invasion 
of Ukraine, 
the U.S. 
imposed, 
 and is likely to continue to impose material additional, financial and economic sanctions and export controls against certain 
 Russian organizations and/or individuals, with similar actions either implemented or planned by the European Union ("EU") 
 and 
the 
United 
Kingdom UK and 
other 
jurisdictions. 
The 
U.S., 
the 
UK, 
and 
the 
EU 
have 
each 
imposed 
packages 
of 
 financial 
and 
economic 
sanctions 
that, 
in 
various 
ways, 
constrain 
transactions 
with 
numerous 
Russian 
entities 
and 
 individuals; transactions 
in Russian 
sovereign debt; 
and investment, 
trade, and 
financing to, 
from, or 
in certain regions 
of 
 Ukraine. Moreover, actions by Russia, and any 
further measures taken by the 
U.S. or its allies, 
could have negative impacts 
 on regional and global 
financial markets and economic conditions. 
To the extent changes in the global 
political environment, 
 including Russia's 
invasion of 
Ukraine and 
the escalating 
tensions between 
Russia and 
the U.S., 
NATO, 
the EU 
and the 
 UK, have a negative impact on 
us or on the markets 
in which we operate, our business, 
results of operations and financial 
 condition could be materially and adversely impacted.

Our lending business is subject to credit risk, which 
could lead to unexpected losses. 

 Our 
primary 
business 
involves 
making 
loans 
to 
customers. 
The 
business 
of 
lending 
is 
inherently 
risky 
because 
the 
 principal or 
interest on 
the loan 
may not 
be repaid 
timely or 
at all 
or the 
value of 
any collateral 
securing the 
loan may 
be 
 insufficient to 
cover our 
outstanding exposure. 
These risks 
may be affected 
by the 
strength or 
weakness of 
the particular 
 borrower's business sector 
and local, regional and 
national market and 
economic conditions. Many 
of our loans are 
made 
 to SMBs that may be 
less able to withstand 
competitive, economic and financial 
pressures than larger borrowers. 
Our risk 
 management practices, 
such as 
monitoring the 
concentration of 
our loans 
within specific 
industries in 
which we 
lend and 
 concentrations with individual borrowers 
or related borrowers, and 
our credit approval 
practices, may not adequately 
reduce 
 credit risk. In addition, there are risks inherent in making any loan, including 
risks relating to proper loan underwriting, risks 
 resulting from 
changes in 
economic and 
industry conditions, 
risks 
inherent in 
dealing with 
individual borrowers, 
including 
 the risk that a borrower may not provide 
information to us about their business 
in a timely manner, 
may present inaccurate 
 or incomplete information to us, may lack a U.S. credit history, 
or may leave the U.S. without fulfilling their loan obligations, 
 leaving us 
with little recourse 
to them 
personally, 
and/or risks 
relating to the 
value of 
collateral. In 
order to 
manage credit 
 risk successfully, 
we must, 
among other 
things, maintain 
disciplined and 
prudent underwriting 
standards and 
ensure that 
 our lenders follow those standards. The weakening of 
these standards for any reason, such as an 
attempt to attract higher 
 yielding loans, 
a lack 
of discipline 
or diligence 
by our 
employees in 
underwriting and 
monitoring loans, 
the inability 
of our 
 employees to adequately adapt 
policies and procedures to 
changes in economic or 
any other conditions affecting borrowers 
 and the quality 
of our loan portfolio, 
may result in loan 
defaults, foreclosures and additional 
charge-offs and may necessitate 
 that we significantly increase our allowance for credit losses, each of which could adversely affect our net income. A failure 
 to effectively 
manage 
credit risk 
associated 
with our 
loan portfolio 
could 
lead to 
unexpected 
losses and 
have a 
material 
 adverse effect on our business, financial condition 
and results of operations. 
 The 
potential 
for 
the 
replacement 
or 
discontinuation 
of 
London 
Inter-bank 
Offered 
Rate, 
or 
LIBOR, 
as 
a 
 benchmark 
interest 
rate 
and 
a 
transition 
to 
an 
alternative 
reference 
interest 
rate 
could 
present 
operational 
 problems and result in market disruption. 
 In 2017, the 
Financial Conduct 
Authority announced 
that after 2021 
it will no 
longer compel banks 
to submit the 
rates 
 required to 
calculate 
LIBOR. 
In November 
2020, the 
administrator 
of LIBOR 
announced 
it will 
consult 
on its 
intention to 
 extend the retirement 
date of certain offered 
rates whereby the publication 
of the one week 
and two month LIBOR 
offered 
 rates will cease after December 31, 2021; but, the publication of 
the remaining LIBOR offered rates will continue until June 
 30, 
2023. 
Given 
consumer 
protection, 
litigation, 
and 
reputation 
risks, 
the 
bank 
regulatory 
agencies 
have 
indicated 
that 
 entering into new 
contracts that use 
LIBOR as a 
reference rate after 
December 31, 2021 
would create safety 
and soundness 
 risks and that 
they will examine 
bank practices accordingly. 
Therefore, the 
agencies encouraged banks 
to cease entering 
 into new contracts that use LIBOR as a reference rate 
as soon as practicable and in any event by December 
31, 2021. 
 Regulators, industry groups 
and certain communities 
(e.g., the Alternative 
Reference Rates Committee) 
have, among 
 other 
things, 
published 
recommended 
fallback 
language 
LIBOR-linked 
financial 
instruments, 
identified 
recommended 
 alternatives for certain LIBOR rates (e.g., 
the Secured Overnight Financing Rate SOFR as the 
recommended alternative 
 to U.S. Dollar LIBOR), and proposed implementations of the recommended alternatives in floating rate instruments. 
At this 
 time, while it appears that 
these recommendations and proposals 
have been broadly accepted, it 
is not possible to predict 
 whether they 
will continue 
to evolve, 
and what 
the effect 
of their 
implementation 
may be 
on the 
markets 
for floating 
rate 
 financial instruments. 
The uncertainty 
surrounding potential 
reforms, 
including the 
use of 
alternative reference 
rates and 
 changes 
to 
the 
methods 
and 
processes 
used 
to 
calculate 
rates, 
may 
have 
an 
adverse 
effect 
on 
the 
trading 
market 
for 
 LIBOR-based 
securities, 
loan 
yields, 
and 
the 
amount 
received 
and 
paid 
on 
derivative 
contracts 
and 
other 
financial 
 instruments. 
In addition, 
the implementation of 
LIBOR reform proposals 
may result in 
increased compliance and 
operational 
 costs. 
 Certain of our financial products are 
tied to LIBOR. Inconsistent approaches to 
a transition from LIBOR to 
an alternative 
 rate among 
different market 
participants and 
for different 
financial products 
may cause 
market disruption 
and operational 
 problems, which 
could adversely 
affect 
us, including 
by exposing 
us to 
increased interest 
rate risk 
and associated 
costs, 
 including, but not limited to, creating the possibility of 
disagreements with counterparties. 
 Natural disasters and severe weather events in Florida 
could have a material adverse impact on our 
business, 
 financial condition and operations. 

 Our 
operations 
and 
our 
customer 
base 
are 
primarily 
located 
in 
South 
Florida. 
This 
region 
is 
vulnerable 
to 
natural 
 disasters 
and 
severe 
weather 
events 
or

the value of property serving as collateral for our loans, force the relocation of residents, and 
significantly disrupt economic 
 activity in the region. 

 We 
cannot predict 
the extent 
of damage 
that may 
result from 
such adverse 
weather events, 
which will 
depend on 
a 
 variety of factors that are beyond our control, 
including, but not limited to, the 
severity and duration of the event, 
the timing 
 and level 
of government 
responsiveness, the 
pace of 
economic recovery 
and availability 
of insurance 
to cover 
losses. In 
 addition, 
the 
nature, 
frequency 
and 
severity 
of 
these 
adverse 
weather 
events 
and 
other 
natural 
disasters 
may 
be 
 exacerbated by climate change. If a significant adverse weather event or other natural disaster were to occur, it could have 
 a materially adverse impact 
on our financial 
condition, results of operations 
and our business, as 
well as potentially 
increase 
 our exposure to credit and liquidity risks. 
 Our business is subject to 
interest rate risk, and variations in 
interest rates may materially and adversely 
affect 
 our financial performance. 

 Changes in the interest 
rate environment may reduce 
our profits. It is 
expected that we 
will continue to realize 
income 
 from the differential or "spread" between the interest earned on loans, securities 
and other interest-earning assets, and the 
 interest paid on deposits, borrowings 
and other interest-bearing 
liabilities. Net interest spreads 
are affected, in part, 
by the 
 difference 
between 
the 
maturities 
and 
repricing 
characteristics 
of 
interest-earning 
assets 
and 
interest-bearing 
liabilities. 
 Changes 
in 
market 
interest 
rates 
generally 
affect 
loan 
volume, 
loan 
yields, 
funding 
sources 
and 
funding 
costs. 
Our 
net 
 interest 
spread 
depends 
on 
many 
factors 
that 
are 
partly 
or completely 
out 
of 
our 
control, 
including 
competition, 
general 
 economic 
conditions, 
and 
federal 
economic 
monetary 
and fiscal 
policies, 
and 
in 
particular, 
the 
Federal 
Reserve's 
policy 
 determinations with respect to interest rates. 
 It is currently expected that during 2023, 
the Federal Open Market Committee of the Federal 
Reserve (the FOMC will 
 increase interest rates 
to reduce the 
rate of 
inflation to the 
extent necessary 
to reduce 
inflation to the 
rate that the 
FOMC 
 believes is appropriate. Since March 2022, the FOMC has increased the federal funds rate by 
450 basis points. All of these 
 increases were expressly 
made in response 
to inflationary pressures, 
which are currently 
expected to continue. 
However, 
 there can be no assurances as to any future FOMC action. 

 While an increase 
in interest rates 
may increase our 
loan yield, it 
may adversely 
affect the ability 
of certain borrowers 
 with variable rate 
loans to pay 
the contractual 
interest and principal 
due to us. 
Following an increase 
in interest rates, 
our 
 ability to maintain a positive net interest spread is 
dependent on our ability to increase our loan offering rates, replace loans 
 that mature and 
repay or 
that prepay before 
maturity with new 
originations at higher 
rates, minimize increases 
on our 
deposit 
 rates, and maintain an acceptable 
level and composition of 
funding. We cannot provide 
assurances that we will 
be able to 
 increase 
our 
loan 
offering 
rates 
and 
continue 
to 
originate 
loans 
due 
to 
the 
competitive 
landscape 
in 
which 
we 
operate. 
 Additionally, 
we cannot 
provide assurances 
that we 
can minimize 
the increases 
in our 
deposit rates 
while maintaining 
an 
 acceptable 
level 
of 
deposits. 
Finally, 
we 
cannot 
provide 
any 
assurances 
that 
we 
can 
maintain 
our 
current 
levels 
of 
 noninterest-bearing deposits as customers may seek 
higher-yielding products when interest rates increase. 
 Accordingly, 
changes 
in 
levels 
of 
interest 
rates 
could 
materially 
and 
adversely 
affect 
our 
net 
interest 
margin, 
asset 
 quality, loan origination 
volume, average loan portfolio balance, liquidity, 
and overall profitability. 
 A 
failure 
or 
the 
perceived 
risk of 
a 
failure 
to 
raise 
the 
statutory 
debt 
limit 
of 
the 
U.S. 
could 
have 
a 
material 
 adverse effect on our business, financial condition 
and results of operations
 . 
 U.S. debt ceiling and budget deficit 
concerns have increased the 
possibility of additional credit-rating 
downgrades and 
 economic slowdowns, or a recession in 
the United States. Although U.S. 
lawmakers passed legislation to 
raise the federal 
 debt ceiling on multiple occasions, including the most recent increase in December 2021, ratings agencies have lowered or 
 threatened to lower the long-term sovereign 
credit rating on the United 
States. The impact of this 
or any further downgrades 
 to the U.S. government s sovereign credit rating or its 
perceived creditworthiness could adversely affect the U.S. and global 
 financial markets and economic conditions. Absent further 
quantitative easing by the Federal Reserve, 
these developments 
 could cause interest rates 
and borrowing costs to rise, 
which may negatively impact 
our ability to access 
the debt markets 
 on favorable terms. In 
addition, disagreement over 
the federal budget has 
caused the U.S. 
federal government to shut 
down 
 for 
periods 
of 
time. 
Continued 
adverse 
political 
and 
economic 
conditions 
could 
have 
a 
material 
adverse 
effect 
on 
our 
 business, financial condition and results of operations. 
 Our allowance for credit losses may not be sufficient 
to absorb potential losses in our loan portfolio. 

 We 
maintain 
an 
allowance 
for 
credit 
losses 
that 
represents 
management's 
judgment 
of 
probable 
losses 
and 
risks 
 inherent in our loan portfolio. 
The level of the allowance 
reflects management's continuing 
evaluation of general economic 
 conditions, 
present 
political 
and 
regulatory 
conditions, 
diversification 
and 
seasoning 
of 
the

portfolio,

experience, identified credit 
problems, delinquency levels 
and adequacy of 
collateral. Determining the 
appropriate level of 
 our 
allowance 
for 
credit 
losses 
involves 
a 
degree 
of 
subjective 
judgment 
and 
requires 
management 
to 
make 
significant 
 estimates of and assumptions regarding current credit risks 
and future trends, all of which may undergo material changes. 
 Inaccurate 
management 
assumptions, 
deterioration 
of 
economic 
conditions 
affecting 
borrowers, 
new 
negative 
 information 
regarding 
existing 
loans, 
identification 
of 
additional 
problem 
loans or 
deterioration 
of existing 
problem 
loans, 
 and 
other 
factors 
(including 
third-party 
review 
and 
analysis), 
both 
within 
and 
outside 
of 
our 
control, 
may 
require 
us 
to 
 increase our allowance for 
credit losses. In addition, 
our regulators, as an 
integral part of their 
periodic examinations, review 
 our methodology for calculating, and 
the adequacy of, our allowance 
for credit losses and may 
direct us to make additions 
 to the allowance 
based on their 
judgments about 
information available to 
them at the 
time of their 
examination. Further, 
if 
 actual charge-offs in future 
periods exceed the 
amounts allocated to 
our allowance for 
credit losses, we 
may need additional 
 provisions for credit losses to restore 
the adequacy of our allowance for credit 
losses. Finally, the measure of our allowance 
 for credit losses depends on the 
adoption and interpretation of accounting 
standards. The Financial Accounting 
Standards 
 Board, or FASB, issued a new credit 
impairment model, the Current Expected Credit Loss, or 
CECL model, which became 
 applicable 
to 
us 
on 
January 
1, 
2023. 
CECL 
requires 
financial 
institutions 
to 
estimate 
and 
develop 
a 
provision 
for 
credit 
 losses over the lifetime of the loan at origination, as opposed to reserving for incurred or probable 
losses up to the balance 
 sheet date. Under the CECL 
model, expected credit deterioration 
would be reflected in the income 
statement in the period 
 of 
origination 
or 
acquisition 
of 
a 
loan, 
with 
changes 
in 
expected 
credit 
losses 
due 
to 
further 
credit 
deterioration 
or 
 improvement reflected 
in the 
periods in 
which the 
expectation changes. 
Accordingly, 
implementation of 
the CECL 
model 
 could 
require 
financial 
institutions, 
like 
us, 
to 
increase 
our 
allowances 
for 
credit 
losses 
from 
levels 
in 
place 
prior 
to 
the 
 implementation of CECL. 
Moreover, the 
CECL model may create 
more volatility in our 
level of allowance for 
credit losses. 
 If we 
are required 
to materially 
increase our 
level of 
allowance for 
credit losses 
for any 
reason, such increase 
could adversely 
 affect our business, prospects, cash flow, 
liquidity, financial 
condition and results of operations. 

 Our commercial loan portfolio may expose us to increased 
credit risk. 
 Commercial business 
and real 
estate loans 
generally have 
a higher 
risk 
of loss 
because loan 
balances 
are typically 
 larger 
than 
residential 
real 
estate 
and 
consumer 
loans 
and 
repayment 
is 
usually 
dependent 
on 
cash 
flows 
from 
the 
 borrower s business or the 
property securing the loan. Our 
commercial business loans are primarily 
made to small business 
 and middle market customers. These loans typically 
involve repayment that depends upon income 
generated, or expected 
 to be generated, by the property securing the loan 
and/or by the cash flow generated by the business borrower and 
may be 
 adversely affected by changes in the economy or 
local market conditions. These loans expose a 
lender to the risk of having 
 to liquidate the collateral securing 
these loans at times when there 
may be significant fluctuation of 
commercial real estate 
 values or to the 
risk of inadequate cash flows to 
service the commercial loans. Unexpected deterioration in 
the credit quality 
 of our 
commercial business 
and/or real 
estate loan 
portfolio could 
require us 
to increase 
our allowance 
for credit 
losses, 
 which would 
reduce our 
profitability and 
could have 
an adverse 
effect 
on our 
business, financial 
condition, and 
results of 
 operations. 
 Commercial construction loans generally 
have a higher risk 
of loss due to the assumptions 
used to estimate the 
value 
 of property 
at completion 
and the 
cost of 
the project, 
including interest. 
It can 
be difficult 
to accurately 
evaluate the 
total 
 funds required 
to complete 
a project, 
and construction 
lending often 
involves the 
disbursement 
of substantial 
funds 
with 
 repayment dependent, in large part, on the success of the ultimate project rather than the ability of a borrower or guarantor 
 to repay the loan from sources other than the subject project. If the assumptions and estimates are inaccurate, the value of 
 completed property 
may fall 
below the 
related loan 
amount. If 
we are forced 
to foreclose 
on a 
project prior 
to completion, 
 we may 
be 
unable 
to 
recover 
the 
entire 
unpaid 
portion 
of 
the 
loan, 
which 
would 
lead 
to 
losses. 
In 
addition, 
we may 
be 
 required to fund additional amounts to complete a project, 
incur taxes, maintenance and compliance costs for 
a foreclosed 
 property and 
may have 
to hold 
the property 
for an 
indeterminate 
period of 
time, any 
of which 
could adversely 
affect 
our 
 business, prospects, cash flow, 
liquidity, financial 
condition and results of operations. 
 The imposition 
of limits 
by the 
bank regulators 
on commercial 
real estate 
lending activities 
could curtail 
our 
 growth and adversely affect our earnings. 

 The 
FDIC, 
the 
Federal 
Reserve 
Board 
and 
the 
Office 
of 
the 
Comptroller 
of 
the 
Currency 
have 
promulgated 
joint 
 guidance 
on 
sound 
risk 
management 
practices 
for 
financial 
institutions 
with 
concentrations 
in 
commercial 
real 
estate 
 lending. Under this guidance, a financial 
institution that, like us, is actively 
involved in commercial real estate lending should 
 perform 
a 
risk 
assessment 
to 
identify 
concentrations. 
Regulatory 
guidance 
on 
concentrations 
in 
commercial 
real 
estate 
 lending provides that a bank s commercial real estate lending exposure 
could receive increased supervisory scrutiny where 
 total 
commercial 
real 
estate 
loans, 
including 
loans 
secured 
by 
multi-family 
residential 
properties, 
owner-occupied 
and 
 nonowner-occupied investor 
real estate, and 
construction and 
land loans, 
represent 300 
or more of 
an institution s 
total 
 risk-based capital, and the outstanding 
balance of the commercial real estate 
loan portfolio has increased by 50 
or more 
 during the 
preceding 
36 months. 
At December 
31, 2022, 
our total 
commercial investor 
real estate 
loans, including 
loans 

Table of Contents 

25 
USCB Financial Holdings, Inc. 
2022 10-K 

secured by apartment buildings, 
commercial real estate, 
and construction and land 
loans represented 390 of 
the Bank s 
 total risk-based capital and the growth in the 
commercial real estate portfolio exceeded 50 over the preceding 36 
months. 
 The particular 
focus of 
the guidance 
is on 
exposure to 
commercial real 
estate loans 
that are 
dependent on 
the cash 
flow 
 from the 
real estate 
held as 
collateral and 
that are 
likely to 
be at 
greater risk 
to conditions 
in the 
commercial 
real estate 
 market (as opposed to real estate collateral held as a secondary source of repayment or as an abundance of caution). The 
 purpose of the guidance is 
to guide institutions in developing 
risk management practices and 
capital levels commensurate 
 with the 
level and 
nature of 
real estate 
concentrations. 
Management has 
established an 
commercial real 
estate lending 
 framework to 
monitor specific exposures 
and limits by 
types within the 
commercial real estate 
portfolio and 
takes appropriate 
 actions, as necessary. While we believe we have implemented policies and procedures with respect to our commercial real 
 estate loan portfolio 
consistent with 
this guidance, 
the FDIC, U.S. 
Century Bank s 
primary federal 
regulator, 
could require 
 us 
to 
implement 
additional 
policies 
and 
procedures 
pursuant 
to 
their 
interpretation 
of 
the 
guidance 
that 
may 
result 
in 
 additional costs to us. In addition, If the FDIC were 
to impose restrictions on the amount of commercial real estate loans we 
 can hold in our portfolio, our earnings would be adversely 
affected. 
 Our 
SBA 
lending 
program 
is dependent 
upon 
the 
federal 
government 
and 
our status 
as 
a participant 
in the 
 SBA's Preferred 
Lenders Program, 
and we 
face specific 
risks associated 
with originating 
SBA loans 
and selling 
 the guaranteed portion thereof. 
 We 
have been 
approved 
by 
the 
SBA 
to 
participate 
in 
the 
SBA's 
Preferred 
Lenders 
Program. 
As 
an 
SBA 
Preferred 
 Lender, 
we enable 
our clients 
to obtain 
SBA loans 
without being 
subject to 
the potentially 
lengthy SBA 
approval process 
 necessary 
for 
lenders 
that 
are 
not 
SBA 
Preferred 
Lenders. 
The 
SBA 
periodically 
reviews 
the 
lending 
operations 
of 
 participating 
lenders 
to 
assess, 
among 
other 
things, 
whether 
the 
lender 
exhibits 
prudent 
risk 
management. 
When 
 weaknesses are identified, the SBA may request corrective actions 
or impose enforcement actions, including revocation of 
 the lender's 
Preferred Lender 
status. If 
we lose 
our status 
as an 
SBA Preferred 
Lender, 
we may 
lose some 
or all 
of our 
 customers to 
lenders who 
are SBA 
Preferred Lenders, 
which could 
adversely affect 
our business, 
financial condition 
and 
 results of operations. 
 We generally sell the guaranteed 
portion of our SBA 7(a) loans 
in the secondary market. These 
sales have resulted in 
 both premium income for us 
at the time of sale 
and created a stream of 
future servicing income. There can be 
no assurance 
 that we will be able to continue originating these loans, that a secondary market for these loans will continue to exist or that 
 we will continue to realize 
premiums upon the sale 
of the guaranteed portion of 
these loans. When we sell 
the guaranteed 
 portion of our SBA 7(a) loans, we incur credit risk on the non-guaranteed portion of the loans, and if a customer defaults on 
 the non-guaranteed portion of a loan, we share any loss 
and recovery related to the loan pro-rata with the SBA. 
 The laws, regulations and 
standard operating procedures 
that are applicable to 
SBA loan products may 
change in the 
 future. We 
cannot predict 
the effects 
of these 
changes on 
our business 
and profitability. 
Because government 
regulation 
 greatly 
affects 
the 
business 
and 
financial 
results 
of 
all 
commercial 
banks 
and 
bank 
holding 
companies, 
especially 
our 
 organization, changes in the laws, regulations 
and procedures applicable to SBA loans 
could adversely affect our 
ability to 
 operate profitably. 
In addition, the 
aggregate amount of 
SBA 7(a) and 504 
loan guarantees by the 
SBA must be approved 
 each fiscal year by the federal 
government. We cannot predict 
the amount of SBA 7(a) 
loan guarantees in any given 
fiscal 
 year. If the federal government were to reduce the amount of SBA loan guarantees, such reduction could 
adversely impact 
 our SBA lending 
program, including making and 
selling the guaranteed portion 
of fewer SBA 
7(a) and 504 
loans. In addition, 
 any default by 
the U.S. government 
on its obligations 
or any prolonged 
government shutdown 
could, among 
other things, 
 impede our ability to originate 
SBA loans or sell such loans 
in the secondary market, which 
could materially and adversely 
 affect our business, financial condition and results 
of operations. 
 The SBA may not honor its guarantees if we do not originate 
loans in compliance with SBA guidelines
 . 

 SBA lending programs 
typically guarantee 
75.0 of the 
principal on 
an underlying 
loan. If the 
SBA establishes 
that a 
 loss on 
an 
SBA guaranteed 
loan 
is attributable 
to significant 
technical 
deficiencies 
in the 
manner 
in 
which 
the loan 
was 
 originated, 
funded 
or serviced 
by us, 
the 
SBA may 
seek 
recovery 
of 
the 
principal 
loss 
related 
to 
the 
deficiency 
from 
us 
 notwithstanding that a portion of the loan 
was guaranteed by the SBA, which could adversely 
affect our business, financial 
 condition and results of 
operations. While we follow 
the SBA's underwriting 
guidelines, our ability to 
do so depends on the 
 knowledge and diligence of our employees 
and the effectiveness of 
controls we have established. If our 
employees do not 
 follow 
the 
SBA 
guidelines 
in 
originating 
loans 
and 
if 
our 
loan 
review 
and 
audit 
programs 
fail 
to 
identify 
and 
rectify 
such 
 failures, the 
SBA may 
reduce or, 
in some 
cases, refuse 
to honor 
its guarantee 
obligations and 
we may 
incur losses 
as a 
 result.

Global banking is an important part of our business, which 
creates increased BSA/AML risk. 
 As our 
business 
model 
includes 
correspondent 
services 
to banks 
in Latin 
America 
and the 
Caribbean, 
these 
cross-
 border 
correspondent 
banking 
relationships 
pose 
unique 
risks 
because 
they 
create 
situations 
in 
which 
a 
U.S. 
financial 
 institution will be 
handling funds from 
a financial institution 
in Latin America 
and the Caribbean 
whose customers may 
not 
 be transparent to us. Moreover, many foreign financial institutions, including 
in Latin America and the Caribbean where our 
 correspondent banking 
services 
are located, 
are not 
subject to 
the same 
or similar 
regulatory 
guidelines 
as U.S. 
banks. 
 Accordingly, 
these 
foreign 
institutions 
may 
pose 
higher 
money 
laundering 
risk 
to 
their 
respective 
U.S. 
bank 
 correspondent(s). Because 
of the 
large amount 
of funds, 
multiple transactions, 
and our 
potential lack 
of familiarity 
with a 
 foreign correspondent financial institution's customers, these customers may 
be able to more 
easily conceal the source and 
 use of 
illicit funds. 
Consequently, 
we may 
have a 
higher 
risk 
of non-compliance 
with the 
BSA 
and 
other 
AML rules 
and 
 regulations 
due 
to 
our 
correspondent 
banking 
relationships 
with 
foreign 
financial 
institutions. 
Additionally, 
international 
 private banking 
places additional 
pressure on 
our policies, 
procedures and 
systems for 
complying with 
the Bank 
Secrecy 
 Act of 1970, as amended, or BSA, and other anti-money laundering, or AML, statutes and regulations. Our failure to strictly 
 adhere to the terms and 
requirements of our OFAC 
license or our failure 
to adequately manage our 
BSA/AML compliance 
 risk 
in light 
of 
our correspondent 
banking 
relationship 
with 
foreign 
financial 
institutions 
and 
international 
private 
banking 
 could result 
in regulatory or 
other actions 
being taken 
against us, 
which could significantly 
increase our compliance 
costs 
 and materially and adversely affect our results of 
operations. 
 We may not recover all amounts that are contractually 
owed to us by our borrowers. 

 We are 
dependent on 
the collection 
of loan 
principal, interest, 
and fees 
to partially 
fund our 
operations. A 
shortfall in 
 collections and proceeds may impair our ability to fund 
our operations or to repay our existing debt. 
 When 
we 
lend 
funds, 
commit 
to 
fund 
a 
loan 
or 
enter 
into 
a 
letter 
of 
credit 
or 
other 
credit-related 
contract 
with 
a 
 counterparty, we incur credit risk. The 
credit quality of our 
portfolio can have a 
significant impact on our 
earnings. We expect 
 to experience charge-offs and delinquencies on our loans 
in the future. Many borrowers have been negatively impacted by 
 the COVID-19 pandemic and related 
economic consequences, and may continue 
to be similarly or more severely 
affected 
 in the future. Our 
customers' actual operating results may be 
worse than our underwriting contemplated when 
we originated 
 the loans, and in these 
circumstances, we could incur 
substantial impairment or 
loss of the value on 
these loans. We 
may 
 fail to identify problems because our customer did not report them in 
a timely manner or, even if the customer did report the 
 problem, we may fail to address it quickly enough or at all, or some loans, due 
to market circumstances, may not be able to 
 be fully rehabilitated. 
Even if customers 
provide us with 
full and accurate 
disclosure of 
all material information 
concerning 
 their businesses, we may misinterpret or incorrectly analyze 
this information. Mistakes may cause us to 
make loans that we 
 otherwise would not have made or to fund 
advances that we otherwise would not 
have funded, either of which could result 
 in losses 
on loans, 
or necessitate 
that we 
significantly 
increase our 
allowance for 
loan and 
lease losses. 
As a 
result, we 
 could suffer 
loan losses 
and have 
non-performing loans, 
which could 
have a 
material adverse 
effect 
on our 
net earnings 
 and results of operations and financial condition, to the extent 
the losses exceed our allowance for loan and lease losses. 
 Some of our 
loans are 
secured by a 
lien on specified 
collateral of the 
borrower and we 
may not obtain 
or properly perfect 
 our liens or the value of the collateral securing any particular loan may not be sufficient to protect us from suffering a partial 
 or complete 
loss 
if the 
loan becomes 
non-performing 
and 
we proceed 
to foreclose 
on or 
repossess 
the collateral. 
With 
 respect 
to 
loans 
that 
we 
originate 
for 
condominium 
or 
homeowners' 
associations, 
or 
the 
Associations, 
these 
loans 
are 
 primarily secured by and rely 
upon the cash flow received 
by the Associations from 
payments received from their property 
 owners, as well 
as cash on 
hand. These Associations 
rely upon payments 
received from 
their property owners 
in order to 
 perform 
on 
these 
loans 
and 
for 
the 
loan collateral. 
Accordingly, 
our 
ability 
to 
recover 
amounts 
on 
non-performing 
loans 
 made to Associations 
is dependent 
upon the Association 
having sufficient 
cash on hand 
for repayment 
of the loan 
and/or 
 having 
the 
ability 
to 
impose 
assessments 
on 
its 
property 
owners, 
some 
of 
whom 
may 
not 
have 
the 
ability 
to 
pay 
such 
 assessments. In such events, we could suffer 
loan losses, which could have a material adverse effect 
on our net earnings, 
 allowance for loan and lease losses, financial condition, 
and results of operations. 
 Non-performing 
assets 
take 
significant 
time 
to 
resolve 
and 
adversely 
affect 
our 
results 
of 
operations 
and 
 financial condition, and could result in further losses in 
the future. 
 Non-performing assets adversely 
affect our net 
income in various 
ways. We do 
not record 
interest income on 
nonaccrual 
 loans or other 
real estate 
owned OREO ), 
thereby adversely 
affecting our 
net income 
and returns on 
assets and 
equity, 
 increasing our loan administration costs and adversely 
affecting our efficiency ratio. When 
we take collateral in foreclosure 
 and similar proceedings, we are 
required to mark the collateral to 
its then-fair market value, which may 
result in a loss. Non-
 performing loans 
and OREO 
also increase our 
risk profile 
and the level 
of capital 
our regulators 
believe is 
appropriate for 
 us to 
maintain in 
light of 
such risks. 
The resolution 
of non-performing 
assets requires 
significant time 
commitments from 
 management and can 
be detrimental to 
the performance 
of their other 
responsibilities. If 
we experience increases 
in non-

Table of Contents

performing 
loans 
and 
non-performing 
assets, 
our 
net 
interest 
income 
may 
be 
negatively 
impacted 
and 
our 
loan 
 administration costs could increase, each of which could have an adverse effect on our net income and related ratios, such 
 as return on assets and equity. 
 We engage in 
lending secured by 
real estate and 
may foreclose on 
the collateral and 
own the underlying 
real 
 estate, subjecting us to the costs 
and potential risks associated with the 
ownership of real property, 
or consumer 
 protection initiatives 
or changes in 
state or federal 
law may substantially 
raise the cost 
of foreclosure 
or prevent 
 us from foreclosing at all. 

 Since we 
originate 
loans secured 
by real 
estate, 
we may 
have to 
foreclose 
on the 
collateral 
property 
to recover 
our 
 investment and may thereafter own and operate such property, 
in which case we would be exposed to the risks inherent in 
 the 
ownership 
of 
real 
estate. 
The 
amount 
that 
we, 
as 
a 
mortgagee, 
may 
realize 
after 
a 
foreclosure 
depends 
on 
factors 
 outside of our 
control, including, 
but not limited 
to, general or 
local economic 
conditions, environmental 
cleanup liabilities, 
 various assessments 
relating to the 
ownership of 
the property, 
interest rates, real 
estate tax rates, 
operating expenses 
of 
 the 
mortgaged 
properties, 
our 
ability 
to 
obtain 
and 
maintain 
adequate 
occupancy 
of 
the 
properties, 
zoning 
laws, 
 governmental and 
regulatory rules, 
and natural 
disasters. Our 
inability to manage 
the amount 
of costs 
or size of 
the risks 
 associated with 
the ownership 
of real 
estate, or 
write-downs in 
the value 
of OREO, 
could have 
an adverse 
effect 
on our 
 business, financial condition, and results of operations. 
 Additionally, 
consumer protection initiatives 
or changes in state 
or federal law may 
substantially increase the 
time and 
 expenses associated 
with the 
residential foreclosure 
process or 
prevent us 
from foreclosing 
at all. 
A number 
of states 
in 
 recent 
years 
have 
either 
considered 
or 
adopted 
foreclosure 
reform 
laws 
that 
make 
it 
substantially 
more 
difficult 
and 
 expensive for 
lenders to 
foreclose on 
residential properties 
in default. 
Furthermore, federal 
regulators have 
prosecuted a 
 number of 
mortgage servicing 
companies for 
alleged consumer 
law violations. 
If new 
state or 
federal laws 
or regulations 
 are ultimately enacted 
that significantly raise 
the cost of 
residential foreclosures 
or raise outright barriers, 
they could have 
 an adverse effect on our business, financial condition, 
and results of operations. 
 We are exposed to risk of environmental liability 
when we take title to property. 

 A 
significant 
portion 
of 
our 
loan 
portfolio 
is 
secured 
by 
real 
estate, 
and 
we 
could 
become 
subject 
to 
environmental 
 liabilities with respect 
to one or 
more of these 
properties, or with 
respect to properties that 
we own in 
operating our business. 
 During the ordinary course of 
business, we may foreclose on and take 
title to properties securing defaulted loans. 
In doing 
 so, there is 
a risk that 
hazardous or toxic 
substances could 
be found on 
these properties. If 
hazardous conditions 
or toxic 
 substances are found 
on these properties, 
we may be 
liable for remediation 
costs, as well 
as for personal 
injury and property 
 damage, civil 
fines and 
criminal penalties 
regardless 
of when 
the hazardous 
conditions or 
toxic substances 
first affected 
 any particular property. 
The costs associated with investigation or 
remediation activities could be substantial. 
In addition, if 
 we are the owner or former owner 
of a contaminated site, we may be 
subject to common law claims 
by third parties based 
 on damages and 
costs resulting 
from environmental 
contamination emanating 
from the 
property. 
If we become 
subject to 
 significant environmental liabilities, our business, financial condition 
and results of operations could be adversely affecte 
d. 
 We 
are 
subject 
to 
certain 
operational 
risks, 
including, 
but 
not 
limited 
to, 
customer, 
employee 
or 
third-party 
 fraud and data processing system failures and errors. 

 Employee errors and employee or 
customer misconduct could subject us 
to financial losses or 
regulatory sanctions and 
 seriously harm our reputation. Misconduct by our employees could include hiding unauthorized 
activities from us, improper 
 or unauthorized activities on behalf of our customers or improper use of confidential information. It is not always possible to 
 prevent employee 
errors and 
misconduct, and 
the precautions we 
take to 
prevent and 
detect this 
activity may 
not be 
effective 
 in all cases. Employee errors could also subject us to financial 
claims for negligence. 
 We have 
implemented a 
system of 
internal controls 
designed to 
mitigate operational 
risks, including 
data processing 
 system failures 
and errors 
and customer 
or employee 
fraud, as 
well as 
insurance 
coverage 
designed to 
protect us 
from 
 material 
losses 
associated 
with 
these 
risks, 
including 
losses 
resulting 
from 
any 
associated 
business 
interruption. 
If 
our 
 internal controls fail 
to prevent or 
detect an 
occurrence, or if 
any resulting loss 
is not 
insured or exceeds 
applicable insurance 
 limits, it could adversely affect our business, 
prospects, cash flow, liquidity, 
financial condition and results of operations. 
 When we originate loans, we rely 
heavily upon information supplied by third parties, 
including the information contained 
 in credit 
applications, property 
appraisals, title 
information, equipment 
pricing and 
valuation and 
employment and 
income 
 documentation, in deciding which loans we will originate, as well as the terms of those loans. If any of the information upon 
 which 
we 
rely 
is 
misrepresented, 
either 
fraudulently 
or 
inadvertently, 
and 
the 
misrepresentation 
is 
not 
detected 
prior 
to 
 funding, 
the 
value of 
the 
loan may 
be significantly 
lower 
than expected, 
or we 
may fund 
a 
loan that 
we 
would not 
have 
 funded or 
on terms 
that do not 
comply with 
our general 
underwriting standards. 
Whether a 
misrepresentation is 
made by 

Table of Contents

the applicant, the borrower, 
one of our employees or another 
third party, 
we generally bear the risk of 
loss associated with 
 the misrepresentation. A loan 
subject to a material 
misrepresentation is typically 
unsellable or subject 
to repurchase if 
it is 
 sold prior to detection of the 
misrepresentation. The sources of 
the misrepresentations are often difficult 
to locate, and it is 
 often difficult 
to recover 
any of 
the 
resulting monetary 
losses 
we may 
suffer, 
which could 
adversely 
affect 
our business, 
 financial condition and results of operations. 
 We are subject to liquidity risk, which could adversely 
affect our financial condition and results 
of operations. 

 Effective liquidity management is essential for the operation of our business. Although we 
have implemented strategies 
 to maintain 
sufficient 
and 
diverse 
sources of 
funding 
to accommodate 
planned, 
as well 
as unanticipated, 
liquidity 
needs 
 (including changes in assets, 
liabilities, and off-balance sheet 
commitments under various economic conditions), 
an inability 
 to 
raise 
funds 
through 
deposits, 
borrowings, 
the 
sale 
of 
investment 
securities 
and 
other 
sources 
could 
have 
a 
material 
 adverse effect on 
our liquidity. Our 
access to 
funding sources in 
amounts adequate to 
finance our 
activities could 
be impaired 
 by factors that affect us specifically or the financial services 
industry in general. Factors that could detrimentally impact 
our 
 access to liquidity sources include a decrease in the level of our business activity due to a market disruption, a decrease in 
 the borrowing capacity assigned to 
our pledged assets by 
our secured creditors, competition from other 
financial institutions 
 which could drive up the 
costs of deposits or adverse 
regulatory action against us. Deterioration in 
economic conditions and 
 the loss of 
confidence in financial 
institutions may increase 
our cost of 
funding and limit 
our access to 
some of our 
customary 
 sources of liquidity, 
including, but not 
limited to, inter-bank 
borrowings and borrowings 
from the Federal 
Home Loan Bank 
 of Atlanta, or 
the FHLB, and 
the Federal Reserve 
Bank of 
Atlanta. Our ability 
to acquire 
deposits or borrow 
could also be 
 impaired by factors 
that are 
not specific 
to us, such 
as a 
severe disruption 
of the 
financial markets 
or negative views 
and 
 expectations 
about the 
prospects 
for 
the financial 
services 
industry 
generally 
as 
a result 
of 
conditions 
faced 
by banking 
 organizations 
in 
the 
domestic 
and 
international 
credit 
markets. 
Any decline 
in 
available 
funding 
or cost 
of 
liquidity could 
 adversely impact our ability to originate loans, invest in securities, meet our expenses 
or fulfill obligations such as repaying 
 our borrowings or 
meeting deposit withdrawal demands, 
any of which 
could, in turn, 
have an adverse 
effect on our 
business, 
 financial condition, and results of operations. 
 We have several 
large depositor relationships, 
the loss of which 
could force us to 
fund our business 
through 
 more expensive and less stable sources. 

 Withdrawals of deposits by any 
one of our largest depositors 
could force us to 
rely more heavily on more 
expensive and 
 less stable funding sources. 
Consequently, 
the occurrence of any 
of these events could 
have a material adverse 
effect on 
 our business, financial condition and results of operations. 
 The value of our securities in our investment portfolio 
may decline in the future. 

 The 
fair 
market 
value 
of 
our 
investment 
securities 
may 
be 
adversely 
affected 
by 
general 
economic 
and 
market 
 conditions, including 
changes 
in interest 
rates, 
credit 
spreads, and 
the 
occurrence 
of any 
events 
adversely 
affecting 
the 
 issuer of particular securities in our investments portfolio 
or any given market segment or industry in 
which we are invested. 
 Any of these factors, among others, could cause OTTI and realized and/or unrealized losses in future periods and declines 
 in 
other 
comprehensive 
income, 
which could 
have 
an 
adverse 
effect 
on 
our 
business, 
financial 
condition 
and 
results 
of 
 operations. 
The 
process 
for 
determining 
whether 
impairment 
of 
a 
security 
is 
OTTI 
usually 
requires 
complex, 
subjective 
 judgments about the 
future financial performance 
and liquidity of 
the issuer, 
any collateral underlying 
the security and 
our 
 intent and ability to hold the security for a sufficient period of time to allow for any anticipated recovery in fair value, in order 
 to assess the probability of receiving 
all contractual principal and interest 
payments on the security. 
Our failure to correctly 
 and timely assess 
any impairments or 
losses with respect 
to our securities 
could have an 
adverse effect 
on our business, 
 financial condition and results of operations. 
 We may not 
effectively execute 
on our expansion 
strategy, which 
may adversely affect 
our ability to 
maintain 
 our historical growth and earnings trends. 

 Our 
primary 
expansion 
strategy 
focuses 
on 
organic 
growth, 
supplemented 
by 
potential 
acquisitions 
of 
financial 
 institutions and 
banking teams; 
however, 
we may 
not be 
able to 
successfully execute 
on these 
aspects of 
our expansion 
 strategy, 
which 
may 
cause 
our 
future 
growth 
rate 
to 
decline 
below 
our 
recent 
historical 
levels, 
or 
may 
prevent 
us 
from 
 growing at 
all. More 
specifically, 
we may not 
be able 
to generate 
sufficient new 
loans and 
deposits within 
acceptable risk 
 and 
expense 
tolerances 
or 
obtain 
the 
personnel 
or 
funding 
necessary 
for 
additional 
growth. 
Various 
factors, 
such 
as 
 economic conditions 
and competition 
with other financial 
institutions, may impede 
or restrict the 
growth of 
our operations. 
 Further, we may be unable to attract 
and retain experienced bankers, which could 
adversely affect our growth. The success 
 of our strategy also depends on our ability to manage our growth effectively, 
which in turn depends on a number of factors, 
 including 
our 
ability 
to 
adapt 
our 
credit, 
operational, 
technology, 
risk 
management, 
internal 
controls 
and 
governance 
 infrastructure to accommodate expanded operations. 
Even if we are successful in continuing our growth, 
such growth may 

Table of Contents 

29 
USCB Financial Holdings, Inc. 
2022 10-K 

not offer the 
same levels of 
potential profitability, 
and we may not 
be successful in 
controlling costs and maintaining 
asset 
 quality in the 
face of 
that growth. Accordingly, 
our inability to 
maintain growth 
or to 
effectively manage 
growth could 
have 
 an adverse effect on our business, financial condition 
and results of operations. 
 New lines of business, products, product enhancements 
or services may subject us to additional risk. 

 From time to time, 
we may implement new 
lines of business or 
offer new products 
and product enhancements 
as well 
 as new 
services within 
our existing 
lines of 
business. There 
are substantial 
risks and 
uncertainties associated 
with these 
 efforts. In 
developing, implementing 
or marketing new 
lines of business, 
products, product 
enhancements or 
services, we 
 may invest significant time and 
resources. We may underestimate the appropriate level 
of resources or expertise necessary 
 to 
make 
new 
lines 
of 
business 
or 
products 
successful 
or 
to 
realize 
their 
expected 
benefits. 
We 
may 
not 
achieve 
the 
 milestones 
set 
in 
initial 
timetables 
for 
the 
development 
and 
introduction 
of 
new 
lines 
of 
business, 
products, 
product 
 enhancements or services, and price 
and profitability targets may not 
prove feasible. External factors, such 
as compliance 
 with regulations, competitive 
alternatives and shifting 
market preferences, may 
also impact the 
ultimate implementation of 
 a new line of business or offerings of new products, product 
enhancements or services. Any new line of business, 
product, 
 product enhancement or service could have a significant impact on the effectiveness of our system of internal controls. We 
 may also 
decide to 
discontinue 
businesses 
or products, 
due to 
lack 
of customer 
acceptance 
or unprofitability. 
Failure to 
 successfully develop and implement new lines of business or offerings of new products, product enhancements or services 
 could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results 
of operations and could subject us to new and 
 unanticipated operational, credit, regulatory and reputational risks, 
among other risks. 
 Our business 
needs and 
future growth 
may require 
us to 
raise additional 
capital and 
that capital 
may not 
be 
 available on terms acceptable to us or may be dilutive to 
existing shareholders. 

 We believe that 
we have sufficient capital 
to meet our capital 
needs for our current 
growth plans. However, 
we expect 
 that we 
will need 
to raise 
additional capital, 
in the 
form of 
debt or 
equity securities, 
in the 
future to 
have sufficient 
capital 
 resources 
to 
meet 
our 
longer-term 
growth 
plans, 
and/or 
if 
the 
quality 
of 
our 
assets 
or 
earnings 
were 
to 
deteriorate 
 significantly. 
In addition, we 
are required by federal 
regulatory authorities to 
maintain adequate levels 
of capital to support 
 our operations. 
 Our ability 
to raise 
capital will 
depend on, 
among other 
things, conditions 
in the 
capital markets, 
which are 
outside of 
 our control, and our financial performance. Accordingly, 
we cannot provide assurance that such capital 
will be available on 
 terms acceptable to us or at all. Any occurrence 
that limits our access to capital may adversely 
affect our capital costs and 
 our ability to raise capital. Further, if we need to raise capital in the future, we may have to do so when many other financial 
 institutions are also 
seeking to 
raise capital and 
would then 
have to 
compete with those 
institutions for investors. 
Any inability 
 to raise capital on acceptable terms when needed may cause us to 
either issue additional shares of common stock or other 
 securities on less than 
desirable terms or 
reduce our rate of 
growth until market conditions 
become more favorable. If 
any 
 of such 
events occur, they could 
have a material 
adverse effect on 
our business, financial 
condition and results 
of operations 
 and could be dilutive to both tangible book value and our 
share price. 
 In 
addition, 
an 
inability 
to 
raise 
capital 
when 
needed 
may 
subject 
us 
to 
increased 
regulatory 
supervision 
and 
the 
 imposition of 
restrictions 
on 
our growth 
and 
business. 
These 
restrictions 
could 
negatively 
affect 
our ability 
to operate 
or 
 further 
expand 
our 
operations 
through 
loan 
growth, 
acquisitions 
or 
the 
establishment 
of 
additional 
branches. 
These 
 restrictions 
may 
also 
result 
in 
increases 
in 
operating 
expenses 
and 
reductions 
in 
revenues 
that 
could 
have 
a 
material 
 adverse effect on our financial condition, results 
of operations and our share price. 
 We may 
grow through 
mergers or 
acquisitions, 
a strategy 
that may 
not be 
successful or, 
if successful, 
may 
 produce risks in successfully integrating and managing the merged companies or acquisitions and may dilute our 
 shareholders. 

 As 
part 
of 
our 
growth 
strategy, 
we 
may 
pursue 
mergers 
and 
acquisitions 
of 
banks 
and 
non-bank 
financial 
services 
 companies within or outside our principal market areas that fit within the mission-driven values of our franchise and that we 
 believe support our business and make financial and strategic 
sense. We may have difficulty identifying suitable acquisition 
 candidates or executing on acquisitions that we pursue, and we may 
not realize the anticipated benefits of any transactions 
 we complete. Additionally, 
for any opportunistic 
acquisition we 
were to consider, 
we expect to 
face significant 
competition 
 from 
numerous 
other 
financial 
services 
institutions, 
many 
of 
which 
will 
have 
greater 
financial 
resources 
than 
we 
do. 
 Accordingly, 
attractive opportunistic 
acquisitions 
may 
not be 
available to 
us. There 
can be 
no assurance 
that 
we will 
be 
 successful in identifying or completing any future acquisitions. 

Table of Contents

2022 10-K 

Mergers and acquisitions involve numerous risks, 
any of which could harm our business, including: 
 
the possibility that expected benefits 
may not materialize in the 
time frame expected or at 
all, or may be more 
costly 
 to achieve, or that the acquired business will not perform 
to our expectations; 
 
time, 
expense 
and 
difficulties 
in 
integrating 
the 
operations, 
management, 
products 
and 
services, 
technologies, 
 existing contracts, accounting processes 
and personnel of the target 
and realizing the anticipated synergies 
of the 
 combined businesses; 
 
incurring the 
time and 
expense associated with 
identifying and 
evaluating potential acquisitions 
and merger partners 
 and negotiating potential transactions, resulting in management s attention being diverted from the operation of our 
 existing business; 
 
difficulties in supporting and transitioning customers 
of the target and disruption of our ongoing banking business; 
 
the price we 
pay or other 
resources that 
we devote may 
exceed the value 
we realize, or 
the value we 
could have 
 realized if we had allocated the purchase consideration 
or other resources to another opportunity; 
 
entering new markets or areas in which we have limited 
or no experience; 
 
the possibility that our culture is disrupted as a result of 
an acquisition; 
 
potential loss of key personnel and customers from 
either our business or the target s business; 
 
assumption of unanticipated problems, claims or other liabilities 
of the acquired business; 
 
an inability to realize expected synergies or returns on 
investment; 
 
the possibility of regulatory approval for the acquisition being delayed, 
impeded, restrictively conditioned, including 
 the requirement to divest 
various activities, or denied 
due to existing or 
new regulatory issues surrounding 
us, the 
 target institution or the proposed combined entity and 
the possibility that any such issues associated with 
the target 
 institution, of which we 
may or may 
not be aware 
at the time 
of the acquisition, 
could adversely impact the 
combined 
 entity after completion of the acquisition; 
 
the possibility that the acquisition may not be timely completed, 
if at all; 
 
the need to raise capital; and 
 
inability to generate sufficient revenue to offset 
acquisition costs. 
 Our acquisition 
activities could 
require us 
to use 
a substantial 
amount of 
cash, other 
liquid assets, 
and/or incur 
debt. 
 Also, 
if 
we finance 
acquisitions 
by issuing 
equity 
securities, 
our 
existing 
shareholders 
ownership 
may 
be 
diluted, 
which 
 could negatively 
affect the 
market price of 
our Class A 
common stock. 
Additionally, 
if the goodwill 
recorded in 
connection 
 with our 
potential future 
acquisitions 
were determined 
to be 
impaired, 
then 
we would 
be required 
to recognize 
a charge 
 against our 
earnings, which 
could materially 
and adversely 
affect 
our results 
of operations 
during the 
period in 
which the 
 impairment was 
recognized. Acquisitions 
may also 
involve the 
payment of 
a premium 
over book 
and market 
values and, 
 therefore, some 
dilution of 
our tangible 
book value 
and net 
income per 
common share 
may occur 
in connection 
with any 
 future transaction. 

 As a result, we 
may not achieve the 
anticipated benefits of 
any such merger or 
acquisition, and we may 
incur costs in 
 excess 
of 
what 
we 
anticipate. 
Our 
failure 
to 
successfully 
evaluate 
and 
execute 
mergers, 
acquisitions 
or 
investments 
or 
 otherwise adequately address and 
manage the risks associated with 
such transactions could have 
a material adverse effect 
 on our business, results of operations and financial condition, 
including short-term and long-term liquidity. 
 The loss of 
one or more 
of our key 
personnel, or our 
failure to attract 
and retain other 
highly qualified personnel 
 in the future, could harm our business. 

 Our future success will, to some extent, depend on the continued service of our directors, executive officers and senior 
 management 
team. 
The 
loss 
of 
the 
services 
of 
any 
of 
these 
individuals 
could 
have 
a 
significant 
adverse 
effect 
on 
our 
 business. 
In 
particular, 
we 
believe 
that 
retaining 
Luis 
de 
la 
Aguilera, 
our 
President 
and 
Chief 
Executive 
Officer, 
Robert 
 Anderson, our Chief Financial Officer, 
and Benigno Pazos, our Chief Credit Officer, 
is important to our continuing success. 
 Although 
we 
have 
entered 
into 
employment 
and 
other 
agreements 
with 
certain 
members 
of 
our 
executive 
and 
senior 
 management team, 
including Mr. 
de la 
Aguilera and 
Mr. 
Anderson, no 
assurance can 
be given 
that these 
individuals will 
 continue to be employed by us. The loss of any of these individuals could negatively affect our ability to achieve our growth 
 strategy and could have a material adverse effect 
on our business and results of operations. 
 We also need to continue 
to attract and retain other senior 
management and to recruit qualified 
individuals to succeed 
 existing 
key 
personnel 
to 
ensure 
the continued 
growth 
and successful 
operation 
of 
our business. 
We 
may be 
unable 
to 
 attract or 
retain qualified 
management 
and other 
key 
personnel 
in the 
future 
due 
to the 
intense competition 
for 
qualified 
 personnel 
among 
companies 
in 
the 
financial 
services 
business 
and 
related 
businesses. 
The 
loss 
of 
the 
services 
of 
any 
 senior management personnel, or the inability to recruit 
and retain qualified personnel in the future, could 
have an adverse 
 effect on our business, results of 
operations, financial condition and prospects. 
Additionally, 
to attract and retain personnel 
 with appropriate skills and 
knowledge to support our 
business, we may offer 
a variety of benefits, including 
equity awards, 
 which may reduce our earnings or adversely affect 
our business, results of operations, financial condition or 
prospects.

Damage to our reputation could significantly harm 
our businesses. 
 Our ability to attract 
and retain customers and 
highly-skilled management and employees is impacted 
by our reputation. 
 A negative public 
opinion of us 
and our business 
can result from 
any number of 
activities, including our 
lending practices, 
 corporate 
governance 
and 
regulatory 
compliance, 
acquisitions, 
customer 
complaints 
and 
actions 
taken 
by 
community 
 organizations in 
response to 
these activities. 
Furthermore, negative 
publicity regarding 
us as 
an employer 
could have 
an 
 adverse 
impact 
on our 
reputation, 
especially 
with respect 
to matters 
of diversity, 
pay equity 
and 
workplace 
harassment. 
 Significant 
harm 
to 
our 
reputation 
could 
also 
arise 
as 
a 
result 
of 
regulatory 
or 
governmental 
actions, 
litigation 
and 
the 
 activities of our customers, other 
participants in the financial services 
industry or our contractual counterparties, such 
as our 
 service providers 
and 
vendors. 
The potential 
harm 
is heightened 
given 
increased attention 
to how 
corporations 
address 
 environmental, social 
and governance 
issues. In 
addition, a cybersecurity 
event affecting 
us or our 
customers' data 
could 
 have a negative 
impact on our 
reputation and 
customer confidence 
in us and 
our cybersecurity 
practices. Damage 
to our 
 reputation could also 
adversely affect 
our credit ratings 
and access to 
the capital markets. 
Additionally, 
whereas negative 
 public opinion once was 
primarily driven by adverse 
news coverage in traditional 
media, the widespread use 
of social media 
 platforms 
by virtually 
every segment 
of society 
facilitates 
the rapid 
dissemination 
of information 
or misinformation, 
which 
 magnifies the potential harm to our reputation. 
 We 
face 
strong 
competition 
from 
financial 
services 
companies 
and 
other 
companies 
that 
offer 
banking 
 services, which could materially and adversely affect 
our business. 

 The financial 
services industry has 
become even 
more competitive as 
a result 
of legislative, 
regulatory and technological 
 changes and 
continued 
banking consolidation, 
which may 
increase as 
a result 
of 
current economic, 
market and 
political 
 conditions. We 
face substantial 
competition 
in all 
phases 
of our 
operations 
from 
a variety 
of competitors, 
including local 
 banks, 
regional 
banks, 
community 
banks 
and, 
more 
recently, 
financial 
technology, 
or 
"fintech" 
companies. 
Many 
of 
our 
 competitors offer the same banking services 
that we offer and our 
success depends on our ability to 
adapt our products and 
 services 
to 
evolving 
industry 
standards 
and 
customer 
requirements. 
Increased 
competition 
in 
our 
market 
may 
result 
in 
 reduced new 
loan and 
lease production 
and/or decreased 
deposit balances 
or less 
favorable terms 
on loans 
and leases 
 and/or deposit 
accounts. We also 
face competition 
from many 
other types 
of financial 
institutions, including without 
limitation, 
 non-bank 
specialty 
lenders, 
insurance 
companies, 
private 
investment 
funds, 
investment 
banks, 
and 
other 
financial 
 intermediaries. Should competition in 
the financial services industry 
intensify, our ability to market our 
products and services 
 may be adversely affected. If we are unable to attract and retain banking customers, we may 
be unable to grow or maintain 
 the levels 
of our 
loans and 
deposits and 
our results 
of operations 
and financial 
condition may 
be adversely 
affected as 
a 
 result. Ultimately, 
we may not be able to compete successfully against current 
and future competitors. 
 We must respond to rapid technological changes 
to remain competitive. 

 We will 
have to respond 
to future 
technological changes, 
which are occurring 
at a rapid 
pace in the 
financial services 
 industry. 
We 
expect 
that 
new 
technologies 
and 
business 
processes 
applicable 
to 
the 
banking 
industry 
will 
continue 
to 
 emerge, and these 
new technologies and business 
processes may be 
better than those we 
currently use. Because the 
pace 
 of technological change 
is high and our 
industry is intensely 
competitive, our future 
success will depend, 
in part, upon our 
 ability to address 
the needs of our 
customers by using technology 
to provide products and 
services that will satisfy 
customer 
 demands for convenience, 
as well as to 
create additional efficiencies 
in our operations. We 
may not be able 
to implement 
 new technology-driven 
products and services 
effectively or 
be successful in 
marketing these 
products and services 
to our 
 customers. Failure to keep pace successfully with technological change affecting the financial services industry could harm 
 our 
ability 
to 
compete 
effectively 
and 
could 
have 
an 
adverse 
effect 
on 
our 
business, 
financial 
condition 
and 
results 
of 
 operations. As 
these 
technologies 
improve 
in the 
future, 
we may 
be required 
to make 
significant capital 
expenditures 
in 
 order to remain 
competitive, which may increase 
our overall expenses 
and have an 
adverse effect on our 
business, financial 
 condition and results of operations. 
 A 
failure, 
interruption, 
or 
breach 
in 
the 
security 
of 
our 
systems, 
or 
those 
of 
our 
contracted 
vendors, 
could 
 disrupt 
our 
business, 
result 
in 
the 
disclosure 
of 
confidential 
information, 
damage 
our 
reputation, 
and 
create 
 significant financial and legal exposure. 
 Although we 
devote significant 
resources to 
maintain and regularly 
update our 
systems and processes 
that are designed 
 to 
protect 
the 
security 
of 
our 
computer 
systems, 
software, 
networks 
and 
other 
technology 
assets, 
as 
well 
as 
the 
 confidentiality, 
integrity and availability 
of information belonging 
to us and 
our customers, 
there is no 
assurance that 
all of 
 our 
security 
measures 
will 
provide 
absolute 
security. 
Many 
financial 
institutions, 
including 
us, 
have 
been 
subjected 
to 
 attempts 
to 
infiltrate 
the 
security 
of 
their 
websites 
or 
other 
systems, 
some 
involving 
sophisticated 
and 
targeted 
attacks 
 intended 
to 
obtain 
unauthorized 
access 
to 
confidential 
information, 
destroy 
data, 
disrupt 
or 
degrade 
service, 
sabotage 
 systems or cause 
other damage, including 
through the introduction of 
computer viruses or 
malware, cyber-attacks and other

means. We 
have been 
targeted by 
individuals and 
groups using 
phishing campaigns, 
pretext calling, 
malicious code 
and 
 viruses and expect to 
be subject to such 
attacks in the future. 
While we have 
not experienced a material 
cyber-incident or 
 security breach that has 
been successful in compromising 
our data or systems 
to date, we can 
never be certain that 
all of 
 our systems are entirely free from vulnerability to breaches 
of security or other technological difficulties or 
failures. 
 Despite efforts to 
ensure the integrity 
and security of 
our systems, it 
is possible that 
we may not be 
able to anticipate, 
 detect or recognize 
threats to our 
systems or 
to implement effective 
preventive measures 
against all efforts 
to breach our 
 security inside or outside our business, especially because the techniques used to attack our 
systems change frequently or 
 are 
not 
recognized 
until 
launched, 
and 
because 
cyber-attacks 
can 
originate 
from 
a 
wide 
variety 
of 
sources, 
including 
 individuals or groups who are associated 
with external service providers or who are or 
may be involved in organized crime 
 or linked 
to terrorist 
organizations or 
hostile foreign 
governments. Those 
parties may 
also attempt 
to fraudulently 
induce 
 employees, customers, third-party service providers or other users of our systems to disclose sensitive information in order 
 to gain access 
to our data or 
that of our customers 
or clients. Similar to 
other companies, our 
risks and exposures 
related 
 to cybersecurity 
attacks have 
increased as 
a result 
of the COVID 
-19 pandemic, 
the related 
increased reliance 
on remote 
 working and increase in digital operations. Such 
risks and exposures are expected to remain high 
for the foreseeable future 
 due to 
the rapidly 
evolving nature 
and sophistication 
of these 
threats and 
the expanding 
use of 
technology, 
as our 
web-
 based product offerings grow and we expand internal 
usage of web-based applications. 
 A successful 
penetration or 
circumvention 
of 
the security 
of 
our systems, 
including those 
of 
our third-party 
vendors, 
 could 
cause 
serious 
negative 
consequences, 
including 
significant 
disruption 
of 
our 
operations, 
misappropriation 
of 
 confidential information, 
or damage 
to computers 
or systems, 
and may result 
in violations 
of applicable 
privacy and 
other 
 laws, financial loss, 
loss of confidence 
in our security measures, 
customer dissatisfaction, increased 
insurance premiums, 
 significant litigation exposure and harm to our reputation, all of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, 
 financial condition, results of operations, and future prospects. 
 We 
rely 
on 
other 
companies 
to 
provide 
key 
components 
of 
our 
business 
infrastructure 
and 
our 
operations 
 could 
be 
interrupted 
if 
our 
third-party 
service 
providers 
experience 
difficulty, 
terminate 
their 
services 
or 
fail 
to 
 comply with banking regulations. 

 Third parties 
provide key 
components of 
our business 
operations such 
as data 
processing, recording 
and monitoring 
 transactions, 
online 
banking 
interfaces 
and services, 
Internet 
connections 
and 
network 
access. While 
we have 
selected 
 these third-party 
vendors carefully, 
performing upfront 
due diligence 
and ongoing 
monitoring activities, 
we do 
not control 
 their actions. Any problems caused by these third parties, including those resulting from disruptions in services provided by 
 a 
vendor 
(including 
as 
a 
result 
of 
a 
cyber-attack, 
other 
information 
security 
event 
or 
a 
natural 
disaster), 
financial 
or 
 operational difficulties 
for the vendor, 
issues at third-party 
vendors to our 
vendors, failure of 
a vendor to 
handle current or 
 higher volumes, failure of a vendor to provide services for any reason, 
poor performance of services, failure to comply with 
 applicable laws 
and regulations, 
or fraud 
or misconduct 
on the 
part of 
employees of 
any of 
our vendors, 
could adversely 
 affect our 
ability to deliver 
products and services 
to our customers, 
our reputation and 
our ability to 
conduct our business, 
 which could 
adversely affect 
our business, 
prospects, cash 
flow, 
liquidity, 
financial condition 
and results 
of operations. 
In 
 certain 
situations, 
replacing 
these 
third-party 
vendors 
could 
also 
create 
significant 
delay, 
expense, 
and 
operational 
 difficulties, which 
could also 
adversely affect 
our business. 
Accordingly, 
use of 
such third 
parties creates 
an unavoidable 
 and 
inherent 
risk 
to 
our 
business 
operations. 
Such 
risk 
is 
generally 
expected 
to 
remain 
elevated 
until 
the 
COVID-19 
 pandemic 
subsides 
and 
may 
remain 
elevated 
thereafter, 
as 
many 
of 
our 
vendors 
have 
also 
been, 
and 
may 
further 
be, 
 affected by increased 
reliance on remote 
work environments, market 
volatility and other factors 
that increase their risks 
of 
 business disruption or 
that may otherwise 
affect their ability 
to perform under 
the terms of 
any agreements with 
us or provide 
 essential services. 
 Our operations could be interrupted or 
materially impacted if any of our 
third-party service providers fail to comply 
with 
 banking regulations 
and other 
applicable laws. 
The Federal 
Reserve, FDIC, 
the Florida 
Office of 
Financial Regulation, 
or 
 the FOFR, and other regulators expect financial institutions to be responsible for all aspects of their performance, including 
 aspects that they delegate 
to third parties. Accordingly, 
we will be responsible 
for deficiencies in 
our oversight and control 
 of our third party relationships 
and in the performance 
of the parties with 
which we have these 
relationships. As a result, 
if 
 our regulators 
conclude that 
we have 
not exercised 
adequate oversight 
and control 
over our 
third party 
vendors or 
other 
 ongoing third party business 
relationships or that such 
third parties have not performed 
appropriately, 
we could be subject 
 to remedial and/or enforcement 
actions, including civil money penalties 
or other administrative or judicial 
penalties or fines 
 as well as requirements for customer remediation, any 
of which could have a material 
adverse effect our business, financial 
 condition or results of operations.

Litigation and regulatory actions, 
including possible enforcement actions, could subject 
us to significant fines, 
 penalties, 
judgments 
or 
other 
requirements 
resulting 
in 
increased 
expenses 
or 
restrictions 
on 
our 
business 
 activities. 

 In the normal course of business, 
from time to time, we 
have in the past and 
may in the future be 
named as a defendant 
 in various 
legal actions 
arising in 
connection 
with our 
current and/or 
prior business 
activities. Legal 
actions could 
include 
 claims for substantial compensatory 
or punitive damages 
or claims for 
indeterminate amounts of 
damages. Further, 
in the 
 future 
our 
regulators 
may 
impose 
consent 
orders, 
civil 
money 
penalties, 
matters 
requiring 
attention, 
or 
similar 
types 
of 
 supervisory penalties 
or criticism. 
We may 
also, from 
time to time, 
be the subject 
of subpoenas, 
requests for 
information, 
 reviews, investigations and proceedings (both formal and informal) by governmental agencies 
regarding our current and/or 
 prior 
business 
activities. 
Any 
such 
legal 
or 
regulatory 
actions 
may 
subject 
us 
to 
substantial 
compensatory 
or 
punitive 
 damages, 
significant 
fines, 
penalties, 
obligations 
to 
change 
our 
business 
practices 
or 
other 
requirements 
resulting 
in 
 increased 
expenses, 
diminished 
income 
and 
damage 
to 
our 
reputation. 
Our 
involvement 
in 
any 
such 
matters, 
whether 
 tangential or otherwise and 
even if the matters are 
ultimately determined in our 
favor, could 
also cause significant harm 
to 
 our reputation and divert management attention away from 
the operation of our business. Further, any 
settlement, consent 
 order or adverse 
judgment in 
connection with 
any formal 
or informal 
proceeding or 
investigation by 
government agencies 
 may result in 
litigation, investigations or proceedings 
as other litigants 
and government agencies begin 
independent reviews 
 of the same 
activities. As a 
result, the outcome of 
legal and regulatory 
actions could have 
an adverse effect on 
our business, 
 results of operations and results of operations. 
 Certain of 
our directors may 
have conflicts 
of interest in 
determining whether to 
present business 
opportunities 
 to us or another entity with which they are, or may 
become, affiliated. 

 Certain of our directors 
are or may 
become subject to fiduciary 
obligations in connection with 
their service on the 
boards 
 of 
directors 
of 
other 
corporations, 
including 
financial 
institutions. 
A 
director's 
association 
with 
other 
financial 
institutions, 
 which give rise to 
fiduciary or contractual obligations to such other 
institutions, may create conflicts of interest. To the extent 
 that any of our directors 
become aware of acquisition 
opportunities that may be 
suitable for entities other 
than us to which 
 they have fiduciary or contractual obligations, or they are 
presented with such opportunities in their capacities as fiduciaries 
 to such 
entities, they 
may honor 
such obligations 
to such 
other entities. 
You 
should assume 
that to 
the extent 
any of 
our 
 directors become 
aware of an 
opportunity that may 
be suitable both 
for us and 
another entity to 
which such person 
has a 
 fiduciary obligation 
or contractual 
obligation 
to present 
such 
opportunity as 
set forth 
above, 
he or 
she may 
first give 
the 
 opportunity to such other entity 
or entities and may give 
such opportunity to us only 
to the extent such other 
entity or entities 
 reject 
or 
are 
unable 
to 
pursue 
such 
opportunity. 
In 
addition, 
you 
should 
assume 
that 
to 
the 
extent 
any 
of 
our 
directors 
 become 
aware 
of 
an 
acquisition 
opportunity 
that 
does 
not 
fall 
within 
the 
above 
parameters, 
but 
that 
may 
otherwise 
be 
 suitable for us, he or she may not present such opportunity to 
us. 
 Pursuant to an agreement between us and each of our Significant Investors 
(as defined below), each of the Significant 
 Investors has the right 
to nominate one 
director to serve 
on our Board, including 
Board committees, and 
to designate one 
 non-voting Board 
observer. 
The directors 
and Board 
observers designated 
by the 
Significant Investors 
have the 
right to, 
 and have 
no duty 
not to, 
engage in 
the same 
or similar 
business activities 
or lines 
of business 
as us. 
In the 
event that 
a 
 director or Board observer designated by a Significant Investor acquires knowledge of a potential transaction or matter that 
 may be 
a corporate opportunity 
for us, 
such person 
shall have 
no duty 
to communicate or 
present such corporate 
opportunity 
 to us 
and shall 
not be 
liable to 
us or 
our shareholders 
for breach 
of any 
duty by 
reason of 
the fact 
that such 
person or 
a 
 related investment fund 
thereof, directly or 
indirectly, pursues or acquires such opportunity 
for itself, directs such 
opportunity 
 to another person, or does not present such opportunity to 
us. 

 Risks Related to Our Tax, 
Accounting and Regulatory Compliance 
 Our 
ability 
to 
recognize 
the 
benefits 
of 
deferred 
tax 
assets 
is 
dependent 
on 
future 
cash 
flows 
and 
taxable 
 income and may be materially impaired upon significant 
changes in ownership of our common stock. 
 We recognize the expected future tax benefit 
from deferred tax assets when it 
is more likely than not 
that the tax benefit 
 will be realized. Otherwise, a valuation allowance is applied against deferred tax assets, reducing the value of such assets. 
 Assessing 
the 
recoverability 
of 
deferred 
tax 
assets 
requires 
management 
to 
make 
significant 
estimates 
related 
to 
 expectations 
of 
future 
taxable 
income 
from 
all 
sources, 
including 
reversal 
of 
taxable 
temporary 
differences, 
forecasted 
 operating 
earnings 
and 
available 
tax 
planning 
strategies. 
Estimates 
of 
future 
taxable 
income 
are 
based 
on 
forecasted 
 income from operations and the application of existing tax laws in each jurisdiction. The improved risk profile of the Bank is 
 a key component 
used in the 
determination of 
our ability 
to realize the 
expected future 
benefit of 
our deferred 
tax assets. 
 To 
the extent that future taxable income differs 
significantly from estimates as a result of 
the interest rate environment and 
 loan growth capabilities or other factors, our ability to realize 
the net deferred tax assets could be negatively 
affected.

Subject to certain exceptions, our Class A common stock is subject 
to transfer restrictions as set forth in our Articles of 
 Incorporation that are 
designed to preserve 
our deferred tax 
assets. Notwithstanding these 
protective provisions, the 
Articles 
 of Incorporation include 
an exception that 
allows our Significant 
Investors the right 
to effect any 
transfer that would 
otherwise 
 be prohibited, which transfer could result in the loss of the deferred 
tax assets. 
 Additionally, 
significant future 
issuances of 
common 
stock or 
common stock 
equivalents, or 
changes in 
the 
direct or 
 indirect ownership 
of our 
common stock 
or common 
stock equivalents, 
could cause 
an ownership 
change and 
could limit 
 our ability to 
utilize our net 
operating loss carryforwards 
and other tax 
attributes pursuant 
to Section 382 
and Section 383 
 of the Internal Revenue Code. 
Future changes in tax law 
or changes in ownership structure 
could limit our ability to utilize 
 our recorded net deferred tax assets. 

 The 
accuracy 
of 
our 
financial 
statements 
and 
related 
disclosures 
could 
be 
affected 
if 
the 
judgments, 
 assumptions or estimates used in our critical accounting 
policies are inaccurate. 
 The 
preparation 
of 
our 
financial 
statements 
and 
related 
disclosures 
in 
conformity 
with 
GAAP 
requires 
us 
to 
make 
 judgments, 
assumptions 
and 
estimates 
that 
affect 
the 
amounts 
reported 
in 
our 
consolidated 
financial 
statements 
and 
 accompanying notes. In some cases, management 
must select the accounting policy or method 
to apply from two or more 
 alternatives, 
any of 
which 
may be 
reasonable 
under 
the circumstances, 
yet which 
may result 
in 
our 
reporting 
materially 
 different 
results 
than 
would 
have 
been 
reported 
under 
a 
different 
alternative. 
Certain 
accounting 
policies 
are 
critical 
or 
 significant to presenting our financial 
condition and results of operations. 
Our critical accounting policies, which 
are included 
 in the section captioned 
"Management's Discussion and 
Analysis of Financial Condition 
and Results of 
Operations" in this 
 Annual Report 
on Form 
10-K, describe 
those significant 
accounting 
policies and 
methods used 
in the 
preparation of 
our 
 consolidated financial statements that we 
consider critical because they 
require judgments, assumptions and estimates that 
 materially affect 
our consolidated 
financial 
statements 
and related 
disclosures. 
As a 
result, 
if future 
events 
or regulatory 
 views concerning such 
analyses differ significantly from 
the judgments, assumptions and 
estimates in our 
critical accounting 
 policies, those 
events or 
assumptions could 
have a 
material impact 
on our 
consolidated financial 
statements and 
related 
 disclosures, in each 
case resulting in 
our need to 
revise or restate 
prior period financial 
statements, cause 
damage to our 
 reputation and 
the price 
of our 
Class A 
common 
stock and 
adversely affect 
our business, 
prospects, cash 
flow, 
liquidity, 
 financial condition and results of operations. 
 As a new public 
company, we may not efficiently or effectively create an 
effective internal control environment, 
 and any 
future failure 
to maintain 
effective internal 
control over 
financial reporting 
could impair 
the reliability 
of 
 our financial 
statements, which 
in turn could 
harm our business, 
impair investor 
confidence in the 
accuracy and 
 completeness of 
our financial 
reports and 
our access 
to the 
capital markets, 
cause the 
price of 
our Class 
A common 
 stock to decline and subject us to regulatory penalt 
ies. 
 Our management is responsible for establishing 
and maintaining adequate internal control over financial 
reporting and 
 for 
evaluating 
and 
reporting 
on 
that 
system 
of 
internal 
control. 
Our 
internal 
control 
over 
financial 
reporting 
consists 
of 
a 
 process 
designed 
to 
provide 
reasonable 
assurance 
regarding 
the 
reliability 
of 
financial 
reporting 
and 
the 
preparation 
of 
 financial statements for external purposes in accordance with GAAP. 
As a public company, 
we are required to comply with 
 SEC regulations, including 
the Sarbanes-Oxley Act 
and other rules 
that govern public 
companies that we 
previously were 
 not required to comply with 
as a private company. 
In particular, 
we are required to certify 
our compliance with Section 
404 
 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act 
beginning with this Annual 
Report on Form 10-K, 
which requires us to annually 
furnish a report 
 by management on 
the effectiveness 
of our internal 
control over financial 
reporting. When 
evaluating our internal 
controls 
 over financial 
reporting, we 
may identify 
material 
weaknesses 
that we 
may not 
be able 
to remediate 
in time 
to meet 
the 
 applicable deadline imposed upon 
us for compliance with 
the requirements of Section 
404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley 
Act. We 
 are 
in 
the 
process 
of 
reviewing 
our 
formal 
policies, 
processes 
and 
practices 
related 
to 
financial 
reporting 
and 
to 
the 
 identification of key financial reporting 
risks, assessment of their potential impact 
and linkage of those 
risks to specific areas 
 and controls within our organization. 
 If we fail to achieve and maintain the adequacy of 
our internal controls, as such standards are modified, supplemented, 
 or amended from time 
to time, we may not 
be able to ensure 
that we will be able 
to conclude on an ongoing 
basis that we 
 have 
effective 
internal 
controls 
over 
financial 
reporting 
in 
accordance 
with 
Section 
404 
of 
the 
Sarbanes-Oxley 
Act. 
We 
 cannot be certain as to the timing of completion of our evaluation, testing, 
and any remediation actions or the impact of the 
 same on 
our operations. 
If we fail 
to adequately 
comply with 
the requirements 
of Section 404 
of the Sarbanes 
-Oxley Act, 
 we may be subject to adverse regulatory consequences and 
there could be a negative reaction in the 
financial markets due 
 to a loss of investor confidence in us and the 
reliability of our financial statements. 
In addition, we may be required to incur 
 costs in improving 
our internal control 
system and 
hiring additional 
personnel. Any such 
action could negatively 
affect our 
 business, financial condition, results of operations, and the price 
of our Class A common stock may decline.

While we remain an 
emerging growth company or a 
non-accelerated smaller reporting company, we will not be 
required 
 to 
include 
an 
attestation 
report 
on 
internal 
control 
over 
financial 
reporting 
issued 
by 
our 
independent 
registered 
public 
 accounting firm. 
To 
prepare for 
eventual compliance 
with the auditor 
attestation requirement 
of Section 
404 of 
Sarbanes-
 Oxley once we no longer qualify as an emerging growth company, we are currently engaged in a process to document 
and 
 evaluate our 
internal control 
over financial 
reporting, which 
is both 
costly and 
challenging. In 
this regard, 
we will 
need to 
 dedicate internal resources, potentially engage outside consultants 
and adopt a detailed work 
plan to assess and 
document 
 the adequacy 
of internal 
control over 
financial reporting, continue 
steps to 
improve control 
processes as 
appropriate, validate 
 through testing that controls are functioning 
as documented and continue to refine 
our reporting and improvement process 
 for internal control over financial reporting. Despite our efforts, there is a risk that we will not be able to conclude, within the 
 prescribed time 
frame or 
at all, 
that our 
internal control 
over financial 
reporting is 
effective as 
required by 
Section 404 
of 
 Sarbanes-Oxley. 
If 
we 
identify 
one 
or 
more 
material 
weaknesses, 
it 
could 
result 
in 
an 
adverse 
reaction 
in 
the 
financial 
 markets due to a loss of confidence in the reliability of 
our financial statements. 
 We 
operate 
in 
a 
highly 
regulated 
environment, 
and 
the 
laws 
and 
regulations 
that 
govern 
our 
operations, 
 corporate governance, 
executive compensation 
and accounting 
principles, or 
changes in 
them, or 
our failure 
to 
 comply with them, could adversely affect us. 
 We operate in a 
highly regulated industry and 
we are subject 
to examination, supervision and 
comprehensive regulation 
 by various federal and state agencies, 
including the Federal Reserve, the 
FDIC and the FOFR. As 
such, we are subject to 
 extensive regulation, supervision and 
legal requirements that govern almost 
all aspects of our operations. 
These laws and 
 regulations 
are 
not 
intended 
to 
protect 
our 
shareholders. 
Rather, 
these 
laws 
and 
regulations 
are 
intended 
to 
protect 
 customers, depositors, the Deposit Insurance 
Fund, or DIF, and the overall financial health and 
stability of the United States 
 banking 
system. 
These 
laws 
and 
regulations, 
among 
other 
matters, 
prescribe 
minimum 
capital 
requirements, 
impose 
 limitations on the 
business activities 
and investments 
in which we 
can engage, regulate 
and restrict our 
lending activities, 
 require us to provide certain banking services broadly within the communities in which 
we operate, determine the locations 
 of our branch 
offices and impose certain 
specific accounting requirements on us 
that may be more 
restrictive and may 
result 
 in 
greater 
or 
earlier 
charges 
to 
earnings 
or 
reductions 
in 
our 
capital 
than 
GAAP 
would 
require. 
We 
are 
also 
subject 
to 
 capitalization 
guidelines 
established 
by 
our 
regulators, 
which 
require 
us 
to 
maintain 
adequate 
capital 
to 
support 
our 
 business. 
Compliance 
with 
laws 
and 
regulations 
can 
be 
difficult 
and 
costly, 
and 
changes 
to 
laws 
and 
regulations 
often 
 impose additional operating costs. Further, we must obtain approval from our regulators 
before engaging in many activities, 
 and 
our 
regulators 
have 
the 
ability 
to 
compel 
us 
to, 
or 
restrict 
us 
from, 
taking 
certain 
actions 
entirely. 
There 
can 
be 
no 
 assurance that any regulatory approvals we may require 
or otherwise seek will be obtained. 
 Regulations affecting 
banks and 
other financial 
institutions are 
undergoing continuous 
review and 
frequently change, 
 and the ultimate effect of such changes cannot be predicted. Changes to the legal and regulatory framework governing our 
 operations, including 
the Dodd-Frank 
Wall 
Street Reform 
and Consumer 
Protection Act, 
or the 
Dodd-Frank 
Act, and 
the 
 Economic Growth, Regulatory Relief and Consumer 
Protection Act, or the Regulatory Relief Act, 
have significantly revised 
 the laws and regulations under which we operate. Such regulations and laws may be modified or repealed at any time, and 
 new legislation may be enacted that will affect 
us and our subsidiaries. 
 Our failure to comply with these laws and regulations, even if the failure follows good faith effort 
or reflects a difference 
 in 
interpretation, 
could 
subject 
us 
to 
restrictions 
on 
our 
business 
activities, 
enforcement 
actions 
and 
fines 
and 
other 
 penalties, 
any 
of 
which 
could 
adversely 
affect 
our 
results 
of 
operations, 
regulatory 
capital 
levels 
and 
the 
price 
of 
our 
 securities. Further, any new laws, rules and 
regulations, such as were imposed 
under the Dodd-Frank Act or 
the Regulatory 
 Relief Act, could make 
compliance more difficult 
or expensive or otherwise 
adversely affect 
our business, prospects, cash 
 flow, liquidity, 
financial condition and results of operations. 
 Our participation in the SBA PPP loan program exposes us to risks related to noncompliance 
with the PPP, 
as 
 well as litigation 
risk related to 
our administration of 
the PPP loan 
program, which 
could have a 
material adverse 
 impact on our business, financial condition, and results 
of operations. 

 We are a 
participating lender in 
the PPP, a loan program administered 
through the SBA, 
that was created 
to help eligible 
 businesses, organizations 
and self-employed persons 
fund their operational 
costs during the 
COVID-19 pandemic. 
Under 
 this program, the SBA guarantees 100 of the amounts 
loaned under the PPP. 
 The PPP opened on April 3, 2020; however, 
because of the short window between 
the passing of the CARES Act and 
 the opening 
of the 
PPP, 
there was 
some 
ambiguity in 
the laws, 
rules and 
guidance 
regarding the 
operation 
of the 
PPP. 
 Subsequent rounds of 
legislation and associated 
agency guidance have 
not provided needed 
clarity and in 
certain instances 
 have 
potentially 
created 
additional 
inconsistencies 
and 
ambiguities. 
Accordingly, 
we 
are 
exposed 
to 
risks 
relating 
to 
 noncompliance with the PPP.

Additionally, since the launch of the PPP, several larger banks have been 
subject to litigation regarding 
the process and 
 procedures 
that 
such 
banks 
used 
in 
processing 
applications 
for 
the 
PPP, 
as 
well 
as 
litigation 
regarding 
the 
alleged 
 nonpayment of 
fees that 
may be 
due to 
certain agents 
who facilitated 
PPP loan 
applications. We 
may be 
exposed to 
the 
 risk of PPP-related litigation, from 
both customers 
and non-customers that approached us 
regarding PPP loans, regarding 
 our process and procedures used in processing 
applications for the PPP. 
If any such litigation is filed against 
us and is not 
 resolved 
in 
a 
manner 
favorable 
to 
us, 
it 
may 
result 
in 
significant 
financial 
liability 
or 
adversely 
affect 
our 
reputation. 
 Regardless of outcome, litigation can be costly and distracting. Any financial liability, litigation costs or reputational damage 
 caused by 
PPP-related litigation 
could have 
a material 
adverse impact 
on our 
business, financial 
condition and 
results of 
 operations. 
 PPP loans are fixed, 
low interest rate loans 
that are guaranteed by 
the SBA and subject 
to numerous other regulatory 
 requirements, and a borrower may apply to have all 
or a portion of the loan forgiven. If PPP 
borrowers fail to qualify for loan 
 forgiveness, we face 
a heightened risk 
of holding these loans 
at unfavorable interest 
rates for an extended 
period of time. 
 While the PPP loans are guaranteed 
by the SBA, various regulatory 
requirements will apply to 
our ability to seek 
recourse 
 under the guarantees, and related procedures are currently subject 
to uncertainty. 
 In 
addition, 
we 
may 
be 
exposed 
to 
credit 
risk 
on 
PPP 
loans 
if 
a 
determination 
is 
made 
by 
the 
SBA 
that 
there 
is 
a 
 deficiency 
in 
the 
manner 
in 
which 
the 
loan 
was 
originated, 
funded, 
or 
serviced, 
such 
as 
an 
issue 
with 
the 
eligibility 
of 
 borrower to receive a PPP 
loan, which may or may 
not be related to the 
ambiguity in the laws, rules 
and guidance regarding 
 the operations of the PPP. If 
a deficiency is identified, the SBA may deny its liability under the guaranty, reduce the amount 
 of the guaranty, 
or, if it has already paid 
under the guaranty, 
seek recovery of any loss related to the deficiency from 
us. 
 We 
face 
a 
risk 
of 
noncompliance 
with 
the 
Bank 
Secrecy 
Act 
and 
other 
anti-money 
laundering 
statutes 
and 
 regulations and corresponding enforcement proceedings. 
 The 
federal 
Bank 
Secrecy 
Act, 
the 
Uniting 
and 
Strengthening 
America 
by 
Providing 
Appropriate 
Tools 
Required 
to 
 Intercept and 
Obstruct Terrorism 
Act of 
2001, or 
the USA 
PATRIOT 
Act, and 
other laws 
and regulations 
require financial 
 institutions, among 
other duties, 
to institute 
and maintain 
effective anti-money 
laundering programs 
and to file 
suspicious 
 activity and 
currency transaction 
reports, as 
appropriate. The 
federal Financial 
Crimes Enforcement 
Network, or 
FinCEN, 
 established by the 
U.S. Treasury 
Department to 
administer the 
Bank Secrecy 
Act, is authorized 
to impose 
significant civil 
 money penalties for 
violations of those 
requirements and has engaged 
in coordinated enforcement efforts with 
the individual 
 federal 
banking 
regulators, 
as 
well 
as 
the 
U.S. 
Department 
of 
Justice, 
Drug 
Enforcement 
Administration 
and 
Internal 
 Revenue Service. 
Additionally, 
South Florida 
has been 
designated as 
a High 
Intensity Financial 
Crime Area, 
or HIFCA, 
 by FinCEN and a 
 High Intensity Drug Trafficking Area, or HIDTA, by the Office of 
National Drug Control Policy. The HIFCA 
 program is intended to concentrate law enforcement efforts 
to combat money laundering efforts in higher-risk 
areas. There 
 is also increased scrutiny of 
compliance with the rules enforced by the 
Office of Foreign Assets Control, 
or OFAC. Federal 
 and state bank 
regulators have for 
many years focused 
on compliance with 
Bank Secrecy 
Act and anti-money 
laundering 
 regulations. In 
order to 
comply 
with regulations, 
guidelines and 
examination 
procedures 
in this 
area, 
we have 
dedicated 
 significant resources 
to our 
anti-money laundering 
program, 
especially due 
to the 
regulatory focus 
on financial 
and other 
 institutions located in South 
Florida. Our business includes 
supporting our customers, including foreign 
financial institutions, 
 with respect to their international banking needs and our policies, procedures and systems have been designed to address 
 federal and 
state anti-money 
laundering compliance. 
If our 
policies, procedures 
and systems 
are deemed 
deficient or the 
 policies, 
procedures 
and 
systems 
of 
the 
financial 
institutions 
that 
we may 
acquire 
are 
deficient, 
we 
would 
be 
subject 
to 
 liability, 
including 
fines, 
and 
regulatory 
actions 
that 
are 
deemed 
necessary 
in 
order 
to 
remediate 
such 
deficiencies 
and 
 prevent the recurrence 
thereof. In recent 
years, sanctions that 
the regulators have 
imposed on banks 
that have not 
complied 
 with 
all 
anti-money 
laundering 
requirements 
have 
been 
especially 
severe. 
Failure 
to 
maintain 
and 
implement 
adequate 
 programs to 
combat money 
laundering and 
terrorist financing 
could also 
have serious 
reputational consequences 
for us, 
 which could have a material adverse effect 
on our business, financial condition and results of operations. 
 We 
are 
subject 
to 
capital 
adequacy 
requirements 
and 
may 
become 
subject 
to 
more 
stringent 
capital 
 requirements, which could adversely affect our 
financial condition and operations. 
 In July 2013, the federal banking agencies published new regulatory capital rules based on 
the international standards, 
 known as 
Basel III, 
that were 
developed by 
the Basel 
Committee on 
Banking Supervision. 
The new 
rules raised 
the risk-
 based capital 
requirements 
and revised 
the methods 
for calculating 
risk-weighted 
assets, usually 
resulting 
in higher 
risk 
 weights. The new rules now apply to us. 
 The Basel III rules increased 
capital requirements and included 
two new capital measurements, 
a risk-based common 
 equity Tier 1 ratio 
and a capital conservation buffer. 
Common Equity Tier 
1 (CET1) capital is a subset 
of Tier 1 capital 
and 
 is limited to common 
equity (plus related surplus), retained 
earnings, accumulated other comprehensive income and 
certain 
 other 
items. 
Other 
instruments 
that 
have 
historically 
qualified 
for 
Tier 
1 
treatment, 
including 
noncumulative 
perpetual

preferred stock, 
are consigned 
to a 
category known 
as Additional 
Tier 
1 capital 
and must 
be phased 
out of 
CETI over 
a 
 period of 
nine years 
beginning in 
2014. In 
order to 
be a 
 well-capitalized depository 
institution under 
the new 
regime, an 
 institution must maintain a 
CET1 capital ratio of 7.0 
or more; a Tier 
1 capital ratio of 8.5 or 
more; a total capital ratio 
of 
 10.5 or more; and a leverage ratio of 4 or more. 
Institutions must also maintain a capital conservation 
buffer consisting 
 of common equity Tier 
1 capital. In 
addition to the 
higher required capital 
ratios and the 
new deductions and 
adjustments, 
 the final 
rules increased 
the risk 
weights for 
certain assets, 
meaning that 
we will 
have to 
hold more 
capital against 
these 
 assets. We will also be required to hold capital 
against short-term commitments that are not unconditionally 
cancellable. 
 While we currently meet these new 
requirements of the Basel III-based capital requirements, we may 
fail to do so in 
the 
 future. The failure 
to meet applicable 
regulatory capital 
requirements could result 
in one or 
more of 
our regulators placing 
 limitations or conditions on our activities, including our growth initiatives, or restricting the commencement of new activities, 
 and could affect customer and investor confidence, our costs of funds and level of required deposit insurance 
assessments 
 to the FDIC, 
our ability to 
pay dividends on 
our capital 
stock, our ability 
to make acquisitions, 
and our business, 
results of 
 operations and financial condition, generally. 
 In addition, 
in the 
current economic 
and regulatory 
environment, including 
the COVID-19 
pandemic, bank 
regulators 
 may 
impose 
capital 
requirements 
that 
are 
more 
stringent 
than 
those 
required 
by 
applicable 
existing 
regulations. 
The 
 application of more stringent capital requirements for us 
could, among other things, result in 
lower returns on equity, require 
 the raising of additional 
capital, and result 
in regulatory actions if 
we were to be unable 
to comply with such 
requirements. 
 Implementation 
of 
changes 
to 
asset 
risk 
weightings 
for 
risk-based 
capital 
calculations, 
items 
included 
or 
deducted 
in 
 calculating regulatory capital or additional capital conservation buffers, could result in management modifying our business 
 strategy and could limit our ability to make distributions, 
including paying dividends. 
 We are periodically subject 
to examination and 
scrutiny by a 
number of banking agencies 
and, depending upon 
 the findings and determinations 
of these agencies, we may 
be required to make adjustments 
to our business that 
 could adversely affect us. 
 As part of 
the bank regulatory 
process, the Federal Reserve, 
the FDIC and 
the FOFR periodically conduct 
examinations 
 of our business, 
including compliance 
with applicable laws 
and regulations. If, 
as a result 
of an examination, 
one of these 
 banking 
agencies 
were 
to 
determine 
that 
the 
financial 
condition, 
capital 
resources, 
asset 
quality, 
asset 
concentration, 
 earnings prospects, management, liquidity sensitivity 
to market risk, risk 
management and internal controls 
or other aspects 
 of any of our operations has become unsatisfactory, or that we or our management are in violation of any law or regulation, 
 the banking 
agency could 
take a 
number of 
different remedial 
or punitive 
actions as 
it deems 
appropriate. These 
actions 
 include the power to prohibit the continuation of 
"unsafe or unsound" practices, to require affirmative 
actions to correct any 
 conditions 
resulting 
from 
any violation 
or practice, 
to 
issue an 
administrative 
order 
or enforcement 
that can 
be judicially 
 enforced, to direct an increase 
in our capital, to restrict our 
growth, to change the asset composition 
of our loan or securities 
 portfolios 
or 
balance 
sheet, 
to 
assess 
civil 
monetary 
penalties 
against 
our 
officers 
or 
directors, 
to 
remove 
officers 
and 
 directors and, if 
it is concluded 
that such conditions 
cannot be corrected 
or there is 
an imminent risk 
of loss to depositors, 
 to 
terminate 
our 
deposit 
insurance 
and 
force 
us 
to 
terminate 
our 
business 
operations. 
If 
we 
become 
subject 
to 
such 
 regulatory actions, our business, financial condition, results 
of operations and reputation may be negatively impacted. 
 We 
are 
subject 
to 
numerous 
laws 
and 
regulations 
of 
certain 
regulatory 
agencies 
designed 
to 
protect 
 consumers, including the Community Reinvestment 
Act, or CRA, and fair lending laws, and failure 
to comply with 
 these laws could lead to a wide variety of sanctions. 
 The CRA directs all insured depository institutions to help meet the credit needs of 
the local communities in which they 
 operate 
branches, 
including 
low- 
and 
moderate-income 
neighborhoods. 
Each 
institution 
is 
examined 
periodically 
by 
its 
 primary federal 
regulator, 
which assesses 
the institution s 
CRA performance. 
The Equal 
Credit Opportunity 
Act, the 
Fair 
 Housing 
Act 
and 
other 
fair 
lending 
laws 
and 
regulations 
impose 
nondiscriminatory 
lending 
requirements 
on 
financial 
 institutions. The U.S. Department of Justice, the Federal Reserve, and other federal agencies are responsible for enforcing 
 these laws and regulations. A successful regulatory challenge to our performance under the CRA, fair lending or consumer 
 lending 
laws 
and 
regulations 
could 
result 
in 
a 
wide 
variety 
of 
sanctions, 
including 
damages 
and 
civil 
money 
penalties, 
 injunctive 
relief, 
customer 
restitution, 
restrictions 
on 
mergers 
and 
acquisitions 
activity, 
restrictions 
on 
expansion, 
and 
 restrictions 
on 
entering 
new 
business 
lines. 
Private 
parties 
may 
also 
have 
the 
ability 
to 
challenge 
an 
institution s 
 performance 
under 
fair 
lending 
laws 
in 
private 
class 
action 
litigation. 
Such 
actions 
could 
have 
an 
adverse 
effect 
on 
our 
 business, financial condition and results of operations.

Climate change and related legislative and regulatory initiatives may materially affect the Company s business 
 and results of operations.
 The effects 
of climate change 
continue to 
create an 
alarming level 
of concern for 
the state of 
the global 
environment. 
 As a result, the global business community has 
increased its political and social awareness surrounding 
the issue, and the 
 United States 
has entered 
into international 
agreements in 
an attempt 
to reduce 
global temperatures, 
such as 
reentering 
 the Paris Agreement. 
Further, 
the U.S. Congress, 
state legislatures 
and federal and 
state regulatory agencies 
continue to 
 propose numerous 
initiatives to supplement 
the global effort 
to combat climate 
change. Similar and 
even more expansive 
 initiatives 
are 
expected 
under 
the 
current 
administration, 
including 
potentially 
increasing 
supervisory 
expectations 
with 
 respect to banks 
risk management 
practices, accounting 
for the effects 
of climate change 
in stress testing 
scenarios and 
 systemic 
risk assessments, 
revising expectations 
for credit 
portfolio concentrations 
based on 
climate-related 
factors 
and 
 encouraging investment 
by banks 
in climate-related initiatives 
and lending 
to communities 
disproportionately impacted 
by 
 the effects 
of climate change. 
The lack 
of empirical data 
surrounding the 
credit and 
other financial 
risks posed 
by climate 
 change render it difficult, or 
even impossible, to predict how climate 
change may impact our financial 
condition and results 
 of operations; however, 
the physical effects 
of climate change may 
also directly impact 
us. Specifically, 
unpredictable and 
 more frequent weather disasters may adversely impact the real property, and/or the value of the real property, 
securing the 
 loans in our 
portfolios. Additionally, 
if insurance 
obtained by 
our borrowers 
is insufficient 
to cover any 
losses sustained 
to 
 the collateral, or if 
insurance coverage is 
otherwise unavailable to 
our borrowers, the 
collateral securing our 
loans may be 
 negatively impacted by climate change, natural disasters and 
related events, which could impact our 
financial condition and 
 results 
of 
operations. Further, 
the effects 
of climate 
change may 
negatively 
impact 
regional 
and 
local economic 
activity, 
 which could adversely 
affect our customers 
and the communities 
in which we 
operate. Overall, climate 
change, its effects 
 and the resulting, unknown impact could have a material adverse effect on our 
financial condition and results of operations. 
 Risks Related to Our Class A Common Stock 
 Our ability to pay dividends is subject to restrictions. 
 Holders of our Class A common stock are only 
entitled to receive cash dividends when, as and 
if declared by our Board 
 out of funds 
legally available 
for dividends. 
The Company 
is a bank 
holding company 
that conducts 
substantially all 
of its 
 operations through the Bank, 
which is a legal entity separate 
and distinct from the 
Company. 
As a result, our ability 
to pay 
 dividends 
on 
our 
common 
stock 
will substantially 
depend 
upon 
the 
receipt 
of 
dividends 
and 
other 
distributions 
from 
the 
 Bank, 
the 
profitability 
of 
which 
is 
subject 
to 
the 
fluctuating 
cost 
and 
availability 
of 
money, 
changes 
in 
interest 
rates 
and 
 economic conditions in general. There 
are numerous laws and banking 
regulations and guidance that limit the 
Bank's ability 
 to pay dividends to us and our ability to pay dividends on our 
common stock. 
 The market price and trading volume of our Class A 
common stock may be volatile, which could result in rapid 
 and substantial losses for our shareholders. 
 The market 
price of 
our 
Class 
A common 
stock may 
be highly 
volatile 
and 
could 
be 
subject 
to 
wide fluctuations. 
In 
 addition, the trading volume on 
our Class A common stock may 
fluctuate and cause significant price variations to 
occur. We 
 cannot assure you that the market price of our Class A common stock will not fluctuate or decline significantly in the future. 
 Some, but 
certainly not 
all, of 
the factors 
that could 
negatively affect 
the price 
of our 
Class A 
common stock, 
or result 
in 
 fluctuations in the price or trading volume of our Class 
A common stock, include: 
 
general market conditions; 
 
domestic and international economic factors unrelated 
to our performance; 
 
variations in our quarterly operating results or failure to 
meet the market s earnings expectations; 
 
publication of research reports about us or the financial services 
industry in general; 
 
the failure of securities analysts to cover our Class 
A common stock after this offering; 
 
additions or departures of our key personnel; 
 
future sales of our Class A common stock; 
 
adverse market reactions to any indebtedness we may incur 
or securities we may issue in the future; 
 
actions by our shareholders; 
 
the expiration of contractual lock-up agreements; 
 
the operating and securities price performance of 
companies that investors consider to be comparable to us; 
 
changes or proposed changes in laws or regulations affecting 
our business; and 
 
actual or potential litigation and governmental investigations. 
 In 
addition, 
if 
the 
market 
for 
stocks 
in 
our 
industry, 
or 
the 
stock 
market 
in 
general, 
experiences 
a 
loss 
of 
investor 
 confidence, the 
trading price 
of the 
Class A 
common stock 
could decline 
for reasons 
unrelated to 
our business, 
financial

condition or results of operations. If 
any of the foregoing occurs, it could 
cause our Class A common 
stock price to fall and 
 may expose us to lawsuits that, even if unsuccessful, 
could be costly to defend and a distraction to management. 
 There are significant restrictions in our Articles of Incorporation that restrict the 
ability to sell our capital stock 
 to shareholders that would own 4.95 or more of 
our stock, excluding our Significant Investors. 
 Because the 
continued availability 
of our 
"deferred tax 
assets" depends, 
in part, 
on the 
value of 
our stock 
owned by 
 shareholders owning 
5 or more 
of our stock, 
our Articles of 
Incorporation, except 
as otherwise 
may be approved 
by the 
 Board 
or 
except 
for 
transfers 
by 
our 
Significant 
Investors, 
prohibits 
any 
direct 
or 
indirect 
transfer 
of 
stock 
or 
options 
to 
 acquire stock to any 
person who, as a 
result of the transfer, would own 4.95 
or more of our 
stock, as long as the 
Company 
 continues to have "deferred tax assets." Such restrictions may 
limit the ability to transfer our stock. 
 Because 
we 
are 
an 
emerging 
growth 
company 
and 
because 
we 
have 
decided 
to 
take 
advantage 
of 
certain 
 exemptions from 
various reporting 
and other 
requirements applicable 
to emerging 
growth companies, 
our Class 
 A common stock could be less attractive to investors. 
 We 
are an 
 emerging growth 
company, 
as defined 
in the 
JOBS Act. 
For as 
long as 
we remain 
an emerging 
growth 
 company, 
we will have 
the option 
to take advantage 
of certain 
exemptions from 
various reporting and 
other requirements 
 that are applicable to other public companies that are not emerging 
growth companies, including: 
 
we 
may 
present 
only 
two 
years 
of 
audited 
financial 
statements 
and 
only 
two 
years 
of 
related 
management s 
 discussion and analysis of financial condition and results 
of operations 
 
we 
are 
exempt 
from 
the 
requirements 
to 
obtain 
an 
attestation 
and 
report 
from 
our 
auditors 
on 
management s 
 assessment of our internal control over financial reporting 
under the Sarbanes-Oxley Act; 
 
we are permitted to have less extensive disclosure about our 
executive compensation arrangements; and 
 
we 
are 
not 
required 
to 
give 
our 
shareholders 
non-binding 
advisory 
votes 
on 
executive 
compensation 
or 
golden 
 parachute arrangements. 
 We may 
continue to 
take advantage 
of some 
or all 
of the 
reduced regulatory 
and reporting 
requirements 
that will 
be 
 available to 
us as 
long as 
we continue 
to 
qualify 
as an 
emerging 
growth 
company. 
We 
will remain 
an emerging 
growth 
 company until the earliest of 
(i) the last day of the first fiscal year 
in which our annual gross revenues 
exceed 1.07 billion, 
 (ii) the date that the market value of our Class A common stock 
that is held by non-affiliates exceeds 700 million as of 
the 
 last business day of 
June 30 of that 
year, (iii) the date on 
which we have, during 
the previous three-year period, issued 
more 
 than 1 billion 
in non-convertible 
debt, or 
(iv) the end 
of fiscal 
year following the 
fifth anniversary 
of the 
completion of 
our 
 IPO. 
 It is 
possible that 
some 
investors could 
find our 
Class 
A common 
stock less 
attractive if 
we choose 
to rely 
on these 
 exemptions. If some investors find our Class A common 
stock less attractive, there may be a less 
active trading market for 
 our Class A common stock and our stock price may be 
more volatile. 
 Because we have elected 
to use the extended 
transition period for complying 
with new or revised 
accounting 
 standards for an emerging growth company, our financial statements may not be comparable to companies that 
 comply with these accounting standards as of the public 
company effective dates. 
 We have elected 
to use the 
extended transition 
period for complying 
with new or 
revised accounting standards 
under 
 Section 7(a)(2)(B) of 
the Securities Act. 
This election allows 
us to delay 
the adoption of 
new or revised 
accounting standards 
 that have different 
effective dates for 
public and private companies 
until those standards apply 
to private companies. 
As a 
 result of 
this election, 
our financial 
statements 
may not 
be comparable 
to companies 
that 
comply 
with these 
accounting 
 standards as of the 
public company effective dates. Because 
our financial statements may 
not be comparable to 
companies 
 that 
comply 
with 
public 
company 
effective 
dates, 
investors 
may 
have 
difficulty 
evaluating 
or 
comparing 
our 
business, 
 performance or 
prospects in 
comparison to 
other public 
companies, which 
may have 
a negative 
impact on 
the value 
and 
 liquidity of 
our Class 
A common 
stock. We 
cannot predict 
if investors 
will find 
our Class 
A common 
stock less 
attractive 
 because we 
plan to 
rely on 
this exemption. 
If some 
investors find 
our Class 
A common 
stock less 
attractive as 
a result, 
 there may be a less active trading market for our Class A common 
stock and our stock price may be more volatile. 
 We have existing investors that own 
a significant amount of our 
common stock whose individual interests may 
 differ from yours. 

 A significant percentage of our Class A common stock is currently held by a few institutional investors, including Patriot 
 Financial Partners II, 
L.P. 
and Patriot Financial 
Partners Parallel II, L.P. 
(collectively, 
"Patriot"), and Priam 
Capital Fund II, 
 LP 
("Priam," 
and 
together 
with 
Patriot, 
the 
"Significant 
Investors"). 
As 
of 
February 
28, 
2023 
Patriot 
and 
Priam 
own 

Table of Contents

2022 10-K 

approximately 22.71

and 22.71
 
 1
 , respectively, of our outstanding Class A common stock. In addition, Patriot and Priam 
 are each entitled to nominate a director to our Board and have certain subscription rights to purchase new equity securities 
 that we issued in the future, 
in each case as long as certain equity 
ownership criteria are met. Patriot and 
Priam also have 
 certain 
registration 
rights, 
including 
demand 
registration 
rights, 
and 
information 
rights. 
Although 
Patriot 
and 
Priam 
are 
 independent of each other, these institutional investors will continue to have a significant level of influence over us 
because 
 of their level of 
Class A common 
stock ownership and their 
right to representation 
on our Board. For 
example, Patriot and 
 Priam will have a greater ability than our other shareholders to influence the election of directors and the potential outcome 
 of other matters submitted 
to a vote of 
our shareholders, including mergers and 
other acquisition transactions, amendments 
 to our Articles 
of Incorporation and 
Amended and Restated 
Bylaws, and other 
extraordinary corporate matters. The 
interests 
 of these 
investors could 
conflict with 
the interests 
of our 
other shareholders, 
and any future 
transfer by 
these investors 
of 
 their shares of Class A common 
stock to other investors who have 
different business objectives 
could adversely affect 
our 
 business, results of operations, financial condition, prospects 
or the market value of our Class A common 
stock. 
 Provisions 
in 
our 
governing 
documents 
and 
Florida 
law 
may 
have 
an 
anti-takeover 
effect 
and 
there 
are 
 substantial regulatory limitations on changes of control 
of the Company. 
 Our corporate organizational documents and provisions of federal 
and state law to which we 
are subject contain certain 
 provisions that could 
have an anti-takeover 
effect and 
may delay, 
make more 
difficult or prevent 
an attempted 
acquisition 
 that you may favor or an attempted replacement of our Board 
or management. 
 Our governing documents include provisions that: 
 
empower our Board, without shareholder 
approval, to issue our preferred 
stock, the terms of which, 
including voting 
 power, are to be set by our 
Board; 
 
provide that directors may be removed from office only for cause and only upon a majority vote 
of the shares of our 
 Bank with voting power; 
 
prohibit holders of our Class A common stock 
to take action by written consent in lieu of a shareholder meeting; 

require holders of at least 10 of our Class A common 
stock to call a special meeting; 
 
do not provide for cumulative voting in elections of our 
directors; 
 
provide that our Board has the authority to amend our Amended 
and Restated Bylaws; 
 
require shareholders that wish to bring business before annual or special meetings of shareholders, or to nominate 
 candidates for election as directors at our annual meeting of shareholders, to provide 
timely notice of their intent in 
 writing and satisfy disclosure requirements; and 
 
enable our Board to increase, between 
annual meetings, the number of 
persons serving as directors and to 
fill the 
 vacancies created 
as a 
result of 
the increase 
until the 
next meeting of 
shareholders by 
a majority 
vote of 
the directors 
 present at a meeting of directors. 
 In addition, 
certain provisions 
of Florida 
law may 
delay, 
discourage, or 
prevent an 
attempted acquisition 
or change 
in 
 control. Furthermore, 
banking laws 
impose notice, 
approval, and 
ongoing regulatory 
requirements 
on any 
shareholder or 
 other party that seeks to acquire direct or indirect "control" of 
a bank holding company, 
which includes the Change in Bank 
 Control 
Act. 
These 
laws 
could 
delay 
or 
prevent 
an 
acquisition. 
Also, 
for 
preservation 
and 
continued 
availability 
of 
our 
 "deferred tax assets," our Articles 
of Incorporation prohibits any direct 
or indirect transfer of stock 
or options to acquire 
stock 
 to any 
person 
who, as 
a result 
of 
the 
transfer, 
would own 
4.95 
or more 
of 
our stock, 
as long 
as 
we continue 
to 
have 
 "deferred tax assets," subject to 
limited exceptions as provided in 
our Articles of Incorporation. Because 
of the requirements 
 to overcome this restriction, this provision of the Articles of Incorporation could have an anti-takeover effect and may delay, 
 make more difficult or prevent an attempted acquisition 
that you may favor.

 Market Information 
 In July 
2021, the Bank s 
Class A 
common stock began 
trading on the 
Nasdaq Stock Market 
under ticker symbol 
 USCB . 
 The listing of our Class 
A common stock 
on the Nasdaq Stock 
Market has resulted in 
a more active trading 
market for our 
 Class 
A 
common 
stock. 
However, 
we 
cannot 
assure 
that 
a 
liquid 
trading 
market 
for 
our 
Class 
A 
common 
stock 
will 
be 
 sustained. 

 Effective December 30, 2021, the bank holding company, 
or the Company, acquired all issued and 
outstanding shares 
 of Class 
A common 
stock of 
the Bank. 
Each of 
the outstanding 
shares of 
the Bank s 
common stock 
formerly held 
by its 
 shareholders was converted 
into and exchanged 
for one newly 
issued share 
of the Company s 
common stock. The 
ticker

 Prior

2023, 
the 
Company s 
Class 
A 
common 
shares 
were 
held 
by 
approximately 
300 
shareholders 
of 
 record, not 
including the 
number 
of persons 
or entities 
whose stock 
is held 
in nominee 
or street 
name through 
various 
 brokerage firms and banks. 
 Dividends 
 As a bank holding company, the Company s ability to declare and pay dividends depends on various federal regulatory 
 considerations, including the guidelines of the Federal Reserve regarding 
capital adequacy and dividends. 
 Because we are 
a bank holding 
company and currently do 
not engage directly in 
business activities of a 
material nature, 
 our ability to pay dividends 
to our shareholders depends, 
in large part, upon 
our receipt of dividends 
from the Bank, which 
 is also subject to 
numerous limitations on 
the payment of 
dividends under federal and 
state banking laws, regulations 
and 
 policies. 
 The principal 
source of 
revenue with 
which to 
pay dividends 
on common 
shares are 
dividends the 
Bank may 
declare 
 and 
pay 
out 
of 
funds 
legally 
available 
for 
payment 
of 
dividends. 
As 
a 
Florida 
corporation, 
we 
are 
only 
permitted 
to 
pay 
 dividends to shareholders if, after giving effect to the dividend, (i) the Company is able to pay its debts as they become due 
 in the ordinary course 
of business and 
(ii) the Company s 
assets exceeds the 
sum of Company s 
(a) liabilities plus 
(b) the 
 amount that 
would be 
needed for 
the Company 
to satisfy 
the 
preferential rights 
upon dissolution 
of shareholders 
whose 
 preferential rights are superior to those receiving the dividend, 
if any.

 generally 
accepted 
accounting 
principles GAAP ). 
This 
financial 
information

certain 
operating 
performance 
 measures. Management has included these non-GAAP 
measures because it believes these measures may 
provide useful 
 supplemental information 
for evaluating 
the Company s 
underlying performance 
trends. Further, 
management uses 
these 
 measures 
in 
managing 
and

to 
refer 
to 
them 
in 
discussions

our 
 operations and performance. 
Operating performance 
measures should be 
viewed in addition 
to, and not 
as an alternative 
 to or 
substitute 
for, 
measures 
determined 
in 
accordance 
with GAAP, 
and 
are 
not 
necessarily 
comparable 
to non-GAAP 
 measures 
that 
may 
be 
presented 
by 
other 
companies.

the 
extent 
applicable, 
reconciliations 
of 
these 
non-GAAP 
 measures to the most directly 
comparable GAAP measures can be found

 Overview 
 For the year ended December 31, 2022, the Company reported net income of 
 20.1 million compared with net income 
 of 
 21.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2021. 

 In

net 
interest 
 margin, the cost of deposits, 
levels and composition of 
non-interest income and non-interest 
expense, performance ratios, 
 asset quality ratios, 
regulatory capital ratios, and any significant event or transaction 
. 
 The following significant highlights are of note for the

in 
 December 31, 2021 as a result of the increase in market 
interest rates.

Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates 
 The 
consolidated 
financial 
statements 
are 
prepared 
based 
on 
the 
application 
of 
U.S. 
GAAP, 
the 
most 
significant 
of 
 which are described 
in Note 1 Summary 
of Significant Accounting 
Policies to our 
Consolidated Financial Statements 
. 
To 
 prepare financial statements in conformity with GAAP, 
management makes estimates, assumptions, 
and judgments based 
 on 
available 
information. 
These 
estimates, 
assumptions, 
and 
judgments 
affect 
the 
amounts 
reported 
in 
the 
financial 
 statements and accompanying notes. These estimates, assumptions, and judgments are based on 
information available as 
 of 
the 
date 
of 
the 
financial 
statements 
and, 
as 
this 
information 
changes, 
actual 
results 
could 
differ 
from 
the 
estimates, 
 assumptions 
and 
judgments 
reflected 
in 
the 
financial 
statements. 
In 
particular, 
management 
has 
identified 
accounting 
 policies that, due to 
the estimates, assumptions 
and judgments inherent 
in those policies, are 
critical in understanding 
our 
 financial statements. 
Management 
has presented 
the application 
of these 
policies to 
the audit 
and risk 
committee of 
our 
 Board. 

 Allowance for Credit Losses 
 The allowance for credit 
losses ACL is 
a valuation allowance that 
is established through charges 
to earnings in the 
 form of a 
provision for credit 
losses. The amount 
of the ACL 
is affected by 
the following: (i) 
charge-offs of loans 
that decrease 
 the allowance; 
(ii) subsequent 
recoveries on 
loans previously 
charged off 
that increase 
the allowance; 
and (iii) 
provisions 
 for credit losses charged to income that increase or decrease the allowance. Management considers the policies related to 
 the ACL 
as the 
most critical 
to the 
financial statement 
presentation. The 
total ACL 
includes activity 
related to 
allowances 
 calculated in accordance with Accounting Standards Codification ASC 
310, Receivables, and ASC 450, Contingencies. 
 Throughout the year, 
management estimates the probable 
incurred losses in the loan portfolio 
to determine if the ACL 
 is adequate to absorb such losses. The ACL 
consists of specific and general components. 
The specific component relates 
 to loans that are 
individually classified as 
impaired. We follow 
a loan review program 
to evaluate the credit 
risk in the loan 
 portfolio. Loans 
that have 
been identified 
as impaired 
are reviewed 
on a 
quarterly basis 
in order 
to determine 
whether a 
 specific reserve is 
required. The 
general component covers 
non-impaired loans 
and is based 
on industry and 
our specific 
 historical loan 
loss experience, 
volume, growth 
and composition 
of the 
loan portfolio, 
the evaluation 
of our 
loan portfolio 
 through our 
internal 
loan review 
process, general 
current 
economic 
conditions both 
internal and 
external 
to 
us that 
may 
 affect the borrower s ability to pay, 
value of collateral and other qualitative relevant risk factors. Based on a review 
of these 
 estimates, we 
adjust the ACL 
to a 
level determined by 
management to be 
adequate. Estimates of 
credit losses 
are inherently 
 subjective as they involve an exercise of judgment. 
 The 
CARES 
Act, 
as 
amended 
by 
the 
Consolidated 
Appropriations 
Act, 
2021, 
specified 
that 
COVID-19 
related 
loan 
 modifications executed 
between March 1, 
2020 and 
the earlier 
of (i) 
60 days 
after the 
date of 
termination of 
the national 
 emergency declared by President Trump and (ii) January 1, 2022, on loans 
that were current as of December 31, 2019, 
are 
 not TDRs. Additionally, 
under guidance from the federal banking agencies, 
other short-term modifications made on a good 
 faith basis 
in response 
to COVID-19 
to borrowers 
that were 
current prior 
to any 
relief are 
not TDRs 
under ASC 
Subtopic 
 310-40, 
 Troubled 
Debt 
Restructurings 
by 
Creditors. 
These 
modifications 
include 
short-term 
(i.e., 
up 
to 
six 
months) 
 modifications 
such 
as 
payment 
deferrals, 
fee 
waivers, 
extensions 
of 
repayment 
terms, 
or 
delays 
in 
payment 
that 
are 
 insignificant. The Company s charge-off 
policy is to continuously review all impaired loans to monitor the Company s ability 
 to collect them in full at the applicable maturity date and/or in 
accordance with terms of any restructurings. For loans 
which 
 are collateral dependent, 
or deemed to 
be uncollectible, any 
shortfall in the 
fair value of 
the collateral relative 
to the recorded 
 investment 
in the loan is charged off. The amount charged-off 
conforms to the amount necessary to comply with GAAP. 
 Income Taxes 
 Deferred tax 
assets and 
liabilities are 
recognized for 
the future 
tax consequences 
attributable to 
differences 
between 
 the financial statement carrying amounts of 
existing assets and liabilities and their 
respective tax bases and operating loss 
 and tax credit carryforwards. Deferred 
tax assets and liabilities are measured 
using enacted tax rates expected to 
apply to 
 taxable income 
in the 
years in 
which those 
temporary differences 
are expected 
to be 
recovered or 
settled. The 
effect 
on 
 deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment 
 date. 

 Management is required to assess whether a valuation allowance should be established on the net deferred tax assets 
 based on the 
consideration of 
all available evidence 
using a more 
likely than not 
standard. In its 
evaluation, management 
 considers taxable loss 
carry-back availability, expectation of sufficient taxable 
income, trends in 
earnings, the future 
reversal 
 of temporary differences, and available tax planning 
strategies.

The Company recognizes positions taken 
or expected to be 
taken in a tax 
return in accordance with existing accounting 
 guidance on 
income taxes 
which prescribes 
a recognition threshold 
and measurement 
process. Interest 
and penalties on 
 tax liabilities, if any, 
would be recorded in interest expense and other operating 
non-interest expense, respectively.

Prices 
obtained 
from 
pricing 
services 
are 
usually 
not 
adjusted. 
Based 
on 
our 
 internal review procedures 
and the fair values 
provided by the pricing 
services, we believe that 
the fair values provided 
by 
 the pricing 
services are 
consistent with 
the principles 
of ASC 
Topic 
820, Fair 
Value 
Measurement. The 
Company may 
at 
 times validate the 
observed prices using 
the observed prices 
for similar securities 
to determine the 
fair value of 
its securities. 
 Changes in the fair values, as 
a result of deteriorating economic conditions 
and credit spread changes, should only 
be 
 temporary. 
Further, 
management 
believes 
that 
the 
Company s 
other 
sources 
of 
liquidity, 
as 
well 
as 
the 
cash 
flow 
from 
 principal and interest 
payments from 
its securities portfolio, 
reduces the 
risk that losses 
would be realized 
as a result 
of a 
 need to sell securities to obtain liquidity. 
 Segment Reporting 
 Management monitors the revenue streams for 
all its various products and services. The identifiable segments 
are not 
 material 
and 
operations 
are 
managed 
and 
financial 
performance 
is 
evaluated 
on 
an 
overall 
Company-wide 
basis. 
 Accordingly, all 
the financial service 
operations are 
considered by 
management to be 
aggregated in one 
reportable operating 
 segment.

Net income 
for the 
year ended 
December 31, 2022 
was 20.1 million, 
compared with 
net income 
of 21.1 million 
for 
 the same 
period in 
2021. The Company 
reported net 
income per 
diluted share 
for the 
year ended 
December 31, 2022 
of 
 1.00 compared 
to net 
loss per diluted 
share for 
the same 
period in 2021 
of 6.72. The 
net loss per 
diluted share 
for the 
 year ended 2021 was 
attributable to the one-time 
reduction in net income 
available to common stockholders 
reflecting the 
 exchange and 
redemption 
of the 
Class 
C and 
Class 
D preferred 
shares. During 
the third 
quarter of 
2021, 
the Company 
 completed 
an 
exchange 
of 
the 
outstanding 
preferred 
shares 
for 
Class A 
common 
shares 
and 
thereafter 
redeemed 
the 
 remaining outstanding 
preferred shares, 
at a 
liquidation value 
that exceeded 
book value, 
causing a 
one-time reduction 
in 
 net income available 
to common stockholders 
of 89.6 million. 
At December 31, 2022, 
there were no 
issued and outstanding 
 preferred shares. 

 Adjusted 
diluted 
net 
income 
per 
common 
share 
(non-GAAP) 
for 
the 
year 
ended 
December 31, 
2022 
was 
 1.00 
 compared to adjusted net income per diluted share (non-GAAP) for the same period in 2021 of 1.81. Adjusted net income 
 per 
diluted 
share 
(non-GAAP) 
for 
the 
year 
ended 
2021 
excludes 
the 
 89.6 million 
one-time 
accounting 
impact 
of 
the 
 exchange and redemption of the 
preferred shares. To see 
a reconciliation of non-GAAP 
measures, 
to GAAP measures refer 
 to section below Reconciliation and Management Explanatio 
n 
of Non-GAAP Financial Measures . 

 Net Interest Income 
 Net interest 
income is 
the difference 
between interest 
earned on 
interest earning 
assets and 
interest incurred 
on interest-
 bearing liabilities 
and is 
the primary 
driver of 
core earnings. 
Interest 
income is 
generated from 
interest and 
dividends on 
 interest-earning 
assets, 
including 
loans, 
investment 
securities 
and 
other 
short-term 
investments. 
Interest 
expense 
is 
 incurred 
from 
interest 
paid 
on 
interest-bearing 
liabilities, 
including 
interest-bearing 
deposits, 
FHLB 
advances 
and 
other 
 borrowings. 
 To evaluate net 
interest income, we 
measure and monitor 
(i) yields on 
loans and other 
interest-earning assets, (ii) 
the 
 costs of deposits 
and other funding 
sources, (iii) net 
interest spread, and 
(iv) net interest margin. 
Net interest spread is 
equal 
 to the difference between yields earned on interest-earning assets and rates paid on interest-bearing liabilities. Net interest 
 margin is 
equal to 
the annualized 
net interest 
income 
divided by 
average interest 
-earning assets. 
Because 
non-interest-
 bearing sources of funds, such as non-interest-bearing deposits 
and stockholders 
equity, also fund interest-earning assets, 
 net interest margin includes the benefit of these non-interest-bearing 
sources. 
 Changes in 
the market 
interest rates and 
interest rates 
we earn on 
interest-earning assets 
or pay on 
interest-bearing 
 liabilities, as well 
as the volume and 
types of interest-earning 
assets and interest-bearing and 
non-interest-bearing liabilities, 
 are usually the 
largest drivers of 
periodic changes in 
net interest spread, 
net interest margin 
and net interest 
income. The 
 ALCO has in place 
asset-liability management techniques 
to manage major 
factors that affect 
net interest income 
and net 
 interest margin.

FHLB stock. 
 (3) 
Net interest spread is the average yield on 
total interest-earning assets minus the average 
rate on total interest-bearing liabilities. 
 (4) 
Net interest margin is the ratio of net interest 
income to total interest-earning assets. 
 Net interest income before the provision 
for credit losses was 63.7 
million for the year ended December 
31, 2022, an 
 increase of 11.2 million 
or 21.3 , from 
 52.5 million for the 
year ended December 31, 
2021. This increase 
was primarily 
 attributable to higher income from a larger loan portfolio and 
higher yield on earning assets. 

 Included with loan interest income are PPP fees totaling 1.6 million and 4.5 million for the 
year ended December 31, 
 2022 and 2021, respectively. 
PPP loan fees are fully recognized upon forgiveness. As of December 31, 2022, we had 
 1.3 
 million of PPP loans remaining in our portfolio. 
 The net 
interest margin 
was 3.38 
for the 
year ended 
December 31, 2022 
and 3.26 
for the 
year ended 
2021. The 
 overall and individual 
yields for interest-bearing 
assets and interest 
-bearing liabilities 
both increased in 
2022 compared to 
 2021 due primarily to increases 
in market rates of interest. 
 Provision for Credit Losses 
 ACL represents 
probable 
incurred 
losses 
in 
our 
portfolio. We 
maintain 
an 
adequate ACL 
that 
can 
mitigate 
probable 
 losses incurred 
in the 
loan portfolio. 
The ACL is increased 
by the 
provision for 
credit losses 
and is 
decreased by 
charge-
 offs, 
net 
of 
recoveries 
on 
prior 
loan 
charge-offs. 
There 
are 
multiple 
credit 
quality 
metrics 
that 
we 
use 
to 
base 
our 
 determination of 
the amount 
of the ACL 
and corresponding 
provision for 
credit losses. 
These credit 
metrics 
evaluate the 
 credit 
quality 
and 
level 
of 
credit 
risk 
inherent 
in 
our 
loan 
portfolio, 
assess 
non-performing 
loans 
and 
charge-offs 
levels, 
 considers statistical trends and economic conditions and other 
applicable factors.

Provision for credit loss 
for the year ended 
December 31, 2022, was 
 2.5 million compared to 
a net reduction of 
 160 
 thousand in provision 
expense for 
the same period 
in 2021. The 
primary driver of 
the increase was 
loan growth. The ACL 
 as a percentage of total loans was 1.16 
at December 31, 2022 compared to 1.27 at December 
31, 2021. 
 See Allowance 
for Credit 
Losses 
below for 
further discussion on 
how the 
ACL was 
calculated for 
the periods 
presented. 

 Non-Interest Income 
 Net interest income 
and other types of 
recurring non-interest 
income are generated 
from our operations. 
Our services 
 and products generate service charges and fees, mainly from our depository accounts. 
We also generate income from gain 
 on sale of 
loans though 
our swap and 
SBA programs. In addition, 
we own insurance 
on several employees 
and generate 
 income reflecting the increase in the cash surrender value 
of these policies.

income for the dates indicated (in thousands):

 Non-interest income 
for the 
year ended 
December 31, 2022 
was 5.2 
million compared 
to 10.7 
million for 
the same 
 period in 2021. This decrease was primarily driven by 2.5 
million loss on sale of securities in 2022 and one-time items that 
 generated income in 2021 but not in 2022. One-time items in 2021 include a 2.5 million interest recovery related to a prior 
 lending customer 
and a gain 
on the 
sale of 
a previously 
owned building 
for 983 
thousand. In 
the fourth 
quarter of 
2022, 
 the 
Company 
executed 
a 
portfolio 
restructuring 
strategy 
which 
resulted 
in 
a 
sale 
of 
 17.0 
million 
of 
its 
lower-yielding 
 available-for-sale 
securities 
for 
a 
loss 
of 
 2.0 
million. 
Proceeds 
from 
the 
sale 
will 
be 
reinvested 
in 
securities 
and 
loans 
 currently yielding higher than the securities that were sold. 
 Non-Interest Expense

 Non-interest expense for 
the year ended 
December 31, 2022 
increased 3.6 million 
or 10.2 , compared 
to the same 
 period in 
2021. The 
increase is 
primarily due 
to an 
increase in 
salaries and 
employee benefit 
costs of 
 2.5 million for 
the 
 year ended 
December 31, 2022, 
compared to 
the same 
period in 2021. 
The headcount 
of full-time 
equivalent employees 
 increased 
from 
187 
at 
December 31, 
2021 
to 
191 
at 
December 31, 
2022. 
Further, 
consulting 
and 
legal 
fees 
and 
other 
 operating expenses 
increased 436 
thousand or 
30.0 and 
 403 thousand 
or 7.6 , 
respectively, during 
the year 
ended 
 December 31, 
2022 compared 
to the 
same 
period in 
2021 
due to 
our first 
full 
year of 
operations 
as a 
publicly 
reporting 
 company. 
The increase in salaries and employee 
benefits, consulting and legal fees, 
and other operating costs has 
enabled 
 us to support recent growth 
and has provided us 
with the necessary technology and 
required professionals to execute 
our 
 growth strategy.

Provision for Income Tax 
 Fluctuations in the effective tax rate reflect the effect of the differences in the inclusion or deductibility of certain income 
 and expense for income tax purposes. 
Therefore, future decisions on the investments we 
choose will affect our effective tax 
 rate. Changes in the 
cash surrender 
value of bank-owned 
life insurance policies 
for key employees, 
purchasing municipal 
 bonds, and overall taxable income will be important elements 
in determining our effective tax rate. 
 Income 
tax expense 
for the 
year ended 
December 31, 
2022 was 
 6.9 million, 
compared 
to 6.6 million 
for 
the 
year 
 ended December 31, 2021. The effective 
tax rate for the year 
ended December 31, 2022 was 25.6 
and for the year 
ended 
 December 31, 2021 was 23.8 .

 Investment Securities 
 The investment portfolio 
is used and 
managed to provide 
liquidity through cash 
flows, marketability 
and, if necessary, 
 collateral for 
borrowings. The 
investment portfolio 
is also 
used as 
a tool 
to manage 
interest rate

The 
investment 
portfolio 
is 
managed 
in 
accordance 
with 
the 
Asset 
and 
Liability 
Management ALM 
policy, 
which 
 includes an 
investment guideline, 
approved by 
the Board. 
Such policy 
is reviewed 
at least 
annually or 
more frequently 
if 
 deemed 
necessary, 
depending 
on market 
conditions and/or 
unexpected 
events. 
The 
investment 
portfolio composition 
is 
 subject to change 
depending on the 
funding and liquidity 
needs of the 
Company, and the interest risk 
management objective 
 directed by the ALCO. The portfolio of investments can be used to modify the duration of 
the balance sheet. The allocation 
 of cash into 
securities takes 
into consideration 
anticipated future cash 
flows (uses 
and sources) and 
all available sources 
 of credit. 
 Our 
investment 
portfolio 
consists 
primarily 
of 
securities 
issued 
by 
U.S. 
government-sponsored 
agencies, 
agency 
 mortgage-backed securities, 
collateralized mortgage 
obligation securities, 
municipal securities, 
and other 
debt securities, 
 all with varying contractual maturities and coupons. Due to the optionality embedded in these securities, the final maturities 
 do not 
necessarily represent the 
expected life of 
the portfolio. Some 
of these 
securities will be 
called or paid 
down depending 
 on capital market conditions and expectations. The investment portfolio is regularly reviewed by the Chief Financial Officer, 
 Treasurer, 
or the 
ALCO of 
the Company 
to ensure 
an appropriate 
risk and 
return profile 
as well 
as for 
adherence to 
the 
 investment policy. 
 As of December 
31, 2022, the investment portfolio consisted of available-for-sale AFS and held-to-maturity HTM 
 debt securities. 
During the third quarter of 2022, there were 26 investment securities that was 
transferred from AFS to HTM 
 with an amortized cost basis and fair value amount 
of 74.4 million and 63.8 million, respectively. 
On the date of transfer, 
 these securities 
had a 
total net 
unrealized loss 
of 10.6 
million. The 
transfer of 
the debt 
securities from 
the AFS 
to HTM 
 category was 
made at 
fair value 
at the 
date of 
transfer. 
The unrealized 
gain or 
loss 
at the 
date of 
transfer is 
retained in 
 accumulated other 
comprehensive income 
and in 
the carrying 
value of 
the HTM 
securities. Such 
amounts are 
amortized 
 over the remaining life of the security. 
There was no impact to net income on the date of transfer. 
 The book value of the AFS securities is adjusted monthly 
for unrealized gain or loss as a valuation allowance, 
and any 
 gain 
or 
loss 
is 
reported 
on 
an 
after-tax 
basis 
as 
a 
component 
of 
other 
comprehensive 
income 
in 
stockholders 
equity. 
 Periodically, 
we 
may 
need 
to 
assess 
whether 
there 
have 
been 
any 
events 
or 
unexpected 
economic 
circumstances 
to 
 indicate that 
a security 
on which 
there is 
an unrealized 
loss is 
impaired on 
an other-than-temporary 
basis OTTI ). 
If the 
 impairment is 
deemed to 
be permanent, 
an analysis 
would be made 
considering many 
factors, including 
the severity 
and 
 duration of the impairment, the severity 
of the event, our intent and 
ability to hold the security for 
a period of time sufficient 
 for a 
recovery in 
value, recent 
events specific 
to the 
issuer or 
industry, 
any related 
credit events, 
and for 
debt securities, 
 external 
credit 
ratings 
and 
recent 
downgrades 
related 
to 
deterioration 
of 
credit 
quality. 
Securities 
on 
which 
there 
is 
an 
 unrealized loss 
that is 
deemed to 
be OTTI 
are written 
down to fair 
value, with 
the write-down 
recorded as 
a realized 
loss 
 under line item 
 Gain (loss) on 
sale of securities 
available-for-sale, net of 
the Consolidated Statements 
of Operations. As 
 of 
December 31, 
2022, there 
are no 
securities 
which 
management 
has classified 
as 
OTTI. 
For further 
discussion 
of 
our 
 analysis 
on 
impaired 
investment 
securities 
for 
OTTI,

Note 2 
 Investment 
Securities 
to 
the 
Consolidated 
Financial 
 Statements in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. 
 AFS and HTM investment securities 
in aggregate decreased 105.4 million or 20.1 
to 418.8 million at December 31, 
 2022 from 524.2 
million at 
December 31, 2021. 
Investment securities 
decreased over the 
past year as 
repayments from 
 securities were 
allocated to 
fund loan 
growth. 
Management reinvested 
the repayments 
of securities 
and income 
from the 
 sale of securities into higher 
yielding loans. As of December 
31, 2022, securities with a 
market value of 49.0 million 
were 
 pledged to secure 
public deposits. 
As of December 
31, 2022, the 
Company did 
not have any 
tax-exempt securities 
in the 
 portfolio.

 Loans 
 Loans are 
the largest 
category of 
interest-earning assets 
on the 
Consolidated 
Balance Sheets, 
and usually 
provides 
 higher yields than the remainder of the Company s 
interest-earning assets. Higher yields typically carry 
inherent credit and 
 liquidity risks in 
comparison to lower 
yielding assets. The 
Company manages and 
mitigates such risks 
in accordance with 
 the credit and ALM policies, risk tolerance and balance 
sheet composition.

 Tot 
al gross loans increased by 315.6 million or 26.5 at December 
31, 2022 compared to December 31, 20211. 
The 
 most significant 
growth was 
in the 
commercial real 
estate and 
consumer 
and other 
loan pools, 
offset 
by a 
decline in 
the 
 residential real estate and commercial and industrial loan pools. Consumer 
and other loans increased primarily as result of 
 organic 
growth 
from 
our 
yacht 
lending 
business 
vertical 
created 
in 
January 
2022. 
Commercial 
and 
industrial 
loans 
 decreased primarily because of continuing PPP loan forgiveness 
as expected. 
 Other 
than 
the 
shifts 
note 
above, 
we 
do 
not 
expect 
any 
significant 
changes 
over 
the 
foreseeable 
future 
in 
the 
 composition 
of 
our 
loan 
portfolio 
or 
in 
our 
emphasis 
on 
commercial 
real 
estate 
lending. 
Our 
loan 
growth 
strategy 
since 
 inception has been reflective of the market in which we 
operate and of our strategic plan as approved by the 
Board. 
 The 
growth 
experienced 
over 
the 
last 
couple 
of 
years 
is 
primarily 
due 
to 
implementation 
of 
our 
relationship-based 
 banking 
model 
and 
the 
success 
of 
our 
relationship 
managers 
in 
competing 
for 
new 
business 
in 
a 
highly 
competitive 
 metropolitan area. Many of our 
larger loan clients have lengthy 
relationships with members of our senior 
management team 
 or our relationship managers that date back to former 
institutions. 

 From a 
liquidity perspective, 
our loan 
portfolio provides 
us with 
additional 
liquidity due 
to repayments 
or unexpected 
 prepayments.

 The information 
presented 
in the 
table above 
is based 
upon the 
contractual maturities 
of the 
individual 
loans, which 
 may be 
subject to 
renewal at 
their contractual 
maturity. 
Renewals will 
depend on 
approval by 
our credit 
department 
and 
 balance sheet 
composition at the 
time of the 
analysis, as 
well as 
any modification of 
terms at 
the loan s maturity. Additionally, 
 maturity 
concentrations, 
loan 
duration, 
prepayment 
speeds 
and 
other 
interest 
rate 
sensitivity 
measures 
are 
discussed, 
 reviewed, and analyzed by the ALCO. Decisions on term 
rate modifications are discussed as well. 

 As of 
December 31, 
2022, approximately 
61.8 
of 
the loans 
have adjustable/variable 
rates 
and 
38.2 
of 
the loans 
 have fixed rates. 
The adjustable/variable 
loans re-price to 
different benchmarks 
and tenors in different 
periods of time. 
By 
 contractual characteristics, there are no 
material concentrations on anniversary repricing. Additionally, it is 
important to note 

Table of Contents 

55 
USCB Financial Holdings, Inc. 
2022 10-K 

that most 
of our 
loans have 
interest rate 
floors. This 
embedded option 
protects the 
Company from 
a decrease 
in interest 
 rates and positions us to gain in the scenario of higher interest 
rates.
 Asset Quality 

 Our asset quality grading 
analysis estimates the capability of 
the borrower to 
repay the contractual obligation of 
the loan 
 agreement as scheduled or at all. The Company s internal credit risk grading system is based on experiences with similarly 
 graded loans. Internal 
credit risk 
grades are evaluated 
at least annually, 
or more frequently 
if deemed necessary. 
Internal 
 credit 
risk 
ratings 
may 
change 
based 
on 
management s 
assessment 
of 
the 
results 
from 
the 
annual 
review, 
portfolio 
 monitoring and other developments observed with borrowers. 

 The internal credit risk grades used by the Company to 
assess the credit worthiness of a loan are shown below: 
 Pass 
 Loans indicate different levels of satisfactory financial 
condition and performance. 

 Special Mention
 
 Loans classified as special mention have a potential weakness 
that deserves management s 
 close attention. If left uncorrected, these potential weaknesses 
may result in deterioration of the repayment 
 prospects for the loan or of the institution s 
credit position at some future date. 

 Substandard 
 Loans classified as substandard are inadequately protected 
by the current net worth and paying 
 capacity of the obligator or of the collateral pledged, if 
any. Loans so classified 
have a well-defined weakness or 
 weaknesses that jeopardize the liquidation of the debt. 
They are characterized by the distinct possibility that the 
 institution will sustain some loss if the deficiencies are 
not corrected. 

 Doubtful
 
 Loans classified as doubtful have all the weaknesses 
inherent in those classified at substandard, with 
 the added characteristic that the weaknesses make collection or 
liquidation in full on the basis of currently existing 
 facts, conditions, and values, highly questionable and improbable. 

 Loss 
 Loans classified as loss are considered uncollectible. 
 Loan credit exposures by internally assigned grades are

 Non-performing 
assets include 
all loans 
categorized as 
non-accrual or 
restructured, 
impaired securities, 
non-accrual 
 troubled 
debt 
restructurings TDRs ), 
OREO 
and 
other 
repossessed 
assets. 
Problem 
loans 
for 
which 
the 
collection 
or 
 liquidation in full is reasonably uncertain 
are placed on a non-accrual status. This 
determination is based on current existing 
 facts concerning 
collateral values and 
the paying 
capacity of the 
borrower. When the collection 
of the 
full contractual balance 
 is unlikely, 
the loan 
is placed 
on non-accrual 
to avoid 
overstating the 
Company s 
income for 
a loan 
with increased 
credit 
 risk. 

 If the 
principal or 
interest on 
a commercial 
loan becomes 
due and 
unpaid for 
90 days 
or more, 
the loan 
is placed 
on 
 non-accrual status as of 
the date it becomes 
90 days past due and 
remains in non-accrual 
status until it meets 
the criteria 
 for restoration to accrual status. 
Residential loans, on 
the other hand, are placed 
on non-accrual status when 
the principal 
 or interest 
becomes due 
and unpaid 
for 120 
days or 
more and 
remains in 
non-accrual status 
until it meets 
the criteria 
for 
 restoration 
to 
accrual 
status. 
Restoring 
a 
loan 
to 
accrual 
status 
is 
possible 
when 
the 
borrower 
resumes 
payment 
of 
all 
 principal and interest 
payments for a period 
of six months 
and the Company 
has a documented 
expectation of repayment 
 of the remaining contractual principal and interest or the 
loan becomes secured and in the process of collection. 
 A TDR is 
a debtor that 
is experiencing financial 
difficulties and 
the Company grants 
a concession. This 
determination 
 is performed during the annual review process or whenever problems 
are surfacing regarding the client s ability to repay in 
 accordance with 
the original 
terms of 
the loan 
or line 
of credit. 
In general, 
a borrower 
that can 
obtain funds 
from sources 
 other than 
the Company 
at market 
interest rates 
at or 
near those 
for non-troubled 
debt is 
not involved 
in a 
troubled debt 
 restructuring. 
The 
concessions 
are 
given 
to 
the 
debtor 
in 
various 
forms, 
including 
interest 
rate 
reductions, 
principal 
 forgiveness, 
extension 
of 
maturity 
date, 
waiver, 
or 
deferral 
of 
payments 
and 
other 
concessions 
intended 
to 
minimize 
 potential losses.

 Allowance for Credit Losses 
 In 
determining 
the 
balance 
of 
the 
allowance 
account, 
loans 
are 
pooled 
by 
product 
segments 
with 
similar 
risk 
 characteristics and management 
evaluates the ACL on 
each segment and on 
a regular basis to maintain 
the allowance at 
 an 
adequate 
level 
based 
on 
factors 
which, 
in 
management s 
judgment, 
deserve 
current 
recognition 
in 
estimating 
credit 
 losses. 
Such 
factors 
include 
changes 
in 
prevailing 
economic 
conditions, 
historical 
loss 
experience, 
delinquency 
trends, 
 changes in the composition and size of the loan portfolio and 
the overall credit worthiness of the borrowers. 
 Additionally, 
qualitative adjustments 
are made to the 
ACL when, based 
on management s 
judgment, there are 
factors 
 impacting the allowance estimate not considered by the 
quantitative calculations.

 Deposits 
 Customer deposits are the 
primary funding source for 
the Bank s growth. 
Through our network of 
banking centers, we 
 offer a competitive array of deposit 
accounts and treasury management services designed 
to meet our customers business 
 needs. Our primary 
deposit customers 
are SMBs, and 
the personal business 
of owners and 
operators of 
these SMBs, 
as 
 well as the retail/consumer relationships of the employees 
of these businesses. Our focus on quality and customer 
service 
 has created a strong brand recognition within 
our depositors, which reflects in the composition 
of our deposits; most of our 
 funding sources are core deposits. In addition to our banking centers network, 
we developed business verticals to diversify 
 our portfolio in different specialty industries and 
we offer public fund deposit products 
to municipalities and public agencies 
 in our geographical footprint. 

 Furthermore, our 
personal and 
private banking 
management 
line of 
business is 
focused on 
the needs 
of the 
owners 
 and operators of 
our business customers, 
offering a suite 
of checking, savings, 
money market and 
time deposit accounts, 
 and utilizing superior 
client service 
to build and 
expand client relationships. 
A unique aspect 
of our business 
model is our 
 ability to offer correspondent services to banks 
in Central America and the Caribbean.

 Critical elements of our liquidity 
risk management include: effective corporate governance consisting of 
oversight by the 
 Board and 
ALCO and 
active involvement 
by senior 
management; 
appropriate strategies, 
policies, procedures, 
and limits 
 used 
to 
identify 
and 
mitigate 
liquidity 
risk; 
comprehensive 
liquidity 
risk 
measurement 
and 
monitoring 
systems 
(including 
 assessments 
of 
the 
current 
and 
prospective 
cash 
flows 
or 
sources 
and 
uses 
of 
funds) 
that 
are 
commensurate 
with 
the 
 complexity and business activities of the Company; active management of intraday liquidity and collateral; an appropriately 
 diverse mix 
of existing 
and potential 
future funding 
sources; adequate 
levels of 
highly liquid 
marketable securities 
free of 
 legal, regulatory, or operational impediments, that 
can be used 
to meet liquidity 
needs in stressful 
situations; comprehensive 
 contingency 
funding 
plans 
that 
sufficiently 
address 
potential 
adverse 
liquidity 
events 
and 
emergency 
cash 
flow 
 requirements; 
and 
internal 
controls and 
internal 
audit 
processes 
sufficient 
to 
determine 
the 
adequacy 
of 
the 
institution s 
 liquidity risk management process. 
 We 
expect 
funds 
to 
be 
available 
from 
several 
basic 
banking 
activity 
sources, 
including 
the 
core 
deposit 
base, 
the 
 repayment and maturity of loans and investment security 
cash flows. Other potential funding sources include 
federal funds 
 purchased, brokered 
certificates of 
deposit, listing 
certificates of 
deposit, Fed 
funds lines 
and borrowings 
from 
the FHLB 
 Atlanta. Accordingly, our liquidity resources were at sufficient levels to 
fund loans and meet other 
cash needs as necessary.

 As

of 
the 
FHLB 
Atlanta, 
we 
are 
eligible 
to 
obtain 
advances 
with 
various 
terms 
and 
conditions. 
This 
 accessibility of additional 
funding allows us 
to efficiently and 
timely meet both 
expected and unexpected 
outgoing cash flows 
 and collateral needs without adversely affecting 
either daily operations or the financial condition 
of the Company. 
 Outstanding fixed-rate advances from the FHLB were at 46.0 million and 36.0 million, as of December 31, 2022, and 
 December 31, 2021, 
respectively. 
The weighted average 
rate for outstanding 
FHLB advances at

temporary 
 fluctuations in our daily

 line of credit.
 Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements 
 We engage 
in various financial 
transactions in 
our operations 
that, under GAAP, 
may not be 
included on 
the balance 
 sheet. To 
meet the financing needs 
of our customers we may 
include commitments to extend 
credit and standby letters 
of 
 credit. To 
a varying 
degree, such 
commitments 
involve elements 
of credit, 
market, 
and interest 
rate risk 
in excess 
of the 
 amount recognized 
in the 
balance sheet. 
We 
use more 
conservative credit 
and collateral 
policies in 
making these 
credit 
 commitments as we 
do for on-balance sheet 
items. We are not 
aware of any accounting 
loss to be 
incurred by funding 
these 
 commitments; however, 
we maintain an allowance for 
off-balance sheet credit risk 
which is recorded under other 
liabilities 
 on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. 
 Since commitments associated with letters of 
credit and commitments to extend 
credit may expire unused, the 
amounts 
 shown do not necessarily 
reflect the actual 
future cash funding 
requirements. 
The following table 
presents lending related 
 commitments outstanding as of December 31, 2022 and

 Commitments to extend credit are agreements to lend funds to a client, as long as there is no violation of any condition 
 established 
in 
the 
contract, 
for 
a 
specific 
purpose. 
Commitments 
generally 
have 
variable 
interest 
rates, 
fixed 
expiration 
 dates or 
other 
termination 
clauses 
and may 
require 
payment 
of 
a fee. 
Since many 
of 
the commitments 
are expected 
to 
 expire without being 
fully drawn, the 
total commitment 
amounts disclosed 
above do not 
necessarily represent 
future cash 
 requirements. 
 Unfunded lines of credit represent unused portions of credit facilities to our current borrowers that represent no change 
 in credit risk in our portfolio. Lines 
of credit generally have variable interest 
rates. The maximum potential amount 
of future 
 payments we could 
be required to 
make is represented 
by the contractual 
amount of 
the commitment, 
less the amount 
of 
 any advances made. 
 Letters of credit are 
conditional commitments 
issued by us to guarantee 
the performance of 
a client to a third 
party. In 
 the event of nonperformance by the 
client in accordance with the terms 
of the agreement with the third party, 
we would be 
 required to fund 
the commitment. 
If the commitment 
is funded, we 
would be entitled 
to seek 
recovery from 
the client from 
 the underlying collateral, 
which can include 
commercial real estate, 
physical plant and 
property, inventory, receivables, cash 
 or marketable securities.

Asset and Liability Management Committee 
 The asset and liability management committee of our Company, 
or ALCO, consists of members of senior management 
 and our Board. Senior management is responsible for 
ensuring in a timely manner that Board 
approved strategies, policies, 
 and procedures 
for managing 
and mitigating 
risks are 
appropriately executed 
within the 
designated lines 
of authority 
and 
 responsibility. 
 ALCO 
oversees 
the 
establishment, 
approval, 
implementation, 
and 
review 
of 
interest 
rate 
risk, 
management, 
and 
 mitigation strategies, ALM related policies, ALCO procedures 
and risk tolerances and appetite. 
 While some degree of interest 
rate risk IRR exposure is inherent 
to the banking business, our ALCO 
has established 
 sound risk management practices in place to identify, 
measure, monitor and mitigate IRR exposures. 
 When assessing 
the scope 
of IRR 
exposure 
and 
impact on 
the consolidated 
balance sheet, 
cash 
flows and 
income 
 statement, 
management 
considers 
both 
earnings 
and 
economic 
impacts. 
Asset 
price 
variations, 
deposits 
volatility 
and 
 reduced earnings or outright losses could adversely affect 
the Company s liquidity, 
performance, and capital adequacy. 
 Income simulations 
are used 
to assess 
the impact 
of changing 
rates on 
earnings under 
different rates 
scenarios and 
 time horizons. 
These simulations 
utilize both 
instantaneous and 
parallel changes 
in the 
level of 
interest rates, 
as well 
as 
 non-parallel changes such as changing slopes (flat and steeping) and 
twists of the yield curve, Static simulation models are 
 based on current exposures and 
assume a constant balance sheet with 
no new growth. Dynamic simulation analysis is 
also 
 utilized to have a 
more comprehensive assessment 
on IRR. This simulation 
relies on detailed 
assumptions outlined in 
our 
 budget and strategic plan, and in assumptions regarding changes in 
existing lines of business, new business, management 
 strategies and client expected behavior. 
 To 
have 
a 
more 
complete 
picture 
of 
IRR, 
the 
Company 
also 
evaluates 
the 
economic 
value 
of 
equity, 
or 
EVE. 
This 
 assessment 
allows 
us 
to 
measure 
the 
degree 
to 
which 
the 
economic 
values 
will 
change 
under 
different 
interest 
rate 
 scenarios. The economic value of equity approach focuses on 
a longer-term time horizon and captures all 
future cash flows 
 expected from existing assets and liabilities. 
The economic value model utilizes a 
static approach in that the analysis does 
 not incorporate new business; rather, 
the analysis shows a snapshot in time of the risk 
inherent in the balance sheet.
 Market and Interest Rate Risk Management 
 
According to our ALCO model, as of December 31, 2022, we were a 
liability sensitive bank for year one modeling and 
 asset sensitive for year two modeling. 
Asset sensitivity indicates that our 
assets generally reprice faster than 
our liabilities, 
 which results in a favorable impact to net interest income when market interest rates increase. 
Liability sensitivity indicates 
 that our liabilities 
generally reprice faster 
than our assets, 
which results in 
a favorable impact 
to net interest 
income when 
 market interest 
rates decrease. 
Many assumptions 
are used 
to calculate 
the impact 
of interest 
rate variations 
on our 
net 
 interest 
income, 
such 
as 
asset 
prepayment 
speeds, 
non-maturity 
deposit 
price 
sensitivity, 
pricing 
correlations, 
deposit 
 truncations and decay rates, and key interest rate drivers. 
 Because of the inherent use 
of these estimates and 
assumptions in the model, 
our actual results may, 
and most likely 
 will, differ from static measures results. In addition, static measures like 
EVEs do not include actions that management may 
 undertake to manage the risks in response to anticipated changes in interest rates or client deposit behavior. As part of our 
 ALM strategy 
and 
policy, 
management 
has the 
ability to 
modify 
the 
balance sheet 
to 
either increase 
asset 
duration 
and 
 decrease liability 
duration to reduce 
asset sensitivity, 
or to decrease 
asset duration and 
increase liability duration 
in order 
 to increase asset sensitivity. 
 According to our model, as of December 31, 2022, the NIM will remain fairly stable for static rate scenarios (-400 
basis 
 points: 
+400 
basis 
points). 
For 
the 
static 
forecast 
for 
year 
one, 
the 
estimated 
NIM 
will decrease 
from 
3.38 
base 
case 
 scenario to 3.20 
under a +400-basis 
points scenario. Additionally, utilizing an economic 
value of equity, or EVE, 
approach, 
 we analyze the 
risk to capital 
from the 
effects of 
various interest rate 
scenarios through 
a long-term 
discounted cash flow 
 model. This 
measures the 
difference between 
the economic 
value of our 
assets and 
the economic 
value of 
our liabilities, 
 which is 
a proxy for 
our liquidation value. 
According to our 
balance sheet composition, 
and as expected, 
our model stipulates 
 that an increase 
of interest 
rates will have 
a negative impact 
on the EVE. 
Results and analysis 
are presented quarterly 
to 
 the ALCO, and strategies are reviewed and refined. 
 Additionally, in the last couple of quarters we 
have been reducing our asset 
sensitivity by extending asset duration. 
This 
 has reduced our 
NII volatility 
for the first 
and second year 
in the analysis 
and has 
helped us to 
maintain the NII 
in accordance 
 with ALCO expectations.

Liquidity 
 
Liquidity is 
defined as 
a Company s capacity 
to meet 
its cash 
and collateral 
obligations at 
a reasonable 
cost. Maintaining 
 an adequate level of liquidity depends on the Company s ability to efficiently meet both expected and 
unexpected cash flow 
 and collateral needs without adversely affecting 
either daily operations or the financial condition of 
the Company. 
 Liquidity risk 
is the 
risk that 
we will 
be unable 
to meet 
our short-term 
and long-term 
obligations as 
they become 
due 
 because of an inability to 
liquidate assets or obtain adequate funding on 
acceptable terms. The Company s obligations, and 
 the funding sources used 
to meet them, depend 
significantly on our business mix, balance 
sheet structure and composition, 
 credit quality of our assets and the cash flow profiles of 
our on- and off-balance sheet obligations. 
 In managing 
inflows and 
outflows, 
management 
regularly monitors 
situations that 
can give 
rise to 
increased 
liquidity 
 risk. These 
include funding 
mismatches, market 
constraints on 
the ability 
to convert 
assets (particularly 
investments) into 
 cash or in 
accessing sources 
of funds (i.e., 
market liquidity), 
and contingent 
liquidity events. Management 
presents to the 
 ALCO, on a quarterly basis, liquidity stress tests foll 
owing the scenarios described in the Bank s 
contingency funding plan. 

 Changes in macroeconomic conditions or exposure 
to credit, market, operational, legal 
and reputational risks, including 
 cybersecurity risk could also affect the Company 
 s liquidity risk profile unexpectedly 
and are considered in the assessment 
 of liquidity and ALM framework. 
 Management has established 
a comprehensive and 
holistic management process for 
identifying, measuring, monitoring 
 and 
mitigating 
liquidity 
risk. 
Due 
to 
its 
critical 
importance 
to 
the 
viability 
of 
the 
Company, 
liquidity 
risk 
management 
is 
 integrated into our risk management processes and ALM 
policy. 
 Critical elements of our liquidity 
risk management include: effective corporate governance consisting of 
oversight by the 
 Board and 
ALCO and 
active involvement 
by senior 
management; 
appropriate strategies, 
policies, procedures, 
and limits 
 used 
to 
identify 
and 
mitigate 
liquidity 
risk; 
comprehensive 
liquidity 
risk 
measurement 
and 
monitoring 
systems 
(including 
 assessments 
of 
the 
current 
and 
prospective 
cash 
flows 
or 
sources 
and 
uses 
of 
funds) 
that 
are 
commensurate 
with 
the 
 complexity and business activities of the Company; active management of intraday liquidity and collateral; an appropriately 
 diverse mix 
of existing 
and potential 
future funding 
sources; adequate 
levels of 
highly liquid 
marketable securities 
free of 
 legal, regulatory, or operational impediments, that 
can be used 
to meet liquidity 
needs in stressful 
situations; comprehensive 
 contingency 
funding 
plans 
that 
sufficiently 
address 
potential 
adverse 
liquidity 
events 
and 
emergency 
cash 
flow 
 requirements; 
and 
internal 
controls and 
internal 
audit 
processes 
sufficient 
to 
determine 
the 
adequacy 
of 
the 
institution s 
 liquidity risk management process. 
 We 
expect 
funds 
to 
be 
available 
from 
several 
basic 
banking 
activity 
sources, 
including 
the 
core 
deposit 
base, 
the 
 repayment and maturity of loans and investment security 
cash flows. Other potential funding sources include 
federal funds 
 purchased, brokered 
certificates of 
deposit, listing 
certificates of 
deposit, Fed 
funds lines 
and borrowings 
from 
the FHLB 
 Atlanta. Accordingly, our liquidity resources were at sufficient levels to 
fund loans and meet other 
cash needs as necessary.

 Impact of Inflation 
 Our Consolidated 
Financial Statements 
and related 
notes have been 
prepared in 
accordance with 
U.S. GAAP, 
which 
 requires the 
measurement of 
financial position 
and operating 
results in 
terms of 
historical dollars, 
without considering 
the 
 changes 
in 
the 
relative 
purchasing 
power 
of 
money 
over 
time 
due 
to 
inflation. 
The 
impact 
of 
inflation 
is 
reflected 
in 
the 
 increased cost of operations. 
Unlike most industrial companies, 
nearly all our assets and 
liabilities are monetary in 
nature. 
 As a result, 
interest rates have a 
greater impact on our 
performance than do the 
effects of general levels 
of inflation. Periods 
 of high inflation 
are often accompanied 
by relatively higher 
interest rates, and 
periods of low 
inflation are accompanied 
by 
 relatively lower interest rates. 
As market interest rates 
rise or fall in relation 
to the rates earned 
on loans and investments, 
 the 
value 
of 
these 
assets 
decreases 
or 
increases 
respectively. 
Inflation 
can 
also 
impact 
core 
non-interest 
expenses 
 associated with delivering the Company s 
services.

Reconciliation and Management Explanation of Non 
-GAAP Financial Measures 
 Management 
has 
included 
these 
non-GAAP 
measures 
because 
it 
believes 
these 
measures 
may 
provide 
useful 
 supplemental information 
for evaluating 
the Company s 
underlying performance 
trends. Further, 
management uses 
these 
 measures 
in 
managing 
and 
evaluating 
the 
Company s 
business 
and 
intends 
to 
refer 
to 
them 
in 
discussions 
about 
our 
 operations and performance. 
Operating performance 
measures should be 
viewed in addition 
to, and not 
as an alternative 
 to or 
substitute 
for, 
measures 
determined 
in 
accordance 
with GA 
AP, 
and 
are 
not 
necessarily 
comparable 
to non-GAAP 
 measures 
that may 
be presented 
by other 
companies. 
The 
Company believes 
these 
non-GAAP 
measurements 
are key 
 indicators of 
the earnings power 
of the Company.

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED 
PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM 
 Stockholders and the Board of Directors of 
 USCB Financial Holdings, Inc. 
 Doral, Florida 
 Opinion on the Financial Statements 
 We 
have audited 
the 
accompanying 
consolidated 
balance sheets 
of 
USCB Financial 
Holdings, 
Inc. 
(the 
 "Company") 
as 
of 
December 
31, 
2022 
and 
2021, 
the 
related 
consolidated 
statements 
of 
operations, 
 comprehensive income 
(loss), changes 
in stockholders 
equity, 
and cash 
flows for 
the years 
then ended, 
 and the 
related 
notes 
(collectively 
referred 
to as 
the 
"financial statements"). 
In 
our opinion, 
the 
financial 
 statements present fairly, in all material respects, the 
financial position of the Company as 
of December 31, 
 2022 and 2021, 
and the results of its operations 
and its cash flows for the 
years then ended, in conformity 
 with accounting principles generally accepted in the United 
States of America. 
 Basis for Opinion 
 These financial 
statements are 
the responsibility 
of the 
Company's management. 
Our responsibility 
is to 
 express an opinion 
on the Company's financial 
statements based on our 
audits. We are a 
public accounting 
 firm registered 
with the 
Public Company 
Accounting Oversight 
Board (United 
States) ("PCAOB") 
and are 
 required to be 
independent with respect to 
the Company in accordance with 
the U.S. federal 
securities laws 
 and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities 
and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. 

 We conducted 
our audits 
in accordance 
with the 
standards of 
the PCAOB. 
Those standards 
require that 
 we plan and perform the 
audit to obtain reasonable 
assurance about whether the 
financial statements are 
 free 
of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. 

 Our 
audits 
included 
performing 
procedures 
to 
assess 
the 
risks 
of 
material 
misstatement 
of 
the 
financial 
 statements, 
whether due 
to error 
or fraud, 
and performing 
procedures that 
respond 
to those 
risks. 
Such 
 procedures 
included examining, 
on a 
test basis, 
evidence 
regarding the 
amounts 
and disclosures 
in the 
 financial 
statements. 
Our 
audits 
also 
included 
evaluating 
the 
accounting 
principles 
used 
and 
significant 
 estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the 
overall presentation of the financial statements. 
 We believe that our audits provide a reasonable 
basis for our opinion.

to 
its 
allowance 
for

losses 
at 
December 
31, 
2022. 
Reserve 
on 
unfunded 
 commitments will 
also increase 
approximately 

thousand to 

thousand and 
it will 
be recognized 
as a 
liability on 
 the 
Consolidated 
Balance 
Sheet. 
The 
Company 
reviewed 
it s 
held-to-maturity 
debt 
securities 
and 
the 
allowance 
was 
 deemed immaterial. The Company will 
initially apply the impact of 
the new guidance through 
a cumulative-effect adjustment 
 to retained 
earnings 
as 
of 
January 
1, 
2023. Future 
adjustments 
to credit 
loss 
expectations 
will be 
recorded 
through 
the 
 income statement as charges or credits to earnings. 
 The disclosed estimates are subject to further refinement upon finalization of the Company s review of the calculations, 
 assumptions, methodologies and judgments. Internal controls over financial reporting relating 
to these new processes have 
 been designed 
and 
implemented 
and are 
being evaluated. 
The 
Company 
is 
in 
the final 
stages 
of 
completing 
the formal 
 governance 
and 
approval 
process. 
The 
ongoing 
impact 
to 
the 
Company s 
results 
of 
operations 
in 
future 
periods 
will 
be 
 influenced 
by 
the 
loan 
portfolio 
composition 
and 
by 
macroeconomic 
conditions 
and 
forecasts 
at 
each 
reporting 
date. 
 Adoption of 
the standard 
on the 
first quarter 
of 2023 
is expected 
to result 
in higher 
volatility in 
the quarterly 
provision for 
 credit losses when compared to the Company s 
historical results under the incurred loss model.

This

eliminates 
the 
accounting 
guidance 
for 
troubled 
debt 
 restructurings 
by 
creditors 
in 
ASC

and 
it 
enhances

involving 
borrowers 
experiencing 
financial 
difficulty. 
Specifically, 
rather 
than 
applying 
the

 restructuring recognition and measurement guidance, 
creditors will evaluate all 
loan modifications to determine if 
they result 
 in 
a

loan 
or 
a 
continuation 
of

million 
of 
unrealized 
losses 
on 
mortgage 
backed 
securities 
and 
 collateralized 
mortgage 
obligations 
of 
government 
sponsored 
entities 
having 
a 
fair 
value 
of 

million 
that 
were 
 attributable 
to 
a 
combination 
of 
factors, 
including 
relative 
changes 
in 
interest 
rates 
since 
the 
time 
of 
purchase. 
The 
 contractual cash flows 
for these securities 
are guaranteed by 
U.S. government agencies 
and U.S. government 
sponsored 
 entities. The municipal bonds are of high credit 
quality and the declines in fair value are not 
due to credit quality. 
Based on 
 the assessment of 
these mitigating factors, management 
believes that the 
unrealized losses on these 
debt security holdings 
 are a 
function of 
changes in 
investment spreads 
and interest 
rate movements and 
not changes 
in credit 
quality. Management 
 expects to recover the entire amortized cost basis of these securities. 
 At December 31, 2022, the 
Company does not intend to 
sell debt securities that are 
in an unrealized loss position 
and 
 it is not more than likely than not that the Company will be required to sell 
these securities before recovery of the amortized 
 cost basis. Therefore, 
management does 
not consider any 
investment to be 
other than temporarily 
impaired at December 
 31, 2022. 
 As of December 31, 2022, the Company maintains a master repurchase agreement with a public banking institution for 
 up 
to 

million 
fully 
guaranteed 
with 
investment 
securities 
upon 
withdrawal. 
Any 
amounts 
borrowed 
would 
be 
at 
a 
 variable interest rate 
based on prevailing 
rates at the 
time funding is 
requested. At 
December 31, 2022, the 
Company did 
 
 t have any securities pledged under this agreement. 
 In 2018, the Company became a Qualified Public Depositor QPD with the State of Florida. As a QPD, the Company 
 has the 
authority to 
legally maintain public 
deposits from cities, 
municipalities, and the 
State of Florida. 
These public deposits 
 are secured by securities 
pledged to the 
State of Florida 
at a ratio of 
 
 of the 
average outstanding uninsured 
deposits. 
 The Company must also maintain a minimum 
amount of pledged securities to be in the program. 
 At December 31, 2022, 
the Company had 

securities with a 
fair value of 

million pledged to 
the State of 
 Florida under the public funds program. The Company 
held a total of 

million in public funds at December 31, 2022. 
 At December

the Company

provide a 
direct incentive 
for small 
businesses to 
keep their 
workers on 
payroll and 
 had to be used towards payroll cost, mortgage interest, rent, utilities and other costs 
related to COVID-19. These loans are 
 forgivable under specific criteria 
as determined by the SBA. The 
Company had PPP loans of 

million at December 31, 
 2022 and 

million at December 31, 2021, which are categorized as commercial 
and industrial loans. These PPP loans 
 had deferred loan fees of

the 
appraised 
value 
of 
the 
underlying 
collateral 
discounted 
as

management's 
 estimates of changes in economic conditions are considered 
a Level 3 valuation. 
 Other Real Estate:
 
Other real

valued at the 
lesser of the 
third-party appraisals 
less management's 
 estimate of the 
costs to 
sell or the 
carrying cost of 
the other 
real estate 
owned. Appraisals generally 
use the 
market approach 
 valuation technique 
and use 
market observable 
data to 
formulate an 
opinion of 
the fair 
value of 
the properties. 
However, 
 the appraiser 
uses professional 
judgment in 
determining the 
fair value 
of the 
property and 
the Company 
may also 
adjust 
 the value for changes in 
market conditions subsequent to 
the valuation date when 
current appraisals are not 
available. As 
 a consequence of the carrying cost or the 
third-party appraisal and adjustments therein, the fair values of the properties are 
 considered a Level 3 valuation.

par value per 
 share. As of the effective date of June 16, 2021, 
each five shares of the Company s 
Class A common stock was combined 
 into 

fully paid share of 
Class A common 
stock. Any fractional 
shares resulting from this 
reverse stock split were 
rounded 
 up to one whole share. The 
Bank has adjusted the Class 
A common stock, earnings per 
share and stock options adjusted 
 for this 
 1 for 5
 
reverse stock 
split for all 
periods presented 
here. The 
Class B non-voting 
common stock 
was not adjusted 
 but if 
sold or 
exchanged 
would be 
converted at 
the 
 1 for 5
 
reverse stock 
split of 
5 Class 
B common 
stock for 

share of 
 Class A common stock. 

 On July 27, 2021, the Bank completed the Initial Public Offering IPO of its Class A common stock, in which it issued 
 and 
sold 

shares 
of 
Class 
A 
common 
stock 
at 
a 
price 
of 

per 
share. 
The 
Company 
received 
total 
net 
 proceeds of 

million after deducting underwriting discounts and 
expenses. 
 On 
December 
21, 
2021, 
the 
Company 
entered 
into 
agreements 
with 
the 
Class 
B 
shareholders 
to 
exchange 
all 
 outstanding Class 
B non-voting 
common stock 
for Class 
A voting 
common stock 
at a 
ratio of 
5 to 
1. On 
the same 
day, 
a 
 total of 

shares of Class B common stock was exchanged for 

shares of Class A common stock. 

 In December 2021, the 
Company acquired all 
the issued and outstanding 
shares of the Class 
A voting common 
stock 
 of 
the 
Bank, 
which 
were 
the 
only 
issued 
and 
outstanding 
shares 
of 
the 
Bank s 
capital 
stock, 
in 
a 
share 
exchange 
(the 
 Reorganization 
effected 
under 
the 
Florida 
Business 
Corporation 
Act. 
Each 
of 
the 
outstanding 
shares 
of 
the 
Bank s 
 common 
stock, par 
value 

per share, 
formerly held 
by its 
shareholders 
was 
converted into 
and exchanged 
for one 
 newly issued 
share of 
the 
Company s 
common 
stock, par 
value 

per share, 
and the 
Bank 
became 
the Company s 
 wholly-owned 
subsidiary. 
Prior to 
completing the 
bank holding 
company formation, 
the Company 
had no 
material assets 
 and had not conducted any business or operations except 
for activities related to our organization and the 
Reorganization. 
 In the 
Reorganization, 
each 
shareholder 
of 
the Bank 
received securities 
of 
the same 
class, 
having substantially 
the 
 same designations, 
rights, 
powers, preferences, 
qualifications, 
limitations 
and restrictions, 
as those 
that the 
shareholder 
 held 
in 
the 
Bank, 
and 
the 
Company s 
current 
shareholders 
own 
the 
same 
percentages 
of 
its 
common 
stock 
as 
they 
 previously owned of the Bank s common 
stock. 
 Preferred Stock 
 On April 5, 2021, 
the Board authorized and 
approved the offer to 
repurchase all outstanding shares of 
Class E preferred 
 stock at 
the liquidation 
value of 

million along 
with declared 
dividends of 

thousand. 
All Class 
E preferred 
stock 
 shareholders approved the repurchase which the Company 
completed on April 26, 2021. 

 The Company offered the 
Class C and Class D preferred 
stockholders the ability to exchange 
their shares for Class 
A 
 common stock. The offer 
to exchange was voluntary and 
the preferred stockholders 
were given the option to 
convert 

of 
their 
preferred 
shares 
for 
Class 
A 
common 
stock 
with 
the 
remaining 

to 
be 
redeemed 
in 
the 
form 
of 
cash. 
The 
 exchange ratio for the shares of 
Class A common stock issued in the 
exchange transaction was based upon 
the IPO price 
 for shares of Class A common stock. 

 During the 
year ended 
2021, 

shares of 
Class C 
preferred stock 
and 

shares of 
Class D 
preferred 
 stock converted 
into 

shares of 
Class 
A common 
stock. The 
exchange of 
the Class 
C and 
Class D 
preferred 
 shares had 
a total 
liquidation value 
of 

million. 
The remaining 
unconverted shares 
of Class 
C preferred 
stock and 
 Class D preferred stock totaling 

shares were subsequently redeemed at liquidation 
value for 

million. 

 The fair value of 
consideration on the exchange and redemption 
of the Class C and 
Class D preferred shares exceeded 
 the 
book 
value 
causing 
a 
one-time 
reduction 
in 
net 
income 
available 
to 
common 
stockholders 
of 

million. 
As 
of 
 December 31, 2022, there were 

preferred shares and 

outstanding dividends to be paid.

 The Company 
is limited in 
the amount 
of cash 
dividends that 
it may 
pay. 
Payment of 
dividends is generally 
limited to 
 the Company s 
net income 
of the 
current year 
combined with 
the Bank s 
retained income 
of the 
preceding two 
years, as 
 defined by state banking regulations. However, for any dividend declaration, the Company 
must consider additional factors 
 such as the amount 
of current period net 
income, liquidity, 
asset quality, 
capital adequacy and 
economic conditions at 
the 
 Bank. It is likely that 
these factors would further limit the 
amount of dividends which the Company 
could declare. In addition, 
 bank regulators have 
the authority to 
prohibit banks 
from paying dividends 
if they deem 
such payment to 
be an unsafe 
or 
 unsound practice.

Accounting and Financial Disclosure 
 None.
 Item 9A. Controls and Procedures 
 Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures 
 Under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and its 
Chief 
 Financial 
Officer, 
we evaluated 
the 
effectiveness 
of 
the 
design 
and 
operation 
of 
the 
Company s 
disclosure 
controls 
and 
 procedures 
as 
of 
December 31, 
2022. 
Based 
on 
that 
evaluation, 
management 
believes 
that 
the 
Company s 
disclosure 
 controls 
and 
procedures 
were 
effective 
to 
collect, 
process, 
and 
disclose 
the 
information 
required 
to 
be 
disclosed 
in 
the 
 reports filed or 
submitted under 
the Exchange 
Act within the 
required time 
periods as of 
the end of 
the period covered 
by 
 this Report. 
 Management s Report on Internal Control 
over Financial Reporting 
 Management is responsible for designing, implementing, documenting, and 
maintaining an adequate system of internal 
 control over financial 
reporting, as 
such term 
is defined in 
the Exchange 
Act. An 
adequate system 
of internal control 
over 
 financial reporting encompasses the processes and procedures 
that have been established by management to: 
 
maintain records that accurately reflect the Company s 
transactions; 
 
prepare 
financial 
statement 
and 
footnote 
disclosures 
in 
accordance 
with 
U.S. 
GAAP 
that 
can 
be 
relied 
upon 
by 
 external users; and 
 
prevent and detect unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of the Company's assets that could have a material 
 effect on the financial statements. 
 Management conducted 
an evaluation 
of the 
effectiveness 
of the 
Company's 
internal control 
over financial 
reporting 
 based on the criteria in Internal Control-Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of 
the 
 Treadway 
Commission 
(COSO). 
Based 
on 
this 
evaluation 
under 
the 
criteria 
in 
Internal 
Control-Integrated 
Framework, 
 management concluded that 
internal control over financial 
reporting was effective 
as of December 31, 
2022. Furthermore, 
 during the conduct of its assessment, management identified no material weakness in 
its financial reporting control system. 
 The Board of USCB 
Financial Holdings, Inc., through its 
Audit Committee, provides oversight to 
management s conduct 
 of 
the 
financial 
reporting 
process. 
The 
Audit 
Committee, 
which 
is 
composed 
entirely 
of 
independent 
directors, 
is 
also 
 responsible for the appointment of the independent registered public accounting firm. The 
Audit Committee also meets with 
 management, the internal audit staff, 
and the independent registered public accounting 
firm throughout the year to provide 
 assurance as to the adequacy of the financial 
reporting process and to monitor the overall 
scope of the work performed by 
 the internal audit staff and the independent public accountants. 
 Because of its inherent limitations, the disclosure controls and 
procedures may not prevent or detect misstatements. 
A 
 control system, no matter how well conceived and operated, can only provide reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the 
 objectives of the control system are met. Because 
of the inherent limitations in all control systems, no evaluation 
of controls 
 can provide absolute assurance that all control issues and instances of 
fraud, if any, have 
been detected. Also, projections 
 of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of 
 changes in conditions or that the degree of compliance 
with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. 
 Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting 
 There has been 
no change in 
our internal control 
over financial reporting 
(as defined in 
Rules 13a-15(f) and 
15d-15(f) 
 under the 
Exchange Act) 
during our 
most recent 
fiscal quarter 
that has 
materially affected, or 
is reasonably 
likely to 
materially 
 affect, our internal control over financial reporting.

Exhibit 10.5 
 EMPLOYMENT AGREEMENT 
 This EMPLOYMENT 
AGREEMENT (this 
"Agreement") is 
made and 
entered into 
as of 
 September 
28, 
2020 
(the 
"Effective 
Date"), 
between 
U.S. 
Century 
Bank, 
a 
Florida-chartered 
 commercial bank (the "Bank" or the "Employer"), and Jalal "Jay" Shehadeh (the "Executive").
 WITNESSETH 
 WHEREAS, the Executive 
is presently the 
Senior Vice 
President and General 
Counsel of 
 the Bank; 
 WHEREAS, 
the 
Employer 
desires 
to 
be 
ensured 
of 
the 
Executive's 
continued 
active 
 participation in the business of the Employer; and 
 WHEREAS, 
the 
Executive 
is 
willing 
to 
serve 
the 
Bank 
on 
the 
terns 
and 
conditions 
 hereinafter set forth. 
 NOW THEREFORE, 
in consideration 
of the 
mutual agreements 
herein contained, 
and upon 
 the other terns and 
conditions hereinafter provided, the 
Employer and the Executive 
hereby agree 
 as follows: 
 1. Definitions. The following words and terms shall have 
the meanings set forth below for 
 the purposes of this Agreement: 
 (a) 
Base Salary. "Base Salary" shall have the meaning set forth in Section3(a) hereof. 
 (b) 
Cause. 
Termination 
of 
the 
Executive's 
employment 
for 
"Cause" 
shall 
mean 
 termination because 
of (i) 
willful misconduct 
(including but 
not limited 
to misappropriation 
of a 
 material 
Bank 
business 
opportunity, 
material 
violation 
of 
a 
confidentiality 
or 
non-competition 
 obligation, 
or 
abuse of 
drugs 
or 
alcohol 
that 
results 
in 
the 
Executive being 
materially 
adversely 
 affected in the 
performance of his 
duties), or fraud 
by the Executive; (ii) 
conviction of (including 
 a 
plea 
of 
guilty 
or 
nolo 
contendere 
to) 
a 
felony 
which 
has 
a 
material 
effect 
on 
the 
Bank 
or 
the 
 Executive's 
performance 
hereunder; 
and 
(iii) 
the 
failure 
to 
comply 
with 
any 
material 
obligation 
 imposed upon 
the Executive 
pursuant to 
this Agreement; 
provided, however, 
that if 
such failure 
 under clause (i) or (iii) 
above is susceptible of cure, "Cause" 
shall be deemed to exist 
only after the 
 failure 
has 
remained 
uncured 
for 
thirty 
(30) 
days 
following 
receipt 
by 
the 
Executive 
of 
written 
 notice from the Bank of 
the failure. Notwithstanding the foregoing, 
if the Executive disagrees with 
 the 
good 
faith 
determination 
of 
the 
Bank 
that 
there 
is 
no 
cure 
after 
the 
3()-day 
cure 
period, 
the 
 Executive may 
request that 
such determination 
be submitted 
to binding 
arbitration in 
accordance 
 with Section 
20 hereof 
(with each 
party responsible 
for its 
own fees 
and costs). 
If the 
Executive 
 makes such 
a request 
for arbitration, 
the termination 
of the 
Executive shall 
not become 
effective 
 unless and until 
it is upheld 
by a final 
decision issued through 
such arbitration process; 
provided, 
 that the Bank 
shall have the 
right, in its 
sole discretion, to 
relieve the 
Executive of all 
or any portion 
 of his 
duties during 
such arbitration 
period pending 
the arbitration 
decision so 
long as 
the Bank 
 continues to pay and provide to the Executive 
on a timely basis the compensation 
and benefits that 
 it would otherwise owe to the Executive during such period under this Agreement. 

3 
 (c) 
 Change in Control

Control" shall mean 
(except as provided 
below) the 
 occurrence of an event described in (i), (ii), (iii) or (iv) below:

Exchange 
Act 
of 
1934, 
as 
amended 
(the 
"Exchange 
Act")), 
other 
than 
the 
Bank, 
an 
 affiliate of 
the Bank 
or a 
trustee or other 
fiduciary holding 
securities under an 
employee benefit 
 plan of the Bank or a corporation owned directly 
or indirectly by the stockholders of the Bank in 
 substantially the same 
proportions as their 
ownership of stock 
of the Bank, 
becomes the beneficial 
 owner (within 
the meaning 
of Rule 
13(d)(3) under 
the Exchange 
Act), directly 
or indirectly 
(which 
 shall 
include 
securities 
issuable 
upon 
conversion, 
exchange 
or 
otherwise) 
of 
securities 
 representing 50 or more of 
the combined voting power 
of the Bank's then outstanding 
securities 
 entitled generally to vote for the election of directors; 
 (ii) 
Consummation of an agreement to merge 
or consolidate with another entity 
 (other 
than 
a 
majority-controlled 
subsidiary 
of 
the 
Bank) 
unless 
the 
Bank's 
stockholders 
 immediately 
before 
the 
merger 
or 
consolidation 
own 
more 
than 
50 
of 
the 
combined 
voting 
 power of 
the resulting 
entity's voting 
securities (giving 
effect to 
the conversion 
or exchange 
of 
 securities 
issued 
in 
the 
merger 
consolidation 
to 
the 
other 
entity 
that 
are 
convertible 
or 
 exchangeable for voting securities) entitled generally to vote for the election of directors; 
 (iii) 
Consummation of an 
agreement (including, without 
limitation, an agreement 
 of liquidation) to 
sell or otherwise dispose

 (iv) 
Individuals who,

"Incumbent 
Board") 
cease 
for 
any 
reason 
to 
constitute 
at 
least 
a 
majority 
of 
the 
 Board, provided that 
any person becoming 
a director subsequent 
to the date hereof 
whose election 
 or 
nomination 
for 
election 
by 
the 
stockholders 
is 
approved 
by 
a 
vote 
of 
at 
least 
a

of 
 directors 
then 
constituting 
the 
Incumbent 
Board 
shall 
be, 
for 
purposes 
of 
this 
Agreement, 
 considered as though such person were a member of the Incumbent Board. 
 Notwithstanding the 
foregoing, no 
event shall 
constitute a 
Change in 
Control unless 
such 
 event shall also 
constitute a change in 
control as defined 
in Section 409A of 
the Code, as 
such term 
 is hereinafter defined.

Termination is given, and (ii) 
 if the Executive's employment is terminated for any other 
reason, the date specified in such Notice 
 of Termination.

mean

to 
engage 
in 
any

by reason of

 condition, describing the existence of 
such condition, and the

(30) days of 
the date the 
Bank received the 
notice from the 
 Executive. If

Executive's employment 
 by the Employer for any 
reason, including without limitation 
for Cause, Disability or Retirement, 
 or 
by 
the 
Executive 
for 
any 
reason, 
including

Good 
Reason, 
shall 
be 
 communicated 
by 
a 
"Notice 
of

to 
the 
other 
party 
hereto. 
For 
purposes 
of 
this

 2. 
 Te
 rm of Employment.
 (a) 
The 
Bank 
hereby 
employs 
the 
Executive 
as 
Senior 
Vice 
President 
and 
General 
 Counsel and the Executive 
hereby accepts said 
employment and agrees to 
render such services to 
 the Employer 
on the 
terms 
and conditions 
set forth 
in this 
Agreement. The 
term of 
employment 
 under this Agreement shall be for three years 
beginning on the Effective Date 
(the "Initial Tern"). 
 Not less than sixty (60) days prior to the second annual anniversary 
of the Effective Date and each 
 annual anniversary thereafter, 
the Board of Directors 
of the Bank 
shall consider and review 
(with 
 appropriate 
corporate 
documentation 
thereof, 
and 
after 
taking 
into 
account 
all 
relevant 
factors, 
 including 
the 
Executive's 
performance 
hereunder) 
a 
one-year 
extension 
of 
the 
tern 
of 
this 
 Agreement. If the Board of Directors approves such an extension, then the term of this Agreement 
 shall be 
so extended 
as of 
the relevant 
annual anniversary 
of the 
Effective Date 
unless the 
Executive 
 gives written notice to 
the Employer of the 
Executive's election not 
to extend the 
term, with such 
 written notice 
to be given 
not less than 
sixty (60) 
days prior 
to any such 
relevant annual 
anniversary 
 of the 
Effective Date. 
If the 
Board of 
Directors elects 
not to 
extend the 
tern, it 
shall give 
written 

5 
 notice of such decision to the Executive as soon as the 
decision is made but in no case no less than 
 sixty (60) days 
prior to any such 
annual anniversary of the 
Effective Date. If any 
party gives timely 
 notice that the 
term will not 
be extended as 
of any annual 
anniversary of the 
Effective Date, 
then 
 this Agreement and the rights and obligations 
provided herein shall terminate at the conclusion 
of 
 its remaining term, except to the extent set forth in Section 7. References herein to the term of this 
 Agreement shall refer both to the Initial Term and successive terms. 
 (b) 
During 
the 
term 
of 
this 
Agreement, 
the 
Executive 
shall 
perform 
such 
executive 
 services for the Bank as may be consistent with his titles and 
from time to time assigned to him by 
 the Bank's Board of Directors and/or the President and Chief Executive Officer. 
 3. 
Compensation and Benefits.
 (a) 
The Employer 
shall compensate 
and pay 
the Executive 
for his 
services during 
the 
 term of this 
Agreement at a 
minimum base salary 
of 200,000 per 
year ("Base Salary"), 
which may 
 be increased from time to 
time in such amounts as 
may be determined by the 
President and Chief 
 Executive Officer or the Board 
of Directors of the Employer 
and may not be decreased 
without the 
 Executive's express written consent. 
 (b) 
The 
Bank 
shall 
pay 
Executive 
a 
retention 
bonus 
(the 
"Retention 
Bonus") 
in 
the 
 amount of 150,000 
in the first 
payroll period following 
August l, 2022; 
provided, however, 
that 
 in the event 
that Executive 
resigns Executive's 
employment with 
the Bank 
without Good 
Reason 
 or is terminated 
by the Bank 
for Cause prior 
to August l, 
2022, Executive shall 
forfeit the Retention 
 Bonus in full. 
The Bank 
shall deduct 
from the 
Retention Bonus all 
amounts required 
to be deducted 
 or withheld under applicable law. 
 (c) 
In addition to 
his Base Salary, 
the Executive shall 
be entitled to 
receive during the 
 term 
of 
this 
Agreement 
such 
bonus 
payments 
("Bonus") 
as 
may 
be 
determined 
by 
the 
Board 
of 
 Directors of the Employer. 
 (d) 
During the term 
of this Agreement, 
the Executive shall 
be entitled to 
participate in 
 and 
receive 
the 
benefits 
of 
any 
pension 
or 
other 
retirement 
benefit 
plan, 
profit 
sharing, 
stock 
 incentive, 
or 
other 
plans, 
benefits 
and 
privileges 
given 
to 
employees 
and 
executives 
of 
the 
 Employer, 
to 
the 
extent 
commensurate 
with 
his 
then 
duties 
and 
responsibilities, 
as 
fixed 
by 
the 
 Board of Directors 
of the 
Bank. Notwithstanding anything 
to the contrary 
herein, for purposes 
of 
 medical and dental insurance benefits offered to or provided by the Bank to the Executive, he will 
 be treated 
as if 
he were 
an Executive 
Vice 
President of 
the Bank. 
The Bank 
shall not 
make any 
 changes in such 
plans, benefits or privileges 
which would adversely affect the 
Executive's rights or 
 benefits thereunder, 
unless such 
change occurs 
pursuant to 
a program 
applicable to 
all executive 
 officers 
of 
the 
Employer 
and 
does 
not 
result 
in 
a 
proportionately 
greater 
adverse 
change 
in 
the 
 rights of or 
benefits to 
the Executive 
as compared 
with any other 
executive officer of 
the Employer. 
 Nothing paid to the Executive under any plan or arrangement presently in 
effect or made available 
 in the future 
shall be deemed 
to be in 
lieu of the 
salary payable 
to the Executive 
pursuant to Section 
 3(a) hereof. 
 (e) 
During the term of this Agreement, the Executive shall be entitled 
to four (4) weeks 
 of paid annual vacation, 
on a calendar basis, to 
be taken at such 
time or times agreed 
upon by the 
 Executive and 
the President 
and Chief 
Executive Officer. In 
addition, the 
Executive shall 
be entitled 
 to 
six 
(6) 
days 
of 
personal/sick 
leave 
per 
calendar 
year. 
The 
Executive 
shall 
not 
be 
entitled 
to 
 receive any 
additional compensation 
from the 
Employer for 
failure to 
take a 
vacation or 
use his 
 personal/sick leave, nor shall the Executive be able to accumulate unused vacation time or unused 
 personal/sick leave from one year to the next, except to the 
extent authorized by the President and 
 Chief Executive Officer. 

6 
 (f) 
The 
Board 
of 
Directors 
will 
grant 
to 
the 
Executive 
(pursuant 
to 
a 
written 
grant 
 agreement) 
non-qualified 
stock 
options 
to 
purchase 
one 
hundred 
and 
fifty 
thousand 
(150,000) 
 shares of common 
stock of the 
Bank (the "Option 
Grant"), with an 
exercise price per 
share equal 
 to the Fair 
Market Value, as such term is defined in 
the Bank's Amended and 
Restated 2015 Equity 
 Incentive Plan (the "2015 Equity Incentive 
Plan"), with such options to be designed 
in a manner to 
 cause them to be exempt from Section 409A of the Internal Revenue Code under Section 1.409A-
 1 (b)(5)(i)(A) of 
the United States Department 
of the Treasury Regulations. This 
grant shall vest as 
 follows: options 
covering 50,000 
shares of 
common stock 
of the 
Bank shall vest 
on August 
1, 2021; 
 options covering 50,000 shares of common stock of the Bank shall vest on August 1, 
 2022; and 
options covering 
50,000 shares 
of common 
stock of 
the Bank 
shall vest 
on August 
1, 
 2023. Options may be exercised after 
they become vested and prior to 
the expiration of the term of 
 the options, provided such exercise does not constitute 
an "ownership change" for the Bank within 
 the meaning 
of Section 
382 of 
the Code. 
In addition 
to the 
other vesting 
dates/events set forth

the terns 
of the

above due to his 
 termination of employment (including termination for Good Reason) and at

any fraudulent act 
or omission, breach 
of trust or 
fiduciary duty, or insider 
 abuse with regard to the Employer that has had or is likely to have a material adverse effect on the 
 Employer, (ii) is

adverse effect 
on the 
Employer, 
 or (iv) has 
violated or conspired 
to violate Sections

shall not be 
 provided to the 
Executive. If it is

receives the Severance 
Payment 
 or the Enhanced 
Severance Payment, as 
applicable, that any 
of the matters 
set forth in 
clauses (i) 
 through (iv) of this Section 5(h) are applicable to the Executive, then 
the Executive shall promptly 
 (and in 
any event 
within ten 
(10) business 
days following 
written notice 
to the 
Executive) return 
 an amount equal to the Severance Payment 
or the Enhanced Severance Payment, as applicable, 
to 
 the Employer in immediately available funds. 
 6. 
 Limitation 
of 
Benefits 
under 
Certain 
Circumstances. 
If 
the 
payment 
pursuant 
to 
 Section hereof, either alone or together with other payments and benefits which 
the Executive has 
 the 
right 
to 
receive 
from 
the 
Employer, 
would 
constitute 
a 
"parachute 
payment" 
under 
Section 
 280G of the Code, then the amount payable by the Employer pursuant to Section 5(d) hereof shall 

9 
 be reduced by the minimum amount necessary 
to result in no portion of the amount payable 
by the 
 Employer under 
Section 5(f) 
being non-deductible 
to the 
Employer pursuant 
to Section 
280G of 
 the Code and subject to 
the excise tax imposed under 
Section 4999 of the Code. 
The determination 
 of any reduction in the 
amount payable pursuant to Section 5(d) 
shall be based upon the opinion 
of 
 independent 
tax 
counsel 
selected 
by 
the 
Employer 
and 
paid 
for 
by 
the 
Employer. 
Such 
counsel 
 shall promptly prepare 
the foregoing opinion, but 
in no event 
later than ten (10) 
days from the 
Date 
 of Termination, 
and may use such 
actuaries as such counsel 
deems necessary or advisable 
for the 
 purpose. Nothing contained herein shall result in a reduction of any payments or benefits to which 
 the Executive 
may be entitled 
upon termination of 
employment under any 
circumstances other than 
 as specified in this Section 6, or a reduction in the payment specified in Section 5(f) below zero.

of services 
by the 
Executive on 
behalf of

connection 
 with any 
legal proceeding 
involving the 
parties hereto; 
provided however, that 
such disclosure 
shall 
 be 
limited 
to 
the 
extent

provided 
further, 
however,

 way 
interfere 
with 
the 
relationship 
between 
any 
such 
customer, 
lender, 
supplier, 
licensee 
or 
 business relation 
and the 
Employer 
(including making 
any negative 
or derogatory 
statements 
or 
 communications concerning the Employer or its directors, officers or employees). 
 (e) 
Intellectual 
Property. 
Executive 
will 
disclose 
to 
Employer 
all 
work, 
products 
 including ideas, 
inventions, literary 
property, 
music, lyrics, 
scripts, themes, 
slogans, titles, 
copy, 
 art and 
any other 
relevant material 
which could 
reasonably be 
used by 
Employer or 
any of 
its clients 
 (herein collectively 
called "Intellectual 
Property") which 
he may 
create any 
time during 
the term 
 of employment, whether created 
during or after working 
hours. Employer and Executive 
agree that 
 all 
Intellectual 
Property 
shall 
be 
deemed 
to 
be 
"works 
made 
for 
hire" 
and 
the 
sole 
property 
of 
 Employer. 
Executive 
agrees 
to 
execute 
and 
deliver 
all 
documents 
which 
Employer 
may 
deem 
 necessary or advisable 
in order to confirm 
such ownership or to 
register Intellectual Property 
in the 
 name of Employer or any of its clients in the United States and all foreign countries. 
 (f) 
Non-Disparagement. 
The 
Executive 
agrees 
that 
he 
shall 
not 
make, 
or 
cause 
to 
be 
 made, any disparaging or critical 
remarks, comments or statements about 
or against the Bank or 
its 
 subsidiaries or affiliates 
or any director, 
officer, 
employee or customer of 
any such entities at any 
 time in 
the future, 
except 
for any 
statements by 
him 
made pursuant 
to lawful 
subpoena or 
legal 
 process. Executive acknowledges that the Employer's reputation and image in the market is 
one of 
 its principal assets and that Employer has expended substantial time, effort and money in building 
 this reputation and image and that, accordingly, 
any action or comment by the Executive which 
is 
 damaging to 
or in 
any way 
diminishes such 
image or 
reputation will 
cause Employer 
irreparable 
 injury. 
 (g) 
Irreparable Harm. The Executive acknowledges that: (i) the Executive's 
compliance 
 with Section 7 of this Agreement is necessary to preserve and protect the proprietary rights, Trade 
 Secrets, and the goodwill of 
the Employer as a going concern, 
and (ii) any failure by 
the Executive 
 to comply with the 
provisions of this Agreement 
will result in irreparable 
and continuing injury for 
 which there will be 
no adequate remedy at 
law. In the event that the Executive 
fails to comply with 

11 
 the terms and conditions 
of this Agreement, the 
obligations of the 
Employer to pay the 
severance 
 benefits set 
forth in 
Section 5 
shall cease, 
and the 
Employer will 
be entitled, 
in addition 
to other 
 relief that may be proper, to all types of equitable relief (including, but not limited to, the issuance 
 of an 
injunction and/or 
temporary restraining 
order and 
the recoupment 
of any 
severance previously 
 paid) that 
may be 
necessary to 
cause the 
Executive to 
comply with 
this Agreement, 
to restore 
to 
 the Employer their property, and to make the Employer whole. 
 (h) 
 Survival
 . The provisions set 
forth in this Section 7 
shall survive the termination of 
 this Agreement. 
 (i) 
Scope Limitations. If the scope, period 
of time or area of restriction specified in this 
 Section 7 
are or 
would be 
judged to 
be unreasonable 
in any 
court proceeding, 
then the 
period of 
 time, scope 
or area 
of restriction 
will be 
reduced or 
limited in 
the manner 
and to 
the extent 
necessary 
 to make the restriction 
reasonable, so that the 
restriction may be enforced 
in those areas, during the 
 period of time and in the scope that are or would be judged to be reasonable. 
 8. 
Mitigation; Exclusivity of Benefits.
 (a) 
The Executive 
shall not be 
required to 
mitigate the amount 
of any 
benefits hereunder 
 by seeking other 
employment or otherwise, 
nor shall the 
amount of any 
such benefits be 
reduced 
 by any compensation earned 
by the Executive as 
a result of employment by 
another employer after 
 the Date of Termination or otherwise. 
 (b) 
The specific 
arrangements referred 
to herein 
are not 
intended to 
exclude any 
other 
 benefits 
which 
may 
be 
available 
to 
the 
Executive 
upon 
a 
termination 
of 
employment 
with 
the 
 Employer pursuant to employee benefit plans of the Employer or otherwise. 
 9. 
 Withholding. 
All payments 
required to 
be made 
by the 
Employer hereunder 
to the 
 Executive 
shall 
be 
subject 
to 
the 
withholding 
of 
such 
amounts, 
if 
any, 
relating 
to 
tax 
and 
other 
 payroll deductions as the Employer may reasonably determine should be withheld pursuant to any 
 applicable law or regulation. 
 10. 
 Assignability. 
The Bank 
may assign 
this Agreement 
and its 
rights and 
obligations 
 hereunder in whole, but not in part, to any corporation, bank or other entity with 
or into which the 
 Bank may hereafter merge or consolidate or to which the Bank may transfer all or 
substantially all 
 of its assets, if in 
any such case said corporation, 
bank or other entity shall 
by operation of law or 
 expressly in 
writing assume 
all obligations 
of 
the 
Employer hereunder 
as 
fully 
as if 
it 
had been 
 originally made 
a 
party 
hereto, but 
may 
not 
otherwise 
assign this 
Agreement 
or their 
rights and 
 obligations hereunder. 
The Executive 
may not 
assign or 
transfer this 
Agreement or 
any rights 
or
