Business
Overview 

Currently,
the Company intends to look for various opportunities like asset acquisitions, business combination or mergers and acquisitions (M A)
for strategic growth. 

We
plan to acquire or merge with private corporations doing businesses in recycling and, sales and distribution of reusable plastics. The
goal of recycling plastics is to reduce high rates of plastic pollution while putting less pressure on virgin materials to produce brand
new plastic products. This approach helps to conserve resources and diverts plastics from landfills or unintended destinations such as
oceans. Our vision incorporates the spirit of social responsibility, not only on a local community basis but also on a global scale. 

The
impact of social distancing requirements due to Coronavirus COVID-19 has affected all industries not only plastic recycling
industry. There has been a strong demand for plastic for several years and converting waste plastic materials into commercially viable
products, utilizing environmentally friendly recycling and manufacturing methods has been a focused by the global awareness in clean
environment, a trend many expect to continue even after the COVID-19 restrictions are lifted. 

The
Company intends to execute its business plan upon capital raising. Subject to available capital, the Company intends to invest in building
a recycling and extrusion facility, on-site contractor services, local engineering and acquisition of lab equipment and supplies, and
marketing sales development. 

As of the date of this filing, we have not entered
into any definitive agreements. 

As
of the time of this filing, the Company s business plan has not been executed. 

Employees 

We
currently have no regular employees, and our officers and directors take an active role serving the Company in corporate governance and
compliance, strategic planning, and overall management. We anticipate that we will start to recruit regular employees and build up our
management team as and when our business starts.

Holders

Stock

Company is authorized to issue 20,000,000 shares of Preferred Stock. As of December 31, 2022, the Company had 2,520 shares of

Transfer
Agent and Registrar

transfer agent for our capital stock is EQ Shareowner Services, with an address at 1110 Centre Pointe Curve, Suite 101, Mendota Heights,
MN 55120, and telephone number is +1 800-401-1957 or +1 800-468-9716. 

Penny
Stock Regulations 

The
Securities and Exchange Commission has adopted regulations which generally define penny stock to be an equity security
that has a market price of less than 5.00 per share. Our Common Stock, when and if a trading market develops, may fall within the definition
of penny stock and be subject to rules that impose additional sales practice requirements on broker-dealers who sell such securities
to persons other than established customers and accredited investors (generally those with assets more than 1,000,000, or annual incomes
exceeding 200,000 individually, or 300,000, together with their spouse). 

For
transactions covered by these rules, the broker-dealer must make a special suitability determination for the purchase of such securities
and have received the purchaser s prior written consent to the transaction. Additionally, for any transaction, other than exempt
transactions, involving a penny stock, the rules require the delivery, prior to the transaction, of a risk disclosure document mandated
by the Securities and Exchange Commission relating to the penny stock market. The broker-dealer also must disclose the commissions payable
to both the broker-dealer and the registered representative, current quotations for the securities and, if the broker-dealer is the sole
market-maker, the broker-dealer must disclose this fact and the broker-dealer s presumed control over the market. Finally, monthly
statements must be sent disclosing recent price information for the penny stock held in the account and information on the limited market
in penny stocks. Consequently, the penny stock rules may restrict the ability of broker-dealers to sell our Common Stock
and may affect the ability of investors to sell their Common Stock in the secondary market. 

In
addition to the penny stock rules promulgated by the Securities and Exchange Commission, the Financial Industry Regulatory
Authority FINRA has adopted rules that require that in recommending an investment to a customer, a broker-dealer must
have reasonable grounds for believing that the investment is suitable for that customer. Prior to recommending speculative low-priced
securities to their non-institutional customers, broker-dealers must make reasonable efforts to obtain information about the customer s
financial status, tax status, investment objectives and other information. Under interpretations of these rules, FINRA believes that
there is a high probability that speculative low-priced securities will not be suitable for at least some customers. The FINRA requirements
make it more difficult for broker-dealers to recommend that their customers buy our Common Stock, which may limit the investors 
ability to buy and sell our stock. 

Dividend
Policy 

Any
future determination as to the declaration and payment of dividends on shares of our Common Stock will be made at the discretion of our
board of directors out of funds legally available for such purpose. We are under no obligations or restrictions to declare or pay dividends
on our shares of Common Stock. In addition, we currently have no plans to pay such dividends. Our board of directors currently intends
to retain all earnings for use in the business for the foreseeable future. 

Equity
Compensation Plan Information 

Currently,
there is no equity compensation plan in place.

Sales of Equity Securities 

Currently,
there is no unregistered sales of equity securities. 

Purchases
of Equity Securities by the Registrant and Affiliated Purchasers

The
following discussion of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with our audited financial statements
and the notes to those financial statements appearing elsewhere in this Report. 

Certain
statements in this Report constitute forward-looking statements. These forward-looking statements include statements, which involve risks
and uncertainties, regarding, among other things, (a) our projected sales, profitability, and cash flows, (b) our growth strategy, (c)
anticipated trends in our industry, (d) our future financing plans, and (e) our anticipated needs for, and use of, working capital. They

 estimate, plan, potential, project, continuing, ongoing, 
 expects, management believes, we believe, we intend, or the negative of these

that the forward-looking statements contained in this filing will in fact occur. You should not place undue reliance on these forward-looking
statements.

Overview 

Sino
Green Land Corporation (the Company or we or our was incorporated under the laws of the
State of Nevada on March 6, 2008, under the name of Henry County Plywood Corporation, as successor by merger to a Virginia
corporation incorporated in May 1948 under the same name. On March 17, 2009, we changed our name from Henry County Plywood
Corporation to Sino Green Land Corporation . On January 7, 2020, we renamed from Sino Green Land
Corporation to Go Silver Toprich, Inc. . On August 31, 2020, we changed the name from Go Silver Toprich,
Inc. back to Sino Green Land Corporation . 

Our
current name is Sino Green Land Corporation, and our fiscal year end is December 31. 

Results
of Operations 

Revenues
and Cost of Revenues 

No
revenues and cost of revenues were recorded for the years ended December 31, 2022, and 2021, respectively. 

General
and Administrative (G A) Expenses 

Our
general and administrative (G A) expenses were 35,659 and 143,983 for the years ended December 31, 2022, and 2021, respectively.
In 2022, these G A expenses comprised of accounting fee of 7,500, audit fee of 12,000, transfer agent fee of 2,578, state filing
fee of 930 and other professional fee of 12,651, respectively. 

Liquidity
and Capital Resources 

As
of December 31, 2022, we had no cash balance and 222,658 in outstanding liabilities, including 208,140 due to our former CEO, Lou
Xiong, a related party. We do not have sufficient cash on hand to fund our ongoing operational expenses for the next 6 months. We
will need to raise funds to maintain our operations and to pay our ongoing operational expenses. Additional funding will likely come
from equity financing from the sale of our Common Stock. If we are successful in completing an equity financing, existing
shareholders will experience dilution of their interest in our Company. We do not have any financing arrangement and we cannot
provide investors with any assurance that we will be able to raise sufficient funding from the sale of our Common Stock to fund our
operations and ongoing operational expenses. In the absence of such financing, our business will likely fail. There are no
assurances that we will be able to achieve further sales of our Common Stock or any other form of additional financing. 

Critical
Accounting Policies and Estimates 

Use
of Estimates 

In
preparing these financial statements, management makes estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities
in the balance sheets, and revenues and expenses during the periods reported. Actual results may differ from these estimates. 

Off-Balance
Sheet Arrangements 

As
of December 31, 2022, we have no significant off-balance sheet arrangements that have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future
effect on our financial condition, changes in our financial condition, revenues or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital
expenditures or capital resources that are material to our stockholders.

report. Disclosure controls and procedures means that the material information required to be included in our Securities and Exchange
Commission SEC reports is recorded, processed, summarized, and reported within the time periods specified in SEC rules
and forms relating to our company, including any consolidating subsidiaries, and was made known to us by others within those entities,
particularly during the period when this report was being prepared. Based on this evaluation, our Principal Executive Officer and Principal
Financial Officer concluded as of the evaluation date that our disclosure controls and procedures were not effective as of December 31,
2022, due to material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting as described below. 

Management s
Annual Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting 

Management
is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting, as defined in Exchange Act Rule 13a-15.
Internal control over financial reporting is defined in Rule 13a-15(f) and 15(d)-15(f) under the Exchange Act as a process designed to
provide reasonable assurance to the Company s management and the board of directors regarding the preparation and fair presentation
of published financial statements. Management conducted an assessment of the Company s internal control over financial reporting
as of December 31, 2022, based on the framework and criteria established by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway
Commission in Internal Control-Integrated Framework (2013) (COSO). Based on the assessment, management concluded that, as of December
31, 2022, the Company s internal controls over financial reporting were not effective. 

We
identified material weaknesses in our internal controls over financial reporting. A material weakness is a deficiency, or a combination
of deficiencies, in internal control over financial reporting such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement
of our financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis. 

The
material weaknesses identified include (i) the Company did not maintain a functioning independent audit committee and did not maintain
an independent board; (ii) the Company had inadequate segregation of duties; and (iii) the Company had an insufficient number of personnel
with an appropriate level of U.S. GAAP knowledge and experience and ongoing training in the application of U.S. GAAP and SEC disclosure
requirements commensurate with the Company s financial reporting requirements. 

The
material weaknesses were identified by our Principal Executive Officer and Principal Financial
Officer , in connection with the review of our financial statements as of December 31, 2022. 

Notwithstanding
the identified material weaknesses, management has concluded that the Financial Statements included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K
present fairly, in all material respects, the Company s financial position, results of operations and cash flows for the periods
disclosed in conformity with U.S. GAAP. 

Changes
in Internal Controls over Financial Reporting 

There
was no change in our internal controls over financial reporting that occurred during the period covered by this Report, which has materially
affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal controls over financial reporting: 

This
annual report does not include an attestation report of the Company s registered independent public accounting firm regarding internal
control over financial reporting. Management s report was not subject to attestation by the Company s registered independent
public accounting firm pursuant to rules of the Securities and Exchange Commission that permit the Company to provide only management s
report in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.

Corporate
Governance 

The
Company promotes accountability for adherence to honest and ethical conduct; endeavors to provide full, fair, accurate, timely and understandable
disclosure in reports and documents that the Company files with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the SEC and in
other public communications made by the Company; and strives to be compliant with applicable governmental laws, rules and regulations.
The Company has not formally adopted a written code of business conduct and ethics that governs the Company s employees, officers
and directors as the Company is not required to do so. 

In
lieu of an Audit Committee, the Company s board of directors, is responsible for reviewing and making recommendations concerning
the selection of outside auditors, reviewing the scope, results, and effectiveness of the annual audit of the Company s financial
statements and other services provided by the Company s independent public accountants. The Chief Executive Officer, the Chief
Financial Officer, and the board of directors of the Company review the Company s internal accounting controls, practices, and
policies. 

Committees
of the Board 

The
Company currently does not have nominating, compensation, or audit committees or committees performing similar functions nor does the
Company have a written nominating, compensation, or audit committee charter. Our directors believe that it is not necessary to have such
committees, at this time, because the directors can adequately perform the functions of such committees. 

Audit
Committee Financial Expert 

Our
board of directors has determined that we do not have a board member that qualifies as an audit committee financial expert 
as defined in Item 407(D)(5) of Regulation S-K, nor do we have a Board member that qualifies as independent as the term
is used in Item 7(d)(3)(iv)(B) of Schedule 14A under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, and as defined by Rule 4200(a)(14)
of the FINRA Rules. 

We
believe that our directors can analyze and evaluate our financial statements and understanding internal controls and procedures for
financial reporting. The directors of the Company do not believe that it is necessary to have an audit committee because management believes
that the board of directors can adequately perform the functions of an audit committee. In addition, we believe that retaining an independent
director who would qualify as an audit committee financial expert would be overly costly and burdensome and is not warranted
in our circumstances given the stage of our development and the fact that we have not generated any positive cash flows from operations
to date. 

8 

Involvement
in Certain Legal Proceedings 

Our
directors and our executive officers have not been involved in any of the following events during the past ten years: 

1. 
 bankruptcy
 petition filed by or against any business of which such person was a general partner or executive officer either at the time of the
 bankruptcy or within two years prior to that time; 
 
 2. 
 any
 conviction in a criminal proceeding or being subject to a pending criminal proceeding (excluding traffic violations and other minor
 offenses); 
 
 3. 
 being
 subject to any order, judgment, or decree, not subsequently reversed, suspended, or vacated, of any court of competent jurisdiction,
 permanently or temporarily enjoining, barring, suspending or otherwise limiting his/her involvement in any type of business, securities
 or banking activities; or 
 
 4. 
 being
 found by a court of competent jurisdiction (in a civil action), the Commission or the Commodity Futures Trading Commission to have
 violated a federal or state securities or commodities law, and the judgment has not been reversed, suspended, or vacated. 
 
 5. 
 Such
 person was found by a court of competent jurisdiction in a civil action or by the Commission to have violated any Federal or State
 securities law, and the judgment in such civil action or finding by the Commission has not been subsequently reversed, suspended,
 or vacated; 
 
 6. 
 Such
 person was found by a court of competent jurisdiction in a civil action or by the Commodity Futures Trading Commission to have violated
 any Federal commodities law, and the judgment in such civil action or finding by the Commodity Futures Trading Commission has not
 been subsequently reversed, suspended or vacated; 
 
 7. 
 Such
 person was the subject of, or a party to, any Federal or State judicial or administrative order, judgment, decree, or finding, not
 subsequently reversed, suspended or vacated, relating to an alleged violation of:(i) Any Federal or State securities or commodities
 law or regulation; or(ii) Any law or regulation respecting financial institutions or insurance companies including, but not limited
 to, a temporary or permanent injunction, order of disgorgement or restitution, civil money penalty or temporary or permanent cease-and-desist
 order, or removal or prohibition order; or(iii) Any law or regulation prohibiting mail or wire fraud or fraud in connection with
 any business entity; or 
 
 8. 
 Such
 person was the subject of, or a party to, any sanction or order, not subsequently reversed, suspended or vacated, of any self-regulatory
 organization (as defined in Section 3(a)(26) of the Exchange Act (15 U.S.C. 78c(a)(26))), any registered entity (as defined in Section
 1(a)(29) of the Commodity Exchange Act (7 U.S.C. 1(a)(29))), or any equivalent exchange, association, entity or organization that
 has disciplinary authority over its members or persons associated with a member. 

Independence
of Directors 

We
are not required to have independent members of our board of directors, and do not anticipate having independent directors until such
time as we are required to do so. 

Code
of Ethics 

We
have not adopted a formal Code of Ethics. The board of directors evaluated the business of the Company and the number of employees and
determined that since the business is operated by a small number of persons, general rules of fiduciary duty and federal and state criminal,
business conduct and securities laws are adequate ethical guidelines. In the event our operations, employees and/or directors expand
in the future, we may take actions to adopt a formal Code of Ethics. 

Shareholder
Proposals 

The
Company does not have any defined policy or procedural requirements for shareholders to submit recommendations or nominations for directors.
The board of directors believes that, given the stage of our development, a specific nominating policy would be premature and of little
assistance until our business operations develop to a more advanced level. The Company does not currently have any specific or minimum
criteria for the election of nominees to the board of directors and we do not have any specific process or procedure for evaluating such
nominees. The board of directors will assess all candidates, whether submitted by management or shareholders, and make recommendations
for election or appointment. 

A
shareholder who wishes to communicate with our board of directors may do so by directing a written request addressed to our President,
at the address appearing on the first page of this Information Statement.

COMPENSATION
DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS 

DIRECTOR
COMPENSATION

the right to pay our executive or any future executives a salary, and/or issue them shares of Common Stock in consideration for services
rendered and/or to award incentive bonuses which are linked to our performance, as well as to the individual executive officer s
performance. This package may also include long-term stock-based compensation to certain executives, which is intended to align the performance
of our executives with our long-term business strategies. Additionally, while the board of directors has not granted any performance
base stock options to date, the board of directors reserves the right to grant such options in the future, if the board in its sole determination
believes such grants would be in the best interests of the Company. 

INCENTIVE
BONUS 

The
board of directors may grant incentive bonuses to our executive officer and/or future executive officers in its sole discretion, if the
board of directors believes such bonuses are in the Company s best interest, after analyzing our current business objectives and
growth, if any, and the amount of revenue we are able to generate each month, which revenue is a direct result of the actions and ability
of such executives. 

LONG-TERM,
STOCK BASED COMPENSATION 

To
attract, retain and motivate executive talent necessary to support the Company s long-term business strategy we may award our executive
and any future executives with long-term, stock-based compensation in the future, at the sole discretion of our board of directors, which

REPORT
OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM 

To
the Shareholders and Board of Directors of Sino Green Land Corporation 

Opinion
on the Financial Statements 

We
have audited the accompanying balance sheet of Sino Green Land Corporation (the Company as of December 31, 2022, the
related statements of operations, changes in stockholders deficit, and cash flows for the year then ended, and the related notes
(collectively referred to as the financial statements ). In our opinion, the financial statements present fairly, in all
material respects, the financial position of the Company as of December 31, 2022, and the results of its operations and its cash flows
for the year then ended, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. 

Going
Concern 

The
accompanying financial statements have been prepared assuming that the Company will continue as a going concern. As discussed in
Note 1 to the financial statements, during the year ended December 31, 2022, the Company incurred a net loss and utilized cash in
operations, and at December 31, 2022, had a stockholders deficit. these conditions raise substantial doubt about the Company s
ability to continue as a going concern. Management s plans regarding these matters are also described in Note 1. The financial
statements do not include any adjustments that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty. 

Basis
for Opinion 

These
financial statements are the responsibility of the Company s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company s
financial statements based on our audit. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board
(United States) PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal
securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. 

We
conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain
reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. The Company
is not required to have, nor were we engaged to perform, an audit of its internal control over financial reporting. As part of our audit,
we are required to obtain an understanding of internal control over financial reporting but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion
on the effectiveness of the Company s internal control over financial reporting. Accordingly, we express no such opinion. 

Our
audit included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or
fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding
the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audit also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant
estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe that our audit provides
a reasonable basis for our opinion. 

Critical Audit Matters 

Critical audit matters are matters arising from the
current period audit of the financial statements that were communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that:
(1) relate to accounts or disclosures that are material to the financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective,
or complex judgments. We determined that there are no critical audit matters. 

We
have served as the Company s auditor since 2022.

Opinion
on the Financial Statements 

We
have audited the accompanying balance sheets of Sino Green Land Corporation (the Company as of December 31, 2021 and 2020,
and the related statements of operations and comprehensive income, stockholders equity, and cash flows for the each of two years
in the year ended of December 31, 2021 and 2020, and the related notes (collectively referred to as the financial statements ).
In our opinion, the financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of December
31, 2021 and 2020, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of two years in the year ended December 31, 2021 and
2020, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. 

Going
Concern 

The
financial statements have been prepared assuming that the Company will continue as a going concern. As discussed in Note 2 to the financial
statements, the Company s losses from operations and no operation raise substantial doubt about its ability to continue as a going
concern. Management s plans regarding those matters also are described in Note 2. The financial statements do not include any adjustments
that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty.

 NOTES

THE YEARS ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2022 AND 2021 

 (Currency

, and used cash in operating activities of , and at December 31, 2022, had a stockholders 
deficit of . These factor raises substantial doubt about the Company s ability to continue as a going concern within one
year of the date that the financial statements are issued. The financial statements do not include any adjustments that might be necessary
if the Company is unable to continue as a going concern. 

The ability of the Company to continue as a going
concern is dependent on raising capital to fund its initial business plan and ultimately to attain profitable operations. Management believes
additional cash required to meet the Company s obligations as they become due will be provided by way of advances from related parties.
No assurance can be given that any future financing, if needed, will be available or, if available, that it will be on terms that are
satisfactory to the Company. Even if the Company is able to obtain additional financing, if needed, it may contain undue restrictions
on its operations, in the case of debt financing, or cause substantial dilution for its stockholders, in the case of equity financing. 

Reverse stock split 

On May 18,
2022 , the Company filed a Certificate of Change with the Secretary of State of the
State of Nevada to effectuate a one-for-five hundred of its Common Stock without any change to its par value. Accordingly, all common shares and preferred
shares and per share amounts in these consolidated financial statements have been adjusted retroactively to reflect the reverse
stock split as if the split occurred at the beginning of the earliest period presented in this Annual Report. As
a result of the Reverse Stock Split, the number of the outstanding shares of Common Stock was decreased from 
(pre-split) shares to 
(post-split) shares, while the number of shares of Preferred Stock outstanding was reduced from 
shares to 
shares. 

COVID-19 

The COVID-19 pandemic has negatively impacted the
global economy, workforces, customers, and created significant volatility and disruption of financial markets. The Company monitors guidance
from national and local public health authorities and has implemented health and safety precautions and protocols in response to these
guidelines. The extent of the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic has had and will continue to have on the Company s business is highly
uncertain and difficult to predict and quantify at this time. 

Inflation 

The continuing impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, higher
inflation, the actions by central banks to address inflation, increases in interest rates, and rising energy prices create uncertainty
about the future economic environment which will continue to evolve and, we believe, will impact businesses in 2023. The implications
of higher government deficits and debt, tighter monetary policy, and potentially higher long-term interest rates may drive a higher cost
of capital for the business

The
provisions of ASC Topic 740, Accounting for Income Taxes, require an assessment of both positive and negative evidence when determining
whether it is more likely than not that deferred tax assets are recoverable. As of December 31, 2022, and 2021, based on all available
objective evidence, including the existence of cumulative losses, the Company determined that it was more likely than not that the net
deferred tax assets were not fully realizable. Accordingly, the Company established a full valuation allowance against its net deferred
tax assets. The Company intends to maintain a full valuation allowance on net deferred tax assets until sufficient positive evidence
exists to support reversal of the valuation allowance. 

The
Company adopted the provisions of ASC 740, which requires companies to determine whether it is more likely than not that
a tax position will be sustained upon examination by the appropriate taxing authorities before any tax benefit can be recorded in the
financial statements. ASC 740 also provides guidance on the recognition, measurement, classification and interest and penalties related
to uncertain tax positions. As of December 31, 2022, and 2021, liability for unrecognized tax benefits was required to be recorded
or disclosed.

the completion of due diligence, the negotiation of a final agreement, and approval of the transaction by the board of directors. No
assurance can be given that the parties will be able agree on a final agreement or that the transactions herein contemplated will close.
