 The Shopping Center Industry 
 General: 
 There are several types of retail shopping centers, which are differentiated primarily based on size and marketing strategy. Regional shopping centers generally contain in excess of 400,000 square feet of GLA and are typically anchored by two or more department or large retail stores ("Anchors") and are referred to as "Regional Town Centers" or "Malls." Regional Town Centers also typically contain numerous diversified retail stores ("Mall Stores"), most of which are national or regional retailers typically located along corridors connecting the Anchors. "Strip centers", "urban villages" or "specialty centers" ("Community/Power Shopping Centers") are retail shopping centers that are designed to attract local or neighborhood customers and are typically anchored by one or more supermarkets, discount department stores and/or drug stores. Community/Power Shopping Centers typically contain 100,000 to 400,000 square feet of GLA. Outlet Centers generally contain a wide variety of designer and manufacturer stores, often located in an open-air center, and typically range in size from 200,000 to 850,000 square feet of GLA ("Outlet Centers"). In addition, freestanding retail stores are located along the perimeter of the shopping centers ("Freestanding Stores"). Mall Stores and Freestanding Stores over 10,000 square feet of GLA are also referred to as "Big Box." Anchors, Mall Stores, Freestanding Stores and other tenants typically contribute funds for the maintenance of the common areas, property taxes, insurance, advertising and other expenditures related to the operation of the shopping center. 
 5 

Regional Town Centers: 
 A Regional Town Center draws from its trade area by offering a variety of fashion merchandise, hard goods and services and entertainment, often in an enclosed, climate controlled environment with convenient parking. Regional Town Centers provide an array of retail shops and entertainment facilities and often serve as the town center and a gathering place for community, charity and promotional events. 
 Regional Town Centers have generally provided owners with relatively stable income despite the cyclical nature of the retail business. This stability is due both to the diversity of tenants and to the typical dominance of Regional Town Centers in their trade areas. 
 Regional Town Centers have different strategies with regard to price, merchandise offered and tenant mix, and are generally tailored to meet the needs of their trade areas. Anchors are located along common areas in a configuration designed to maximize consumer traffic for the benefit of the Mall Stores. Mall GLA, which generally refers to GLA contiguous to the Anchors for tenants other than Anchors, is leased to a wide variety of smaller retailers. Mall Stores typically account for the majority of the revenues of a Regional Town Center. 
 Business of the Company 
 Strategy: 
 The Company has a long-term four-pronged business strategy that focuses on the acquisition, leasing and management, redevelopment and development of Regional Town Centers. 
 Acquisitions. The Company principally focuses on well-located, quality Regional Town Centers that can be dominant in their trade area and have strong revenue enhancement potential. In addition, the Company pursues other opportunistic acquisitions of property that include retail and will complement the Company's portfolio. The Company subsequently seeks to improve operating performance and returns from these properties through leasing, management and redevelopment. Since its initial public offering, the Company has acquired interests in shopping centers nationwide. The Company believes that it is geographically well positioned to cultivate and maintain ongoing relationships with potential sellers and financial institutions and to act quickly when acquisition opportunities arise. 
 Leasing and Management. The Company believes that the shopping center business requires specialized skills across a broad array of disciplines for effective and profitable operations. For this reason, the Company has developed a fully integrated real estate organization with in-house acquisition, accounting, development, finance, information technology, leasing, legal, marketing, property management and redevelopment expertise. In addition, the Company emphasizes a philosophy of decentralized property management, leasing and marketing performed by on-site professionals. The Company believes that this strategy results in the optimal operation, tenant mix and drawing power of each Center, as well as the ability to quickly respond to changing competitive conditions of the Center's trade area. 
 The Company believes that on-site property managers can most effectively operate the Centers. Each Center's property manager is responsible for overseeing the operations, marketing, maintenance and security functions at the Center. Property managers focus special attention on controlling operating costs, a key element in the profitability of the Centers, and seek to develop strong relationships with, and be responsive to, the needs of retailers. 
 The Company generally utilizes regionally located leasing managers to better understand the market and the community in which a Center is located. The Company continually assesses and fine tunes each Center's tenant mix, identifies and replaces underperforming tenants and seeks to optimize existing tenant sizes and configurations. 
 On a selective basis, the Company provides property management and leasing services for third parties. The Company currently manages one regional town center and two community centers for third party owners on a fee basis. 
 Redevelopment. One of the major components of the Company's growth strategy is its ability to redevelop acquired properties. On a selective basis, the Company's business strategy may include mixed-use densification to maximize space at the Company s Regional Town Centers, including by developing available land at the Regional Town Centers or by demolishing underperforming department store boxes and redeveloping the land. For this reason, the Company has built a staff of redevelopment professionals who have primary responsibility for identifying redevelopment opportunities that they believe will result in enhanced long-term financial returns and market position for the Centers. The redevelopment professionals oversee the design and construction of the projects in addition to obtaining required governmental approvals (See "Redevelopment and Development Activities" in Recent Developments). 
 6 

Development. The Company pursues ground-up development projects on a selective basis. The Company has supplemented its strong acquisition, operations and redevelopment skills with its ground-up development expertise to further increase growth opportunities. 
 The Centers: 
 As of December 31, 2022, the Centers primarily included 44 Regional Town Centers (including office, hotel and residential space adjacent to these shopping centers), five Community/Power Shopping Centers, one office property and one redevelopment property totaling approximately 47 million square feet of GLA. These 51 Centers average approximately 925,000 square feet of GLA and range in size from 3.2 million square feet of GLA at Tysons Corner Center to 185,000 square feet of GLA at Boulevard Shops. As of December 31, 2022, the Centers primarily includ e d 163 Anchors totaling approximately 21.7 million square feet of GLA and approximately 5,000 Mall Stores and Freestanding Stores totaling approximate ly 23.6 million square feet of GLA. 
 Competition: 
 Numerous owners, developers and managers of malls, shopping centers and other retail-oriented real estate compete with the Company for the acquisition of properties and in attracting tenants or Anchors to occupy space. There are a number of other publicly traded mall companies and several large private mall companies in the United States, any of which under certain circumstances could compete against the Company for an Anchor or a tenant. In addition, these companies, as well as other REITs, private real estate companies or investors compete with the Company in terms of property acquisitions. This results in competition both for the acquisition of properties or centers and for tenants or Anchors to occupy space. Competition for property acquisitions may result in increased purchase prices and may adversely affect the Company's ability to make suitable property acquisitions on favorable terms. The existence of competing shopping centers could have a material adverse impact on the Company's ability to lease space and on the level of rents that can be achieved. There is also increasing competition from other retail formats and technologies, such as lifestyle centers, power centers, outlet centers and online retail shopping that could adversely affect the Company's revenues. 
 In making leasing decisions, the Company believes that retailers consider the following material factors relating to a center: quality, design and location, including consumer demographics; rental rates; type and quality of Anchors and retailers at the center; and management and operational experience and strategy of the center. The Company believes it is able to compete effectively for retail tenants in its local markets based on these criteria in light of the overall size, quality and diversity of its Centers. 
 Major Tenants: 
 For the year ended December 31, 2022, the Centers derived approximately 73 of their total rents from Mall Stores and Freestanding Stores under 10,000 square feet and 27 of their total rents from Big Box and Anchor tenants. Total rents as set forth in "Item 1. Business" include minimum rents and percentage rents. 
 The following retailers (including their subsidiaries) represent the 10 largest tenants in the Centers based upon total rents in place as of December 31, 2022: Tenant Primary DBAs Number of Locations in the Portfolio of Total Rents Victoria's Secret Co. Pink, Victoria's Secret 43 2.0 Signet Jewelers Limited Banter by Piercing Pagoda, Jared, Kay Jewelers, Pandora, Piercing Pagoda, Zales, and others 99 1.9 Foot Locker, Inc.

 7 

Mall Stores and Freestanding Stores: 
 Mall Store and Freestanding Store leases generally provide for tenants to pay rent comprised of a base (or "minimum") rent and a percentage rent based on sales. In some cases, tenants pay only minimum rent, and in other cases, tenants pay only percentage rent. The Company generally enters into leases for Mall Stores and Freestanding Stores that also require tenants to pay their pro rata share of property taxes and to pay a stated amount for operating expenses, excluding property taxes, regardless of the expenses the Company actually incurs at any Center. However, certain leases for Mall Stores and Freestanding Stores contain provisions that require tenants to pay their pro rata share of maintenance of the common areas, property taxes, insurance, advertising and other expenditures related to the operations of the Center. 
 Tenant space of 10,000 square feet and under in the Company's portfolio at December 31, 2022 comprises approximately 61 of all Mall Store and Freestanding Store space. The Company uses tenant spaces of 10,000 square feet and under for comparing rental rate activity because this space is more consistent in terms of shape and configuration and, as such, the Company is able to provide a meaningful comparison of rental rate activity for this space. Mall Store and Freestanding Store space greater than 10,000 square feet is inconsistent in size and configuration throughout the Company's portfolio and as a result does not lend itself to a meaningful comparison of rental rate activity with the Company's other space. Much of the non-Anchor space over 10,000 square feet is not physically connected to the mall, does not share the same common area amenities and does not benefit from the foot traffic in the mall. As a result, space greater than 10,000 square feet has a unique rent structure that is inconsistent with mall space under 10,000 square feet. 
 Cost of Occupancy: 
 A major factor contributing to tenant profitability is cost of occupancy, which consists of tenant occupancy costs charged by the Company. Tenant occupancy costs include tenant expenses such as minimum rents, percentage rents and recoverable expenditures, which consist primarily of property operating expenses, real estate taxes and repair and maintenance expenditures. These costs are then compared to tenant sales to present tenant occupancy costs as a percentage of tenant sales. A low cost of occupancy percentage shows more potential capacity for the Company to increase rents at the time of lease renewal than a high cost of occupancy percentage. The following table summarizes occupancy costs for Mall Store and Freestanding Store tenants in the Centers as a percentage of total Mall Store sales for the twelve months ended December 31, 2022 and December 31, 2019, the most immediately comparative period prior to the COVID-19 pandemic:

 (1) The ending base rent per square foot on leases expiring during the period represents the final year minimum rent, on a cash basis, for tenant leases expiring during the year. 
 Anchors: 
 Anchors have traditionally been a major factor in the public's identification with Regional Town Centers. Anchors are generally department stores whose merchandise appeals to a broad range of shoppers. Although the Centers receive a smaller percentage of their operating income from Anchors than from Mall Stores and Freestanding Stores, strong Anchors play an important part in maintaining customer traffic and making the Centers desirable locations for Mall Store and Freestanding Store tenants. 
 Anchors either own their stores, the land under them and in some cases adjacent parking areas, or enter into long-term leases with an owner at rates that are lower than the rents charged to tenants of Mall Stores and Freestanding Stores. Each Anchor that owns its own store and certain Anchors that lease their stores enter into reciprocal easement agreements with the owner of the Center covering, among other things, operational matters, initial construction and future expansion. 
 Anchors accounted for approximately 6.5 of the Company's total rents for the year ended December 31, 2022.

Governmental Regulations 
 Compliance with various governmental regulations has an impact on the Company s business, including its capital expenditures, earnings and competitive position, which can be material. The Company incurs costs to monitor, and takes actions to comply with, governmental regulations that are applicable to its business, which include, among others, federal securities laws and regulations, applicable stock exchange requirements, REIT and other tax laws and regulations, environmental and health and safety laws and regulations, local zoning, usage and other regulations relating to real property, the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990 (the "ADA") and related laws and regulations. 
 See Item 1A. Risk Factors for a discussion of material risks to the Company, including, to the extent material, to its competitive position, relating to governmental regulations, and see Item 7. Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations together with the Company s Consolidated Financial Statements, including the related notes included therein, for a discussion of material information relevant to an assessment of the Company s financial condition and results of operations, including, to the extent material, the effects that compliance with governmental regulations may have upon its capital expenditures and earnings. 
 Insurance 
 Each of the Centers has comprehensive liability, fire, extended coverage and rental loss insurance with insured limits customarily carried for similar properties. The Company does not insure certain types of losses (such as losses from wars), because they are either uninsurable or not economically insurable. In addition, while the Company or the relevant joint venture, as applicable, carry specific earthquake insurance on the Centers located in California, the policies are subject to a deductible equal to 5 of the total insured value of each Center, a 150,000 per occurrence minimum and a combined annual aggregate loss limit of 100 million on these Centers. The Company or the relevant joint venture, as applicable, carry specific earthquake insurance on the Centers located in the Pacific Northwest and in the New Madrid Seismic Zone. However, the policies are subject to a deductible equal to 2 of the total insured value of each Center, a 150,000 per occurrence minimum and a combined annual aggregate loss limit of 100 million on these Centers. While the Company or the relevant joint venture also carry standalone terrorism insurance on the Centers, the policies are subject to a 25,000 deductible and a combined annual aggregate loss limit of 1.0 billion. Each Center has environmental insurance covering eligible third-party losses, remediation and non-owned disposal sites, subject to a 100,000 retention and a 50 million three-year aggregate loss limit, with the exception of one Center, which has a 5 million ten-year aggregate loss limit and another Center, which has a 20 million ten-year aggregate loss limit. Some environmental losses are not covered by this insurance because they are uninsurable or not economically insurable. Furthermore, the Company carries title insurance on substantially all of the Centers for generally less than their full value. 
 Qualification as a Real Estate Investment Trust 
 The Company elected to be taxed as a REIT under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the "Code"), commencing with its first taxable year ended December 31, 1994, and intends to conduct its operations so as to continue to qualify as a REIT under the Code. As a REIT, the Company generally will not be subject to federal and state income taxes on its net taxable income that it currently distributes to stockholders. Qualification and taxation as a REIT depends on the Company's ability to meet certain dividend distribution tests, share ownership requirements and various qualification tests prescribed in the Code. 
 Supplemental Material United States Federal Income Tax Considerations 
 The following discussion supplements and updates the disclosures under Material United States Federal Income Tax Considerations in the prospectus dated August 5, 2020, contained in the Company s Registration Statement on Form S-3 filed with the SEC on August 5, 2020 (such disclosure, the Base Disclosure ). Capitalized terms used in this section that are not otherwise defined shall have the same meaning as when used in the Base Disclosure. 
 On December 29, 2022, the IRS promulgated final Treasury Regulations under Sections 897, 1441, 1445, and 1446 of the Code that were, in part, intended to coordinate various withholding regimes for non-U.S. stockholders. The new Treasury Regulations provide that: 
 (i) The withholding rules applicable to ordinary REIT dividends paid to a non-U.S. stockholder (generally, a 30 rate of withholding on gross amounts unless otherwise reduced by treaty or effectively connected with such non-U.S. stockholder s trade or business within the U.S. and proper certifications are provided) will apply to (a) that portion of any distribution paid by the Company that is not designated as a capital gain dividend, a return of basis or a distribution in excess of the non-U.S. stockholder s adjusted basis in its stock that is treated as gain from the disposition of such stock and (b) any portion of a capital gain dividend paid by the Company that is not treated as gain attributable to the sale or exchange of a U.S. real property interest by reason of the recipient not owning more than 
 13 

10 of a class of the Company's stock that is regularly traded on an established securities market during the one-year period ending on the date of the capital gain dividend. 
 (ii) The withholding rules under FIRPTA will apply to a distribution paid by the Company in excess of a non-U.S. stockholder s adjusted basis in the Company's stock, unless the interest in the Company's stock is not a U.S. real property interest (for example, because the Company is a domestically controlled qualified investment entity) or the distribution is paid to a withholding qualified holder. A withholding qualified holder means a qualified holder (as defined below) and a foreign partnership all of the interests of which are held by qualified holders, including through one or more partnerships. 
 (iii) The withholding rules under FIRPTA will apply to any portion of a capital gain dividend paid to a non-U.S. stockholder that is attributable to the sale or exchange of a U.S. real property interest, unless it is paid to a withholding qualified holder. 
 In the case of FIRPTA withholding under clause (ii) above, the applicable withholding rate is currently 15 , and in the case of FIRPTA withholding under clause (iii) above, the withholding rate is currently 21 . For purposes of FIRPTA withholding under clause (iii), whether a capital gain dividend is attributable to the sale or exchange of a U.S. real property interest is determined taking into account the general exception from FIRPTA distribution treatment for distributions paid to certain non-U.S. stockholders under which any distribution by the Company to a non-U.S. stockholder with respect to any class of stock which is regularly traded on an established securities market located in the United States is not treated as gain recognized from the sale or exchange of a U.S. real property interest if such non-U.S. stockholder did not own more than 10 of such class of stock at any time during the one-year period ending on the date of such distribution. To the extent inconsistent, these Treasury Regulations supersede the discussion on withholding contained in the Base Disclosure under the heading Material United States Federal Income Tax Considerations Taxation of Non-U.S. Stockholders. However, if, notwithstanding these Treasury Regulations, the Company encounters difficulties in properly characterizing a distribution for purposes of the withholding rules, the Company may decide to withhold on such distribution at the highest possible U.S. federal withholding rate that the Company determines could apply. 
 New Treasury Regulations also provide new guidance regarding qualified foreign pension funds. Accordingly, the fifth paragraph under the heading Material United States Federal Income Tax Considerations Taxation of Non-U.S. Stockholders Dispositions of Stock is hereby deleted and replaced with the following: 
 In general, for FIRPTA purposes, and subject to the discussion below regarding qualified holders, neither a qualified foreign pension fund (as defined below) nor any entity all of the interests of which are held by a qualified foreign pension fund is treated as a foreign person, thereby exempting such entities from tax under FIRPTA (as described further below). A qualified foreign pension fund is an organization or arrangement (i) created or organized in a foreign country, (ii) established by a foreign country (or one or more political subdivisions thereof) or one or more employers to provide retirement or pension benefits to current or former employees (including self-employed individuals) or their designees as a result of, or in consideration for, services rendered, (iii) which does not have a single participant or beneficiary that has a right to more than 5 of its assets or income, (iv) which is subject to government regulation and with respect to which annual information about its beneficiaries is provided, or is otherwise available, to relevant local tax authorities, and (v) with respect to which, under its local laws, (A) contributions that would otherwise be subject to tax are deductible or excluded from its gross income or taxed at a reduced rate, or (B) taxation of its investment income is deferred, or such income is excluded from its gross income or taxed at a reduced rate. Under Treasury Regulations, subject to the discussion below regarding qualified holders, a qualified controlled entity also is not generally treated as a foreign person for purposes of FIRPTA. A qualified controlled entity generally includes a trust or corporation organized under the laws of a foreign country all of the interests of which are held by one or more qualified foreign pension funds either directly or indirectly through one or more qualified controlled entities. 
 Treasury Regulations further require that a qualified foreign pension fund or qualified controlled entity will not be exempt from FIRPTA with respect to dispositions of U.S. real property interests or REIT distributions attributable to the same unless the qualified foreign pension fund or qualified controlled entity is a qualified holder. To be a qualified holder, a qualified foreign pension fund or qualified controlled entity must satisfy one of two alternative tests at the time of the disposition of the U.S. real property interest or the REIT distribution. Under the first test, a qualified foreign pension fund or qualified controlled entity is a qualified holder if it owned no U.S. real property interests as of the earliest date during an uninterrupted period ending on the date of the disposition or distribution during which it qualified as a qualified foreign pension fund or qualified controlled entity. Alternatively, if a qualified foreign pension fund or qualified controlled entity held U.S. real property interests as of the earliest date during the period described in the preceding sentence, it can be a qualified holder only if it satisfies certain testing period requirements. 
 14 

Treasury Regulations also provide that a foreign partnership all of the interests of which are held by qualified holders, including through one or more partnerships, may certify its status as such and will not be treated as a foreign person for purposes of withholding under Section 1445 of the Code (and Section 1446 of the Code, as applicable). 
 Distributions that are attributable to gain from the sales of USRPIs received by qualified foreign pension funds or qualified controlled entities will not be subject to U.S. federal income or withholding tax. All other distributions received by qualified foreign pension funds or qualified controlled entities will be taxed as described above under Material United States Federal Income Tax Considerations Taxation of Non-U.S. Stockholders Dividends. Gain of a qualified foreign pension fund or qualified controlled entity from the sale or exchange of the Company's stock and distributions treated as gain from the sale or exchange of the Company's stock under the rules described above under Material United States Federal Income Tax Considerations Taxation of Non-U.S. Stockholders Dividends, will not be subject to U.S. federal income or withholding tax, unless such gain is treated as effectively connected with the qualified foreign pension fund s (or the qualified controlled entity s, as applicable) conduct of a U.S. trade or business, in which case, the qualified foreign pension fund (or qualified controlled entity) generally will be subject to a tax at the same graduated rates applicable to U.S. stockholders, unless an applicable income tax treaty provides otherwise, and may be subject to the 30 branch profits tax on its effectively connected earnings and profits, subject to adjustments, in the case of a foreign corporation. 
 Employees and Human Capital 
 As of December 31, 2022, the Company had approximately 651 employees, of which 650 were full-time and one was part-time. The Company believes that relations with its employees are good. 
 The Company, with oversight from senior management and its Board of Directors, puts great effort into cultivating an inclusive company culture that attracts top talent and creates an environment that fosters collaboration, innovation and diversity, while providing professional development opportunities and training. The Company s human capital objectives include, as applicable, identifying, recruiting, retaining, developing, incentivizing and integrating the Company s existing and prospective employees. To further these objectives, the Company has established a number of policies and programs and undertaken various initiatives, including: 
 Diversity and Inclusion: The Company recognizes the value in strengthening its workforce with diverse thought, ideas and people and maintains employment policies that comply with federal, state and local labor laws. As an equal opportunity employer, it is committed to diversity, recognition and inclusion and rewards its employees based on merit and their contributions in accordance with the principles and requirements of the Equal Employment Opportunities Commission and the principles and requirements of the ADA. The Company s policies set forth its commitment to provide equal employment opportunity and to recruit, hire and promote at all levels without regard to race, national origin, religion, age, color, sex, sexual orientation, gender identity, disability, protected veteran status or any other characteristic protected by local, state or federal laws. As of December 31, 2022, approximately 59 of the Company s employees identified as female. Of the total employee population, approximately 30 identified as belonging to an underrepresented group and approximately 

 scholarship program to help fund post high-school education for dependents of employees; 
 Company-sponsored donor advised fund to support philanthropic efforts of employees, which provides a Company matching program and paid time off program for philanthropic volunteerism; 
 paid time off for volunteer efforts; and 
 paid time off for employees to bond with a new child. 
 Employee Training and Professional Development: The Company values the professional development of its employees and seeks to foster their talent and growth by providing training and education at all levels. In addition to training programs geared towards specific job functions, the Company offers training related to company policies, diversity, skill development, privacy and cybersecurity. In furtherance of the value it places on talent development, in 2022 the Company began work on the design and implementation of a unified platform available to all employees that supports training and education related to compliance, inclusion and professional development and plans to launch it in Q1 2023. As of December 31, 2022, the average tenure of the Company s employees was approximately 11.6 years and that of the Company s senior management was 20 years. In 2022, the Company s workforce turnover rate was 14 , which includes all employees. 
 Employee Health and Safety: The Company is also committed to ensuring that the operations at all of its Centers and corporate offices are conducted in a manner that safeguards the health and safety of employees, tenants, contractors, customers and members of the public who are either present at, or affected by, its operations. The Company has implemented a long list of operational protocols at each of its Centers and its offices that are designed to ensure the safety of its employees, tenants, service providers and shoppers. These protocols were originally developed and implemented in response to the COVID-19 pandemic and meet or exceed recommendations from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. All of the Company s retail properties achieved SafeGuard certification from Bureau Veritas, an internationally recognized testing and certification board. 
 Seasonality 
 The shopping center industry is seasonal in nature, particularly in the fourth quarter during the holiday season when retailer occupancy and retail sales are typically at their highest levels. In addition, shopping malls achieve a substantial portion of their specialty (temporary retailer) rents during the holiday season and the majority of percentage rent is recognized in the fourth quarter. As a result of the above, earnings are generally higher in the fourth quarter. 
 Sustainability 
 A recognized leader in sustainability, the Company has achieved the #1 GRESB ranking in the North American Retail Sector for eight straight years 2015 2022.

ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS 
 Set forth below are the risks that we believe are material to our investors and they should be carefully considered. Those risks are not all of the risks we face, and other factors not presently known to us or that we currently believe are immaterial may also affect our business if they occur. This section contains forward-looking statements. You should refer to the explanation of the qualifications and limitations on forward-looking statements in Important Factors Related To Forward-Looking Statements. For purposes of this Risk Factor section, Centers wholly owned by us are referred to as Wholly Owned Centers and Centers that are partly but not wholly owned by us are referred to as Joint Venture Centers. 
 
 RISKS RELATED TO OUR BUSINESS AND PROPERTIES 
 
 We invest primarily in shopping centers, which are subject to a number of significant risks that are beyond our control. 
 
 Real property investments are subject to varying degrees of risk that may affect the ability of our Centers to generate sufficient revenues to meet operating and other expenses, including debt service, lease payments, capital expenditures and tenant improvements, and to make distributions to us and our stockholders. A number of factors may decrease the income generated by the Centers, including: 
 the global and national economic climate, including the impact of geopolitical tensions and military conflict; 
 the regional and local economy (which may be negatively impacted by rising unemployment, declining real estate values, increased foreclosures, higher taxes, plant closings, industry slowdowns, union activity, adverse weather conditions, natural disasters and other factors); 
 local real estate conditions (such as an oversupply of, or a reduction in demand for, retail space or retail goods, decreases in rental rates, declining real estate values and the availability and creditworthiness of current and prospective tenants); 
 decreased levels of consumer spending, consumer confidence, and seasonal spending (especially during the holiday season when many retailers generate a disproportionate amount of their annual sales); 
 increasing use by customers of e-commerce and online store sites and the impact of internet sales on the demand for retail space; 
 negative perceptions by retailers or shoppers of the safety, convenience and attractiveness of a Center; 
 acts of violence, including terrorist activities; and 
 increased costs of maintenance, insurance and operations (including real estate taxes). 
 Income from shopping center properties and shopping center values are also affected by applicable laws and regulations, including tax, environmental, safety and zoning laws. 
 
 A significant percentage of our Centers are geographically concentrated and, as a result, are sensitive to local economic and real estate conditions. 
 
 A significant percentage of our Centers are located in California, New York and Arizona. To the extent that weak economic or real estate conditions or other factors affect California, New York and Arizona or any region in which we have a high concentration of properties more severely than other areas of the country, our financial performance could be negatively impacted. 
 
 We are in a competitive business. 
 
 Our properties compete with other owners, developers and managers of malls, shopping centers and other retail-oriented real estate, including other publicly traded mall companies and large private mall companies, for the acquisition of properties and in attracting tenants or Anchors to occupy space. Competition for property acquisitions may result in increased purchase prices and may adversely affect our ability to make suitable property acquisitions on favorable terms or at all. The existence of competing shopping centers could have a material adverse impact on our ability to lease space and on the rental rates that can be achieved. 
 
 There is also increasing competition for tenants and shoppers from other retail formats and technologies, such as lifestyle centers, power centers, outlet centers and online retail shopping that could adversely affect our revenues. The increased popularity of digital and mobile technologies has accelerated the transition of a percentage of market share from shopping at physical stores to web-based shopping. If we are unsuccessful in adapting our business to evolving consumer purchasing habits 
 17 

it may have a material adverse impact on our financial condition and results of operations. Further, the increased utilization of online retail shopping, if sustained, may lead to the closure of underperforming stores by retailers, which could impact our occupancy levels and the rates that tenants are willing to pay to lease our space. 
 
 We may be unable to renew leases, lease vacant space or re-let space as leases expire on favorable terms or at all, or to the appropriate mix of tenants for the Centers, which could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations. 
 
 There are no assurances that our leases will be renewed or that vacant space in our Centers will be re-let at net effective rental rates equal to or above the current average net effective rental rates or that substantial rent abatements, tenant improvements, early termination rights or below-market renewal options will not be offered to attract new tenants or retain existing tenants. If the rental rates at our Centers decrease, if our existing tenants do not renew their leases or if we do not re-let a significant portion of our available space and space for which leases will expire, our financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected. 
 
 Additionally, if we fail to identify and secure the right blend of tenants at our retail and mixed-use properties, including our properties under development or redevelopment, our Centers may not appeal to the communities they are intended to serve, which could reduce customer traffic and the operations of our tenants and adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations. 
 
 If Anchors or other significant tenants experience a downturn in their business, close or sell stores or declare bankruptcy, our financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected. 
 
 Our financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected if a downturn in the business of, or the bankruptcy or insolvency of, an Anchor or other significant tenant leads them to close retail stores or terminate their leases after seeking protection under the bankruptcy laws from their creditors, including us as lessor. In recent years, including as a result of the general conditions caused by COVID-19, a number of companies in the retail industry, including some of our tenants, have declared bankruptcy, have gone out of business, have significantly reduced their brick-and-mortar presence or failed to comply with their contractual obligations to us and others. If one of our tenants files for bankruptcy, we may not be able to collect amounts owed by that party prior to filing for bankruptcy. We may make lease modifications either pre- or post-bankruptcy for certain tenants undergoing significant financial distress in order for them to continue as a going concern. In addition, after filing for bankruptcy, a tenant may terminate any or all of its leases with us, in which event we would have a general unsecured claim against such tenant that would likely be worth less than the full amount owed to us for the remainder of the lease term. Furthermore, we may be required to incur significant expense in re-letting the space vacated by a bankrupt tenant and may not be able to release the space on similar terms or at all. The bankruptcy of a tenant, particularly an Anchor, may require a substantial redevelopment of their space, the success of which cannot be assured, and may make the re-letting of their space difficult and costly, and it may also be difficult to lease the remainder of the space at the affected property. 
 
 Furthermore, certain department stores and other national retailers have experienced, and may continue to experience, decreases in customer traffic in their retail stores, increased competition from alternative retail options such as e-commerce and other forms of pressure on their business models. If the in-store sales of retailers operating at our Centers decline significantly due to adverse economic conditions or for any other reason, tenants might be unable to pay their minimum rents or expense recovery charges. In the event of a default by a lessee, the affected Center may experience delays and costs in enforcing its rights as lessor. 
 
 Anchors and/or tenants at one or more Centers might also terminate their leases as a result of mergers, acquisitions, consolidations or dispositions in the retail industry. The sale of an Anchor or store to a less desirable retailer may reduce occupancy levels, customer traffic and rental income. Depending on economic conditions, there is also a risk that Anchors or other significant tenants may sell stores operating in our Centers or consolidate duplicate or geographically overlapping store locations. Store closures by an Anchor and/or a significant number of tenants may allow other Anchors and/or certain other tenants to terminate their leases, receive reduced rent and/or cease operating their stores at the Center or otherwise adversely affect occupancy at the Center. 
 
 Our real estate acquisition, development and redevelopment strategies may not be successful. 
 
 Our historical growth in revenues, net income and funds from operations has been in part tied to the acquisition, development and redevelopment of shopping centers. Many factors, including the availability and cost of capital, our total amount of debt outstanding, our ability to obtain financing on attractive terms, if at all, interest rates and the availability of attractive acquisition targets, among others, will affect our ability to acquire, develop and redevelop additional properties in the future. We may not be successful in pursuing acquisition opportunities, and newly acquired properties may not perform as well as expected. Expenses arising from our efforts to complete acquisitions, develop and redevelop properties or increase our market penetration may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. We face competition for acquisitions primarily from other REITs, as well as from private real estate companies or investors. Some of our competitors have greater financial and other resources. Increased competition for shopping center acquisitions may result in 
 18 

increased purchase prices and may impact adversely our ability to acquire additional properties on favorable terms. We cannot guarantee that we will be able to implement our growth strategy successfully or manage our expanded operations effectively and profitably. 
 
 We may not be able to achieve the anticipated financial and operating results from newly acquired assets. Some of the factors that could affect anticipated results are: 
 
 our ability to integrate and manage new properties, including increasing occupancy rates and rents at such properties; 
 the disposal of non-core assets within an expected time frame; and 
 our ability to raise long-term financing to implement a capital structure at a cost of capital consistent with our business strategy. 
 Our business strategy also includes the selective development and construction of retail properties. On a selective basis, our business strategy may include mixed-use densification to maximize space at our Regional Town Centers, including by developing available land at our Regional Town Centers or by demolishing underperforming department store boxes and redeveloping the land. Any development, redevelopment and construction activities that we may undertake will be subject to the risks of real estate development, including lack of financing, construction delays, environmental requirements, budget overruns, sunk costs and lease-up. Furthermore, occupancy rates and rents at a newly completed property may not be sufficient to make the property profitable. Real estate development activities are also subject to risks relating to the inability to obtain, or delays in obtaining, all necessary zoning, land-use, building, and occupancy and other required governmental permits and authorizations. If any of the above events occur, our ability to pay dividends to our stockholders and service our indebtedness could be adversely affected. 
 
 Additionally, if we elect to pursue a mixed-use redevelopment, we expose ourselves to risks associated with each non-retail use (e.g., office, residential, hotel and entertainment), and the performance of our retail tenants in such properties may be negatively impacted by delays in opening and/or the performance of such non-retail uses. We have less experience in developing and managing non-retail real estate than we do with retail real estate and, as a result, we may seek to contract with a third-party developer or third-party manager with more experience in non-retail uses. In addition to the risks typically associated with the development of commercial real estate generally, we would also be exposed to the risks associated with the ownership and management of non-retail real estate, including limited experience in managing certain types of non-retail properties and the adverse impacts of competition and trends in the non-retail industry. For example, in the case of office properties, some businesses are rapidly evolving to make employee telecommuting, flexible work schedules, open workplaces and teleconferencing increasingly common, which may enable businesses to reduce their space requirements and erode the overall demand for office space over time, which, in turn, may place downward pressure on occupancy, rental rates and property valuations, each of which could have an adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations, cash flows and ability to make expected distributions to our stockholders to the extent we own office property. 
 
 Excess space at our properties could materially and adversely affect us. 
 
 Certain of our properties have had or may continue to have excess space available for prospective tenants, and those properties may continue to experience, and other properties may commence experiencing, such oversupply in the future. Among other causes, in 2020 due to the COVID-19 pandemic and in the years leading up to the pandemic, there was an increased number of bankruptcies of Anchors and other national retailers, as well as store closures. In the past, an increase in bargaining power of creditworthy retail tenants resulted in a downward pressure on our rental rates and occupancy levels, and an increase in bargaining power may also result in us having to increase our spend on tenant improvements and potentially make other lease modifications in order to attract or retain tenants, any of which, in the aggregate, could materially and adversely affect us. 
 
 Real estate investments are relatively illiquid and we may be unable to sell properties at the time we desire and on favorable terms. 
 
 Investments in real estate are relatively illiquid, which limits our ability to adjust our portfolio in response to changes in economic, market or other conditions. Moreover, there are some limitations under federal income tax laws applicable to REITs that limit our ability to sell assets. In addition, because our properties are generally mortgaged to secure our debts, we may not be able to obtain a release of a lien on a mortgaged property without the payment of the associated debt and/or a substantial prepayment penalty, which restricts our ability to dispose of a property, even though the sale might otherwise be desirable. Furthermore, the number of prospective buyers interested in purchasing shopping centers is limited. Therefore, if we want to sell one or more of our Centers, we may not be able to dispose of it in the desired time period and may receive less consideration than we originally invested in the Center. 

19 

Our real estate assets may be subject to impairment charges. 
 
 We periodically assess whether there are any indicators, including property operating performance, changes in anticipated holding period and general market conditions, that the value of our real estate assets and other investments may be impaired. A property s value is considered to be impaired only if the estimated aggregate future undiscounted and unleveraged property cash flows, taking into account the anticipated probability weighted average holding period, are less than the carrying value of the property. In our estimate of cash flows, we consider trends and prospects for a property and the effects of demand and competition on expected future operating income. If we are evaluating the potential sale of an asset or redevelopment alternatives, the undiscounted future cash flows consider the most likely course of action as of the balance sheet date based on current plans, intended holding periods and available market information. We are required to make subjective assessments as to whether there are impairments in the value of our real estate assets and other investments. Impairment charges have an immediate direct impact on our earnings. There can be no assurance that we will not take additional charges in the future related to the impairment of our assets. Any future impairment could have a material adverse effect on our operating results in the period in which the charge is recognized. 
 
 Possible environmental liabilities could adversely affect us. 
 
 Each of the Centers have undergone Environmental Site Assessment-Phase I studies conducted by an environmental consultant. As a result of these assessments and other information, we are aware of certain environmental issues present at certain Centers or at properties neighboring certain Centers, such as asbestos containing materials ACMs (some of which may ultimately require removal under certain conditions, though the company has developed an operations and maintenance plan to manage ACMs), underground storage tanks (which are often present at or near Centers in connection with gasoline stations or automotive tire, battery and accessory services centers, and some of which may have leaked or are suspected to have leaked) and chlorinated hydrocarbons (such as perchloroethylene and its degradation byproducts, which have been detected at certain Centers and are often present in connection with tenant dry cleaning operations). These issues may result in potential environmental liability and cause us to incur costs in responding to these liabilities or in other costs associated with future investigation or remediation. 
 
 Under various federal, state and local environmental laws, ordinances and regulations, a current or previous owner or operator of real property may be liable for the costs of removal or remediation of hazardous or toxic substances on, under or in that real property. These laws often impose liability whether or not the owner or operator knew of, or was responsible for, the presence of hazardous or toxic substances. The costs of investigation, removal or remediation of hazardous or toxic substances may be substantial. In addition, the presence of hazardous or toxic substances, or the failure to remedy environmental hazards properly, may adversely affect the owner s or operator s ability to sell or rent affected real property or to borrow money using affected real property as collateral. 
 
 Persons or entities that arrange for the disposal or treatment of hazardous or toxic substances may also be liable for the costs of removal or remediation of hazardous or toxic substances at the disposal or treatment facility, whether or not that facility is owned or operated by the person or entity arranging for the disposal or treatment of hazardous or toxic substances. For example, laws exist that impose liability for release of ACMs into the air, and third parties may seek recovery from owners or operators of real property for personal injury associated with exposure to ACMs. In connection with our ownership, operation, management, development and redevelopment of the Centers, or any other centers or properties we acquire in the future, we may be potentially liable under these laws and may incur costs in responding to these liabilities. 
 
 We face risks associated with climate change. 
 
 Due to changes in weather patterns caused by climate change, our properties in certain markets could experience increases in storm intensity and rising sea levels. Over time, climate change could result in volatile or decreased demand for retail space at some of our Centers or, in extreme cases, our inability to operate the properties at all. Climate change may also have indirect effects on our business by increasing the cost of (or making unavailable) insurance on favorable terms, or at all, increasing the cost of energy at our properties or requiring us to spend funds to repair and protect our properties against such risks. Additionally, we seek to promote energy efficiency and other sustainability strategies at our properties. Implementing such strategies and compliance with new laws or regulations related to climate change, including compliance with green building codes, may result in significant capital expenditures to improve our existing properties or properties we may acquire. If we are unable to comply with the laws and regulations on climate change or implement effective sustainability strategies, our reputation among our tenants and investors may be damaged and we may incur fines and/or penalties. Moreover, there can be no assurance that any of our sustainability strategies will result in reduced operating costs, higher occupancy or higher rental rates or deter our existing tenants from relocating to properties owned by our competitors. 
 
 Some of our properties are subject to potential natural or other disasters. 
 
 Some of our Centers are located in areas that are subject to natural disasters, including our Centers in California or in other areas with higher risk of earthquakes, our Centers in flood plains or in areas that may be adversely affected by tornadoes, 
 20 

as well as our Centers in coastal regions that may be adversely affected by increases in sea levels or in the frequency or severity of hurricanes, tropical storms or other severe weather conditions. The occurrence of natural disasters can delay redevelopment or development projects, increase investment costs to repair or replace damaged properties, increase future property insurance costs and negatively impact the tenant demand for lease space. If insurance is unavailable to us or is unavailable on acceptable terms, or our insurance is not adequate to cover losses from these events, our financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected. 
 
 Uninsured or underinsured losses could adversely affect our financial condition. 
 
 Each of our Centers has comprehensive liability, fire, extended coverage and rental loss insurance with insured limits customarily carried for similar properties. We do not insure certain types of losses (such as losses from wars), because they are either uninsurable or not economically insurable, and our insurance coverage may have certain exclusions (such as pandemics) that prevent us from collecting on certain claims under our policies. In addition, while we or the relevant joint venture, as applicable, carry specific earthquake insurance on the Centers located in California, the policies are subject to a deductible equal to 5 of the total insured value of each Center, a 150,000 per occurrence minimum and a combined annual aggregate loss limit of 100 million on these Centers. We or the relevant joint venture, as applicable, carry specific earthquake insurance on the Centers located in the Pacific Northwest and in the New Madrid Seismic Zone. However, the policies are subject to a deductible equal to 2 of the total insured value of each Center, a 150,000 per occurrence minimum and a combined annual aggregate loss limit of 100 million on these Centers. While we or the relevant joint venture also carry standalone terrorism insurance on the Centers, the policies are subject to a 25,000 deductible and a combined annual aggregate loss limit of 1.0 billion. Each Center has environmental insurance covering eligible third-party losses, remediation and non-owned disposal sites, subject to a 100,000 retention and a 50 million three-year aggregate loss limit, with the exception of one Center, which has a 5 million ten-year aggregate loss limit and another Center has a 20 million ten-year aggregate loss limit. Some environmental losses are not covered by this insurance because they are uninsurable or not economically insurable. Furthermore, we carry title insurance on substantially all of the Centers for generally less than their full value. 
 
 If an uninsured loss or a loss in excess of insured limits occurs, we could lose all or a portion of the capital we have invested in a property, as well as the anticipated future revenue from the property, but may remain obligated for any mortgage debt or other financial obligations related to the property. 
 
 Compliance with the Americans with Disabilities Act and fire, safety and other regulations may require us to make expenditures that could adversely affect our cash flows. 
 All of the properties in our portfolio are required to comply with the Americans with Disabilities Act (the ADA ). Compliance with the ADA requirements could require removal of access barriers, and non-compliance could result in the imposition of fines by the United States government, awards of damages to private litigants, or both. While the tenants to whom our portfolio is leased are obligated to comply with ADA provisions, within their leased premises, if required changes within their leased premises involve greater expenditures than anticipated, or if the changes must be made on a more accelerated basis than anticipated, the ability of tenants to cover costs could be adversely affected. Furthermore, we are required to comply with ADA requirements within the common areas of the properties in our portfolio and we may not be able to pass on to our tenants any costs necessary to remediate any common area ADA issues. In addition, we are required to operate the properties in compliance with fire and safety regulations, building codes and other land use regulations, as they may be adopted by governmental agencies and bodies and become applicable to our portfolio. We may be required to make substantial capital expenditures to comply with, and we may be restricted in our ability to renovate or redevelop the properties subject to, those requirements and to comply with the provisions of the ADA. The resulting expenditures and restrictions could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and operating results. 
 
 Possible terrorist activity or other acts or threats of violence and threats to public safety could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations. 
 
 Terrorist attacks and threats of terrorist attacks in the United States or other acts or threats of violence may result in declining economic activity, which could harm the demand for goods and services offered by our tenants and the value of our properties and might adversely affect the value of an investment in our securities. Such a resulting decrease in retail demand could make it difficult for us to renew or re-lease our properties. 
 
 Terrorist activities or violence also could result in decreased traffic at our properties due to a heightened level of concern for safety in public places or directly affect the value of our properties through damage, destruction or loss. Further, the availability of insurance for such acts, or of insurance generally, might be reduced or cost more, which could increase our operating expenses and adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations. To the extent that our tenants are affected by such attacks and threats of attacks, their businesses similarly could be adversely affected, including their ability to continue to meet obligations under their existing leases. These acts and threats might erode business and consumer confidence and spending and might result in increased volatility in national and international financial markets and economies. Any one of 
 21 

these events might decrease demand for real estate, decrease or delay the occupancy of our new or redeveloped properties, and limit our access to capital or increase our cost of raising capital. 
 
 COVID-19 has caused, and COVID-19 or any future pandemic, epidemic or outbreak of any other highly infectious disease could continue to cause, disruptions in the U.S., regional and global economies and could materially and adversely impact our business, financial condition and results of operations and the business, financial condition and results of operations of our tenants. 
 
 The COVID-19 pandemic, including the emergence of additional variants, has caused, and COVID-19 or any future pandemic, epidemic or outbreak of any other highly infectious disease could continue to cause, widespread disruptions to the United States and global economies and has contributed, and could continue to contribute, to significant volatility and negative pressure in financial markets. The extent to which COVID-19, or any future pandemic, epidemic or outbreak of any other highly infectious disease, impacts our operations will depend on future developments, which are highly uncertain and cannot be predicted with confidence, including the scope, severity and duration of such pandemic, the emergence and characteristics of new variants, the actions taken to contain the pandemic or mitigate its impact, including the adoption, administration and effectiveness of available vaccines, and the direct and indirect economic effects of the pandemic and containment measures, among others. COVID-19 has adversely affected, and COVID-19 or any future pandemic, epidemic or outbreak of any other highly infectious disease may continue to adversely affect, our business, financial condition and results of operations, and it may also have the effect of heightening many of the risks described in this Risk Factors section, including: 
 
 a complete or partial closure of, or other operational issues at, one or more of our Centers resulting from government or tenant action, which has caused or could continue to cause subsequent closures of previously re-opened Centers, which has adversely affected, and could continue to adversely effect, our operations and those of our tenants; 
 reduced economic activity impacting the businesses, financial condition and liquidity of our tenants, which has caused and could continue to cause, one or more of our tenants, including one or more of our Anchors, to be unable to meet their obligations to us in full, or at all, to otherwise seek modifications of such obligations, including, deferrals or reductions of rental payments, or to declare bankruptcy; 
 decreased levels of consumer spending and consumer confidence during the pandemic, as well as a decrease in traffic at our Centers, which has affected, and could continue to affect, the ability of the Centers to generate sufficient revenues to meet operating and other expenses in the short-term and could also accelerate a shift to online retail shopping, which, if sustained could result in prolonged decreases in revenue at the Centers even after the immediate impact of the pandemic is resolved; 
 inability to renew leases, lease vacant space, including vacant space from tenant bankruptcies and defaults, or re-let space as leases expire on favorable terms, or at all, which could result in lower rental payments or reduced occupancy levels, or could cause interruptions or delays in the receipt of rental payments; 
 the closure of Anchors at one or more of our properties, has triggered, and future closures could trigger, co-tenancy lease clauses within one or more of our leases at such properties and any future closures could potentially lead to a decline in revenue and occupancy; 
 a potential negative impact on our financial results could adversely impact our compliance with the financial covenants within our credit facility and other debt agreements or cause a failure to meet certain of these financial covenants, which could cause an event of default, which, if not cured or waived, could accelerate some or all of such indebtedness and could have a material adverse effect on us; 
 a potential decline in asset values at one or more of our properties encumbered by mortgage debt, which could inhibit our ability to successfully refinance one or more such properties, result in the default under the applicable mortgage debt agreement and potentially cause the acceleration of such indebtedness; and 
 disruption and instability in the global financial markets or deteriorations in credit and financing conditions, which has made, and could continue to make, it difficult for us to access debt and equity capital on attractive terms, or at all, and could also impact our ability to fund business activities, repay debt on a timely basis and renew, extend or replace our credit facility prior to its maturity date at all or on terms that are favorable to us. 
 
 Inflation may adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations. 
 
 Inflation in the United States increased in 2022 and may continue to increase in the near-term. If inflation increases in the future, we may experience any or all of the following: 
 22 

Increases in interest rates on our outstanding floating-rate debt as well as higher interest rates on any new and refinanced fixed-rate debt; 
 Difficulty in replacing or renewing expiring leases with new leases at higher rents; and 
 Decreasing tenant sales as a result of decreased consumer spending which could adversely affect the ability of our tenants to meet their rent obligations and/or result in lower percentage rents. 
 Additionally, even though most of our leases require tenants to pay their pro rata share of utilities, as well as a stated amount for operating expenses regardless of the expenses actually incurred at any Center, substantial inflationary pressures and increased operating costs may increase our exposure to rising property expenses and make it more difficult to maintain our historical cost controls at the Centers. 
 
 We have substantial debt that could affect our future operations. 
 
 Our total outstanding loan indebtedness at December 31, 2022 was 6.81 billion (consisting of 4.4 billion of consolidated debt, less 0.41 billion attributable to noncontrolling interests, plus 2.82 billion of our pro rata share of mortgages and other notes payable on unconsolidated joint ventures). As a result of this substantial indebtedness, we are required to use a material portion of our cash flow to service principal and interest on our debt, which limits the amount of cash available for other business opportunities. Borrowing costs increased throughout 2022 and may continue to increase in the near-term as the Federal Reserve acts to address rising inflation and, as a result, borrowing costs on our outstanding floating-rate debt as well as on new and refinanced fixed-rate debt may be more expensive. We are subject to the risks normally associated with debt financing and increased borrowing costs, including the risk that our cash flow from operations will be insufficient to meet required debt service and that rising interest rates could adversely affect our debt service costs. 
 
 In certain cases, we may limit our exposure to interest rate fluctuations related to a portion of our floating-rate debt by the use of interest rate cap and swap agreements. Such agreements, subject to current market conditions, allow us to replace floating-rate debt with fixed-rate debt in order to achieve our desired ratio of floating-rate to fixed-rate debt. However, in an increasing interest rate environment, the fixed rates we can obtain with such replacement fixed-rate cap and swap agreements or the fixed-rate on new and refinanced debt will also continue to increase. Our use of interest rate hedging arrangements may also expose us to additional risks, including that the counterparty to the arrangement may fail to honor its obligations and that termination of these arrangements typically involves costs such as transaction fees or breakage costs. There can be no assurance that our hedging activities will have the desired impact on our results of operations, liquidity or financial condition. 
 
 Furthermore, most of our Centers are mortgaged to secure payment of indebtedness, and if income from the Center is insufficient to pay that indebtedness, the Center could be foreclosed upon by the mortgagee resulting in a loss of income and a decline in our total asset value. During the year ended December 31, 2022, we did not repay the outstanding mortgage loan on our Towne Mall property on its maturity and are in the process of transitioning the property to a loan receiver. 
 
 We are obligated to comply with financial and other covenants that could affect our operating activities. 
 
 Our unsecured credit facilities contain financial covenants, including interest coverage requirements, as well as limitations on our ability to incur debt, make dividend payments and make certain acquisitions. These covenants may restrict our ability to pursue certain business initiatives or certain transactions that might otherwise be advantageous. In addition, failure to meet certain of these financial covenants could cause an event of default, which, if not cured or waived, could accelerate some or all of such indebtedness which could have a material adverse effect on us. 
 
 We depend on external financings for our growth and ongoing debt service requirements and are subject to refinancing risk. 
 
 We depend primarily on external financings, principally debt financings and, in more limited circumstances, equity financings, to fund the growth of our business and to ensure that we can meet ongoing maturities of our outstanding debt. Our access to financing depends on the willingness of banks, lenders and other institutions to lend to us based on their underwriting criteria which can fluctuate with market conditions and on conditions in the capital markets in general. In addition, levels of market disruption and volatility could materially adversely impact our ability to access the capital markets for equity financings. 
 
 We are also subject to the risks normally associated with debt financings, including the risk that our cash flow from operations will be insufficient to meet required debt service or that we will be unable to refinance such indebtedness on acceptable terms, or at all. If principal payments due at maturity cannot be refinanced, extended or repaid with proceeds from other sources, such as new equity capital, our cash flow may not be sufficient to repay all maturing debt in years when significant balloon payments come due. In addition, there are no assurances that we will continue to be able to obtain the financing we need for future growth on acceptable terms, or at all, and any new or refinanced debt could also impose more restrictive terms. 
 
 23 

The discontinuation of LIBOR and the replacement of LIBOR with an alternative reference rate may adversely affect our borrowing costs and could impact our business and results of operations. 
 
 We expect that all LIBOR settings relevant to us will cease to be published or will no longer be representative after June 30, 2023. The discontinuation of LIBOR will not affect our ability to borrow or maintain already outstanding borrowings or hedging transactions, but if our contracts indexed to LIBOR, including certain contracts governing our variable rate debt, the variable rate debt of our joint ventures and our interest rate caps, are converted to SOFR, the differences between LIBOR and SOFR, plus the recommended spread adjustment, could result in interest or hedging costs that are higher than if LIBOR remained available. Additionally, although SOFR is the Alternative Reference Rates Committee s recommended replacement rate, it is also possible that lenders may instead choose alternative replacement rates that may differ from LIBOR in ways similar to SOFR or in ways that would result in higher interest or hedging costs for us. It is not yet possible to predict the magnitude of LIBOR s end on our borrowing costs given the remaining uncertainty about which rates will replace LIBOR. As of December 31, 2022, each of the agreements governing our variable rate debt provides for the replacement of LIBOR if it becomes unavailable during the term of such agreement. 
 
 RISKS RELATED TO OUR ORGANIZATIONAL STRUCTURE 
 
 Certain individuals have substantial influence over the management of both us and the Operating Partnership, which may create conflicts of interest. 
 
 Under the limited partnership agreement of the Operating Partnership, we, as the sole general partner, are responsible for the management of the Operating Partnership s business and affairs. Conflicts of interest may exist or could arise in the future as a result of the relationships between us and our affiliates, on the one hand, and our Operating Partnership or any of its partners, on the other. Our directors and officers have duties to our Company under Maryland law in connection with their management of our Company. At the same time, we have duties and obligations to our Operating Partnership and its limited partners under Delaware law as modified by the partnership agreement of our Operating Partnership in connection with the management of our Operating Partnership as the sole general partner. Our duties and obligations as the general partner of our Operating Partnership may come into conflict with the duties of our directors and officers to our Company and our stockholders. 
 
 Outside partners in Joint Venture Centers result in additional risks to our stockholders. 
 
 We own partial interests in property partnerships that own 22 Joint Venture Centers, one office property and one development property, as well as several development sites. We may acquire partial interests in additional properties through joint venture arrangements. Investments in Joint Venture Centers involve risks different from those of investments in Wholly Owned Centers. 
 
 We have fiduciary responsibilities to our joint venture partners that could affect decisions concerning the Joint Venture Centers. Our partners in certain Joint Venture Centers (notwithstanding our majority legal ownership) share control of major decisions relating to the Joint Venture Centers, including decisions with respect to sales, refinancings and the timing and amount of additional capital contributions, as well as decisions that could have an adverse impact on us. 
 
 In addition, we may lose our management and other rights relating to the Joint Venture Centers if: 
 
 we fail to contribute our share of additional capital needed by the property partnerships; or 
 we default under a partnership agreement for a property partnership or other agreements relating to the property partnerships or the Joint Venture Centers. 
 Furthermore, the bankruptcy of one of the other investors in our Joint Venture Centers could materially and adversely affect the respective property or properties. Pursuant to the bankruptcy code, we could be precluded from taking some actions affecting the estate of the other investor without prior court approval which would, in most cases, entail prior notice to other parties and a hearing. At a minimum, the requirement to obtain court approval may delay the actions we would or might want to take. If the relevant joint venture through which we have invested in a Joint Venture Center has incurred recourse obligations, the discharge in bankruptcy of one of the other investors might result in our ultimate liability for a greater portion of those obligations than would otherwise be required. 
 
 Our legal ownership interest in a joint venture vehicle may, at times, not equal our economic interest in the entity because of various provisions in certain joint venture agreements regarding distributions of cash flow based on capital account balances, allocations of profits and losses and payments of preferred returns. As a result, our actual economic interest (as distinct from our legal ownership interest) in certain of the Joint Venture Centers could fluctuate from time to time and may not wholly align with our legal ownership interests. Substantially all of our joint venture agreements contain rights of first refusal, buy-sell provisions, exit rights, default dilution remedies and/or other break up provisions or remedies which are customary in 
 24 

real estate joint venture agreements and which may, positively or negatively, affect the ultimate realization of cash flow and/or capital or liquidation proceeds. 
 
 Our holding company structure makes us dependent on distributions from the Operating Partnership. 
 
 Because we conduct our operations through the Operating Partnership, our ability to service our debt obligations and pay dividends to our stockholders is strictly dependent upon the earnings and cash flows of the Operating Partnership and the ability of the Operating Partnership to make distributions to us. Under the Delaware Revised Uniform Limited Partnership Act, the Operating Partnership is prohibited from making any distribution to us to the extent that at the time of the distribution, after giving effect to the distribution, all liabilities of the Operating Partnership (other than some non-recourse liabilities and some liabilities to the partners) exceed the fair value of the assets of the Operating Partnership. An inability to make cash distributions from the Operating Partnership could jeopardize our ability to maintain qualification as a REIT. 
 
 An ownership limit and certain of our Charter and bylaw provisions could inhibit a change of control or reduce the value of our common stock. 
 
 The Ownership Limit . In order for us to maintain our qualification as a REIT, not more than 50 in value of our outstanding stock (after taking into account certain options to acquire stock) may be owned, directly or indirectly or through the application of certain attribution rules, by five or fewer individuals (as defined in the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the Code ), to include some entities that would not ordinarily be considered individuals at any time during the last half of a taxable year. To assist us in maintaining our qualification as a REIT, among other purposes, our Charter restricts ownership of more than 5 (the Ownership Limit of the lesser of the number or value of our outstanding shares of stock by any single stockholder or a group of stockholders (with limited exceptions). In addition to enhancing preservation of our status as a REIT, the Ownership Limit may: 
 
 have the effect of delaying, deferring or preventing a change in control of us or other transaction without the approval of our board of directors, even if the change in control or other transaction is in the best interests of our stockholders; and 
 limit the opportunity for our stockholders to receive a premium for their common stock or preferred stock that they might otherwise receive if an investor were attempting to acquire a block of stock in excess of the Ownership Limit or otherwise effect a change in control of us. 
 Our board of directors, in its sole discretion, may waive or modify (subject to limitations and upon any conditions as it may direct) the Ownership Limit with respect to one or more of our stockholders, if it is satisfied that ownership in excess of this limit will not jeopardize our status as a REIT. 
 
 Selected Provisions of our Charter and bylaws. Some of the provisions of our Charter and bylaws may have the effect of delaying, deferring or preventing a third party from making an acquisition proposal for us and may inhibit a change in control that holders of some, or a majority, of our shares might believe to be in their best interests or that could give our stockholders the opportunity to realize a premium over the then-prevailing market prices for our shares. These provisions include the following: 
 
 advance notice requirements for stockholder nominations of directors and stockholder proposals to be considered at stockholder meetings; 
 the obligation of our directors to consider a variety of factors with respect to a proposed business combination or other change of control transaction; 
 the authority of our directors to classify or reclassify unissued shares and cause the Company to issue shares of one or more classes or series of common stock or preferred stock; 
 the authority of our directors to create and cause the Company to issue rights entitling the holders thereof to purchase shares of stock or other securities from us; and 
 limitations on the amendment of our Charter, the change in control of us, and the liability of our directors and officers. 
 Certain provisions of Maryland law could inhibit a change in control or reduce the value of our common stock. 
 
 Certain provisions of the Maryland General Corporation Law (the MGCL may have the effect of delaying, deferring or preventing a third party from making an acquisition proposal for us and may inhibit a change in control that holders of some, or a majority, of our shares might believe to be in their best interests or that could give our stockholders the opportunity to realize a premium over the then-prevailing market prices for our shares, including: 
 25 

Business Combination provisions that, subject to limitations, prohibit certain business combinations between us and an interested stockholder (defined generally as any person who beneficially owns 10 or more of the voting power of our outstanding voting stock or an affiliate or associate of ours who, at any time within the two-year period immediately prior to the date in question, was the beneficial owner of 10 or more of our then outstanding stock) or an affiliate of an interested stockholder for five years after the most recent date on which the stockholder becomes an interested stockholder, and thereafter may impose special appraisal rights and special stockholder voting requirements on these combinations; and 
 Control Share provisions that provide that holders of control shares of our Company (defined as shares which, when aggregated with other shares controlled by the stockholder, entitle the stockholder to exercise one of three increasing ranges of voting power in electing directors) acquired in a control share acquisition (defined as the direct or indirect acquisition of ownership or control of control shares have no voting rights except to the extent approved by our stockholders by the affirmative vote of at least two-thirds of all the votes entitled to be cast on the matter, excluding all interested shares. 
 As permitted by the MGCL, our Charter exempts from the business combination provisions any business combination between us and the principals and their respective affiliates and related persons. The MGCL also allows the board of directors to exempt particular business combinations before the interested stockholder becomes an interested stockholder. Furthermore, a person is not an interested stockholder if the transaction by which he or she would otherwise have become an interested stockholder is approved in advance by the board of directors. 
 
 Additionally, pursuant to a provision in our bylaws, we have opted out of the control share acquisition provisions of the MGCL. However, in the future, we may, without the approval of our stockholders, by amendment to our bylaws, opt in to the control share provisions of the MGCL. The MGCL and our Charter also contain supermajority voting requirements with respect to our ability to amend certain provisions of our Charter, merge, or sell all or substantially all of our assets. 
 
 Furthermore, our board of directors has adopted a resolution prohibiting us from electing to be subject to the provisions of Title 3, Subtitle 8 of the MGCL that would, among other things, permit our board of directors to classify the board without stockholder approval. Such provisions of Title 3, Subtitle 8 of the MGCL could have an anti-takeover effect. We may only elect to be subject to the classified board provisions of Title 3, Subtitle 8 after first obtaining the approval of our stockholders. 
 
 FEDERAL INCOME TAX RISKS 
 
 The tax consequences of the sale of some of the Centers and certain holdings of the principals may create conflicts of interest. 
 
 The principals will experience negative tax consequences if some of the Centers are sold. As a result, the principals may not favor a sale of these Centers even though such a sale may benefit our other stockholders. In addition, the principals may have different interests than our stockholders because they are significant holders of limited partnership units in the Operating Partnership. 
 
 If we were to fail to qualify as a REIT, we would have reduced funds available for distributions to our stockholders. 
 
 We believe that we currently qualify as a REIT. No assurance can be given that we will remain qualified as a REIT. Qualification as a REIT involves the application of highly technical and complex Code provisions for which there are only limited judicial or administrative interpretations. The complexity of these provisions and of the applicable income tax regulations is greater in the case of a REIT structure like ours that holds assets through the Operating Partnership and joint ventures. The determination of various factual matters and circumstances not entirely within our control, including determinations by our partners in the Joint Venture Centers, may affect our continued qualification as a REIT. In addition, legislation, new regulations, administrative interpretations or court decisions could significantly change the tax laws with respect to our qualification as a REIT or the U.S. federal income tax consequences of that qualification. 
 
 In addition, we currently hold certain of our properties through subsidiaries that have elected to be taxed as REITs and we may in the future determine that it is in our best interests to hold one or more of our other properties through one or more subsidiaries that elect to be taxed as REITs. If any of these subsidiaries fails to qualify as a REIT for U.S. federal income tax purposes, then we may also fail to qualify as a REIT for U.S. federal income tax purposes. 
 
 If in any taxable year we were to fail to qualify as a REIT, we will suffer the following negative results: 
 
 we will not be allowed a deduction for distributions to stockholders in computing our taxable income; and 
 we will be subject to U.S. federal and state income tax on our taxable income at regular corporate rates. 
 26 

In addition, if we were to lose our REIT status, we would be prohibited from qualifying as a REIT for the four taxable years following the year during which the qualification was lost, absent relief under statutory provisions. As a result, net income and the funds available for distributions to our stockholders would be reduced for at least five years and the fair market value of our shares could be materially adversely affected. Furthermore, the Internal Revenue Service could challenge our REIT status for past periods. Such a challenge, if successful, could result in us owing a material amount of tax, interest and penalties for prior periods. It is possible that future economic, market, legal, tax or other considerations might cause our board of directors to revoke our REIT election. 
 
 Even if we remain qualified as a REIT, we might face other tax liabilities that reduce our cash flow. Further, we might be subject to federal, state and local taxes on our income and property. Any of these taxes would decrease cash available for distributions to stockholders. 
 
 Complying with REIT requirements might cause us to forego otherwise attractive opportunities. 
 
 In order to qualify as a REIT for U.S. federal income tax purposes, we must satisfy tests concerning, among other things, our sources of income, the nature of our assets, the amounts we distribute to our stockholders and the ownership of our stock. We may also be required to make distributions to our stockholders at disadvantageous times or when we do not have funds readily available for distribution. Thus, compliance with REIT requirements may cause us to forego opportunities we would otherwise pursue. 
 
 In addition, the REIT provisions of the Code impose a 100 tax on income from prohibited transactions. Prohibited transactions generally include sales of assets that do not qualify for a statutory safe harbor if such assets constitute inventory or other property held for sale in the ordinary course of business, other than foreclosure property. This 100 tax could impact our desire to sell assets and other investments at otherwise opportune times if we believe such sales could be considered prohibited transactions. 
 
 Complying with REIT requirements may force us to borrow or take other measures to make distributions to our stockholders. 
 
 As a REIT, we generally must distribute 90 of our annual taxable income (subject to certain adjustments) to our stockholders. From time to time, we might generate taxable income greater than our net income for financial reporting purposes, or our taxable income might be greater than our cash flow available for distributions to our stockholders. If we do not have other funds available in these situations, we might be unable to distribute 90 of our taxable income as required by the REIT rules. In that case, we would need to borrow funds, liquidate or sell a portion of our properties or investments (potentially at disadvantageous or unfavorable prices), in certain limited cases distribute a combination of cash and stock (at our stockholders election but subject to an aggregate cash limit established by the Company) or find another alternative source of funds. These alternatives could increase our costs or reduce our equity. In addition, to the extent we borrow funds to pay distributions, the amount of cash available to us in future periods will be decreased by the amount of cash flow we will need to service principal and interest on the amounts we borrow, which will limit cash flow available to us for other investments or business opportunities. 
 
 We may face risks in connection with Section 1031 Exchanges. 
 
 If a transaction intended to qualify as a Section 1031 Exchange is later determined to be taxable, we may face adverse consequences, and if the laws applicable to such transactions are amended or repealed, we may not be able to dispose of properties on a tax deferred basis. Section 1031 Exchanges now only apply to real property and do not apply to any related personal property transferred with the real property. As a result, any appreciated personal property that is transferred in connection with a Section 1031 Exchange of real property will cause gain to be recognized, and such gain is generally treated as non-qualifying income for the 95 and 75 gross income tests. Any such non-qualifying income could have an adverse effect on our REIT status. 
 
 If our Operating Partnership fails to maintain its status as a partnership for tax purposes, we would face adverse tax consequences. 
 
 We intend to maintain the status of the Operating Partnership as a partnership for federal income tax purposes. However, if the Internal Revenue Service were to successfully challenge the status of the Operating Partnership as an entity taxable as a partnership, the Operating Partnership would be taxable as a corporation. This would reduce the amount of distributions that the Operating Partnership could make to us. This could also result in our losing REIT status, with the consequences described above. This would substantially reduce the cash available to us to make distributions and the return on your investment. In addition, if any of the partnerships or limited liability companies through which the Operating Partnership owns its property, in whole or in part, loses its characterization as a partnership or disregarded entity for federal income tax purposes, it would be subject to taxation as a corporation, thereby reducing distributions to the Operating Partnership. Such a recharacterization of an underlying entity could also threaten our ability to maintain REIT status. 
 27 

Legislative or regulatory action could adversely affect our stockholders. 
 
 In recent years, numerous legislative, judicial and administrative changes have been made to the U.S. federal income tax laws applicable to investments similar to an investment in our stock. Additional changes to tax laws are likely to continue in the future, and we cannot assure you that any such changes will not adversely affect the taxation of us or our stockholders. 
 
 Any such changes could have an adverse effect on an investment in our stock or on the market value or the resale potential of our properties. 
 
 GENERAL RISK FACTORS 
 
 Our success depends, in part, on our ability to attract and retain talented employees, and the loss of any one of our key personnel could adversely impact our business. 
 
 The success of our business depends, in part, on the leadership and performance of our executive management team and key employees, and our ability to attract, retain and motivate talented employees could significantly impact our future performance. Competition for these individuals is intense, and we cannot assure you that we will retain our executive management team and key employees or that we will be able to attract and retain other highly qualified individuals for these positions in the future. Losing any one or more of these persons could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows. 
 
 The price of our common stock has and may continue to fluctuate significantly, which may make it difficult for our stockholders to resell their shares when they want or at prices they find attractive. 
 
 The price of our common stock on the NYSE constantly changes and has been subject to significant price fluctuations. Our stock price can fluctuate as a result of a variety of factors, many of which are beyond our control. These factors may include, but are not limited to, actual or anticipated variations in our operating results or dividends; general market fluctuations, including potentially extreme increases or decreases in the market prices of certain of our publicly traded tenants, industry factors and general economic and geopolitical conditions and events, such as economic slowdowns or recessions, consumer confidence in the economy, ongoing military conflicts and terrorist attacks; technical factors in the public trading market for our stock that may produce price movements that may or may not comport with macro, industry or company-specific fundamentals, including, without limitation, the sentiment of retail investors (including as may be expressed on financial trading and other social media sites), the amount and status of short interest in our securities and the potential for a short squeeze whereby short sellers are forced to cover their open positions, access to margin debt, trading in options and other derivatives on our common stock and other technical trading factors; changes in our funds from operations or earnings estimates; changes in the ability of our shopping centers to generate sufficient revenues to meet operating and other expenses; anchor or tenant bankruptcies, closures, mergers or consolidations; local economic and real estate conditions in geographic locations where we have a high concentration of Centers; competition by public or private mall companies or others, including competition for both acquisition of Centers and for tenants to occupy space; the ability of our tenants to pay rent and meet their other obligations to us under current lease terms and our ability to lease space on favorable terms; the success of our acquisition and real estate development strategy; our ability to comply with the financial covenants in our debt agreements and the impact of restrictive covenants in our debt agreements; our access to financing; inflation and increases in interest rates; the risk of our failure to qualify or maintain our status as a REIT; our ability to comply with our joint venture agreements and other risks associated with our joint venture investments; possible uninsured losses, including losses from casualty events or natural disasters, and possible environmental liabilities; adverse impacts from COVID-19 or any future pandemic, epidemic or outbreak of any other highly infectious disease on the U.S., regional and global economies and on our financial condition and results of operations and the financial condition and results of operations of our tenants; a decision by any of our significant stockholders to sell substantial amounts of our common stock; any future issuances of equity securities; and the realization of any of the other risk factors included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. 
 
 We face risks associated with and have been the target of security breaches through cyber attacks, cyber intrusions or otherwise, as well as other significant disruptions of our information technology (IT) networks and related systems. 
 
 We face risks associated with cyber threats and have been the target of security breaches, whether through cyber attacks or cyber intrusions over the Internet, malware, computer viruses, attachments to e-mails, persons inside our organization or persons with access to systems inside our organization, and other significant disruptions of our IT networks and related systems. Cyber incidents have been increasing in sophistication and frequency and can include third parties gaining access to data using stolen or inferred credentials, computer malware, viruses, spamming, phishing attacks, ransomware, and other deliberate attacks and attempts to gain unauthorized access. The techniques used to sabotage or to obtain systems in which data is stored or through which data is transmitted change frequently, and we may be unable to implement adequate preventative measures or stop security breaches while they are occurring. Because the techniques used by threat actors who may attempt to penetrate and sabotage our computer systems change frequently and may not be recognized until launched against a target, we may be unable to anticipate these techniques. These threats, in turn, may lead to increased costs to protect our information 
 28 

systems, detect and respond to threats, and recover from cyber incidents. While we carry cyber liability insurance, it may not be adequate to cover all losses relating to such events. 
 
 Our IT networks and related systems are essential to the operation of our business and our ability to perform day-to-day operations and, in some cases, may be critical to the operations of certain of our tenants. Although we make efforts to maintain the security and integrity of these types of IT networks and related systems, and we have implemented various measures to manage the risk of a security incident, there can be no guarantee that our security efforts and measures will be effective or that attempted cyber attacks would not be successful, disruptive, or damaging. A security incident involving our information systems could disrupt the proper functioning of our networks and systems. This could, in turn, result in misstated financial reports, violations of loan covenants and/or missed reporting deadlines, the inability to properly monitor our compliance with the rules and regulations regarding our qualification as a REIT, the unauthorized access to, and the destruction, loss, theft, misappropriation or release of proprietary, confidential, sensitive or otherwise valuable information of ours or others, which could be used to compete against us or for disruptive, destructive or otherwise harmful purposes and outcomes; require significant management attention and resources to remedy any damages that result; subject us to claims for breach of contract, damages, credits, penalties or termination of leases or other agreements; or damage our reputation among our tenants and investors generally. Moreover, cyber attacks perpetrated against our Anchors and tenants, including unauthorized access to customers credit card data and other confidential information, could diminish consumer confidence and consumer spending and negatively impact our business. Any breach, loss, or compromise of personal data may also subject us to civil fines and penalties, or claims for damages under relevant state and federal privacy laws in the United States. Data breaches and other data security compromises may lead to public disclosures which, in turn, may lead to widespread negative publicity.

________________________ 
 (1) The Company's ownership interest in this table reflects its direct or indirect legal ownership interest. Legal ownership may, at times, not equal the Company's economic interest in the listed properties because of various provisions in certain joint venture agreements regarding distributions of cash flow based on capital account balances, allocations of profits and losses and payments of preferred returns. As a result, the Company's actual economic interest (as distinct from its legal ownership interest) in certain of the properties could fluctuate from time to time and may not wholly align with its legal ownership interests. Substantially all of the Company's joint venture agreements contain rights of first refusal, buy-sell provisions, exit rights, default dilution remedies and/or other break up provisions or remedies which are customary in real estate joint venture agreements and which may, positively or negatively, affect the ultimate realization of cash flow and/or capital or liquidation proceeds. See Item 1A. Risks Related to Our Organizational Structure Outside partners in Joint Venture Centers result in additional risks to our stockholders. 
 (2) The Company owned or had an ownership interest in 44 Regional Town Centers (including office, hotel and residential space adjacent to these shopping centers), five community/power shopping centers, one office property and one redevelopment property. With the exception of the eight Centers indicated with footnote (7) in the table above, the underlying land controlled by the Company is owned in fee entirely by the Company or, in the case of Joint Venture Centers, by the joint venture property partnership or limited liability company. With respect to these eight Centers, portions of the underlying land controlled by the Company are owned by third parties and leased to the Company, or the joint venture property partnership or limited liability company, pursuant to long-term ground leases. Under the terms of a typical ground lease, the Company, or the joint venture property partnership or limited liability company, has an option or right of first refusal to purchase the land. The termination dates of the ground leases range from 2038 to 2098. 
 (3) Total GLA includes GLA attributable to Anchors (whether owned or non-owned) and Mall and Freestanding Stores as of December 31, 2022. Non-owned Anchors is space not owned by the Company (or, in the case of Joint Venture Centers, by the joint venture property partnership or limited liability company) which is occupied by Anchor tenants. Company-owned Anchors is space owned (or leased) by the Company (or, in the case of Joint Venture Centers, by the joint venture property partnership or limited liability company) and leased (or subleased) to Anchor. 
 (4) These Centers have vacant Anchor locations. The Company is actively seeking replacement tenants or has entered into replacement leases for many of these vacant sites and/or is currently executing or considering redevelopment opportunities for these locations. The Company continues to collect rent under the terms of an agreement regarding five of these vacant Anchors. 
 (5) Scheels All Sports is building a two-level 222,000 square foot store at Chandler Fashion Center utilizing the vacant 144,000 square foot location formerly occupied by Nordstrom. The store is anticipated to open in fall 2023. 
 (6) Target has announced plans to open a three-level, 90,000 square foot store at Kings Plaza and a two-level, 126,000 square foot store at Danbury Fair Mall. 
 (7) Portions of the land on which the Center is situated are subject to one or more long-term ground leases. 
 (8) Primark has announced plans to open two new two-level stores at Green Acres Mall and Tysons Corner Center. 
 (9) The Center has a vacant former anchor store to be demolished for redevelopment. 
 (10) Included in Consolidated Centers. 
 (11) Included in Unconsolidated Joint Venture Centers. 
 (12) The Company owns an office building and three stores located at shopping centers not owned by the Company. Of the three stores, one has been leased to Kohl's and two have been leased for non-Anchor uses. With respect to the office building and one of the three stores, the underlying land is owned in fee entirely by the Company. With respect to the remaining two stores, the underlying land is owned by third parties and leased to the Company pursuant to long-term building or ground leases. Under the terms of a typical building or ground lease, the Company pays rent for the use of the building or land and is generally responsible for all costs and expenses associated with the building and improvements. In some cases, the Company has an option or right of first refusal to purchase the land. The two ground leases terminate in years 2027 and 2028. 
 (13) In 2022, the Company s joint venture completed its redevelopment of the majority of One Westside to convert it from a three-level former regional town center into a three-level, 584,000 square foot creative office campus that is leased entirely to Google. Google is expected to take occupancy in 2023, and to commence paying rent in the second quarter of 2023. The remaining approximately 96,000 square feet of entertainment and retail space of the property is currently vacant and unleased. 
 (14) Construction started in summer 2021 on the first phase of a multi-phase, multi-year project to convert the former regional town center Paradise Valley Mall into a mixed-used development with high-end grocery, restaurants, multi-family residences, offices, retail shops and other elements on the 92-acre site. The existing Costco and JCPenney stores remain open, while all of the other stores at the property have closed.

 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS 
 Management's Overview and Summary 
 The Company is involved in the acquisition, ownership, development, redevelopment, management and leasing of regional and community/power shopping centers located throughout the United States. The Company is the sole general partner of, and owns a majority of the ownership interests in, the Operating Partnership. As of December 31, 2022, the Operating Partnership owned or had an ownership interest in 44 Regional Town Centers (including office, hotel and residential space adjacent to these shopping centers), five community/power shopping centers, one office property and one redevelopment property. These 51 Regional Town Centers, community/power shopping centers, office and redevelopment properties consist of approximately 47 million square feet of gross leasable area GLA and are referred to herein as the Centers . The Centers consist of consolidated Centers Consolidated Centers and unconsolidated joint venture Centers Unconsolidated Joint Venture Centers as set forth in Item 2. Properties, unless the context otherwise requires. The Company is a self-administered and self-managed REIT and conducts all of its operations through the Operating Partnership and the Management Companies. 
 The following discussion is based primarily on the consolidated financial statements of the Company for the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020. It compares the results of operations and cash flows for the year ended December 31, 2022 to the results of operations and cash flows for the year ended December 31, 2021.

This information should be read in conjunction with the accompanying consolidated financial statements and notes thereto. 
 Acquisitions: 
 On August 2, 2022, the Company acquired the remaining 50 ownership interest in two former Sears parcels (Deptford Mall and Vintage Faire Mall) in the MS Portfolio LLC joint venture that it did not previously own for a total purchase price of 24.5 million.

The Company drew the 175 million term loan facility in its entirety simultaneously with entering into the new credit agreement in April 2021 and subsequently paid off the remaining balance outstanding on the term loan facility with proceeds from the sale of Tucson La Encantada in September 2021. 
 On October 26, 2021, the Company's joint venture in The Shops at Atlas Park replaced the existing loan on the property with a new 65 million loan that bears interest at a floating rate of LIBOR plus 4.15 and matures on November 9, 2026, including extension options.

 See Item 7. Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Liquidity and Capital Resources for a further discussion of the Company s anticipated liquidity needs, and the measures taken by the Company to meet those needs. 
 Inflation: 
 Most of the leases at the Centers have rent adjustments periodically throughout the lease term. These rent increases are either in fixed increments or based on using an annual multiple of increases in the Consumer Price Index. In addition, the routine expiration of leases for spaces 10,000 square feet and under each year (See "Item I. Business of the Company Lease Expirations"), enables the Company to replace existing leases with new leases at higher base rents if the rents of the existing leases are below the then existing market rate. The Company has generally entered into leases that require tenants to pay a stated amount for operating expenses, generally excluding property taxes, regardless of the expenses actually incurred at any Center, which places the burden of cost control on the Company. Additionally, most leases require the tenants to pay their pro rata share of property taxes and utilities. Inflation is expected to have a negative impact on the Company's costs in 2022 and 2023. 
 
 Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates 
 The preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles ("GAAP") in the United States of America requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates. 
 Some of these estimates and assumptions include judgments on revenue recognition, estimates for common area maintenance and real estate tax accruals, provisions for uncollectible accounts, impairment of long-lived assets, the allocation of purchase price between tangible and intangible assets, capitalization of costs and fair value measurements. The Company s significant accounting policies and estimates are described in more detail in Note 2 Summary of Significant Accounting Policies in the Company s Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements. However, the following policies are deemed to be critical: 
 Acquisitions: 
 Upon the acquisition of real estate properties, the Company evaluates whether the acquisition is a business combination or asset acquisition. For both business combinations and asset acquisitions, the Company allocates the purchase price of properties to acquired tangible assets and intangible assets and liabilities. For asset acquisitions, the Company capitalizes transaction costs and allocates the purchase price using a relative fair value method allocating all accumulated costs. For business combinations, the Company expenses transaction costs incurred and allocates purchase price based on the estimated fair value of each separately identified asset and liability. The Company allocates the estimated fair value of acquisitions to land, building, tenant improvements and identified intangible assets and liabilities, based on their estimated fair values. In addition, any assumed mortgage notes payable are recorded at their estimated fair values. The estimated fair value of the land and buildings is determined utilizing an as if vacant methodology. Tenant improvements represent the tangible assets associated with the existing leases valued on a fair value basis at the acquisition date prorated over the remaining lease terms. The tenant improvements are classified as an asset under property and are depreciated over the remaining lease terms. Identifiable intangible assets and liabilities relate to the value of in-place operating leases which come in three forms: (i) leasing commissions and legal costs, which represent the value associated with cost avoidance of acquiring in-place leases, such as lease commissions paid under terms generally experienced in the Company's markets; (ii) value of in-place leases, which represents the estimated loss of revenue and of costs incurred for the period required to lease the assumed vacant property to the occupancy level when purchased; and (iii) above or below-market value of in-place leases, which represents the difference between the contractual rents and market rents at the time of the acquisition, discounted for tenant credit risks. Leasing commissions and legal costs are recorded in deferred charges and other assets and are amortized over the remaining lease terms. The value of in-place leases are recorded in deferred charges and other assets and amortized over the remaining lease terms plus any below-market fixed rate renewal options. Above or below-market leases are classified in deferred charges and other assets 
 43 

or in other accrued liabilities, depending on whether the contractual terms are above or below-market, and the asset or liability is amortized to minimum rents over the remaining terms of the leases. The remaining lease terms of below-market leases may include certain below-market fixed-rate renewal periods. In considering whether or not a lessee will execute a below-market fixed-rate lease renewal option, the Company evaluates economic factors and certain qualitative factors at the time of acquisition such as tenant mix in the Center, the Company's relationship with the tenant and the availability of competing tenant space. 
 Remeasurement gains and losses are recognized when the Company becomes the primary beneficiary of an existing equity method investment that is a variable interest entity to the extent that the fair value of the existing equity investment exceeds the carrying value of the investment, and remeasurement losses to the extent the carrying value of the investment exceeds the fair value. The fair value is determined based on a discounted cash flow model, with the significant unobservable inputs including discount rate, terminal capitalization rate and market rents. 
 Asset Impairment: 
 The Company assesses whether an indicator of impairment in the value of its properties exists by considering expected future operating income, trends and prospects, as well as the effects of demand, competition and other economic factors. Such factors include projected rental revenue, operating costs and capital expenditures as well as estimated holding periods and capitalization rates. If an impairment indicator exists, the determination of recoverability is made based upon the estimated undiscounted future net cash flows, excluding interest expense. The amount of impairment loss, if any, is determined by comparing the fair value, as determined by a discounted cash flows analysis or a contracted sales price, with the carrying value of the related assets. The Company generally holds and operates its properties long-term, which decreases the likelihood of their carrying values not being recoverable. A shortened holding period increases the risk that the carrying value of a long-lived asset is not recoverable. Properties classified as held for sale are measured at the lower of the carrying amount or fair value less cost to sell. 
 The Company reviews its investments in unconsolidated joint ventures for a series of operating losses and other factors that may indicate that a decrease in the value of its investments has occurred which is other-than-temporary. The investment in each unconsolidated joint venture is evaluated periodically, and as deemed necessary, for recoverability and valuation declines that are other-than-temporary. 
 Fair Value of Financial Instruments: 
 The fair value hierarchy distinguishes between market participant assumptions based on market data obtained from sources independent of the reporting entity and the reporting entity's own assumptions about market participant assumptions. 
 Level 1 inputs utilize quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities that the Company has the ability to access. Level 2 inputs are inputs other than quoted prices included in Level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly or indirectly. Level 2 inputs may include quoted prices for similar assets and liabilities in active markets, as well as inputs that are observable for the asset or liability (other than quoted prices), such as interest rates, foreign exchange rates and yield curves that are observable at commonly quoted intervals. Level 3 inputs are unobservable inputs for the asset or liability, which is typically based on an entity's own assumptions, as there is little, if any, related market activity. In instances where the determination of the fair value measurement is based on inputs from different levels of the fair value hierarchy, the level in the fair value hierarchy within which the entire fair value measurement falls is based on the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement in its entirety. The Company's assessment of the significance of a particular input to the fair value measurement in its entirety requires judgment, and considers factors specific to the asset or liability. 
 The Company calculates the fair value of financial instruments and includes this additional information in the notes to consolidated financial statements when the fair value is different than the carrying value of those financial instruments. When the fair value reasonably approximates the carrying value, no additional disclosure is made. 
 The Company records its Financing Arrangement obligation at fair value on a recurring basis with changes in fair value being recorded as interest expense in the Company s consolidated statements of operations. The fair value is determined based on a discounted cash flow model, with the significant unobservable inputs including discount rate, terminal capitalization rate, and market rents. The fair value of the Financing Arrangement obligation is sensitive to these significant unobservable inputs and a change in these inputs may result in a significantly higher or lower fair value measurement.

Results of Operations 
 Many of the variations in the results of operations, discussed below, occurred because of the transactions affecting the Company's properties described above, including those related to the Redevelopment Properties, the JV Transition Centers and the Disposition Properties (each as defined below). 
 For purposes of the discussion below, the Company defines "Same Centers" as those Centers that are substantially complete and in operation for the entirety of both periods of the comparison. Non-Same Centers for comparison purposes include those Centers or properties that are going through a substantial redevelopment often resulting in the closing of a portion of the Center Redevelopment Properties ), those properties that have recently transitioned to or from equity method joint ventures to or from consolidated assets ("JV Transition Centers") and properties that have been disposed of ("Disposition Properties"). The Company moves a Center in and out of Same Centers based on whether the Center is substantially complete and in operation for the entirety of both periods of the comparison. Accordingly, the Same Centers consist of all consolidated Centers, excluding the Redevelopment Properties, the JV Transition Centers and the Disposition Properties for the periods of comparison. 
 For the comparison of the year ended December 31, 2021 to the year ended December 31, 2020, the Redevelopment Properties are Paradise Valley Mall and certain ground up developments. 
 For the comparison of the year ended December 31, 2022 to the year ended December 31, 2021, the JV Transition Centers are the two former Sears parcels at Deptford Mall and Vintage Faire Mall (See "Acquisitions" in Management's Overview and Summary), and for the comparison of the year ended December 31, 2021 to the year ended December 31, 2020, the JV Transition Centers are Fashion District Philadelphia and Sears South Plains. The change in revenues and expenses at the JV Transition Centers is primarily due to the conversion of Fashion District Philadelphia from an Unconsolidated Joint Venture Center to a Consolidated Center (See Note 15 Consolidated Joint Venture and Acquisitions in the Company's Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements). 
 For the comparison of the year ended December 31, 2022 to the year ended December 31, 2021 and the comparison of the year ended December 31, 2021 to the year ended December 31, 2020, the Disposition Properties are Paradise Valley Mall and Tucson La Encantada. 
 Unconsolidated joint ventures are reflected using the equity method of accounting. The Company's pro rata share of the results from these Centers is reflected in the consolidated statements of operations as equity in income (loss) of unconsolidated joint ventures. 
 The Company considers tenant annual sales, occupancy rates (excluding large retail stores or "Anchors") and releasing spreads (i.e. a comparison of initial average base rent per square foot on leases executed during the trailing twelve months to average base rent per square foot at expiration for the leases expiring during the trailing twelve months based on the spaces 10,000 square feet and under) to be key performance indicators of the Company's internal growth. 
 During the trailing twelve months ended December 31, 2022, comparable tenant sales for spaces less than 10,000 square feet across the portfolio increased by 2.8 compared to the time frame in 2021. The leased occupancy rate of 92.6 at December 31, 2022 represented a 1.1 increase from 91.5 at December 31, 2021 and a 0.5 sequential increase compared to the 92.1 occupancy rate at September 30, 2022. Releasing spreads increased as the Company executed leases at an average rent of 60.48 for new and renewal leases executed compared to 58.16 on leases expiring, resulting in a releasing spread increase of 2.32 per square foot, or 4 , for the trailing twelve months ended December 31, 2022. 
 The Company continues to renew or replace leases that are scheduled to expire in 2023, however, for a variety of factors, the Company cannot be certain of its ability to sign, renew or replace leases expiring in 2023 or beyond. These leases that are scheduled to expire represent approximately 1.0 million square feet of the Centers, accounting for 18.14 of the GLA of mall stores and freestanding stores, for spaces 10,000 square feet and under, as of December 31, 2022. These calculations exclude Centers under development or redevelopment and property dispositions (See Acquisitions, "Dispositions" and "Redevelopment and Development Activities" in Management's Overview and Summary), and include square footage of Centers owned by joint ventures at the Company s share. 
 2023 lease expirations continue to be an important focal point for the Company. As of December 31, 2022, the Company has executed leases or commitments from retailers that are in lease documentation for 52 of the leased space expiring in 2023, and another 27 of such expiring space is in the letter of intent stage. Excluding those leases, the remaining leases expiring in 2023, which represent approximately 600,000 square feet of the Centers, are in the prospecting stage. 
 45 

The Company has entered into 123 leases for new stores totaling approximately 1.1 million square feet that have opened or are planned for opening in 2023, and another 17 leases for new stores totaling approximately 925,000 square feet opening after 2023. While there may be additional new space openings in 2023, any such leases are not yet executed. 
 During the trailing twelve months ended December 31, 2022, the Company signed 314 new leases and 660 renewal leases comprising approximately 3.8 million square feet of GLA, of which 2.4 million square feet is related to the consolidated Centers. The average tenant allowance was 17.82 per square foot. 
 Outlook 
 The Company has a long-term four-pronged business strategy that focuses on the acquisition, leasing and management, redevelopment and development of Regional Town Centers. During 2022, the Company leased 3.8 million square feet, which represents the strongest year of leasing volume for the Company when measured on a comparable center basis since before the 2009 Global Financial Crisis. The Company s portfolio also experienced the smallest volume of tenant bankruptcies since 2013. As of December 31, 2022, the Company s portfolio leased occupancy was 92.6 , which has increased 4.1 in the past seven quarters since the pandemic-driven low of 88.5 as of March 31, 2021. The Company continues to make progress addressing the near-term maturities of its non-recourse mortgage debt, as further described below. Although fundamentals at the Centers continued to improve during 2022, operating results in 2023 could be negatively impacted by certain macro-economic factors, including any continued increase in inflation and interest rates or an economic slowdown or recession. 
 The Company experienced a positive impact to its leasing revenue during the three and twelve months ended December 31, 2022. Leasing revenue increased by approximately 1.9 and 5.2 , compared to the three and twelve months ended December 31, 2021, respectively. This increase includes the joint ventures at the Company s share and excludes the Disposition Properties and The Shops at Northbridge, at the Company s share. Among other factors, the increase for the year was primarily due to increases in occupancy and from decreases in retroactive rent abatements incurred in 2022 compared to 2021. 
 Traffic levels during the fourth quarter of 2022 continued to range in the mid 90 s relative to the pre-pandemic fourth quarter of 2019. Similar traffic trends were generally consistent throughout all of 2022 when compared to pre-pandemic 2019. Comparable tenant sales from spaces less than 10,000 square feet across the portfolio for the trailing twelve months ended December 31, 2022 increased by 2.8 compared to the same period in 2021. Portfolio tenant sales per square foot for spaces less than 10,000 square feet for the trailing twelve months ended December 31, 2022 were 869 compared to 801 for the pre-pandemic trailing twelve months ended December 31, 2019. 
 During 2022, the Company signed 974 new and renewal leases for approximately 3.8 million square feet, compared to 816 leases and 3.4 million square feet signed during 2021. This leasing volume represented a 19 increase in the number of leases and a 10 increase in the amount of square footage leased compared to the same period in 2021 on a comparable basis. 
 The Company believes that diversity of use within its tenant base will be a prominent internal growth catalyst at its Centers going forward, as new uses enhance the productivity and diversity of the tenant mix and have the potential to significantly increase customer traffic at the applicable Centers. During the year ended December 31, 2022, the Company signed deals for new stores with new-to-Macerich portfolio uses for over 440,000 square feet, with another 210,000 square feet of such new-to-Macerich portfolio leases currently in negotiation as of the date of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. 
 As of December 31, 2022, the leased occupancy rate increased to 92.6 , a 1.1 increase compared to the leased occupancy rate of 91.5 at December 31, 2021 and a 0.5 sequential increase compared to the leased occupancy rate of 92.1 at September 30, 2022. 
 The Company s rent collections through the year ended December 31, 2022 have been comparable to pre-COVID-19 levels for the year ended December 31, 2019. Prior to 2022, the Company completed the majority of its pandemic-driven negotiations with national and local tenants to secure rental payments. Those negotiations resulted in the Company entering into lease amendments that granted significant rental assistance in the form of rent deferral and/or rent reduction. Many of the Company s leases contain co-tenancy clauses. Certain Anchor or small tenant closures have become permanent, whether caused by the pandemic or otherwise, and co-tenancy clauses within certain leases may be triggered as a result. The Company does not anticipate that the negative impact of such clauses on lease revenue will be significant. 
 During the year ended December 31, 2021, the Company incurred 47.6 million of rent abatements at the Company s share, relating primarily to 2020 rents as a result of COVID-19 and negotiated 4.6 million of rent deferrals during the year ended December 31, 2021 at the Company s share. During the year ended December 31, 2022, the Company incurred 1.4 million of rent abatements at the Company s share. The Company negotiated 1.1 million of rent deferrals during the year ended December 31, 2022. As of December 31, 2022, 2.6 million of the rent deferrals remain outstanding, with 1.4 million scheduled to be repaid during 2023 and the balance scheduled for repayment thereafter. 
 46 

During 2022, the pace of bankruptcy filings involving the Company s tenants decreased substantially as compared to 2021, with only two bankruptcy filings involving three of the Company's tenants representing approximately 111,000 square feet of leased space and 2.2 million of annual leasing revenue at the Company s share. The Company continues to expect that the pace of bankruptcy filings in 2023 will be low. Year-to-date in 2023, there have been two bankruptcy filings involving the Company s tenants totaling seven leases and representing approximately 39,000 square feet of leased space and 1.9 million of annual leasing revenue. 
 During 2023, the Company expects to generate positive cash flow from operations after recurring operating capital expenditures, leasing capital expenditures and payment of dividends. This assumption does not include any potential capital generated from dispositions, refinancings or issuances of common equity. This expected surplus will be used to de-lever the Company s balance sheet as well as to fund the Company s development and redevelopment pipeline (See " Redevelopment and Development Activities" in Management's Overview and Summary). 
 On February 2, 2022, the Company s joint venture in FlatIron Crossing replaced the existing 197 million loan on the property with a new 175 million loan that bears interest at SOFR plus 3.70 and matures on February 9, 2025, including extension options. On April 29, 2022, the Company closed on a new 72 million loan at Pacific View with a fixed rate of 5.29 that matures on May 6, 2032. On May 6, 2022, the Company closed on a two-year extension of the loan on The Oaks to June 5, 2024. The loan will now bear a fixed interest rate of 5.25 , and the Company repaid 5.0 million of the outstanding loan balance at closing. On July 1, 2022, the Company extended the loan maturity on Danbury Fair Mall to July 1, 2023. The interest rate remained unchanged at 5.5 , and the Company repaid 10.0 million of the outstanding loan balance at closing. On November 14, 2022, the Company s joint venture closed a four-year extension on the 503 million loan on Washington Square. 15 million of the loan was repaid at closing by the joint venture 9 million at the Company s share). The extended loan bears interest at a floating rate of SOFR plus 4.0 , subject to an interest rate cap agreement, and matures on November 1, 2026, including extension options. On December 9, 2022, the Company closed a three-year extension on the 300 million loan on Santa Monica Place. None of the loan amount was repaid at closing. The extended loan bears interest at a floating rate of LIBOR plus 1.48 and matures on December 9, 2025, including extension options. In addition, on January 3, 2023, the Company closed on a five-year 370.0 million combined refinance of Green Acres Mall and Green Acres Commons. The new interest only loan bears a fixed interest rate of 5.90 and matures on January 6, 2028. On January 20, 2023, the Company exercised its one-year extension option of the loan on Fashion District Philadelphia to January 22, 2024. The interest rate is SOFR plus 3.60 and the Company repaid 26.1 million of the outstanding loan balance at closing. The Company s joint venture in Scottsdale Fashion Square expects to replace the existing 406.0 million mortgage loan on the property with a 700.0 million, five-year, fixed-rate loan. The Company expects the joint venture to close this refinancing during the first quarter of 2023, subject to negotiating final documentation and customary closing conditions. The Company did not repay the loan on Towne Mall on its maturity date of November 1, 2022, and has begun the process of transitioning the property to a loan receiver. (See Financing Activities in Management s Overview and Summary). 
 Rising interest rates are increasing the cost of the Company s borrowings due to its outstanding floating-rate debt and have led to higher interest rates on new fixed-rate debt. The Company expects to incur increased interest expense from the refinancing or extension of loans that may currently carry below-market interest rates. In certain cases, the Company may limit its exposure to interest rate fluctuations related to a portion of its floating-rate debt by using interest rate cap and swap agreements. Such agreements, subject to current market conditions, allow the Company to replace floating-rate debt with fixed-rate debt in order to achieve its desired ratio of floating-rate to fixed-rate debt. However, any interest rate cap or swap agreements that the Company enters into may not be effective in reducing its exposure to interest rate changes. 
 
 Comparison of Years Ended December 31, 2022 and 2021 
 Revenues: 
 Leasing revenue increased by 13.0 million, or 1.7 , from 2021 to 2022. The increase in leasing revenue is attributed to increases of 21.3 million from the Same Centers and 1.9 million from the JV Transition Centers offset in part by 10.2 million from the Disposition Properties. Leasing revenue includes the amortization of above and below-market leases, the amortization of straight-line rents, lease termination income and the provision for bad debts.

For a reconciliation of net (loss) income attributable to the Company, the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure, to FFO attributable to common stockholders and unit holders, excluding financing expense in connection with Chandler Freehold and loss on extinguishment of debt and FFO attributable to common stockholders and unit holders diluted, excluding financing expense in connection with Chandler Freehold and loss on extinguishment of debt , see "Funds From Operations ("FFO")" below. 
 Operating Activities: 
 48 

Cash provided by operating activities increased 51.1 million from 2021 to 2022. The increase is primarily due to the changes in assets and liabilities and the results, as discussed above. 
 Investing Activities: 
 Cash used in investing activities increased 236.4 million from 2021 to 2022. The increase in cash used in investing activities is primarily attributed to a decrease in proceeds from the sale of assets of 287.1 million offset in part by an increase of 37.4 million in distributions from unconsolidated joint ventures and 21.0 million in proceeds from collection of receivable in connection with sale of joint venture property. 
 Financing Activities: 
 Cash used in financing activities decreased 0.5 billion from 2021 to 2022. The decrease in cash used in financing activities is primarily due to the decrease in payments on mortgages, bank and other notes payable of 1.7 billion offset by a reduction in the amounts of net proceeds received from sales of common shares under the ATM Programs of 830.4 million and proceeds from mortgages, bank and other notes payable of 315.0 million.

The increase in leasing revenue and decrease in bad debt at the Same Centers is primarily the result of all Centers being open in 2021 compared to the majority of Centers being closed for portions of 2020 and an increase in tenant sales to pre-COVID 2019 levels (See "Other Transactions and Events" in Management's Overview and Summary). 
 Other income increased from 22.2 million in 2020 to 33.9 million in 2021. This is primarily due to increased parking garage income resulting from increased traffic at the Centers (See "Other Transactions and Events" in Management's Overview and Summary). 
 Management Companies' revenue increased from 23.5 million in 2020 to 26.0 million in 2021. The increase is primarily the result of increased management fees in 2021 due to all Centers being open in 2021 compared to Centers being closed for portions of 2020.

 Gain (loss) on sale or write down of assets, net increased from a loss of 68.1 million in 2020 to a gain of 75.7 million in 2021. The increase is primarily due to the 36.7 million of impairment losses on Wilton Mall and Paradise Valley Mall, 4.2 million write-down of non-real estate assets and 36.7 million write-down of development costs in 2020 and 117.2 million gain on the sale of Tucson La Encantada and 29.4 million gain on land sales in 2021 offset in part by the sale and impairment loss of 41.6 million on Estrella Falls and 28.3 million loss related to North Bridge in 2021 (See "Dispositions" in Management's Overview and Summary). The impairment losses were due to the reduction in the estimated holding periods of the properties.

 Financing Activities: 
 Cash provided by financing activities decreased 1.3 billion from 2020 to 2021. The decrease in cash provided by financing activities is primarily due to decreases in proceeds from mortgages, bank and other notes payable of 140.0 million and an increase in payments on mortgages, bank and other notes payable of 2.0 billion offset in part by net proceeds from sales of common shares under the ATM Programs of 830.2 million and a decrease in dividends and distributions of 36.4 million. 
 50 

Liquidity and Capital Resources 
 The Company anticipates meeting its liquidity needs for its operating expenses, debt service and dividend requirements for the next twelve months and beyond through cash generated from operations, distributions from unconsolidated joint ventures, working capital reserves and/or borrowings under its line of credit. 
 Uses of Capital 
 The following tables summarize capital expenditures and lease acquisition costs incurred at the Centers (at the Company's pro rata share) for the years ended December 31: (Dollars in thousands) 2022 2021 2020 Consolidated Centers: Acquisitions of property, building improvement and equipment 49,459 18,715 9,570 Development, redevelopment, expansion and renovation of Centers 55,493 46,341 38,405 Tenant allowances 25,045 22,101 12,413 Deferred leasing charges 2,443 2,585 3,044 132,440 89,742 63,432 Joint Venture Centers (at the Company's pro rata share): Acquisitions of property, building improvement and equipment 13,222 18,803 6,497 Development, redevelopment, expansion and renovation of Centers 74,592 48,512 109,902 Tenant allowances 16,757 11,594 4,804 Deferred leasing charges 4,057 2,881 2,111 108,628 81,790 123,314 
 The Company expects amounts to be incurred during the next twelve months for tenant allowances and deferred leasing charges to be comparable to 2022. The Company expects to incur approximately 150.0 million during 2023 for development, redevelopment, expansion and renovations. Capital for these expenditures, developments and/or redevelopments has been, and is expected to continue to be, obtained from a combination of cash on hand, debt or equity financings, which are expected to include borrowings under the Company's line of credit, from property financings and construction loans, each to the extent available. 
 Sources of Capital 
 The Company has also generated liquidity in the past, and may continue to do so in the future, through equity offerings and issuances, property refinancings, joint venture transactions and the sale of non-core assets. For example, the Company sold Paradise Valley Mall in Phoenix, Arizona and Tucson La Encantada in Tucson, Arizona during the year ended December 31, 2021 and used the proceeds to pay down its line of credit and other debt obligations. During the year ended December 31, 2022, the Company and certain joint venture partners sold various land parcels in separate transactions for aggregate proceeds of 60.3 million (at the Company's share), which the Company used to pay down debt and for other general corporate purposes. Furthermore, the Company has filed a shelf registration statement, which registered an unspecified amount of common stock, preferred stock, depositary shares, debt securities, warrants, rights, stock purchase contracts and units that may be sold from time to time by the Company. 
 
 On each of February 1, 2021 and March 26, 2021, the Company registered a separate "at the market" offering program, pursuant to which the Company may issue and sell shares of its common stock having an aggregate offering price of up to 500 million under each ATM Program, or a total of 1.0 billion under the ATM Programs, in amounts and at times to be determined by the Company. During the twelve months ended December 31, 2021, the Company issued approximately 62.0 million shares of common stock under the ATM Programs for net proceeds of 830.2 million. During the twelve months ended December 31, 2022, no shares were issued under the March 2021 ATM Program. As of December 31, 2022, the Company had approximately 151.7 million of gross sales of its common stock available under the March 2021 ATM Program. 
 The capital and credit markets can fluctuate and, at times, limit access to debt and equity financing for companies. The Company has been able to access capital; however, there is no assurance the Company will be able to do so in future periods or on similar terms and conditions. Many factors impact the Company's ability to access capital, such as its overall debt level, interest rates, interest coverage ratios and prevailing market conditions, including periods of economic slowdown or recession. The Company expects to incur increased interest expense from the refinancing or extension of loans that may currently carry below-market interest rates. In addition, increases in the Company's proportion of floating rate debt will cause it to be subject to interest rate fluctuations in the future.

The Company's total outstanding loan indebtedness, which includes mortgages and other notes payable, at December 31, 2022 was 6.81 billion (consisting of 4.40 billion of consolidated debt, less 0.41 billion of noncontrolling interests, plus 2.82 billion of its pro rata share of unconsolidated joint venture debt). The majority of the Company's debt consists of fixed-rate conventional mortgage notes collateralized by individual properties. The Company expects that all of the maturities during the next twelve months will be refinanced, restructured, extended and/or paid off from the Company's line of credit or cash on hand, with the exception of the loan on Towne Mall. 
 The Company believes that the pro rata debt provides useful information to investors regarding its financial condition because it includes the Company s share of debt from unconsolidated joint ventures and, for consolidated debt, excludes the Company s partners share from consolidated joint ventures, in each case presented on the same basis. The Company has several significant joint ventures and presenting its pro rata share of debt in this manner can help investors better understand the Company s financial condition after taking into account the Company's economic interest in these joint ventures. The Company s pro rata share of debt should not be considered as a substitute for the Company s total consolidated debt determined in accordance with GAAP or any other GAAP financial measures and should only be considered together with and as a supplement to the Company s financial information prepared in accordance with GAAP. 
 The Company accounts for its investments in joint ventures that it does not have a controlling interest or is not the primary beneficiary using the equity method of accounting and those investments are reflected on the consolidated balance sheets of the Company as investments in unconsolidated joint ventures. 
 Additionally, as of December 31, 2022, the Company was contingently liable for 40.9 million in letters of credit guaranteeing performance by the Company of certain obligations relating to the Centers. As of December 31, 2022, 40.7 million of these letters of credit were secured by restricted cash. The Company does not believe that these letters of credit will result in a liability to the Company. 
 On February 2, 2022, the Company s joint venture in FlatIron Crossing replaced the existing 197 million loan on the property with a new 175 million loan that bears interest at SOFR plus 3.70 and matures on February 9, 2025, including extension options. On April 29, 2022, the Company closed on a new 72 million loan at Pacific View with a fixed rate of 5.29 that matures on May 6, 2032. On May 6, 2022, the Company closed on a two-year extension of the loan on The Oaks to June 5, 2024. The loan will now bear a fixed interest rate of 5.25 , and the Company repaid 5.0 million of the outstanding loan balance at closing. On July 1, 2022, the Company extended the loan maturity on Danbury Fair Mall to July 1, 2023. The interest rate remained unchanged at 5.5 , and the Company repaid 10.0 million of the outstanding loan balance at closing. On November 14, 2022, the Company s joint venture closed a four-year extension on the 503 million loan on Washington Square. 15 million of the loan was repaid at closing by the joint venture 9 million at the Company s share). The extended loan bears interest at a floating rate of SOFR plus 4.0 , subject to an interest rate cap agreement, and matures on November 1, 2026, including extension options. On December 9, 2022, the Company closed a three-year extension on the 300 million loan on Santa Monica Place. None of the loan amount was repaid at closing. The extended loan bears interest at a floating rate of LIBOR plus 1.48 and matures on December 9, 2025, including extension options. In addition, on January 3, 2023, the Company closed on a five-year 370.0 million combined refinance of Green Acres Mall and Green Acres Commons. The new interest only loan bears a fixed interest rate of 5.90 and matures on January 6, 2028. On January 20, 2023, the Company exercised its one-year extension option of the loan on Fashion District Philadelphia to January 22, 2024. The interest rate is SOFR plus 3.60 and the Company repaid 26.1 million of the outstanding loan balance at closing. The Company s joint venture in Scottsdale Fashion Square expects to replace the existing 406.0 million mortgage loan on the property with a 700.0 million, five-year, fixed-rate loan. The Company expects the joint venture to close this refinancing during the first quarter of 2023, subject to negotiating final documentation and customary closing conditions. The Company did not repay the loan on Towne Mall on its maturity date of November 1, 2022, and has begun the process of transitioning the property to a loan receiver. (See Financing Activities in Management s Overview and Summary). 
 The Company has a 700 million credit facility, including a 525 million revolving loan facility that matures on April 14, 2023, with a one-year extension option. The revolving loan facility can be expanded up to 800 million, subject to receipt of lender commitments and other conditions. All obligations under the credit facility are guaranteed unconditionally by the Company and are secured in the form of mortgages on certain wholly-owned assets and pledges of equity interests held by certain of the Company s subsidiaries. The credit facility bears interest at LIBOR plus a spread of 2.25 to 3.25 depending on Company s overall leverage level. As of December 31, 2022, the borrowing rate was LIBOR plus 2.25 . As of December 31, 2022, borrowings under the credit facility were 171.0 million less unamortized deferred finance costs of 7.9 million for the revolving loan facility at a total interest rate of 8.08 . As of December 31, 2022, the Company s availability under the revolving loan facility for additional borrowings was 353.8 million. 
 Cash dividends and distributions for the twelve months ended December 31, 2022 were 186.3 million which were funded by operations.

At December 31, 2022, the Company was in compliance with all applicable loan covenants under its agreements. 
 At December 31, 2022, the Company had cash and cash equivalents of 100.3 million.

 Funds From Operations ("FFO") 
 The Company uses FFO in addition to net income to report its operating and financial results and considers FFO and FFO -diluted as supplemental measures for the real estate industry and a supplement to GAAP measures. The National Association of Real Estate Investment Trusts ("Nareit") defines FFO as net income (loss) (computed in accordance with GAAP), excluding gains (or losses) from sales of properties, plus real estate related depreciation and amortization, impairment write-downs of real estate and write-downs of investments in an affiliate where the write-downs have been driven by a decrease in the value of real estate held by the affiliate and after adjustments for unconsolidated joint ventures. Adjustments for unconsolidated joint ventures are calculated to reflect FFO on the same basis. 
 The Company accounts for its joint venture in Chandler Freehold as a financing arrangement. In connection with this treatment, the Company recognizes financing expense on (i) the changes in fair value of the financing arrangement obligation, (ii) any payments to the joint venture partner equal to their pro rata share of net income and (iii) any payments to the joint venture partner less than or in excess of their pro rata share of net income. The Company excludes from its definition of FFO the noted expenses related to the changes in fair value and for the payments to the joint venture partner less than or in excess of their pro rata share of net income. 
 The Company also presents FFO excluding financing expense in connection with Chandler Freehold and loss on extinguishment of debt. 
 FFO and FFO on a diluted basis are useful to investors in comparing operating and financial results between periods. This is especially true since FFO excludes real estate depreciation and amortization, as the Company believes real estate values fluctuate based on market conditions rather than depreciating in value ratably on a straight-line basis over time. The Company believes that such a presentation also provides investors with a meaningful measure of its operating results in comparison to the operating results of other REITs. In addition, the Company believes that FFO excluding financing expense in connection with Chandler Freehold and non-routine costs associated with extinguishment of debt and costs related to shareholder activism provide useful supplemental information regarding the Company s performance as they show a more meaningful and consistent comparison of the Company s operating performance and allows investors to more easily compare the Company s results. The Company further believes that FFO on a diluted basis is a measure investors find most useful in measuring the dilutive impact of outstanding convertible securities. 
 The Company believes that FFO does not represent cash flow from operations as defined by GAAP, should not be considered as an alternative to net income as defined by GAAP, and is not indicative of cash available to fund all cash flow needs. The Company also cautions that FFO, as presented, may not be comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other real estate investment trusts.

Funds From Operations ("FFO") (Continued) 
 Management compensates for the limitations of FFO by providing investors with financial statements prepared according to GAAP, along with this detailed discussion of FFO and a reconciliation of net (loss) income to FFO and FFO diluted. Management believes that to further understand the Company's performance, FFO should be compared with the Company's reported net (loss) income and considered in addition to cash flows in accordance with GAAP, as presented in the Company's consolidated financial statements. The following reconciles net (loss) income attributable to the Company to FFO and FFO diluted attributable to common stockholders and unit holders basic and diluted, excluding financing expense in connection with Chandler Freehold and loss on extinguishment of debt, net and costs related to shareholder activism for the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021, 2020, 2019 and 2018 (dollars and shares in thousands):

 ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK 
 The Company's primary market risk exposure is interest rate risk. The Company has managed and will continue to manage interest rate risk by (1) maintaining a ratio of fixed rate, long-term debt to total debt such that floating rate exposure is kept at an acceptable level, (2) reducing interest rate exposure on certain long-term floating rate debt through the use of interest rate caps and/or swaps with matching maturities where appropriate, (3) using treasury rate locks where appropriate to fix rates on anticipated debt transactions, and (4) taking advantage of favorable market conditions for long-term debt and/or equity. 
 The following table sets forth information as of December 31, 2022 concerning the Company's long term debt obligations, including principal cash flows by scheduled maturity, weighted average interest rates and estimated fair value (dollars in thousands): Expected Maturity Date For the years ending December 31, 2023 2024 2025 2026 2027 Thereafter Total Fair Value CONSOLIDATED CENTERS: Long term debt: Fixed rate(1) 517,585 530,491 608,383 538,780 1,682 1,527,758 3,724,679 3,385,936 Average interest rate 4.55 4.39 3.49 3.55 4.82 4.05 4.01 Floating rate(1)(2) 132,820 267,927 300,000 700,747 679,550 Average interest rate 6.91 7.15 5.79 6.53 Total debt Consolidated Centers

 (1) On January 3, 2023, the Company closed a 370 million, five-year refinance of the combined loans that formerly encumbered Green Acres Mall and Green Acres Commons (See Financing Activity in Management s Overview and Summary). 
 (2) On January 20, 2023, the Company exercised its one-year extension option of the Fashion District Philadelphia loan to January 22, 2024 and repaid 26.1 million of the outstanding loan balance at closing (See Financing Activity in Management s Overview and Summary). 
 (3) The Company's joint venture in Scottsdale Fashion Square expects to replace the existing 406.0 million mortgage loan on the property with a 700.0 million, five-year, fixed rate loan. The Company expects the joint venture to close this refinancing during the first quarter of 2023, subject to negotiating final documentation and customary closing conditions (See "Financing Activity" in Management's Overview and Summary). 
 The Consolidated Centers' total fixed rate debt at December 31, 2022 and 2021 was 3.7 billion and 3.8 billion, respectively. The average interest rate on such fixed rate debt at December 31, 2022 and 2021 was 4.01 and 3.94 , respectively. The Consolidated Centers' total floating rate debt at December 31, 2022 and 2021 was 0.7 billion. The average interest rate on such floating rate debt at December 31, 2022 and 2021 was 6.53 and 2.61 , respectively. 
 The Company's pro rata share of the Unconsolidated Joint Venture Centers' fixed rate debt at December 31, 2022 and 2021 was 2.7 billion and 2.8 billion, respectively. The average interest rate on such fixed rate debt at December 31, 2022 and 
 55 

2021 was 4.46 and 3.83 , respectively. The Company's pro rata share of the Unconsolidated Joint Venture Centers' floating rate debt at December 31, 2022 and 2021 was 90.7 million and 104.3 million, respectively. The average interest rate on such floating rate debt at December 31, 2022 and 2021 was 5.81 and 2.60 , respectively. 
 The Company uses derivative financial instruments in the normal course of business to manage or hedge interest rate risk and records all derivatives on the balance sheet at fair value. Interest rate cap agreements offer protection against floating rates on the notional amount from exceeding the rates noted in the above schedule, and interest rate swap agreements effectively replace a floating rate on the notional amount with a fixed rate as noted above. As of December 31, 2022, the Company has interest rate cap agreements in place (See Note 4 Investments in Unconsolidated Joint Ventures and Note 5 Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities in the Company's Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements). The respective loans each require an interest rate cap agreement to be in place at all times, which limits how high the prevailing floating loan rate index (i.e., LIBOR or SOFR) for the loans can rise. As of the date of this report, LIBOR/SOFR for each of these loans exceeded the strike interest rate (the "Strike Rate") within the required interest rate cap agreement. If LIBOR/SOFR does exceed the Strike Rate, each of these loans would then be considered fixed rate debt. If LIBOR/SOFR for these respective loans thereafter no longer exceeds the Strike Rate, then these loans would once again be considered floating rate debt. 
 In addition, the Company has assessed the market risk for its floating rate debt and believes that a 1 increase in interest rates would decrease future earnings and cash flows by approximately 7.9 million per year based on 791.4 million of floating rate debt outstanding at December 31, 2022. 
 The fair value of the Company's long-term debt is estimated based on a present value model utilizing interest rates that reflect the risks associated with long-term debt of similar risk and duration. In addition, the method of computing fair value for mortgage notes payable included a credit value adjustment based on the estimated value of the property that serves as collateral for the underlying debt (See Note 10 Mortgage Notes Payable and Note 11 Bank and Other Notes Payable in the Company's Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements). 
 The Company expects that all LIBOR settings relevant to it will cease to be published or will no longer be representative after June 30, 2023. The discontinuation of LIBOR will not affect the Company s ability to borrow or maintain already outstanding borrowings or hedging transactions, but if the Company s contracts indexed to LIBOR, including certain contracts governing the variable rate debt of the Company and its joint ventures and the Company s interest rate caps, are converted to SOFR, the differences between LIBOR and SOFR, plus the recommended spread adjustment, could result in interest or hedging costs that are higher than if LIBOR remained available. Additionally, although SOFR is the Alternative Reference Rates Committee s recommended replacement rate, it is also possible that lenders may instead choose alternative replacement rates that may differ from LIBOR in ways similar to SOFR or in ways that would result in higher interest or hedging costs for the Company. It is not yet possible to predict the magnitude of LIBOR s end on the Company s borrowing costs given the remaining uncertainty about which rates will replace LIBOR. As of December 31, 2022, each of the agreements governing the Company s variable rate debt provides for the replacement of LIBOR if it becomes unavailable during the term of such agreement. The Company does not expect that the costs of converting any remaining LIBOR-based loans to SOFR-based loans to be significant.

 Management's Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting 
 The Company's management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rule 13a-15(f) under the Exchange Act). The Company's management assessed the effectiveness of the Company's internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2022. In making this assessment, the Company's management used the criteria set forth by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission in Internal Control Integrated Framework (2013). The Company's management concluded that, as of December 31, 2022, its internal control over financial reporting was effective based on this assessment. 
 KPMG LLP, the independent registered public accounting firm that audited the Company's 2022 consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, has issued a report on the Company's internal control over financial reporting which follows below. 
 Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting 
 There were no changes in the Company's internal control over financial reporting during the quarter ended December 31, 2022 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, the Company's internal control over financial reporting.

Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm 
 
 To the Stockholders and Board of Directors of 
 The Macerich Company: 
 
 Opinion on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting 
 We have audited The Macerich Company and subsidiaries (the Company) internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2022, based on criteria established in Internal Control Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. In our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2022, based on criteria established in Internal Control Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. 
 We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the consolidated balance sheets of the Company as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, the related consolidated statements of operations, comprehensive (loss) income, equity, and cash flows for each of the years in the three-year period ended December 31, 2022, and the related notes and financial statement Schedule III - Real Estate and Accumulated Depreciation (collectively, the consolidated financial statements), and our report dated February 24, 2023 expressed an unqualified opinion on those consolidated financial statements. 
 Basis for Opinion 
 The Company s management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in the accompanying Management's Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company s internal control over financial reporting based on our audit. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. 
 We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audit of internal control over financial reporting included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk. Our audit also included performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion. 
 Definition and Limitations of Internal Control Over Financial Reporting 
 A company s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements. 
 Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm 
 To the Stockholders and Board of Directors of 
 The Macerich Company: 

Opinion on the Consolidated Financial Statements 
 We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of The Macerich Company and subsidiaries (Company) as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, the related consolidated statements of operations, comprehensive (loss) income, equity, and cash flows for each of the years in the three-year period ended December 31, 2022, and the related notes and financial statement Schedule III - Real Estate and Accumulated Depreciation (collectively, the consolidated financial statements). In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the years in the three-year period ended December 31, 2022, in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. 
 We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the Company s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2022, based on criteria established in Internal Control Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission, and our report dated February 24, 2023 expressed an unqualified opinion on the effectiveness of the Company s internal control over financial reporting. 
 Basis for Opinion 
 These consolidated financial statements are the responsibility of the Company s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these consolidated financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. 
 We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. Our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the consolidated financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the consolidated financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion. 
 Critical Audit Matters 
 The critical audit matters communicated below are matters arising from the current period audit of the consolidated financial statements that were communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that: (1) relate to accounts or disclosures that are material to the consolidated financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion on the consolidated financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matters below, providing separate opinions on the critical audit matters or on the accounts or disclosures to which they relate. 
 Assessment of the Company s evaluation of the expected holding period for operating properties 
 As discussed in Notes 2 and 6 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company assesses whether an indicator of impairment in the carrying value of its properties exists by considering property operating performance, holding periods, capitalization rates, and other market factors. Property, net as of December 31, 2022 was 6,128 million, or 76 of total assets. 
 We identified the assessment of the Company s evaluation of the expected holding period for operating properties as a critical audit matter. Subjective auditor judgment was required to assess the relevant events or changes in circumstances that the Company used to evaluate its expected holding period. A shortening of the expected holding period could indicate a potential impairment. 
 The following are the primary procedures we performed to address this critical audit matter. We evaluated the design and tested the operating effectiveness of certain internal controls over the Company s property impairment process, including controls over the Company s evaluation of the expected holding period. We evaluated the relevant events or 
 61 

changes in circumstances and the current economic environment that the Company used to evaluate its expected holding period by: 
 reading minutes of the meetings of the Company s Board of Directors 
 reading external communications with investors and analysts 
 analyzing documents prepared by the Company regarding proposed real estate transactions 
 considering properties with current encumbrances that are set to mature within one year. 
 Evaluation of the fair value of the Chandler Freehold financing arrangement obligation 
 As discussed in Notes 2 and 12 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company reports the Chandler Freehold consolidated joint venture as a financing arrangement with the related deferred gain recorded as a liability at fair value. The fair value of the financing arrangement obligation is determined primarily based upon the fair value of the underlying shopping centers, Chandler Fashion Center and Freehold Raceway Mall, owned by the Chandler Freehold consolidated joint venture. The fair value of the shopping centers is estimated using a discounted cash flow model. Subsequent changes in the fair value of the financing arrangement obligation are recorded as interest expense. The financing arrangement obligation as of December 31, 2022 was 143 million, or 3 of total liabilities. The adjustment to fair value of the financing arrangement obligation was 24 million, or 37 of net income for the year ended December 31, 2022. 
 We identified the evaluation of the fair value of the Chandler Freehold financing arrangement obligation as a critical audit matter. A high degree of subjectivity was required in evaluating the discounted cash flow model used to fair value the shopping centers. Specifically, the model was sensitive to reasonably possible changes to significant assumptions, which have a significant effect on the determination of fair value of the financing arrangement obligation. The significant assumptions include market rental rates, discount rates, and terminal capitalization rates. 
 The following are the primary procedures we performed to address this critical audit matter. We evaluated the design and tested the operating effectiveness of certain internal controls over the Company s fair value determination process for the financing arrangement obligation and specifically the development of the significant assumptions. We involved valuation professionals with specialized skills and knowledge who assisted in evaluating the Company s significant assumptions used in the discounted cash flow model. The valuation professionals independently developed a range of the market rental rates, discount rates, and terminal capitalization rates using publicly available market data for comparable properties and geographic regions in which Chandler Fashion Center and Freehold Raceway Mall are located and compared the rates to those used by the Company.

 COVID-19 Pandemic: 
 In March 2020, the COVID-19 outbreak was declared a pandemic by the World Health Organization. As a result, all of the markets that the Company operates in were subject to stay-at-home orders, and the majority of its properties were temporarily closed in part or completely. Following staggered re-openings during 2020, all Centers have been open and operating since October 7, 2020 and government-imposed capacity restrictions resulting from COVID-19 have been eliminated across the Company s markets. 
 COVID-19 Lease Accounting: 
 In April 2020, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ("FASB") issued a Staff Question-and-Answer Q A to clarify whether lease concessions related to the effects of COVID-19 require the application of the lease modification guidance under ASC 842, "Leases" ("the lease modification accounting framework"). Under ASC 842, the Company would have to determine, on a lease-by-lease basis, if a lease concession was the result of a new arrangement reached with the tenant or an enforceable right and obligation within the existing lease. The Q A allows for the bypass of a lease-by-lease analysis, and allows the Company to elect to either apply the lease modification accounting framework or not to all of its lease concessions with similar characteristics and circumstances. The Company has elected to apply the lease modification accounting framework to lease concessions that include the abatement of rent in its consolidated financial statements for the twelve months ended December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020.

Estimated recoveries from certain tenants for their pro rata share of real estate taxes, insurance and other shopping center operating expenses are recognized as revenues in the period the applicable expenses are incurred. Other tenants pay a fixed rate and these tenant recoveries are recognized as revenues on a straight-line basis over the term of the related leases.

 interest in Corte Madera Village, LLC, Macerich HHF Centers LLC, New River Associates LLC and Pacific Premier Retail LLC, the Company does not have controlling financial interests in these joint ventures due to the substantive participation rights of the outside partners in these joint ventures and, therefore, accounts for its investments in these joint ventures using the equity method of accounting. 
 Equity method investments are initially recorded on the balance sheet at cost and are subsequently adjusted to reflect the Company s proportionate share of net earnings and losses, distributions received, additional contributions and certain other adjustments, as appropriate. The Company separately reports investments in joint ventures when accumulated distributions have exceeded the Company s investment, as distributions in excess of investments in unconsolidated joint ventures. The net investment of certain joint ventures is less than zero because of financing or operating distributions that are usually greater than net income, as net income includes charges for depreciation and amortization. 
 forms: (i) leasing commissions and legal costs, which represent the value associated with cost avoidance of acquiring in-place leases, such as lease commissions paid under terms generally experienced in the Company's markets; (ii) value of in-place leases, which represents the estimated loss of revenue and of costs incurred for the period required to lease the assumed vacant property to the occupancy level when purchased; and (iii) above or below-market value of in-place leases, which represents the difference between the contractual rents and market rents at the time of the acquisition, discounted for tenant credit risks. Leasing commissions and legal costs are recorded in deferred charges and other assets and are amortized over the remaining lease terms. The value of in-place leases is recorded in deferred charges and other assets and amortized over the remaining lease terms plus any below-market fixed rate renewal options. Above or below-market leases are classified in deferred charges and other assets or in other accrued liabilities, depending on whether the contractual terms are above or below-market, and the asset or liability is amortized to minimum rents over the remaining terms of the leases. The remaining lease terms of below-market leases may include certain below-market fixed-rate renewal periods. In considering whether or not a lessee will execute a below-market fixed-rate lease renewal option, the Company evaluates economic factors and certain qualitative factors at the time of acquisition such as tenant mix in the Center, the Company's relationship with the tenant and the availability of competing tenant space. 
 Remeasurement gains and losses are recognized when the Company becomes the primary beneficiary of an existing equity method investment that is a VIE to the extent that the fair value of the existing equity investment exceeds the carrying value of the investment, and remeasurement losses to the extent the carrying value of the investment exceeds the fair value. The fair value is determined based on a discounted cash flow model, with the significant unobservable inputs including discount rate, terminal capitalization rate and market rents.

 (1) The Company's ownership interest in this table reflects its direct or indirect legal ownership interest. Legal ownership may, at times, not equal the Company s economic interest in the listed entities because of various provisions in certain joint venture agreements regarding distributions of cash flow based on capital account balances, allocations of profits and losses and payments of preferred returns. As a result, the Company s actual economic interest (as distinct from its legal ownership interest) in certain of the properties could fluctuate from time to time and may not wholly align with its legal ownership interests.

 The above derivatives were valued with an aggregate fair value (Level 2 measurement) and were included in other assets (other accrued liabilities). The fair value of the Company's interest rate derivatives were determined using discounted cash flow analysis on the expected cash flows of the derivatives. This analysis reflects the contractual terms of the derivatives, including the period to maturity, and uses observable market-based inputs, including interest rate curves and implied volatilities. The Company incorporates credit valuation adjustments to appropriately reflect both its own nonperformance risk and the respective counterparty's nonperformance risk in the fair value measurements. 
 Although the Company has determined that the majority of the inputs used to value its derivatives falls within Level 2 of the fair value hierarchy, the credit valuation adjustments associated with its derivatives utilize Level 3 inputs, such as estimates of current credit spreads, to evaluate the likelihood of default by the Company and its counterparties. The Company has assessed the significance of the impact of the credit valuation adjustments on the overall valuation of its derivative positions and

 The consolidation of the joint venture required the Company to recognize the joint venture s identifiable assets and liabilities at fair value in the Company s consolidated financial statements, along with the fair value of the non-controlling interest. The fair value of the joint venture s assets and liabilities upon initial consolidation were measured using estimates of expected future cash flows and other valuation techniques. The fair value of the joint venture property was determined by using income and market or sales comparison valuation approaches which included, but are not limited to estimates of rental rates, comparable sales, revenue and expense growth rates, capitalization rates and discount rates. The allocation of fair value to assets was estimated by the market or sales comparison, cost and income approaches. Assumed debt was recorded at fair value based upon the present value of the expected future payments and current interest rates. Other acquired assets, including cash, and assumed liabilities were recorded at cost due to the short-term nature of the balances.

Multivariate Geometric Brownian Motion is a common assumption when modeling in financial markets, as it allows the modeled quantity (in this case, the stock price) to vary randomly from its current value and take any value greater than zero. The volatilities of the returns on the share price of the Company and the peer group REITs were estimated based on a look-back period. The expected growth rate of the stock prices over the "derived service period" is determined with consideration of the risk free rate as of the grant date.

The following description sets forth certain general terms and provisions of our Common Stock.

 Our Articles authorize us to issue up to 575,000,000 shares of capital stock, consisting of 500,000,000 shares of Common Stock, 15,000,000 shares of preferred stock, par value 0.01 per share Preferred Stock ), and 60,000,000 shares of excess stock, par value 0.01 per share Excess Stock ). 
 Common Stock 
 Voting Rights 
 Subject to the provisions of our Articles regarding Excess Stock, the holders of our Common Stock have full voting rights, one vote for each share held of record. 
 Dividend Rights 
 Subject to the provisions of our Articles regarding Excess Stock and the rights of any holders of Preferred Stock, holders of our Common Stock are entitled to receive the dividends authorized by our board of directors and declared by us out of funds legally available for this purpose. 
 Distributions on Liquidation 
 Upon our liquidation, dissolution or winding up and after payment in full of all amounts required to be paid to creditors and to the holders of any outstanding shares of any other class or series of stock having liquidation preferences, if any, the assets legally available for distribution to holders of our Common Stock will be distributed ratably among the holders of our Common Stock. 
 Other Rights 
 Holders of our Common Stock have no preemptive or other subscription or conversion rights. Our Common Stock is not subject to assessment or any sinking fund. 
 Stock Exchange Listing 
 Our shares of Common Stock are listed on the New York Stock Exchange under the symbol MAC . 
 Transfer Agent and Registrar 
 The transfer agent and registrar for our Common Stock is Computershare Trust Company, N.A. 
 Relationship to Preferred Stock 
 Under our Articles, we may issue shares of Preferred Stock from time to time, in one or more series as authorized by our board of directors. Prior to issuance of shares of each class or series, our board of directors is required by the MGCL to adopt resolutions and file Articles Supplementary with the State Department of Assessments and Taxation of Maryland, fixing for each class or series the designations, powers, preferences, conversion and other rights, voting powers, qualifications, limitations as to dividends, restrictions and terms and conditions of redemption. Our board of directors could authorize the issuance of shares of Preferred Stock with terms and conditions which could have the effect of delaying, deferring or preventing a change of control or other transaction in which holders of 
 1 

some, or a majority, of shares of our Common Stock might receive a premium for their shares over the then prevailing market price of those shares or which such holders might believe to be otherwise in their best interests. 
 We currently have 1,961,345 shares of Series D Cumulative Convertible Preferred Stock (the Series D Preferred Stock authorized under our Articles, none of which are outstanding. If issued, shares of the Series D Preferred Stock could be converted into shares of our Common Stock based on a formula set forth in the applicable Articles Supplementary. Rights of holders of the Series D Preferred Stock include dividend and liquidation preferences over the holders of shares of our Common Stock and, in some circumstances, voting rights preferences over the holders of shares of our Common Stock. 
 See Selected Provisions of Maryland Law and of Our Articles and Bylaws Power to Reclassify Shares of Our Stock for more information. 
 Restrictions on Transfer and Ownership 
 For us to qualify as a real estate investment trust REIT under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the Code ), both of the following conditions relating to ownership of shares must be satisfied 
 not more than 50 in value of our outstanding stock (after taking into account options to acquire stock) may be owned, directly or indirectly (after application of certain attribution rules), by five or fewer individuals (as defined under the Code to include some entities that would not ordinarily be considered individuals during the last half of a taxable year and 
 
 shares of our capital stock must be beneficially owned by 100 or more persons during at least 335 days of a taxable year of 12 months or during a proportionate part of a shorter taxable year. 
 Our Articles Restrict the Ownership and Transfer of Shares of Our Capital Stock 
 Subject to exceptions specified in our Articles, no stockholder may own, or be deemed to own by virtue of the attribution provisions of the Code, in excess of the lesser of 5 in value or in number of shares of our outstanding capital stock. The attribution provisions are complex and may cause stock owned directly or indirectly by a group of related individuals or entities to be deemed to be owned by one individual or entity. As a result, the acquisition of less than 5 in value or in number of shares of stock (or the acquisition of an interest in an entity which owns stock) by an individual or entity could cause that individual or entity (or another individual or entity) to be deemed to own in excess of 5 in value or in number of shares of our outstanding capital stock, and thus subject that stock to the ownership limit. Our board of directors, in its sole discretion (subject to certain limitations), may waive the ownership limit with respect to our stockholders, but is under no obligation to do so. As a condition of a waiver of the ownership limit, our board of directors may require opinions of counsel satisfactory to it or other conditions as it may direct, including an agreement from the applicant that the applicant will not act to threaten our REIT status. Our Articles exclude from the ownership limit some persons and their respective families and affiliates, but provides that no excluded participant may own (directly or indirectly) more than the excluded participant s percentage limitation, as described below under Issuance of Excess Stock. 
 Our Articles provide that any purported transfer or issuance of shares, or other event, will be null and void if it results in a prohibited event. The intended transferee or purported owner in a transaction that results in a prohibited event will not acquire, and will retain no rights to, or economic interest in, those shares of stock. For more information, see the section entitled Issuance of Excess Stock. 
 Issuance of Excess Stock 
 Our Articles provide that in the case of a prohibited event, the relevant shares of stock will automatically be exchanged for shares of Excess Stock, to the extent necessary to ensure that the purported transfer or other event does not result in a prohibited event. A prohibited event is a purported transfer of stock or other event that will, if effective, result in any of the following 
 a person owning (directly or indirectly) shares of our stock in excess of the ownership limit as determined in accordance with our Articles or owning (directly or indirectly) more than a specified percentage of our Common Stock as determined in accordance with our Articles (that person s percentage limitation 
 
 shares of our Common Stock and Preferred Stock being owned by fewer than 100 persons (determined without reference to any rules of attribution) 
 
 2 

our becoming closely held under Section 856(h) of the Code (determined without regard to Code Section 856(h)(2) and by deleting the words the last half of in the first sentence of Code Section 542(a)(2) in applying Code Section 856(h)) or 
 
 our disqualification as a REIT. 
 Outstanding shares of Excess Stock will be held in trust. The trustee of the trust will be appointed by us and will be independent of us, any purported record or beneficial transferee and any beneficiary of such trust (the beneficiary ). The beneficiary will be one or more charitable organizations selected by the trustee. 
 Our Articles further provide that shares of Excess Stock are entitled to the same dividends as the shares of stock exchanged for Excess Stock (the original shares ). The trustee, as record holder of the Excess Stock, is entitled to receive all dividends and distributions in respect of the Excess Stock as may be authorized by our board of directors and declared by us and will hold the dividends or distributions in trust for the benefit of the beneficiary. The trustee is also entitled to cast all votes that holders of the Excess Stock are entitled to cast. Shares of Excess Stock in the hands of the trustee will have the same voting rights as original shares. Upon our liquidation, dissolution or winding up, each share of Excess Stock will be entitled to receive ratably with each other share of stock of the same class or series as the original shares, the assets distributed to the holders of the class or series of stock. The trustee will distribute to the purported transferee the amounts received upon our liquidation, dissolution or winding up, but only up to the amount paid by the purported transferee, or the market price for the original shares on the date of the purported transfer, if no consideration was paid by the transferee, and subject to additional limitations and offsets set forth in our Articles. 
 If, after the purported transfer or other event resulting in an exchange of stock for shares of Excess Stock, dividends or distributions are paid with respect to the original shares, then the dividends or distributions will be paid to the trustee for the benefit of the beneficiary. While shares of Excess Stock are held in trust, Excess Stock may be transferred by the trustee only to a person whose ownership of the original shares will not result in a prohibited event. At the time of any permitted transfer, the shares of Excess Stock will be automatically exchanged for the same number of shares of the same type and class as the original shares. Our Articles contain provisions that prohibit the purported transferee of shares of Excess Stock from receiving in return for the transfer an amount that reflects any appreciation in the original shares during the period that the shares of Excess Stock were outstanding. Our Articles require any amount received by a purported transferee, in excess of the amount permitted to be received, to be paid to the beneficiary. 
 Our Articles further provide that we may purchase, for a period of 90 days during the time the shares of Excess Stock are held in trust, all or any portion of the Excess Stock at the lesser of the price paid for the stock by the purported transferee (or if no consideration was paid, the market price at the time of such transaction) or the market price of the relevant shares on the date we, or our designee, accept the offer to purchase the shares of Excess Stock. The 90-day period begins on the date of the prohibited transfer if the purported transferee gives notice to us of the transfer or, if no notice is given, the date our board of directors determines in good faith that a prohibited transfer has occurred. 
 These provisions contained in our Articles will not be automatically removed even if the REIT provisions of the Code are changed so as to no longer contain any ownership concentration limitation or if the ownership concentration limitation is increased. Amendments to our Articles generally require the affirmative vote of stockholders entitled to cast a majority of all the votes entitled to be cast on the matter. In addition to preserving our status as a REIT, the ownership limit may have the effect of precluding an acquisition of control of us without the approval of our board of directors. 
 Any certificates representing shares of our Common Stock and our Preferred Stock bear, or will bear, a legend referring to the restrictions described above. 
 All persons who own, directly or by virtue of the attribution provisions of the Code, more than 5 of our outstanding stock must file an affidavit with us containing the information specified in our Articles within 30 days after January 1 of each year. In addition, these and other significant stockholders are required, upon demand, to disclose to us in writing the information with respect to their direct, indirect and constructive ownership of shares of our capital stock that our board of directors deems necessary to comply with the provisions of the Code applicable to a REIT. 
 Selected Provisions of Maryland Law and of Our Articles and Bylaws 
 In addition to the ownership limit, certain provisions of our Articles, Bylaws and the MGCL may delay, defer or prevent a change of control or other transaction in which holders of some, or a majority, of shares of our Common Stock might receive a premium for their shares over the then prevailing market price of those shares or which such 
 3 

holders might believe to be otherwise in their best interests. The following paragraphs summarize a number of these provisions, as well as selected provisions of the MGCL. 
 Power to Reclassify Shares of Our Stock 
 Our Articles and the MGCL permit our board of directors, or any duly authorized committee thereof, to classify and reclassify any unissued shares of our capital stock by setting or changing in any one or more respects the preferences, conversion or other rights, voting powers, restrictions, limitations as to dividends and other distributions, qualifications or terms and conditions of redemption of the classified or reclassified shares of our capital stock. The terms of any stock classified or reclassified by our board of directors or a duly authorized committee thereof in accordance with our Articles will be set forth in articles supplementary filed with the State Department of Assessments and Taxation of Maryland prior to the issuance of any classified or reclassified stock. 
 Our Articles also authorize our board of directors to issue one or more classes or series of Common Stock or Preferred Stock and authorize the creation and issuance of rights entitling holders thereof to purchase from us shares of stock or other securities or property. 
 Advance Notice of Director Nominations and New Business Procedures for Special Meetings Requested by Stockholders 
 Our Articles and Bylaws provide that for any stockholder proposal to be presented in connection with an annual meeting or special meeting of our stockholders, including a proposal to nominate a director, the stockholder must have given timely written notice of the proposal to our secretary. The Bylaws provide that nominations to our board of directors and the proposal of other business to be considered by stockholders at an annual meeting of stockholders may be made only 
 pursuant to our notice of the meeting 
 
 by or at the direction of our board of directors 
 
 by any stockholder who is a stockholder of record at the record date set by our board of directors for the purpose of determining stockholders entitled to vote at the annual meeting, at the time such stockholder gives the notice required by our Bylaws and at the time of the annual meeting (and any postponement or adjournment thereof), who is entitled to vote at the meeting in the election of each individual so nominated or on the proposal of other business, as the case may be, and who has complied with the advance notice procedures and other applicable requirements, including minimum and maximum time periods, set forth in our Articles and Bylaws or 
 
 pursuant to the proxy access provisions of our Bylaws, which allow an eligible stockholder or a qualifying group of up to 20 stockholders, owning at least 3 of our outstanding shares of Common Stock continuously for at least three years, to nominate up to the greater of two directors or the largest whole number that does not exceed 20 of the number of directors then serving on our board of directors for inclusion in our proxy materials, subject to complying with the requirements contained in our Bylaws. 
 Our Bylaws also provide that only the business specified in our notice of meeting may be brought before a special meeting of stockholders. Nominations of persons for election to our board of directors at a special meeting of stockholders at which directors are to be elected may be made only 
 by or at the direction of our board of directors 
 
 by a stockholder who has requested that a special meeting be called for the purpose of electing directors in compliance with our Bylaws and who has supplied the information required by our Bylaws about each individual whom the stockholder proposes to nominate for election as a director or 
 
 provided that the special meeting has been called in accordance with our Bylaws for the purpose of electing directors, by any stockholder who is a stockholder of record at the record date set by our board of directors for the purpose of determining stockholders entitled to vote at the special meeting, at the time such stockholder gives the notice required by our Bylaws and at the time of the special meeting (and any postponement or adjournment thereof), who is entitled to vote at the meeting in the election of each individual so nominated and who has complied with the advance notice procedures and other applicable requirements, including minimum and maximum time periods, set forth in our Bylaws. 
 4 

Our Bylaws also contain special procedures applicable to a special meeting of stockholders that is called by the secretary to act on any matter that may properly be considered at a meeting of stockholders at the written request of stockholders entitled to cast not less than a majority of all the votes entitled to be cast on such matter at the meeting. 
 Exemptions for Our Original Founders from the Maryland Business Combination Act 
 Under the MGCL, business combinations between a Maryland corporation and an interested stockholder or an affiliate of an interested stockholder are prohibited for five years after the most recent date on which the interested stockholder becomes an interested stockholder. These business combinations include a merger, consolidation, share exchange, or, in circumstances specified in the statute, an asset transfer or issuance or reclassification of equity securities. An interested stockholder is defined as 
 any person who beneficially owns 10 or more of the voting power of the corporation s voting stock or 
 
 an affiliate or associate of the corporation who, at any time within the two-year period immediately prior to the date in question, was the beneficial owner, directly or indirectly, of 10 or more of the voting power of the then outstanding stock of the corporation. 
 After the five-year prohibition, any business combination between the Maryland corporation and an interested stockholder generally must be recommended by the board of directors of the corporation and approved by two super-majority stockholder votes, unless, among other conditions, the holders of the corporation s common stock receive a minimum price, as defined by the MGCL, for their shares and the consideration is received in cash or in the same form as previously paid by the interested stockholder for its shares. None of these provisions of the MGCL will apply, however, to business combinations that are approved or exempted by the board of directors of the corporation before the time that the interested stockholder becomes an interested stockholder. Furthermore, a person is not an interested stockholder if the transaction by which he or she would otherwise have become an interested stockholder is approved in advance by the board of directors. 
 As permitted by the MGCL, our Articles exempt from these provisions any business combination between us and our original founders and their respective affiliates or related persons. As a result, these persons may be able to enter into business combinations with us that may not be in the best interest of our stockholders without compliance with the super-majority vote requirements and the other provisions of the statute. 
 Non-Stockholder Constituencies 
 Under our Articles, for the purpose of determining our and our stockholders best interests with respect to a proposed business combination or other transaction involving a change of control of us, our board of directors must give due consideration to all relevant factors, including, without limitation, the interests of our employees, the economy, community and societal interests and our and our stockholders long-term as well as short-term interests, including the possibility that these interests may be best served by our continued independence. 
 Control Share Acquisitions 
 The MGCL provides that the acquirer of certain levels of voting power in electing directors of a Maryland corporation (one-tenth or more, but less than one-third, one-third or more but less than a majority, and a majority or more) is not entitled to vote the shares in excess of the applicable threshold unless voting rights for the shares are approved at a meeting by holders of two-thirds of the votes entitled to be cast on the matter, excluding shares of stock owned by the acquiror or by an officer or director of the corporation who is an employee of the corporation, or unless the acquisition of the shares has been specifically or generally approved or exempted from the statute by a provision in the corporation s charter or bylaws adopted before the acquisition of the shares. 
 Our Articles exempt from these provisions voting rights of shares owned or acquired by our original founders and their respective affiliates and related persons. Our Bylaws also contain a provision exempting from this statute any acquisition by any person of shares of our stock. There can be no assurance that such provision will not be amended or eliminated at any time in the future. 
 Subtitle 8 
 Our board of directors has approved a resolution prohibiting us from unilaterally electing to be subject to the provisions of Sections 3-803, 3-804 and 3-805 of Subtitle 8 of Title 3 of the MGCL Subtitle 8 ). Subtitle 8 permits a Maryland corporation with a class of equity securities registered under the Exchange Act and at least three independent directors to elect, without any stockholder vote or other action and notwithstanding any contrary provision in its charter or bylaws, to be subject to any or all of the following five provisions 
 5 

Section 3-803 requiring classification of the board of directors into three classes 
 
 Section 3-804(a) requiring that stockholders may remove any director by the affirmative vote of at least two-thirds of all the votes entitled to be cast by the stockholders generally in the election of directors 
 
 Section 3-804(b) requiring that the number of directors be fixed only by vote of the board of directors 
 
 Section 3-804(c) requiring that any vacancy on the board of directors be filled only by the affirmative vote of a majority of the remaining directors for the remainder of the full term of the class of directors in which the vacancy occurred and until a successor is elected and qualifies and 
 
 Section 3-805 requiring that a special meeting of stockholders may be called only upon the written request of stockholders entitled to cast at least a majority of all the votes entitled to be cast at the meeting. 
 Following our board of director s resolution, we supplemented our Articles to provide that we are prohibited from electing to be subject to any of the foregoing provisions, and such prohibition may not be repealed unless a proposal to repeal such prohibition with respect to any such section is approved by the affirmative vote of a majority of the votes cast on the matter by stockholders entitled to vote generally in the election of directors. 
 Amendment to Our Articles and Bylaws 
 Except for those amendments permitted to be made without stockholder approval under the MGCL or by specific provision in our Articles, amendments to our Articles must be declared advisable by our board of directors and approved by the affirmative vote of stockholders entitled to cast a majority of all the votes entitled to be cast on the matter. Any amendment to our Articles related to the (i) removal of directors, (ii) vote required to approve any extraordinary transaction (i.e. , merger, share exchange, consolidation, conversion and sale of all or substantially all of our assets) or (iii) amendment provision in our Articles relating to these matters requires the affirmative vote of stockholders entitled to cast two-thirds of all the votes entitled to be cast on the matter. 
 Our Bylaws provide that, with the exception of provisions in our Bylaws relating to (i) the indemnification of our present and former directors and officers and (ii) the amendment of our Bylaws, which provisions may not be amended without the approval of our board of directors, our Bylaws may be altered or repealed or new bylaw provisions may be adopted, in each case to the extent permitted by, and consistent with, our Articles, our Bylaws and applicable law, by the affirmative vote of a majority of all the votes entitled to be cast on the matter pursuant to a proposal submitted for approval at a duly called annual meeting or special meeting of stockholders. Our board of directors may also adopt, alter or repeal any provision of our Bylaws or make new Bylaws. 
 Our Board of Directors Election Removal 
 Our Articles provide that the number of directors on our board of directors is fixed pursuant to our Bylaws, but may not be fewer than the minimum required by the MGCL, which is one. Our Bylaws provide that our board of directors must consist of not less than one and not more than twelve directors. 
 
 Our Articles and Bylaws provide that directors are required to be elected by the affirmative vote of a majority of all the votes cast on the matter at a meeting at which a quorum is present. 
 
 Subject to the rights of holders of any series of Preferred Stock, our Articles provide that a director may be removed only for cause and only by the affirmative vote of the holders of shares entitled to cast at least two-thirds of the votes entitled to be cast generally in the election of directors. 
 
 Our Dissolution 
 Our dissolution must be approved by our board of directors and by the affirmative vote of not less than a majority of all of the votes entitled to be cast on the matter. 
 Supermajority Vote for Extraordinary Corporate Actions 
 Under the MGCL, a Maryland corporation generally cannot dissolve, amend its charter, merge, convert into another entity, sell all or substantially all of its assets, or engage in a share exchange or in a similar extraordinary corporate action unless approved by the corporation s board of directors and the affirmative vote of holders of at least two-thirds of the votes entitled to be cast on the matter, unless a lesser percentage (but not less than a majority of all of the votes entitled to be cast on the matter) is set forth in the corporation s charter. Except for Article Seventh and Article Ninth of our Articles, which provide that amendments to the Articles (except for certain instances) and 
 6 

dissolution must be approved by the vote of holders of a majority of our outstanding shares of Common Stock entitled to vote on the matter, our Articles do not provide for a lesser percentage in these situations. 
 Exclusive Forum 
 Our Bylaws provide that, unless our board of directors agrees otherwise, (i) any derivative action or proceeding, (ii) any action asserting a claim of breach of any duty owed by any of our directors, officers or other employees to us or our stockholders, (iii) any action asserting a claim against us or any of our directors, officers or other employees pursuant to the MGCL, or our Articles or Bylaws and (iv) claims governed by the internal affairs doctrine must be brought in the Circuit Court for Baltimore City, Maryland (or if that court does not have jurisdiction, the United States District Court for the District of Maryland, Baltimore Division).

THE MACERICH COMPANY 
 ELIGIBLE DIRECTORS 
 DEFERRED COMPENSATION PHANTOM STOCK PLAN 
 (As Amended and Restated Effective as of January 1, 2023) 
 ARTICLE I TITLE, PURPOSE AND AUTHORIZED SHARES 
 This Plan shall be known as The Macerich Company Eligible Directors Deferred Compensation Phantom Stock Plan. The purpose of this Plan is to attract, motivate and retain experienced and knowledgeable directors of The Macerich Company by permitting them to defer compensation and affording them the opportunity to link that compensation to an equity interest in the Company. The total number of shares of Common Stock that may be delivered pursuant to awards under this Plan is 650,000, subject to adjustments contemplated by Section 5.6. This version of this Plan applies to Compensation and or Special Compensation payable to an Eligible Director for service on the Board or any Board committee on or after January 1, 2023. The Plan was amended and restated to change the formula for calculating the number of Stock Units to credit to an Eligible Director s Current Stock Unit Account and Current Dividend Equivalent Stock Account effective on and after January 1, 2023. Such amendment was intended as a change to the method of calculating allocations to an investment option and for calculating earnings, and is not intended to constitute a material modification within the meaning of Code Section 409A. For the provisions applicable to Compensation and or Special Compensation payable to an Eligible Director for service prior to January 1, 2023, see the version of this Plan in effect as of the applicable date. 
 ARTICLE II DEFINITIONS 
 Whenever the following terms are used in this Plan they shall have the meaning specified below unless the context clearly indicates to the contrary 
 2.1 Account shall mean one or more of an Eligible Director s Cash Account(s), Stock Unit Account(s), Dividend Equivalent Cash Account(s) and Dividend Equivalent Stock Account(s). Each Account includes, to the extent applicable, any Distribution Subaccounts. 
 2.2 Additional Compensation with respect to a particular calendar year shall mean the difference (if any) between (i) the amount of an Eligible Director s Compensation for such calendar year taken into account on the Award Date, and (ii) the amount of Compensation the Eligible Director would actually have been paid for such calendar year, solely to the extent that such difference in the Eligible Director s Compensation for such calendar year is attributable to (1) changes in the Company s compensation policy for non-employee directors that are approved by the Board of Directors and take effect during or prior to such calendar year and or (2) changes in the Eligible Director s annual retainer levels as a result of such Eligible Director s becoming or ceasing to be a member of a Board committee or the chairperson or presiding lead director of the Board or the chairperson of a Board committee. For purposes of clarity, Additional Compensation may be a negative number. Notwithstanding any other provision herein, an amount of Compensation that is treated as Additional Compensation hereunder shall not in any event be treated as Special Compensation. 
 1 

2.3 Additional Compensation Approval Date shall mean, as applicable, the date on which the Board of Directors approves the change in the Company s compensation policy for non-employee directors that gives rise to the Additional Compensation or, in the case of an Eligible Director s becoming or ceasing to be a member of a Board committee or the chairperson or presiding lead director of the Board or the chairperson of a Board committee, the date on which the Board of Directors approves such change in the Eligible Director s status (or, if later, the effective date of such change). 
 2.4 Award Date with reference to elections under Section 4.2 shall mean the January 1 that next follows the date of an Eligible Director s election made pursuant to Section 4.2. Award Date with reference to elections under Section 4.1 shall mean the date next following the date that the Eligible Director files his or her election under Section 4.1.

Notwithstanding the foregoing, on the annual or multiple-year deferral election form that a Participant files in accordance with the provisions of Article IV of the Plan for any Plan Year or series of two or three Plan Years beginning on or after January 1, 2005, an Eligible Director may elect to have the amounts credited to his or her Accounts with respect to such annual or multiple-year deferral period distributed to him or her on any one of the following optional distribution dates (A) January 1 following 
 12 

the Eligible Director s termination of service, (B) January 1 of a specified year designated by the Eligible Director, which shall be no earlier than 3 years after the Plan Year to which the deferral relates, or (C) the earlier to occur of (A) or (B). 
 (ii) The benefits payable under this Plan shall be distributed to the Eligible Director (or, in the event of his or her death, the Eligible Director s Beneficiary) in a lump sum or, if elected by the Eligible Director in writing on the annual or multiple-year deferral election form that a Participant files in accordance with the provisions of Article IV of the Plan for a Plan Year beginning on or after January 1, 2005, in annual installments for up to 10 years. 
 (iii) An Eligible Director shall be permitted to make a different election with respect to each annual or multiple-year deferral period as to the time and manner in which his or her benefits shall be distributed. For each Eligible Director who makes one or more distribution elections pursuant to this Section 5.5(a), each of his or her Accounts shall be divided into two or more Distribution Subaccounts as necessary to separately account for deferrals that are payable at different times and or in different manners. For purposes of calculating installments, the Eligible Director s vested Accounts (and Distribution Subaccounts if applicable) will be valued as of December 31 of each year, and divided by the number of remaining installments to determine the amount of the installment to be paid in the following year. Subsequent installments will be adjusted accordingly for the next calendar year, according to procedures established by the Committee. Such installment payments shall commence as of the date benefits become distributable under this Section 5.5(a). 
 (iv) Notwithstanding any other provision of this Section 5.5, in the event that an Eligible Director becomes entitled to a credit of Stock Units pursuant to Section 5.2(a)(2) and such Stock Units would otherwise have been payable pursuant to this Section 5.5 prior to the date such Units are credited to the Eligible Director s Current Stock Unit Account, such Units shall be paid not later than thirty (30) days following the date such Units are credited pursuant to Section 5.2(a)(2). 
 (b) Change in Time or Manner of Distribution . Notwithstanding subsection (a), an Eligible Director may elect to further defer the commencement of any distribution to be made, or change the manner of any distribution election from a lump sum to annual installments made, with respect to benefits payable under this Plan by filing a new written election with the Committee on a form approved by the Committee provided, however, that (A) no such election shall be effective until one year after the date on which the election is made, (B) the first payment with respect to which such election is made must be deferred for a period of not less than five years from the date such payment would otherwise have been made or payments would have commenced, and (C) any election related to a payment that commences on any date other than the date of the Eligible Director s termination of service shall only be effective if it is made at least twelve months prior to the date of the first scheduled payment under such election. 
 (c) Effect of Change in Control Event . Notwithstanding subsections (a) and (b), if a Change in Control Event and a termination of service occurs, the vested portions of an Eligible Director s Accounts shall be distributed immediately in a lump sum. 
 (d) Distribution for Unforeseeable Emergencies . An Eligible Director (which for purposes of this Section 5.5(d) includes former Eligible Directors) may request a distribution for an Unforeseeable Emergency without penalty of an amount not greater than the value of the Eligible Director s vested benefit under this Plan. Such distribution for an Unforeseeable Emergency shall be subject to approval by the Committee in its sole 
 13 

discretion and may be made only to the extent necessary to satisfy such Unforeseeable Emergency plus amounts necessary to pay taxes reasonably anticipated as a result of the distribution, after taking into account the extent to which such hardship is or may be relieved (1) through reimbursement or compensation by insurance or otherwise or (2) by liquidation of the Eligible Director s assets, to the extent the liquidation of such assets would not itself cause severe financial hardship. Amounts distributed pursuant to this Section 5.5(d) shall be distributed only from vested amounts credited to his or her Accounts and shall be distributed first from an Eligible Director s Cash and Dividend Equivalent Cash Accounts, and, to the extent the balance of the Participant s Cash and Dividend Equivalent Cash Accounts is not sufficient to satisfy the severe financial hardship, next as a distribution of shares of the Company s Common Stock with a Fair Market Value equal to such deficiency from the vested portion of such Eligible Director s Stock Unit and Dividend Equivalent Stock Accounts. 
 (e) Form of Distribution . Stock Units credited to an Eligible Director s Stock Unit Account and Dividend Equivalent Stock Account shall be distributed in an equivalent whole number of shares of the Company s Common Stock. Fractions shall be disregarded. Amounts credited to an Eligible Director s Cash Account and vested in the Eligible Director s Dividend Equivalent Cash Account shall be distributed in cash. 
 (f) Small Benefit Exception . Notwithstanding any other provision of this Plan to the contrary, if at the time any partial or installment distribution is to be made to an Eligible Director hereunder the total vested balance remaining in the Eligible Director s Current Cash Account and Current Dividend Equivalent Cash Account is less than 2,000 and the number of vested Units credited to the Eligible Director s Current Stock Unit Account of Current Dividend Equivalent Stock Account is less than 100, then all such remaining vested balances and vested Units shall be distributed in a lump sum on the date scheduled for such partial or installment distribution. This provision is intended to comply with Treasury Regulations Section 1.409A-2(b)(2)(iii) and shall be interpreted accordingly. 
 (g) Distributions to Specified Employees . Notwithstanding any other provision of this Plan to the contrary, and solely to the extent that a delay in payment is required in order to avoid the imposition of any tax under Section 409A of the Code, if an Eligible Director is a specified employee for purposes of Section 409A(a)(2)(B) of the Code, and any amounts to be distributed under this Agreement are considered to be non-qualified deferred compensation payable in connection with the Eligible Director s separation from service with the Company for purposes of Section 409A of the Code, which otherwise would be payable at any time during the six-month period immediately following such separation from service, then such amounts shall not be paid prior to, and shall instead be payable in a lump sum within ten (10) business days following, the expiration of such six-month period. 
 5.6 Adjustments in Case of Changes in Common Stock . If any stock dividend, stock split, recapitalization, merger, consolidation, combination or exchange of shares, sale of all or substantially all of the assets of the Company, split-up, split-off, spin-off, liquidation or similar change in capitalization or any similar extraordinary dividend distribution to holders of the Company s Common Stock (other than Cash or Combination Dividends) shall occur, proportionate and equitable adjustments shall be made in the number and type of shares of Common Stock or other property reserved and of Units (both credited and vested) under this Plan. 
 5.7 Company s Right to Withhold . The Company shall satisfy any state or federal income tax withholding obligation arising upon distribution of an Eligible Director s 
 14 

accounts by reducing the number of shares of Common Stock otherwise deliverable to the Eligible Director by the appropriate number of shares, valued at the Fair Market Value of a share of Common Stock on the date of distribution, required to satisfy such tax withholding obligation. If the Company, for any reason, cannot satisfy the withholding obligation in accordance with the preceding sentence, the Eligible Director shall pay or provide for payment in cash of the amount of any taxes which the Company may be required to withhold with respect to the benefits hereunder. 
 5.8 Stockholder Approval . This Plan, and all the elections, actions and accruals with respect to Stock Units and Dividend Equivalents made prior to stockholder approval, was originally approved by the stockholders of the Company at their 1995 annual meeting. Amendments to the Plan have been approved by the Board of Directors pursuant to Article VII.

 (2) An Eligible Director may change the manner of any distribution election from a lump sum to annual installments (or vice versa) made with respect to amounts credited under his or her Accounts by filing a written election with the Committee on a form provided by the Committee provided, however, that no such election shall be effective

 A-2 

the hardship and only from vested amounts credited to his or her Accounts.
