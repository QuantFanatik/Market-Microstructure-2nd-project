SPECIAL NOTE REGARDING FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS 
 
 This Report, including, without limitation, statements under the heading Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, includes forward-looking statements within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. These forward-looking statements can be identified by the use of forward-looking terminology, including the words believes, estimates, anticipates, expects, intends, plans, may, might, will, potential, projects, predicts, continue, or should, or, in each case, their negative or other variations or comparable terminology. There can be no assurance that actual results will not materially differ from expectations. These statements are based on management s current expectations, but actual results may differ materially due to various factors, including, but not limited to: 

expectations regarding the Company s strategies and future financial performance, including the Company s future business plans or objectives, prospective performance and commercial opportunities and competitors, services, pricing, marketing plans, operating expenses, market trends, revenues, liquidity, cash flows and uses of cash, capital expenditures, and the Company s ability to invest in growth initiatives; 

the effects of general economic conditions, including inflation, interest rates levels, and availability of construction materials for our development projects; 

the outcome of any legal proceedings that may be instituted against the Company or its predecessors in connection with the Business Combination and related transactions; 

our limited operating history makes it difficult to predict future revenues and operating results; 

financial projections may not prove to be reflective of actual financial results; 

the ability to recognize the anticipated benefits of the Business Combination, which may be affected by, among other things, competition, and the ability of the combined business to grow and manage growth profitably; 

changes in applicable laws or regulations; 

the possibility that the Company may be adversely affected by other economic, business, and/or competitive factors; 

our financial performance; and 

other risk factors included under "Risk Factors" in this Report. 

The forward-looking statements contained in this Report are based on our current expectations and beliefs concerning future developments and their potential effects on us. Future developments affecting us may not be those that we have anticipated. These forward-looking statements involve a number of risks, uncertainties (some of which are beyond our control) and other assumptions that may cause actual results or performance to be materially different from those expressed or implied by these forward-looking statements. These risks and uncertainties include, but are not limited to, those factors described under the heading Risk Factors. Should one or more of these risks or uncertainties materialize, or should any of our assumptions prove incorrect, actual results may vary in material respects from those projected in these forward-looking statements. We undertake no obligation to update or revise any forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise, except as may be required under applicable securities laws. These risks and others described under Risk Factors may not be exhaustive. 
 
 By their nature, forward-looking statements involve risks and uncertainties because they relate to events and depend on circumstances that may or may not occur in the future. We caution you that forward-looking statements are not guarantees of future performance and that our actual results of operations, financial condition and liquidity, and developments in the industry in which we operate may differ materially from those made in or suggested by the forward-looking statements contained in this Report. In addition, even if our results or operations, financial condition and liquidity, and developments in the industry in which we operate are consistent with the forward-looking statements contained in this Report, those results or developments may not be indicative of results or developments in subsequent periods.

SUMMARY OF RISK FACTORS 
 
 You should read this summary together with the more detailed description of each risk factor contained in Item 1A Risk Factors in this Report and the other reports and documents filed or furnished by us with the SEC for a more detailed discussion of the principal risks (as well as certain other risks) that you should carefully consider before deciding to invest in our securities. Some of the factors that could materially and adversely affect our financial condition and the market price of shares of our securities or our prospects include, but are not limited to, the following. 
 
 Risks Relating to Our Business 

We have a limited operating history and could experience significant operating losses in the future. 

Our business, and the aviation industry generally, are subject to downturns in the economy and disruption and volatility in the financial markets. 

Our growth will depend in part upon our ability to enter into new ground leases at airports, and we may be unsuccessful in identifying and consummating attractive new ground leases or taking advantage of other investment opportunities, which would impede our growth and materially and adversely affect our business and results of operation. 

Our ability to meet our obligations under our ground leases and our indebtedness is dependent on our ability to enter into and collect lease payments from tenants. 

We have a substantial amount of indebtedness outstanding, which may expose us to the risk of default under our debt obligations, restrict our operations and our ability to grow our business and revenues. 

Secured debt obligations, including those under the Series 2021 PABs (as defined herein), expose us to the possibility of foreclosure, which could result in the loss of our investment in a property or group of properties subject to mortgage debt. 

Our growth will depend on our access to external sources of capital, and our ability to obtain financing or access capital markets may be limited. 

Increases in market interest rates or unavailability of additional indebtedness may make it difficult for us to finance or refinance our debt, which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations and growth prospects. 

An epidemic, pandemic, or contagious disease, including the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations. 

We may be required to record impairment charges to future earnings if our long-lived assets become impaired. 

The industry in which we operate is subject to significant competition and our failure to effectively compete could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations. 

The growth and success of our business is subject to our ability to market and to attract and retain tenants. 

Our rental income is initially concentrated within a small number of tenants and the loss of or default by one or more significant tenants could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations. 

Our capital projects are subject to uncertainties, including the possibility of delays, cost overruns, and inflation, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and market reputation. 

Failure to adequately maintain our HBS hangar campuses or the integrity of our fuel supplies may have a material adverse impact on the revenue or market share of one or more of our HBS hangar campuses resulting in a decline in operations of the business. 

The growth and success of our business is dependent on the continued service of certain key employees and the ability to recruit and retain new employees. 

Our management team has no prior experience operating a public company, and we cannot assure you that the past experience of our senior management team will be sufficient to successfully operate as a public company. 

If we fail to maintain effective internal control over financial reporting, we may not be able to accurately report our financial results, which may adversely affect investor confidence in the Company and, as a result, the value of our common stock. 

We conduct substantially all of our operations under ground leases, which grant significant rights to airport authorities as our direct or ultimate landlord.

Table of Contents 

Risks Relating to Tax 

Our only principal asset is our interest in Sky, and accordingly we are dependent on distributions from Sky to pay dividends, taxes, other expenses, and make any payments required to be made under the Tax Receivable Agreement. 

In certain cases, payments under the Tax Receivable Agreement may (i) exceed any actual tax benefits the Tax Group realizes or (ii) be accelerated. 

Risks Relating to Our Common Stock and Warrants 

The market price of Class A Common Stock and Public Warrants has been and may continue to be extremely volatile, which could cause purchasers of our securities to incur substantial losses. 

The public float of our Class A Common Stock is very illiquid, and there may not be sufficient demand in the marketplace to absorb the sale of newly registered shares. 

We cannot predict the impact our dual class structure may have on the stock price of Class A Common Stock. 

The outstanding Warrants are exercisable for shares of Class A Common Stock and common units in Sky may be redeemed for Class A Common Stock upon expiration of the applicable lock-up period. The exercise of these outstanding Warrants will increase the number of shares eligible for future resale in the public market and result in dilution to our stockholders. 

You may experience future dilution as a result of future equity offerings.

ITEM 1. 
 BUSINESS 

Business Combination 
 
 On January 25, 2022 (the Closing Date ), we completed the Business Combination pursuant to the Equity Purchase Agreement between us and Sky. Each of the Existing Sky Equityholders separately entered into an Equityholders Voting and Support Agreement irrevocably agreeing to vote in favor of the Business Combination set forth in the Equity Purchase Agreement. As contemplated by the Equity Purchase Agreement, the following occurred on the Closing Date: (a) YAC changed its name to Sky Harbour Group Corporation (b) all outstanding shares of Sponsor Stock held by the Sponsor were converted into shares of Class A Common Stock of the Company; (c) Sky restructured its capitalization, issued to the Company 14,937,581 Sky Common Units, which was equal to the number of outstanding shares of Class A Common Stock immediately after giving effect to the Business Combination (taking into account the redemption of Class A Common Stock and the Class A Common Stock issued under the BOC PIPE investment (the BOC PIPE )), reclassified the existing Sky Common Units (other than the Sky Incentive Units), existing Sky Series A Preferred Units and the existing Sky Series B Preferred Units into Sky Common Units; (d) certain adjustments to the number of Sky Incentive Units were effected to reflect the new capital structure; (e) the Company was appointed as the managing member of Sky; (f) the Sky Common Units issued to BOC YAC in respect of its Series B Preferred Units were converted into 5,500,000 shares of Class A Common Stock; (g) holders of Sky Common Units received one share of Class B Common Stock for each Sky Common Unit, and as consideration for the issuance of 14,937,581 Sky Common Units by Sky to the Company, YAC contributed to Sky the net amount held in the YAC trust account after redemptions and taking into account the BOC PIPE and the amount of various transaction costs; and (h) each YAC Warrant that was issued and outstanding immediately prior to the closing became a Warrant (the transactions referred to in clauses (a) through (h), collectively, the Business Combination ). 
 
 As a result of the Business Combination, the Company is organized as an Up-C structure in which substantially all of the operating assets of Sky s business are held by Sky. The Company s only assets are its equity interests in Sky. 
 
 As of January 26, 2022, the Class A Common Stock and Warrants of the Company began trading on the New York Stock Exchange American LLC (the NYSE American as SKYH and SKYH WS, respectively. The disclosure in this section gives effect to the Business Combination and includes the operations of Sky prior to the Business Combination. 
 
 Overview 
 
 We are an aviation infrastructure development company building the first nationwide network of Home-Basing Solutions HBS hangar campuses for business aircraft. We develop, lease and manage general aviation hangars across the United States, targeting airfields in markets with significant aircraft populations and high hangar demand. Our HBS hangar campuses feature exclusive private hangars and a full suite of dedicated services specifically optimized for home-based, versus transient, aircraft. 
 
 The physical footprint of the U.S. business aviation fleet grew by almost 28 million square feet in the ten years preceding the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic, with hangar supply lagging dramatically, especially in key growth markets. As the fleet of private jets in the United States continues to grow, with recent new aircraft deliveries exceeding retirements, demand for hangar space is at a premium in part because new jets require more square footage of hangar space and the pace of new hangar construction has lagged behind the demand. The cumulative square footage of the business aircraft fleet in the United States increased 50 between 2010 and 2021. Moreover, over that same period, there was an 81 increase in the square footage of larger private jets those with greater than a 24-foot tail height. A recent study conducted by a business aircraft manufacturer forecasted that business aircraft will only continue to grow in the next ten years, with up to 8,500 new business jet deliveries worth almost 275 billion expected to be delivered between 2023 and 2032, further supported by data from the major business aviation manufacturers that suggest the current order backlog for new business aviation aircraft is almost 47 billion. 
 
 These larger footprint aircraft do not fit in much of the existing hangar infrastructure and impose stacking challenges and constraints in the traditional shared or community hangars operated by fixed-base operators FBO ). The addition of winglets (the vertical extensions on aircraft wingtips) on most modern business jets inhibits wing-over-wing storage. Aircraft hangars are in high demand and short supply, with some airports compiling waiting lists that can exceed several years. 
 
 We believe our scalable, real estate-centric business model is uniquely optimized to capture this market opportunity and address the increased imbalance between the supply and demand for private jet storage. We intend to capitalize on the existing hangar supply constraints at major U.S. airports by targeting high-end tenants in markets where there is a shortage of private and FBO hangar space, or where such hangars are or are becoming obsolete. 
 
 We realize economies of scale in construction through a proprietary prototype hangar design replicated at HBS hangar campuses across the United States. This allows for centralized procurement, straightforward permitting processes, efficient development processes, and the best hangar in business aviation. Unlike a service company, our revenues are mostly derived from long-term rental agreements, offering stability and forward visibility of revenues and cash flows. This allows the Company to fund its development through the public bond market, providing capital efficiency and mitigating refinance risk.

Table of Contents 

In contrast with community hangars and other facilities provided by FBOs, the HBS hangar campuses we develop provide the following features and services: 

private hangar space for exclusive use of the tenant; 

adjoining configurable lounge and office suites; 

line crews and services dedicated exclusively to tenants; 

climate control to mitigate condensation and associated corrosion; 

features to support in-hangar aircraft maintenance; 

no-foam fire suppression; and 

customized software to provide security, control access and monitor hangar space. 

We use a standard set of proprietary prototype hangar designs, which are intended to deliver high-quality business aviation facilities, lower construction costs, minimize development risk, expedite permit issuance, and facilitate the implementation of refinements across its portfolio. Hangar features include: 

the ability to accommodate heavy business jets in single configuration, medium jets in twin or triplet configuration, or light jets in multi-configuration; 

compliance with National Fire Protection Association NFPA 409 Group III fire code, eliminating foam fire protection systems, resulting in lower construction costs and operating expenses, as well as eliminating accidental foam discharges and the resultant negative effects on aircraft maintenance and resale value; 

high-voltage capability, industrial drainage and impervious floors that support in-hangar maintenance and inspections; and 

control through smartphone application. 

Our product strategy aims to attract tenants with exclusive access to their aircraft, minimize the risk of damage to aircraft, provide increased access, security and control, facilitate maintenance, and improve pre-flight and post-flight convenience. We believe that with no transient traffic, our HBS hangar campuses offer a shorter time to wheels-up, even during periods of peak traffic. 
 
 We believe demand for HBS services will be driven broadly by the growing size of the business aviation fleet in the United States and the delivery of larger aircraft with taller tail heights. The discovery by first-time flyers in the convenience, control and comfort of general aviation has caused a shift in consumer behavior which we believe will also support increasing demand for HBS services. 
 
 While private aircraft use generally was not affected to the extent of commercial aviation, and some private aircraft clients may continue to use that mode of aviation following the pandemic, preferences for air travel and specifically general aviation are unknown and may change following COVID-19. See Risk Factors An epidemic, pandemic or contagious disease, including the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations." 
 
 Tax Exempt Senior Bond Issuance 
 
 On September 14, 2021, Sky s subsidiary, Sky Harbour Capital LLC SHC ), closed a 166.3 million financing through the sale of Series 2021 private activity tax-exempt senior bonds through a municipal conduit issuer, Public Finance Authority (Wisconsin) (the Series 2021 PABs ). See Management s Discussion Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Liquidity and Capital Resources Private Activity Bonds for more information regarding the Series 2021 PABS. The use of proceeds from this issuance, together with proceeds from the sale of the 55.0 million of Sky Series B Preferred Units to BOC YAC, were used, in part, to fund a construction escrow account for Sky s development program at five airports consisting of existing and new hangars in various phases of development and construction and to repay all existing indebtedness of Sky.

Deer Valley Site 
 
 The Airport. DVT is a medium sized, predominantly business and general aviation airport that is owned and operated by the City of Phoenix. DVT is located on 914 acres within Phoenix s northern limits, approximately 20 miles north of downtown and approximately 17 miles north of Phoenix Sky Harbor International Airport PHX ). DVT serves to relieve general aviation air traffic from PHX and is a convenient alternative to the larger and more congested airport. This convenience has led DVT to become one of the busiest general aviation airports in the country, ranking second in the FAA s Top 10 Busiest General Aviation Airports, as of 2017. The airport is also home to several flight schools. No commercial passenger service operations are available; however, air taxi service is available. 
 
 DVT has two parallel runways. The airport offers a complete range of services including fueling, avionics repair, maintenance, parts, flight training, new and used aircraft sales, aircraft rentals, a pilot shop, and a restaurant. The landside facilities at DVT include the terminal building, an FBO, flight schools, fueling facilities, major utilities, and support facilities. 
 
 Based on data from FAA OPSNET, between 2018 and 2019, DVT experienced a 10.0 increase in overall operations. The effects of the COVID-19 pandemic can be seen in the change from 2019 to 2020 as total operations at DVT decreased 12.0 , and the effects of the pandemic continued to be evident in the change from 2020 to 2021, as total operations at DVT decreased a further 32.4 . FAA TAF forward looking data forecasts a rebound in total operations beginning in 2022 and increasing each year thereafter, including increases of 18.9 , 18.1 for 2022 and 2023, respectively. 
 
 Currently, the only aircraft hangar rental providers at DVT are the DVT Airport Authority and an FBO.

Addison Airport Site 
 
 The Airport. ADS is owned and operated by the Town of Addison. The airport serves the Dallas/Fort Worth Metroplex market and is in close proximity to the residential and business districts where aircraft owners and operators live and work, located only nine miles north of the central business district of Dallas. ADS does not cater to commercial flights, making it preferable for basing business aircraft as it provides for the quickest time-to-wheels-up in the Dallas area. According to its website, ADS is home to more than 650 based aircraft. 
 
 Facilities at ADS include a 7,203 foot runway equipped with high-intensity lighting and a full length parallel taxiway. Operations are supported by Instrument Landing System (ILS) and RNAV (GPS) instrument approaches. The airport offers an FAA control tower, 24-hour U.S. Customs services for international arrivals, no landing fees, and over 70 businesses including maintenance providers, flight schools, and various other aviation-related service providers. According to the Texas Department of Transportation, as of 2018 the airport contributes over 1,000 on-airport jobs to the Town of Addison. 
 
 Between 2018 and 2019, ADS experienced a 6.1 increase in overall operations. The effects of the COVID-19 pandemic can be seen in the change from 2019 to 2020 as total operations at ADS decreased 15.9 . Operations at ADS rebounded from 2020 to 2021, as the airport experienced a 22.8 increase in total operations. FAA TAF forward looking data forecasts a continued rebound in total operations beginning in 2022 and increasing each year thereafter, including increases of 1.1 . 4.8 , and 3.7 for 2022, 2023, and 2024, respectively. 
 
 Aircraft hangar rental providers currently on the airport consist of three FBOs. Additionally, multiple smaller private hangars exist on the airport, primarily owned by operators or for flight schools and other airport businesses. 
 
 The existing hangar facilities at ADS are overcapacity and predominantly older with low door heights, which creates little opportunity for attracting newer larger private jet aircraft to the market. Though a new FBO brought additional community hangar square footage to the airport, the combination of older current facilities, lack of private hangar space on the airport, increased wealth migration to the north side of Dallas, and substantial popularity of the airport make for an attractive target for our private and exclusive Home-Basing solution.

Addison Site Facilities. We obtained lease rights to approximately six acres on the northeast side of the primary runway. As part of our development plan, the existing facilities on the site, including a terminal, ramp and automobile parking, will be demolished. We anticipate subsequently developing six hangars with adjoining office and support space constituting approximately 105,000 square feet. Anticipated occupancy for the ADS site is in the third calendar quarter of 2024. In January 2023, we amended our existing ground lease agreement with the Town of Addison, TX to include additional parcels of land that will effectively double the land available for development at our ADS HBS hangar campus project.

Customers, Sales and Marketing 
 
 We seek to maximize hangar rental charges consistent with capacity utilization at our existing and future facilities. Rental hangar space is open to the public on a non-discriminatory basis, and prospective tenants are reviewed for credit quality and nature of intended use of the facilities. We focus our operations on various types of tenants, including, individuals (directly or through personally or family-owned LLCs), charter operations, flight schools, corporate fleets, government entities and aviation service providers. We intend to develop a diversified portfolio of tenants in terms of geography, type of tenant and length of lease term. 
 
 While much of our historical revenue has been concentrated with our two largest tenants, longer term, we do not expect to depend on a single tenant or group of tenants, the loss of which would have a material adverse effect on our business. We expect to diversify our risk by having multiple types of tenants across multiple locations across the country. See Risk Factors Our rental income is initially concentrated within a small number of tenants and the loss of or default by one or more significant tenants could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations. 
 
 Tenant lease terms are generally 1-10 years, with maturity dates staggered for purposes of risk management. Base lease rents vary by location, but all leases feature annual rent escalation. Leases are structured as either gross or triple-net, with tenants covering insurance, taxes and utilities. The tenant leases do not have early termination options, and renewals are generally reset to fair market value. 
 
 Competition 
 
 The hangar space rental segment of the aviation services industry in which we operate is very competitive. We compete with national, regional and local FBOs and other hangar real estate companies. Our competitors may include FBOs currently operating at certain airports that may have financial or other resources and/or lower cost structure than us. Other competitors have been in business longer than us and may have greater financial resources available. 
 
 We compete with other operators, including FBOs, at all of our current locations, and our hangar campuses may also face indirect competition from operators located at nearby airports. In addition, we may be adversely affected by competition from other facilities within or outside the airports where the facilities are located, including construction of new facilities at the airports at which we operate or the expansion of hangar facilities by competitors at nearby airports. We must compete with other operators based on the location of the facility relative to runways and street access, quality of customer service, safety, reliability, value-added features, and price. See Investment Criteria for additional information regarding our competitors with respect to each particular facility. 
 
 Seasonality 
 
 We do not experience substantial seasonal fluctuations in our revenues and the results of operations.

Government Regulation 
 
 FAA Regulation 
 
 The industry is overseen primarily by the FAA. In addition, the Department of Homeland Security, Department of Transportation, Environmental Protection Agency, state and local environmental agencies, and local airport authorities contribute to the regulation of our HBS hangar campuses. We must comply with federal, state, and local environmental statutes, and regulations, including those associated in part with the operation of fuel storage tank systems and fuel trucks. These requirements include, among others, tank and pipe testing for tightness, soil sampling for evidence of leaking, and remediation of detected leaks and spills. 
 
 Environmental and Related Matters 
 
 Our HBS hangar campuses are subject to regular inspection by local environmental agencies, as well as local fire marshals and other agencies. We do not expect that compliance and related remediation work, if any, will have a material negative impact on our business. We have not received notice requiring us to cease operations at any location or of any abatement proceeding by any government agency for failure to comply with applicable environmental laws and regulations. 
 
 Americans with Disabilities Act 
 
 Under Title III of the Americans with Disabilities Act ADA ), and rules promulgated thereunder, in order to protect individuals with disabilities, public accommodations must remove architectural and communication barriers that are structural in nature from existing places of public accommodation to the extent readily achievable. In addition, under the ADA, alterations to a place of public accommodation or a commercial facility are to be made so that, to the maximum extent feasible, such altered portions are readily accessible to and usable by disabled individuals. The readily achievable standard takes into account, among other factors, the financial resources of the affected site and the owner, lessor or other applicable person. 
 
 Compliance with the ADA, as well as other federal, state and local laws, may require modifications to properties we currently own or may purchase, or may restrict renovations of those properties. Failure to comply with these laws or regulations could result in the imposition of fines or an award of damages to private litigants, as well as the incurrence of the costs of making modifications to attain compliance, and future legislation could impose additional obligations or restrictions on our properties. Although our tenants are generally responsible for all maintenance and repairs of the property pursuant to our leases, including compliance with the ADA and other similar laws or regulations, we could be held liable as the owner of the property for a failure of one of our tenants to comply with these laws or regulations. 
 
 Environmental Matters 
 
 Our business is subject to numerous statutes, rules and regulations relating to environmental protection and is exposed to various environmental risks, hazards, and environmental protection requirements, including those related to the storage and handling of jet fuel and compliance with firefighting regulations. See Risk Factors Our businesses are subject to environmental risks that may impact our future profitability of this Report. 
 
 We endeavor to be a leader of the industry s initiatives to address environmental issues, and we are increasingly focused on how we can reduce our carbon footprint in a sustainable way. As part of this, our HBS hangar campuses are designed to reduce the need to reposition private jets, which reduces the use of fuel as well as air emissions and noise pollution. We operate a fleet of electric ground support equipment which have a low cost to operate and maintain. In addition, our HBS hangar campuses are designed to be electric vehicle charger-equipped and electric airplane charger-ready. In addition, our hangar design contains environmentally friendly aspects such as no-foam fire suppression. Moreover, our hangars are designed to be both solar and wind energy capable for future installation. 
 
 Insurance 
 
 We maintain insurance of the types and in amounts that we believe to be adequate and consistent with industry standards. During construction, our principal coverage includes builder's risk, general liability, excess liability, and contractor's pollution liability insurance. Once operational, each campus maintains commercial property, flood, earthquake, boiler and machinery, business income/loss of rent, automobile liability, general liability, environmental liability, and worker's compensation insurance. We also maintain insurance coverage related to our directors and officers, employment-related liabilities, and cyber-related incidents. We require the tenants at our campuses to maintain aircraft physical damage, general liability, worker's compensation, automobile liability, and pollution liability insurance coverage.

ITEM 1A. 
 RISK FACTORS 

Certain factors may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. You should consider carefully the risks and uncertainties described below, in addition to other information contained in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, including our financial statements and related notes. If any of the following events occur, our business, financial condition and operating results may be materially adversely affected. In that event, the trading price of our securities could decline, and you could lose all or part of your investment. The risks and uncertainties described below are not the only ones we face. Additional risks and uncertainties that we are unaware of, or that we currently believe are not material, may also become important factors that adversely affect our business, financial condition and operating results. 
 
 Risks Relating to Our Business 
 
 Our growth depends in part upon our ability to enter into new ground leases at airports, and we may be unsuccessful in identifying and consummating attractive new ground leases or taking advantage of other investment opportunities, which would impede our growth and materially and adversely affect our business and results of operation. 
 
 Our ability to expand through new ground leases at airports is integral to our long-term business strategy and requires that we identify and consummate suitable new ground leases or investment opportunities in real estate properties for our portfolio that meet our investment criteria and are compatible with our growth strategy. Our ability to enter into new ground leases on favorable terms, or at all, may be adversely affected by the following significant factors: 

we may not be able to negotiate new ground leases with airport authorities on attractive terms or at all; 

we may encounter competition from other potential ground lessors, which could significantly increase the lease rate for properties we seek to lease; 

we may incur significant costs and divert management attention in connection with evaluating and negotiating potential new ground leases, including ones that we are subsequently unable to complete; 

even if we enter into letters of intent or conditional agreements for new ground leases of airport properties, these agreements are subject to customary closing conditions, including, but not limited to, the satisfactory results of our due diligence investigations and local government and municipal authority approvals; and 

we may be unable to obtain financing for the development of additional sites on favorable terms, or at all, as a result of our existing indebtedness, market conditions or other factors 

Our ability to meet our obligations under our ground leases and our indebtedness is dependent on our ability to enter into and collect lease payments from tenants. 
 
 Our ability to meet our obligations under the ground leases and our debt service obligations will depend on our ability to generate revenues sufficient in the aggregate to make our payments under the ground leases and our debt service obligations under our outstanding indebtedness and any other indebtedness incurred in the future. Our ability to generate revenues may be adversely affected by a wide variety of unforeseen or unforeseeable events and conditions, including, without limitation, economic changes affecting the HBS industry generally, the airports or the tenants specifically, any of which could result in a default under the tenant leases. In addition, the ability of tenant leases to generate revenues may be adversely affected by competition from other facilities within or outside the airports where the facilities are located, including construction of new facilities at the airports at which we operate or the expansion of hangar facilities by competitors at nearby airports. There can be no assurances that the airports or their competitors will not undertake future improvements that may adversely impact the ability of tenant leases to generate revenues. 
 
 Moreover, the terms of our tenant leases currently in place do not extend past the final maturity date of our bond debt. Our ability to make payments under the ground leases or under our debt service obligations through their final maturity will depend upon our success in renewing current tenants or in re-leasing these facilities. The loss of one or more of tenants may (without a similar tenant or tenants to replace such tenant or tenants) have a material adverse effect on our ability to collect rental revenue sufficient to meet our obligations. 
 
 We have a substantial amount of indebtedness outstanding, which may expose us to the risk of default under our debt obligations, restrict our operations and our ability to grow our business and revenues. 
 
 Our outstanding indebtedness is secured under the terms of the Series 2021 PABs. We intend to incur additional debt in connection with new hangar projects at new airport locations, refinancing of existing indebtedness, future acquisitions, or for other purposes. 
 
 In addition, the Series PABs include, and we expect any other indebtedness we incur in the future to include, customary events of default, the occurrence of any of which, after any applicable cure period, would permit the holders of such indebtedness, among other things, to accelerate payment of all amounts outstanding under such indebtedness and to exercise their remedies with respect to the collateral, including foreclosure and sale of the real estate interests securing the loans. If any one of these events were to occur, our business and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected.

Table of Contents 

Secured debt obligations, including those under the Series 2021 PABs, expose us to the possibility of defaults and cross-defaults, as well as foreclosure, which could result in the loss of our investment in a property or group of properties subject to mortgage debt. 
 
 Each constructed and in-construction facility in our portfolio is subject to secured indebtedness under the Series 2021 PABs. Secured debt obligations increase the risk of property losses because defaults on indebtedness secured by properties may result in foreclosure actions initiated by holders of the Series 2021 PABs, its trustee, or other lenders and ultimately our loss of the property securing any loans for which it is in default. As described above, our current tenant leases do not extend past the maturity date of the Series 2021 PABs, and as a result we will be required to re-lease hangars as vacancies arise in order to continue to generate revenue to meet our debt service obligations under the Series 2021 PABs. If any of our facilities are foreclosed upon due to a default, it could materially and adversely affect our business and results of operations. 
 
 In addition, the agreements that govern our current indebtedness contain, and the agreements that may govern any future indebtedness that we may incur may contain, financial and other restrictive covenants, which may limit our ability to engage in activities that may be in our long-term best interests. Our failure to comply with those covenants could result in an event of default that, if not cured or waived, could result in the acceleration of our debt and loss of any collateral securing such debt. 
 
 Our growth will depend on our access to external sources of capital, and our ability to obtain financing or access capital markets may be limited. 
 
 Our growth will depend on external sources of capital in order to finance the development of new properties. We may not be able to obtain such financing on favorable terms, in the time period we desire, or at all. There are a number of factors that may limit our ability to raise financing or access capital markets in the future, including future debt and future contractual obligations, our liquidity and credit status, our operating cash flows, the trading price of our Class A Common Stock, the market conditions in the aviation and/or real estate industries, U.S. and global economic conditions, and the general state of the capital markets. We cannot assure you that we will be able to source external financing for our capital needs, and if we are unable to source financing on acceptable terms or at all, our business could be materially adversely affected. If we cannot obtain capital from third-party sources, we may not be able to grow our business when strategic opportunities exist, meet the capital and operating needs of our existing properties or satisfy our debt service obligations. To the extent we finance our activities with additional debt, we may become subject to financial and other covenants that may restrict our ability to pursue our business strategy or otherwise constrain our growth and operations. 
 
 Increases in market interest rates or unavailability of additional indebtedness may make it difficult for us to finance or refinance our debt, which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations and growth prospects. 
 
 We expect to issue additional debt to finance future site developments and higher interest rates would impact our overall economic performance. In addition, we are subject to credit spreads demanded by fixed income investors. As a non-rated issuer, increases in general of credit spreads in the market, or for us, may result in a higher cost of borrowing in the future. If additional indebtedness is unavailable to us at reasonable rates or at all, we may not be able to finance additional projects or refinance existing debt when it becomes due. If interest rates are higher when we refinance our debt, our income and cash flow could be reduced as a result of increased debt service requirements, which may hinder our ability to raise more capital by issuing more stock or by borrowing money. Our ability to successfully issue any additional debt will depend on a range of factors, including general economic conditions, the level of activity in capital markets generally, and the terms of our existing indebtedness then in effect. 
 
 Adverse economic and geopolitical conditions and dislocations in the credit markets could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations, cash flow, and ability to service our debt and ground lease obligations. 
 
 Our business has been, and may in the future be, affected by market and economic challenges experienced by the U.S. economy or the real estate industry as a whole, increased inflation and rising interest rates. Such conditions may materially and adversely affect us as a result of the following potential consequences, among others: 

a decreased demand for private airport hangar space, which would cause our rental rates to be negatively impacted 

our ability to obtain financing on terms and conditions that we find acceptable, or at all, may be limited, which could reduce our ability to pursue new ground leases and development sites; and 

declines in the financial condition of our tenants could make it more difficult to collect rental revenue from them. 

If the U.S. economy experiences an economic downturn, we may experience delays in leasing vacant sites, which could negatively impact our financial condition, results of operations, cash flow, and ability to service our debt obligations. Furthermore, our ability to grow and lease new sites will be inhibited.

An epidemic, pandemic or contagious disease, including the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations. 
 
 We face risks related to an epidemic, pandemic or contagious disease, including the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, which have impacted, and in the future could impact, the markets in which we operate and could materially and negatively impact our business and results of operations. The impact of such events and measures to prevent the spread of such an event could materially and adversely affect our business in a number of ways. For example, reductions in passenger volumes and flights, as well as by the broader economic shutdown resulting from an epidemic, pandemic or contagious disease could materially and negatively impact our business and results of operations. 
 
 Furthermore as the COVID-19 pandemic continues to subside, the demand for private air travel that increased during the pandemic may decrease, which may result in decreased demand for private airport hangar space and could materially and negatively impact our business and results of operations. 
 
 We may be required to record impairment charges to future earnings if our long-lived assets become impaired. 
 
 Accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America GAAP require us to assess our long-lived assets for impairment at least annually. In addition, we assess our long-lived assets for impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable. Depending on the results of our review, we could be required to record a significant charge to earnings in our consolidated financial statements during the period in which any impairment of our long-lived assets were determined, negatively impacting our results of operations. In June 2022, the Company evaluated the development progress related to its smart hangar app. In connection with this evaluation, the Company recognized an impairment loss of approximately 0.2 million during the year ended December 31, 2022. See Note 5 Long-lived assets in the Notes to our Consolidated Financial Statements for more information regarding our 2022 impairment of long-lived assets. 
 
 The industry in which we operate is subject to significant competition and our failure to effectively compete could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations. 
 
 The hangar space rental segment of the aviation services industry in which we operate is very competitive. We compete with national, regional and local FBO and other hangar real estate companies. Competitor aircraft hangar operators at an airport compete based on various factors, including location of their facilities relative to runways and street access, service, value added features, reliability, and price. Our HBS hangar campuses compete with one or more hangar operators at their respective airports and with operators at nearby airports. Furthermore, ground leases related to HBS and FBO operations may be subject to competitive bidding at the end of their term. 
 
 Our competitors may include hangar operators currently operating at certain airports, as well as possible entrants into our market due to new entrants, consolidation, merger, modification of airport master plans, or any other number of factors. These entrants may have additional financial or other resources and/or lower cost structures than us. Other competitors have been in business longer than us. Having greater financial resources may make it easier for these competitors to absorb higher construction costs and other increases in expenses. This could impact our business and results of operations. 
 
 Our HBS hangar campuses do not have the right to be the sole provider of services at any airport. Furthermore, despite limited space for further development at certain airports, existing competitors with FBO facilities located at our current or future airports could expand their hangar facilities and additional operators of HBS could begin operations at such airports. Competitors might seek acquisitions in regions and markets competitive to us. Given the variety of factors that impact competitiveness within the HBS industry, we can give no assurance that we will be able to successfully compete, which could, in turn, result in a decline in the trading price of our securities. 
 
 The growth and success of our business is subject to our ability to market and to attract and retain tenants. 
 
 Our future success depends upon our ability to attract and retain tenants for hangars at our HBS hangar campuses. The extent to which we achieve growth in our customer base materially influences our business and results of operation. Any number of factors could affect our ability to grow our customer base, including tenant preferences for hangar space and related services, including size and location of the hangar, as well as general economic conditions. The level and volatility of fuel prices may also impact the general aviation industry and our ability to attract and retain tenants. In addition, our ability to attract and retain customers may be dependent on other factors outside of our control, including the future trend of private aircraft sizes, the availability of alternative hangars, including size, location and/or services provided, as well as the external perception of us. Any significant decline in our customer base, or in our rate of growth, could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations, which could, in turn, result in a decline in the trading price of our securities.

Our rental revenue is concentrated within a small number of tenants and the loss of or default by one or more significant tenants could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations. 
 
 Our two largest tenants contributed a substantial portion of our revenues. Both of these tenants have ongoing leases with us that expire in December 2023 and November 2025, respectively (assuming no exercise of tenant option extensions). If any of our most significant tenants, currently or in the future, were to discontinue or otherwise reduce their use of our HBS hangar campuses or other services, our business and results of operation would be materially and adversely affected. 
 
 Our capital projects are subject to uncertainties, including the possibility of delays, cost overruns, and inflation, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operation and market reputation. 
 
 The estimated costs of, and the projected schedule for, our capital projects are subject to a number of uncertainties. Our ability to complete these projects within budgets and on expected schedules may be adversely affected by various factors including: 

estimating errors; 

design and engineering errors; 

cost increases because of demand for labor and materials; 

contractors difficulty in predicting costs over a lengthy construction period; 

the need to estimate costs of unbid project elements; 

changes to the scope of the projects; 

delays in contract awards; 

material and/or labor shortages; 

unforeseen site conditions; 

adverse weather conditions; 

contractor defaults and bankruptcy; 

labor disputes; 

unanticipated levels of inflation; 

litigation; and 

environmental issues. 

Inflationary and supply chain pressures have led to increased construction materials costs, specifically associated with steel, concrete, and other materials. We believe we will continue to experience such pressures in future quarters, as well as delays in our contractors ability to requisition such materials. These pressures have led to an overall increase in budgeted and actual construction costs, as well as delays in starting and completing certain of our development projects, particularly at our Centennial and Deer Valley Airport development projects. No assurance can be given that the costs of our projects will not exceed budgets or the guaranteed maximum price for such projects or that the completion will not be delayed beyond the projected completion dates. Any such cost overruns or delays could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations or market reputation, which could, in turn, result in a decline in the value of our Common Stock.

Failure to adequately maintain our HBS hangar campuses or the integrity of our fuel supplies may have a material adverse impact on the revenue or market share of one or more of our HBS hangar campuses resulting in a decline in operations of the business. 
 
 HBS and FBO operators compete, in part, based on the overall quality and attractiveness of their facilities. Inadequate maintenance of any of the hangars or other assets comprising our HBS hangar campuses could result in customers electing not to utilize us where another provider operates, or to elect not to use a particular airport where an alternative operator in the same market exists. The resulting decline in tenants or negative impact on our reputation could adversely impact revenue, including from more than one facility, which would have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operation. 
 
 Aircraft owners and operators rely on HBS and FBO operators to control the quality of the fuel they provide. Failure to maintain the integrity of fuel supplies as a result of inadequate or inappropriate procedures or maintenance of fuel storage facilities, fuel trucks or related equipment on our part or our suppliers, including FBOs, could result in the introduction of contaminants and could lead to damage or failure of aircraft and could adversely impact the reputation, revenue, and/or profitability of our business. 
 
 The growth and success of our business is dependent on the continued service of certain key employees and the ability to recruit and retain new employees. 
 
 We are dependent on the continued availability of the services of our employees, many of whom are individually key to our current and future success, as well as the availability of new employees to implement our development plans. Because our management team and key employees are not obligated to provide us with continued service, they could terminate their employment with us at any time. 
 
 In addition, the market for employees is highly competitive, especially for employees in fields such as aviation and real estate. While our compensation programs are intended to attract and retain the employees required for us to be successful, ultimately, we may not be able to retain the services of all of our key employees or a sufficient number to execute our development plans. In addition, we may not be able to continue to attract new employees as required. In the event we are unable to attract and retain talent sufficient to support our development plans, our business and results of operations may be adversely affected. 
 
 Our management team has no prior experience operating a public company, and we cannot assure you that the past experience of our senior management team will be sufficient to successfully operate as a public company. 
 
 While certain members of our senior management team and directors have extensive experience in real estate, aviation, development, management and finance, no members of our senior management team and Board of Directors have prior experience in operating a public company. As a public company, we are required to develop and implement substantial control systems, policies and procedures in order to satisfy the company s periodic SEC reporting. We cannot assure you that management s past experience will be sufficient to successfully develop and implement these systems, policies and procedures and to operate a public company, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operation, and value of our Class A Common Stock. 
 
 We are not required to have our outside auditor attest to the effectiveness of our internal controls for several years. If we fail to maintain effective internal control over financial reporting, we may not be able to accurately report our financial results, which may adversely affect investor confidence in the Company and, as a result, the value of our Common Stock. 
 
 Our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting. Substantial work on our part is required to implement appropriate processes, document the system of internal control over key processes, assess their design, remediate any deficiencies identified and test their operation. This process is expected to be both costly and challenging. As of such time that we are no longer an emerging growth company or a non-accelerated filer and smaller reporting company, Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 (the Sarbanes-Oxley Act will require our auditors to deliver an attestation report on the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting in conjunction with their opinion on our audited financial statements. As a result, there would likely be no outside auditor attestation report on our internal controls over financial reporting for the fiscal years through 2024. We will be required to evaluate our status as a smaller reporting company on an annual basis. 
 
 We cannot give any assurances that material weaknesses will not be identified in the future in connection with our compliance with the provisions of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act. The existence of any material weakness would preclude a conclusion by management and our independent auditors that we maintained effective internal control over financial reporting. Our management may be required to devote significant time and expense to remediate any material weaknesses that may be discovered and may not be able to remediate any material weakness in a timely manner. The existence of any material weakness in our internal control over financial reporting could also result in errors in our financial statements that could require us to restate our financial statements, cause us to fail to meet our reporting obligations and cause investors to lose confidence in our reported financial information, all of which could lead to a decline in the value of our Common Stock.

We conduct substantially all of our operations under ground leases, which grant significant rights to airport authorities as our direct or ultimate landlord. The termination for cause of one or more of the ground leases would affect our business and results of operations significantly. 
 
 We do not directly own the sites we develop and lease to tenants. Instead, we enter into ground leases at each site directly or indirectly (thru a sub-lessor) from airport authorities and other governmental agencies that regulate local airports. Airport authorities may choose not to renew a lease at all or to only renew the lease on terms that are unfavorable to us. In addition, airport authorities may require us to participate in a bidding process to renew a lease, which could require unanticipated capital spending and could divert management s attention during the pendency of the process. The loss or modification of any of our airport ground leases could adversely impact our business and results of operations. 
 
 Because we do not directly own the sites we lease, we will not be able to liquidate real estate investments in order to meet liquidity needs. 
 
 Unlike other real estate companies that lease space to tenants, we do not directly own the sites we lease. Instead, the sites are subject to long-term ground leases with airport authorities. As a result, we will not be able to sell underlying real estate assets in order to meet liquidity requirements, including our debt service obligations, which could have a material and adverse impact on our liquidity position and ability to meet our obligations. 
 
 We may be unable to renew ground leases, lease vacant space or re-lease space as leases expire, or renewing existing leases may require significant concession, inducements and/or capital expenditures. 
 
 We cannot assure you that our airport ground leases will be renewed or that our hangars will be re-leased at rental rates equal to or above the current average rental rates or that we will not offer substantial concessions or below-market renewal options to attract new tenants or retain existing tenants. 
 
 If the rental rates for our hangar campuses decrease, or if our existing tenants do not renew their leases or we do not re-lease a significant portion of our available space and space for which leases will expire, our business and results of operations could be adversely affected. In order to attract and retain tenants, we may be required to make rent or other concessions to tenants, accommodate requests for renovations and other improvements or provide additional services to our tenants. Additionally, we may need to raise capital to make such expenditures. If we are unable to do so or if capital is otherwise unavailable, we may be unable to make the required expenditures. This could result in non-renewals by tenants upon expiration of their leases and/or an inability to attract new tenants, which would have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operation. 
 
 Failure to succeed in new markets may have adverse consequences. 
 
 We intend to continue to develop properties across the United States. When we develop properties located in new geographic areas in the United States, we may face risks associated with a lack of market knowledge or understanding of the local market, including the availability and identity of quality tenants, forging new business relationships in the area, and developing an understanding of local government requirements and procedures. Furthermore, the negotiation of a potential expansion into new markets may divert management time and other resources. As a result, we may have difficulties executing our business strategy in these new markets, which could have a negative impact on our business and results of operations. 
 
 Our business and results of operations will be dependent on tenants satisfying their obligations under tenant leases, which may be subject to default or termination. 
 
 We are subject to tenant credit risk. Our HBS hangars are generally leased to single or multi hangar tenants, and certain of our tenants constitute a significant percentage of our revenues. Therefore, the financial failure of, or other default by, a single tenant under its lease is likely to cause a significant or complete reduction in the operating cash flow generated by the property leased to that tenant. For instance, any of our tenants could experience a downturn in their businesses, which may weaken their financial condition and liquidity and result in their failure to make timely payments to us or otherwise default under their contracts. 
 
 If a tenant defaults under its lease, we may be forced to pursue alternative arrangements with those tenants in order to recover amounts due under the leases or pursue litigation in order to collect payments from tenants who are unable make their lease payments as they come due. We can provide no assurance that we will be able to collect the full amount due under a particular lease if we are forced to pursue alternative payment arrangements or litigation with any of our tenants. If the tenant represents a significant portion of our rental revenues, the impact on our business and results of operations would be material if it impacts the company s ability to pay ground lease rent payments on a timely basis. 
 
 If a bankrupt tenant rejects a lease with us, any claim we might have for breach of the lease, excluding a claim against collateral securing the lease, would be treated as a general unsecured claim. In the event of a tenant s default under its lease or its rejection of the lease in bankruptcy proceedings, we may be unable to locate a replacement tenant in a timely manner or on comparable or better terms. As a result, our financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected.

Our business and results of operations may be materially adversely affected by a default under a ground lease or the bankruptcy of a subsidiary. 
 
 We are a holding company with no independent operations and, as such, will be dependent upon the operations of our subsidiaries. Our subsidiaries operations rely upon the authority granted under certain ground leases to operate project sites. Each operating subsidiary with bond debt is structured as a special purpose entity. In the event of the bankruptcy of one or more of these subsidiaries, delays in the payment of rent, fees or loan payments may occur under the automatic stay provisions of the United States Bankruptcy Code. Moreover, a subsidiary debtor as lessee or a trustee in bankruptcy may reject a ground lease altogether, thereby extinguishing the respective subsidiary s duty to pay rent and its right to use the leased property. In addition, a subsidiary lessee may fail to make rental or fee payments when due to the respective airport landlord, regardless of its financial situation. Such bankruptcy or default of a subsidiary lessee could result in the loss of the leased property, which is critical to the operation of our business. A loss of any leased property could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations. 
 
 To the extent a ground lease constitutes a true lease, a subsidiary that has executed its applicable ground lease, or other executory contract, with an airport landlord and seeks protection under the U.S. bankruptcy laws must, subject to the bankruptcy court s approval, assume or reject (a) its ground lease within 120 days after the bankruptcy filing (subject to court approval, a one-time 90-day extension is allowed (further extensions are subject to the consent of the relevant airport landlords)), and (b) its other executory contracts with the airport landlord no later than the confirmation of a plan of reorganization. 
 
 In the event of assumption and/or assumption and assignment of any executory contract with a third party, the subsidiary would be required to cure any pre- and post-petition monetary defaults and provide adequate assurance of future performance under the ground lease or other applicable agreements. 
 
 Rejection of a ground lease or other executory contract, in general, is treated as a pre-petition breach of contract. Subject to certain exceptions, this rejection relieves the subsidiary of performing future obligations under the contract, but will give rise to the tenant s loss of use of the leased property and a pre-petition general unsecured claim of the airport landlord for rejection damages, the amount of which in the case of a ground lease or other agreement is limited by the United States Bankruptcy Code generally to any amounts due and payable prior to the bankruptcy plus the greater of (a) the rent reserved by such lease, without acceleration, for one year of rent; or (b) 15 of the total remaining rent payments, not to exceed three years. However, the amount ultimately received in the event of a rejection of a ground lease or other agreement could be considerably less than the maximum amounts allowed under the United States Bankruptcy Code. In addition, payments made by a subsidiary in bankruptcy within 90 days of filing a bankruptcy case could be deemed to be an avoidable preference under the United States Bankruptcy Code and thus subject to recapture by the debtor-in-possession or its trustee in bankruptcy. In general, risks associated with bankruptcy include risks of substantial delay in payment or of non-payment and the risk that the airport landlord may not be able to enforce any of its remedies under the agreements with a bankrupt borrower. 
 
 During the pendency of a bankruptcy proceeding, a debtor subsidiary may not, absent a court order, make any payments to the airport landlord or to us on account of goods and services provided prior to the bankruptcy. Thus, the airport landlord or our stream of payments from a debtor subsidiary would be interrupted to the extent of pre-petition goods and services, including accrued loan and lease payments, which would have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operation. 
 
 In addition, with respect to tenant leases, under current bankruptcy law, in the event of a bankruptcy of such tenant, the tenant can generally assume or reject a lease within a certain number of days of filing its bankruptcy petition. If a tenant rejects the lease, our damages as a landlord, subject to availability of funds from the bankruptcy estate, are generally limited to the greater of (1) one year s rent and (2) the rent for 15 of the remaining term of the lease, not to exceed three years. Any such event could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations. 
 
 The lack of accurate and reliable industry data can result in unfavorable strategic planning, mergers and acquisitions, and macro pricing decisions. 
 
 We use industry and airport-specific general aviation traffic data published by the FAA, as well as data from private sources, to identify trends in the aircraft hangar industry. We also use this data as an input to decision-making, including in strategic planning and pricing matters. Both the public and private data, however, has several limitations and challenges. As a result, the use of such data may result in decisions in strategic planning or pricing that are incorrect or inefficient, which could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operation. 
 
 We are subject to extensive governmental regulations that could require significant expenditures. Regulators, such as the TSA, have and may again consider regulations that could impair the relative convenience of general aviation and adversely affect demand for our services. 
 
 We are subject to extensive regulatory requirements and compliance with those requirements could result in significant costs. For example, the FAA, from time to time, issues directives and other regulations relating to the management, maintenance, and operation of airport facilities. Compliance with those requirements may cause us to incur significant expenditures. 
 
 In addition, the proposal and enactment of additional laws and regulations, including by the TSA, as well as any failure to comply with such laws and regulations, could significantly increase the cost of our operations and reduce overall revenue. Moreover, certain new regulations, if implemented, could decrease the convenience and attractiveness of general aviation travel relative to commercial air travel and may adversely impact demand for our services.

Compliance or failure to comply with the ADA and other regulations could result in substantial costs. 
 
 Under the ADA, places of public accommodation must meet certain federal requirements related to access and use by disabled persons. Noncompliance with these requirements could result in additional costs to attain compliance, the imposition of fines by the federal government or the award of damages or attorney s fees to private litigants. If we are required to make unanticipated expenditures to comply with the ADA or other regulations, including removing access barriers, then our business and results of operations may be adversely affected. 
 
 Potential limitation of tax-exemption of interest on private activity bonds could impact the debt funding of Sky for future projects or significantly increase our cost. 
 
 From time to time, the President of the United States, the United States Congress and/or state legislatures have proposed and could propose in the future, legislation that, if enacted, could cause interest on private activity bonds to be subject, directly or indirectly, to federal income taxation or to be subject to state income taxation. Clarifications of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 (the Code ), as amended, or court decisions may also cause interest on private activity bonds to be subject, directly or indirectly, to federal income taxation or to be subject to state income taxation. The introduction or enactment of any such legislative proposals or any clarification of the Code or court decisions may also affect the market price for, or marketability of, private activity bonds. We expect to issue private activity bonds in the future to partially fund our expansion of hangar campuses at new airport sites. Lack of access to private activity bonds due to change in law or market access would have an increase in the cost of our debt and our future financial results. 
 
 Uninsured losses or a loss in excess of insured limits could adversely affect our business and results of operations. 
 
 We carry comprehensive liability, fire, property damage, and business interruption insurance on our HBS hangar campuses, with policy specifications and insured limits that we believe are customary for similar properties. An unanticipated number of claims under the insurance policy or policies, however, could result in payment of unanticipated deductibles and increased premiums, which could result in a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations. 
 
 As with all real estate, if reconstruction (for example, following fire or other casualty) or any major repair or improvement is required to the damaged property, changes in laws and governmental regulations may be applicable and may materially affect the cost to, or ability of, us to affect such reconstruction, major repair or improvement. In addition, there can be no assurance that the amount of insurance required or provided would be sufficient to cover damages caused by any casualty, or that such insurance will be commercially available in the future. 
 
 There can also be no assurance that any loss incurred will be of a type covered by such insurance and will not exceed the limits of such insurance. For instance, there are certain types of losses, such as losses resulting from wars, terrorism or certain acts of God, that generally are not insured because they are either uninsurable or not economically insurable. Should an uninsured loss or a loss in excess of insured limits occur, we could suffer disruption of rental income, potentially for an extended period of time, while remaining responsible for any financial obligations relating to the applicable HBS hangar campus, which would have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations. 
 
 We may not be able to rebuild our properties to their existing specifications if we experience a substantial or comprehensive loss of such properties. 
 
 In the event that we experience a substantial or comprehensive loss of one of our properties, we may not be able to rebuild such property to its existing specifications. Further, reconstruction or improvement of such a property may require significant upgrades to meet zoning and building code requirements. Environmental and legal restrictions could also restrict the rebuilding of properties.

Our businesses are subject to environmental risks that may impact our future profitability. 
 
 Our businesses are subject to numerous statutes, rules and regulations relating to environmental protection and we are exposed to various environmental risk and hazards, including the environmental protection requirements related to the storage and handling of jet fuel and compliance with firefighting regulations. Materialization of these risks could result in substantial losses including personal injury, loss of life, damage or destruction of property and equipment, and environmental damage. Any losses we face could be greater than insurance levels maintained by our businesses and could have an adverse effect on us and our businesses and results of operations. We also could be subject to fines and penalties for violation of applicable environmental regulations, which could be substantial. In addition, disruptions to physical assets could reduce our ability to serve customers and adversely affect future rentals, services and cash flows. 
 
 Failure to comply with regulations or other claims may interrupt operations and result in civil or criminal penalties, significant unexpected compliance costs and liabilities that could adversely affect the profitability of our business. These rules and regulations are subject to change, and compliance with any changes could result in a restriction of the activities of our businesses, significant capital expenditures, and/or increased ongoing operating costs. 
 
 We may also be required to address other prior or future environmental contamination, including soil and groundwater contamination that results from the spillage of fuel, hazardous materials, or other pollutants. Any past contamination of the properties could result in remediation obligations, personal injury, property damage, environmental damage, or similar claims by third parties. 
 
 Under various federal, state, and local environmental statutes, rules and regulations, a current or previous owner or operator of real property may be liable for noncompliance with applicable environmental and health and safety requirements and for the costs of investigation, monitoring, removal or remediation of hazardous materials. These laws often impose liability, whether the current owner or operator knew of, or was responsible for, the presence of hazardous materials. Persons who arrange for the disposal or treatment of hazardous materials may also be liable for the costs of removal or remediation of those materials at the disposal or treatment facility, whether or not that facility is or ever was owned or operated by that person and whether or not the original disposal or treatment activity accorded with all regulatory requirements. The presence of hazardous materials on a property could result in personal injury, loss of life, damage or destruction of property and equipment, environmental damage and/or claims by third parties that could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations. 
 
 We are exposed to the potential impacts of future climate change and climate change-related risks. 
 
 Our properties may be exposed to rare catastrophic weather events, such as severe storms, floods or wildfires. If the frequency of extreme weather events increases due to climate change, our exposure to these events could increase. In addition, in connection with any development project, we may be harmed by potential changes to the supply chain or stricter energy efficiency standards for industrial buildings. To the extent climate change causes shifts in weather patterns, our markets could experience negative consequences, including declining demand for hangar space and an inability to operate our hangar campuses. Climate change may also have indirect negative effects on our business by increasing the cost of, or decreasing the availability of, property insurance on terms we find acceptable and increasing the cost of, among other things, energy, aircraft fuel and building materials. 
 
 In addition, compliance with new laws or regulations relating to climate change, including compliance with green building codes, may require us to make improvements to our existing properties or result in increased operating costs that we may not be able to effectively pass on to our tenants. Any such laws or regulations could also impose substantial costs on our tenants, thereby impacting the financial condition of our tenants and their ability to meet their lease obligations. 
 
 Cybersecurity risks and cyber incidents may adversely affect our business by causing a disruption to our operations, a compromise or corruption of our confidential information, misappropriation of assets and/or damage to our business relationships, all of which could negatively impact our business and results of operations. 
 
 Cyber incidents may result in disrupted operations, misstated or unreliable financial data, liability for stolen assets or information, increased cybersecurity protection and insurance costs and litigation and damage to our tenants. As our reliance on technology has increased, so have the risks posed to our information systems, both internal and those we have outsourced. Any processes, procedures and internal controls that we implement, as well as our increased awareness of the nature and extent of a risk of a cyber-incident, do not guarantee that our financial results, operations, business relationships, confidential information or Common Stock price will not be negatively impacted by such an incident. 
 
 Insider or employee cyber and security threats are increasingly a concern for all companies, including us. In addition, social engineering and phishing are a particular concern for companies with employees. As a landlord, we are also susceptible to cyber-attacks on our tenants and their payment information. We are continuously working to deploy information technology systems and to provide employee awareness training around phishing, malware and other cyber risks to ensure that we are protected against cyber risks and security breaches. Such technology and training, however, may not be sufficient to protect us and our tenants from all risks. 
 
 As a smaller company, we use third-party vendors to assist us with our network and information technology requirements. While we carefully select these third-party vendors, we cannot control their actions. Any problems caused by these third parties, including those resulting from breakdowns or other disruptions in communication services provided by a vendor, failure of a vendor to handle current or higher volumes, cyber-attacks and security breaches at a vendor could adversely affect our business and results of operations. 
 
 We may not be able to adequately address these additional risks. If we were unable to do so, our operations might suffer, which may adversely impact our results of operations and financial condition.

Risks Relating to Our Organization and Structure 
 
 We are a controlled company within the meaning of the NYSE American listing standards and, as a result, qualify for, and rely on, exemptions from certain corporate governance requirements. You do not have the same protections afforded to stockholders of companies that are subject to such requirements. 
 
 We qualify as a controlled company within the meaning of the corporate governance standards of the NYSE American. Under these rules, a listed company of which more than 50 of the voting power is held by an individual, group or another company is a controlled company and may elect not to comply with certain corporate governance requirements, including the requirement that (i) a majority of the our Board consist of independent directors, (ii) our compensation committee is composed entirely of independent directors and (iii) director nominees be selected or recommended to our Board by independent directors. 
 
 We rely on certain of these exemptions. As a result, we do not have a compensation committee consisting entirely of independent directors and our directors are not nominated or selected solely by independent directors. We may also rely on the other exemptions so long as we qualify as a controlled company. To the extent we rely on any of these exemptions, holders of Class A Common Stock will not have the same protections afforded to stockholders of companies that are subject to all of the corporate governance requirements of the NYSE American. 
 
 The Existing Sky Equityholders control the direction of SHG Corporation s business, and the concentrated ownership of Common Stock prevent you and other stockholders from influencing significant decisions. 
 
 In connection with the Business Combination, we, each of Tal Keinan, Due West Partners LLC and Center Sky Harbour LLC (collectively, the Existing Sky Equityholders ), and the Sponsor (collectively the Stockholder Parties entered into a stockholders agreement (the Stockholders Agreement ). Pursuant to the terms of the Stockholders Agreement, each of the parties thereto are required to take all necessary action to cause the specified designees of the Existing Sky Equityholders to be nominated to serve on our Board, and each of the holders are required, among other things, to vote all of the securities of SHG Corporation held by such party in a manner necessary to elect the individuals designated by such holders. For so long as these parties hold a majority of Common Stock, they will be able to control the composition of our Board, which in turn will be able to control all matters affecting us, subject to the terms of the Stockholders Agreement, including: 

any determination with respect to our business direction and policies, including the appointment and removal of officers and, in the event of a vacancy on our Board, additional or replacement directors; 

any determinations with respect to mergers, business combinations or disposition of assets; 

determination of our management policies; 

our financing policy; 

our compensation and benefit programs and other human resources policy decisions; and 

the payment of dividends on Common Stock. 

Because the interests of these stockholders may differ from our interests or the interests of our other stockholders, actions that these stockholders take with respect to us may not be favorable to us or our other stockholders. 
 
 Provisions in our Bylaws and Delaware law may have the effect of discouraging lawsuits against our directors and officers. 
 
 Our Bylaws provide that, to the fullest extent permitted by law, and unless we provide notice in writing to the selection of an alternative forum, the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware is the sole and exclusive forum for (i) any derivative action or proceeding brought on behalf of SHG Corporation, (ii) any action asserting a claim of breach of a fiduciary duty owed by any of SHG Corporation s directors, officers, employees or agents to SHG Corporation or its stockholders, (iii) any action asserting a claim arising pursuant to any provision of the DGCL, the Certificate of Incorporation or SHG Corporation Bylaws or as to which the DGCL confers jurisdiction on the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware or (iv) any action asserting a claim governed by the internal affairs doctrine, in each such case subject to such Court of Chancery having personal jurisdiction over the indispensable parties named as defendants therein. Our Bylaws further provide that the federal district courts of the United States are the exclusive forum for resolving any complaint asserting a cause of action arising under the Securities Act. There is uncertainty as to whether a court would enforce such a provision relating to causes of action arising under the Securities Act, and investors cannot waive compliance with the federal securities laws and the rules and regulations thereunder. The clauses described above do not apply to suits brought to enforce a duty or liability created by the Exchange Act or any other claim for which the federal courts have exclusive jurisdiction. Although we believe these provisions benefit us by providing increased consistency in the application of Delaware law in the types of lawsuits to which it applies, a court may determine that this provision is unenforceable, and to the extent it is enforceable, the provision may have the effect of discouraging lawsuits against our directors and officers, although our stockholders will not be deemed to have waived our compliance with federal securities laws and the rules and regulations thereunder.

We qualify as an emerging growth company within the meaning of the Securities Act, and we take advantage of certain exemptions from disclosure requirements available to emerging growth companies, and as such, it could make our securities less attractive to investors and may make it more difficult to compare our performance to the performance of other public companies. 
 
 We qualify as an emerging growth company as defined in Section 2(a)(19) of the Securities Act, as modified by the Jumpstart our Business Startups Act of 2012 (the JOBS Act ). As such, we are eligible for and we take advantage of certain exemptions from various reporting requirements applicable to other public companies that are not emerging growth companies for as long as it continues to be an emerging growth company, including, but not limited to, (i) not being required to comply with the auditor attestation requirements of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, (ii) reduced disclosure obligations regarding executive compensation in our periodic reports and proxy statements and (iii) exemptions from the requirements of holding a nonbinding advisory vote on executive compensation and stockholder approval of any golden parachute payments not previously approved. As a result, our stockholders may not have access to certain information they may deem important. We will remain an emerging growth company until the earliest of (i) the last day of the fiscal year (a) following the fifth anniversary of the completion of the Business Combination, (b) in which we have total annual gross revenue of at least 1.235 billion, or (c) in which we are is deemed to be a large accelerated filer, which means the market value of our Common Stock that is held by non-affiliates exceeds 700 million as of the prior June 30th, and (ii) the date on which we have issued more than 1.0 billion in non-convertible debt securities during the prior three year period. We cannot predict whether investors will find our securities less attractive because it will rely on these exemptions. If some investors find our securities less attractive as a result of its reliance on these exemptions, the trading prices of our securities may be lower than they otherwise would be, there may be a less active trading market for our securities and the trading prices of our securities may be more volatile. 
 
 Because members of our senior management team hold most or all of their economic interest in Sky through other entities, conflicts of interest may arise between them and holders of shares of Class A Common Stock or us. 
 
 Because members of our senior management team hold most or all of their economic interest in Sky directly through holding companies, they may have interests that do not align with, or conflict with, those of the holders of Class A Common Stock or with us. For example, members of our senior management team may have different tax positions from those of SHG Corporation and/or holders of Class A Common Stock, which could influence their decisions regarding whether and when to enter into certain transactions or dispose of assets, whether and when to incur new or refinance existing indebtedness, and whether and when we should terminate the Tax Receivable Agreement and accelerate the obligations thereunder. In addition, the structuring of future transactions and investments may take into consideration the members tax considerations even where no similar benefit would accrue to SHG Corporation. 
 
 The requirements of being a public company may strain our resources and divert management s attention. 
 
 As a public company, we are subject to the reporting requirements of the Exchange Act, the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act, the listing requirements of the NYSE American and other applicable securities rules and regulations. Compliance with these rules and regulations increase our legal and financial compliance costs, make some activities more difficult, time-consuming or costly and increase demand on our systems and resources, particularly after we are no longer an emerging growth company. The Sarbanes-Oxley Act requires, among other things, that we maintain effective disclosure controls and procedures and internal control over financial reporting. In order to maintain and, if required, improve our disclosure controls and procedures and internal control over financial reporting to meet this standard, significant resources and management oversight may be required. As a result, management s attention may be diverted from other business concerns, which could adversely affect our business and operating results. We may need to hire more employees in the future or engage outside consultants to comply with these requirements, which will increase our costs and expenses. 
 
 Risks Relating to Tax 
 
 Our only principal asset is our interest in Sky, and accordingly we will depend on distributions from Sky to pay dividends, taxes, other expenses, and make any payments required to be made by us under the Tax Receivable Agreement. 
 
 We are a holding company and have no material assets other than our ownership of Sky Common Units. We are not expected to have independent means of generating revenue or cash flow, and our ability to pay our taxes, operating expenses, and pay any dividends in the future will be dependent upon the financial results and cash flows of Sky. There can be no assurance that Sky will generate sufficient cash flow to distribute funds to us or that applicable state law and contractual restrictions, including negative covenants under debt instruments will permit such distributions. If Sky does not distribute sufficient funds to us to pay our taxes or other liabilities, we may default on contractual obligations or have to borrow additional funds. In the event that we are required to borrow additional funds, it could adversely affect our liquidity and subject us to additional restrictions imposed by lenders. 
 
 Sky is treated as partnership for U.S. federal income tax purposes and, as such, generally is not subject to any entity-level U.S. federal income tax. Instead, taxable income will be allocated, for U.S. federal income tax purposes, to the holders Sky Common Units. Under the terms of the third amended and restated Operating Agreement (the A R Operating Agreement ), Sky is obligated to make pro rata tax distributions to holders of Sky Common Units calculated at certain assumed rates. In addition to tax expenses, we will also incur expenses related to our operations, including payment obligations under the Tax Receivable Agreement, which could be significant and some of which will be reimbursed by Sky (excluding payment obligations under the Tax Receivable Agreement). For so long as we are Managing Member (as defined in the A R Operating Agreement) of Sky, we intend to cause Sky to make ordinary distributions and tax distributions to the holders of Sky Common Units on a pro rata basis in amounts sufficient to enable us to cover all applicable taxes, relevant operating expenses, payments under the Tax Receivable Agreement and dividends, if any, declared by us. However, Sky s ability to make such distributions may be subject to various limitations and restrictions, including, but not limited to, retention of amounts necessary to satisfy the obligations of Sky and its subsidiaries and restrictions on distributions that would violate any applicable restrictions contained in Sky s debt agreements, or any applicable law, or that would have the effect of rendering Sky insolvent. To the extent we are unable to make payments under the Tax Receivable Agreement for any reason, such payments will be deferred and will accrue interest until paid. Additionally, nonpayment for a specified period and/or under certain circumstances may constitute a material breach of a material obligation under the Tax Receivable Agreement and therefore accelerate payments under the Tax Receivable Agreement, which could be substantial.

Table of Contents 

We anticipate that the distributions received from Sky may, in certain periods, exceed our actual tax liabilities and obligations to make payments under the Tax Receivable Agreement. The Board, in its sole discretion, will make any determination from time to time with respect to the use of any such excess cash so accumulated, which may include, among other uses, to pay dividends on our Class A Common Stock. We will have no obligation to distribute such cash (or other available cash other than any declared dividend) to our stockholders. 
 
 The Tax Receivable Agreement requires us to make cash payments to the TRA Holders in respect of certain tax benefits and such payments may be substantial. In certain cases, payments under the Tax Receivable Agreement may (i) exceed any actual tax benefits the Tax Group realizes or (ii) be accelerated. 
 
 Following closing of the Business Combination, we, Sky, the Existing Sky Equityholders and Tal Keinan (in the capacity of TRA Holder Representative entered into the Tax Receivable Agreement. Pursuant to the Tax Receivable Agreement, we are generally required to pay the TRA Holders 85 of the amount of savings, if any, in U.S. federal, state, local, and foreign taxes that are based on, or measured with respect to, net income or profits, and any interest related thereto that the Tax Group (i.e., SHG Corporation and applicable consolidated, unitary, or combined Subsidiaries) realizes, or is deemed to realize, as a result of certain Tax Attributes, which include: 

existing tax basis in certain assets of Sky and certain of its direct or indirect Subsidiaries, including assets that will eventually be subject to depreciation or amortization, once placed in service, attributable to Sky Common Units acquired by SHG Corporation from a TRA Holder, as determined at the time of the relevant acquisition; 

tax basis adjustments resulting from taxable exchanges of Sky Common Units (including any such adjustments resulting from certain payments made by SHG Corporation under the Tax Receivable Agreement) acquired by SHG Corporation from a TRA Holder pursuant to the terms of the A R Operating Agreement; and 

tax deductions in respect of portions of certain payments made under the Tax Receivable Agreement. 

Payments under the Tax Receivable Agreement generally will be based on the tax reporting positions that we determine (with the amount of subject payments determined in consultation with an advisory firm and subject to the TRA Holder Representative s review and consent), and the Internal Revenue Service (the IRS or another taxing authority may challenge all or any part of a position taken with respect to tax attributes or the utilization thereof, as well as other tax positions that we take, and a court may sustain such a challenge. In the event that any tax attributes initially claimed or utilized by the tax group are disallowed, the TRA Holders will not be required to reimburse us for any excess payments that may previously have been made pursuant to the Tax Receivable Agreement, for example, due to adjustments resulting from examinations by taxing authorities. Rather, any excess payments made to such TRA Holders will be applied against and reduce any future cash payments otherwise required to be made by us to the applicable TRA Holders under the Tax Receivable Agreement, after the determination of such excess. However, a challenge to any tax attributes initially claimed or utilized by the tax group may not arise for a number of years following the initial time of such payment and, even if challenged earlier, such excess cash payment may be greater than the amount of future cash payments that we might otherwise be required to make under the terms of the Tax Receivable Agreement. As a result, there might not be future cash payments against which such excess can be applied and we could be required to make payments under the Tax Receivable Agreement in excess of the tax group s actual savings in respect of the tax attributes. 
 
 Moreover, the Tax Receivable Agreement will provide that, in certain early termination events, we will be required to make a lump-sum cash payment to all the TRA Holders equal to the present value of all forecasted future payments that would have otherwise been made under the Tax Receivable Agreement. The lump-sum payment would be based on certain assumptions, including those relating to there being sufficient future taxable income of the tax group to fully utilize the tax attributes over certain specified time periods and that all Sky Common Units that had not yet been exchanged for Class A Common Stock or cash are deemed exchanged for cash. The lump-sum payment could be material and could materially exceed any actual tax benefits that the tax group realizes subsequent to such payment. 
 
 Payments under the Tax Receivable Agreement will be our obligations and not obligations of Sky. Any actual increase in our allocable share of Sky and its relevant subsidiaries tax basis in relevant assets, as well as the amount and timing of any payments under the Tax Receivable Agreement, will vary depending upon a number of factors, including the timing of exchanges, the market price of the Class A Common Stock at the time of an exchange of Sky Common Units by a TRA Holder pursuant to the terms of the A R Operating Agreement and the amount and timing of the recognition of the Tax Group s income for applicable tax purposes. While many of the factors that will determine the amount of payments that we will be required to make under the Tax Receivable Agreement are outside of our control, we expect that the aggregate payments we will be required to make under the Tax Receivable Agreement could be substantial and, if those payments substantially exceed the tax benefit we realize in a given year or in the aggregate, could have an adverse effect on our financial condition, which may be material. 
 
 Any payments made by us under the Tax Receivable Agreement will generally reduce the amount of overall cash flow that might have otherwise been available to us. To the extent that we are unable to make timely payments under the Tax Receivable Agreement for any reason, the unpaid amounts will be deferred and will accrue interest until paid. Additionally, nonpayment for a specified period and/or under certain circumstances may constitute a material breach of a material obligation under the Tax Receivable Agreement and therefore accelerate payments due under the Tax Receivable Agreement. Furthermore, our future obligation to make payments under the Tax Receivable Agreement could make us a less attractive target for an acquisition, particularly in the case of an acquirer that cannot use some or all of the Tax Attributes that may be deemed realized under the Tax Receivable Agreement.

We could be adversely affected by changes in applicable tax laws, regulations, or administrative interpretations thereof in the United States or other jurisdictions . 
 
 We could also be adversely affected by changes in applicable tax laws, regulations, or administrative interpretations thereof in the United States or other jurisdictions and changes in tax law could reduce our after-tax income and adversely affect our business and financial condition. For example, the U.S. federal tax legislation commonly referred to as the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the Tax Act ), enacted in December 2017, resulted in fundamental changes to the Code. These changes included, among many other things, a reduction to the federal corporate income tax rate, a partial limitation on the deductibility of business interest expense, a limitation on the deductibility of certain director and officer compensation expense, limitations on net operating loss carrybacks and carryovers and changes relating to the scope and timing of U.S. taxation on earnings from international business operations. Subsequent legislation, the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act (the CARES Act enacted on March 27, 2020, relaxed certain of the limitations imposed by the Tax Act for certain taxable years, including the limitation on the use and carryback of net operating losses and the limitation on the deductibility of business interest expense. The exact impact of the Tax Act and the CARES Act for future years is difficult to quantify, but these changes could materially affect SHG Corporation, Sky, or its subsidiaries. In addition, other changes could be enacted in the future to increase the corporate tax rate, limit further the deductibility of interest, or effect other changes that could have a material adverse effect on SHG Corporation s financial condition. Such changes could also include increases in state taxes and other changes to state tax laws to replenish state and local government finances depleted by costs attributable to the COVID-19 pandemic and the reduction in tax revenues due to the accompanying economic downturn. 
 
 More recently, the United States government has recently enacted the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 which, among other things, significantly changes the taxation of business entities including by imposing a minimum tax equal to fifteen percent of the adjusted financial statement income of certain corporations as well as a one percent excise tax on share buybacks, effective for tax years beginning in 2023. When effective, it is possible that the minimum tax could result in an additional tax liability over the regular federal corporate tax liability in a given year based on differences between book and taxable income (including as a result of temporary differences). The resulting tax liability could adversely impact SHG Corporation s business, financial condition, results of operation and liquidity. The excise tax on share buybacks is currently not expected to have a material impact on SHG Corporation s tax liability. 
 
 In addition, our effective tax rate and tax liability are based on the application of current income tax laws, regulations and treaties. These laws, regulations and treaties are complex and often open to interpretation. In the future, the tax authorities could challenge our interpretation of laws, regulations and treaties, resulting in additional tax liability or adjustment to our income tax provision that could increase our effective tax rate. Changes to tax laws may also adversely affect our ability to attract and retain key personnel. 
 
 Risks Relating to Our Common Stock and Warrants 
 
 The market price of Class A Common Stock and Public Warrants has been and may continue to be extremely volatile, which could cause purchasers of our securities to incur substantial losses. 
 
 The market prices and trading volume that our shares of Class A Common Stock have recently experienced, and may continue to experience, extreme volatility, which could cause purchasers of our Class A Common Stock and Public Warrants to incur substantial losses. Since the closing of the Business Combination, our Class A Common Stock has traded as low as 2.50 and as high as 43.41 through December 31, 2022. In addition, the volume of trading of our Class A Common Stock has been inconsistent. For example, on February 16, 2022 our Class A Common Stock had trading volume of 13,800 shares and on February 18, 2022 our Class A Common Stock had trading volume of 19,692,800. Our Public Warrants have not traded in tandem with our Class A Common Stock, and since the closing of the Business Combination have traded within a range of 0.18 to 2.75 through December 31, 2022. 
 
 We believe that the recent volatility and our current market prices reflect market and trading dynamics unrelated to our underlying business, or macro or industry fundamentals, and we do not know how long these dynamics will last. Under the circumstances, investors in our Class A Common Stock and Warrants are subject to the risk of losing all or a substantial portion of their investment. 
 
 Extreme fluctuations in the market price of our Class A Common Stock have been accompanied by reports of strong and atypical retail investor interest, including on social media and online forums. The market volatility and trading patterns we have experienced create several risks for investors, including the following: 

the market price of our Class A Common Stock has experienced and may continue to experience rapid and substantial increases or decreases unrelated to our operating performance or prospects, or macro or industry fundamentals, and substantial increases may be significantly inconsistent with the risks and uncertainties that we continue to face; 

factors in the public trading market for our Class A Common Stock may include the sentiment of retail investors, the direct access by retail investors to broadly available trading platforms, the amount and status of short interest in our securities, access to margin debt, trading in options and other derivatives on our Class A Common Stock and any related hedging and other trading factors; 

to the extent volatility in our Class A Common Stock is caused by a short squeeze in which coordinated trading activity causes a spike in the market price of our Class A Common Stock as traders with a short position make market purchases to avoid or to mitigate potential losses, investors purchase at inflated prices unrelated to our financial performance or prospects, and may thereafter suffer substantial losses as prices decline once the level of short-covering purchases has abated; and 

if the market price of our Class A Common Stock declines, you may be unable to resell your shares at or above the price at which you acquired them, and the Warrant you own may become out of the money.

The public float of our Class A Common Stock is very illiquid, and there may not be sufficient demand in the marketplace to absorb the sale of newly registered shares. 
 
 As of December 31, 2022, the public float of our Class A Common Stock listed in the NYSE American was approximately 4.1 million, which is only 2.7 of the equity capitalization of the Company. Given the company is recently listed, and does not have any investor research coverage nor a seasoned established institutional investor base, any significant sale of newly registered shares may have a significant negative impact on the price of our Class A Common Stock. 
 
 We cannot predict the impact our dual class structure may have on the stock price of Class A Common Stock. 
 
 We cannot predict whether our dual class structure will result in a lower or more volatile market price of Class A Common Stock or in adverse publicity or other adverse consequences. For example, certain index providers have announced restrictions on including companies with multiple-class share structures in certain of their indexes. Under these policies, our dual class capital structure would make us ineligible for inclusion in certain indices, and as a result, mutual funds, exchange-traded funds and other investment vehicles that attempt to passively track those indices will not be investing in our stock. It is unclear what effect, if any, these policies will have on the valuations of publicly traded companies excluded from such indices, but it is possible that they may depress valuations, as compared to similar companies that are included. As a result, the market price of shares of Class A Common Stock could be adversely affected.

The outstanding Warrants are exercisable for shares of Class A Common Stock and common units in Sky may be redeemed for Class A Common Stock. The exercise of these outstanding warrants will increase the number of shares eligible for future resale in the public market and result in dilution to our stockholders. 
 
 As of December 31, 2022, there were 6,799,189 outstanding Public Warrants to purchase 6,799,189 shares of Class A Common Stock at an exercise price of 11.50 per share. In addition, as of December 31, 2022, there were 7,719,779 Private Placement Warrants outstanding exercisable for 7,719,779 shares of Class A Common Stock at an exercise price of 11.50 per share. To the extent such warrants are exercised, additional shares of Class A Common Stock will be issued, which will result in dilution to the holders of Class A Common Stock and increase the number of shares eligible for resale in the public market. 
 
 In addition, as of December 31, 2022, there were 42,192,250 Sky Common Units, which may be redeemed for shares of our Class A Common Stock on a one-for-one basis, and in connection with the redemption of such Sky Common Units, the corresponding shares of Class B Common Stock will be cancelled. The lock-up period for the outstanding shares of Class B Common Stock, and for the shares of Class A Common Stock underlying the Private Placement Warrants, expired on January 25, 2023. Furthermore, we have registered for resale all of the Class A Common Stock underlying such outstanding units. Sales of substantial numbers of such shares in the public market, or the perception that such sales may occur, could adversely affect the market price of Class A Common Stock, the impact of which is increased as the value of our stock price increases. 
 
 We do not intend to pay cash dividends for the foreseeable future. 
 
 We currently intend to retain our future earnings, if any, to finance the further development and expansion of our business and do not intend to pay cash dividends in the foreseeable future. Any future determination to pay dividends will be at the discretion of our Board and will depend on our financial condition, results of operations, capital requirements, restrictions contained in future agreements and financing instruments, business prospects and such other factors as our Board deems relevant. 
 
 If analysts do not publish research about our business or if they publish inaccurate or unfavorable research, our stock price and trading volume could decline. 
 
 The trading market for Class A Common Stock will depend in part on the research and reports that analysts publish about our business. We do not have any control over these analysts. If one or more of the analysts who cover us downgrade our Class A Common Stock or publish inaccurate or unfavorable research about our business, the price of Class A Common Stock would likely decline. If few analysts cover us, demand for Class A Common Stock could decrease and our Class A Common Stock price and trading volume may decline. Similar results may occur if one or more of these analysts stop covering us in the future or fail to publish reports on us regularly. 
 
 You may experience future dilution as a result of future equity issuances. 
 
 In order to raise additional capital, we may in the future offer additional shares of our Common Stock or other securities convertible into or exchangeable for our Common Stock at prices that may not be the same as the price per share paid by any investor. For example, on August 18, 2022, we entered into a Common Stock Purchase Agreement and a Registration Rights Agreement (collectively, the "Stock Purchase Agreement") with B. Riley Principal Capital II, LLC ("B. Riley") pursuant to which we may issue from time to time up to 10,000,000 shares of our Class A Common Stock. We will have discretion over the prices at which we sell shares under the Stock Purchase Agreement over its 36-month term. We may sell shares or other securities in any other offering at a price per share that is less than the price per share paid by any investor, and investors purchasing shares or other securities in the future could have rights superior to you. The price per share at which we sell additional shares of our Common Stock, or securities convertible or exchangeable into Common Stock, in future transactions may be higher or lower than the price per share paid by any investor. 
 
 We may be subject to securities litigation, which is expensive and could divert management attention. 
 
 The market price of Class A Common Stock has been and may continue to be volatile and, in the past, companies that have experienced volatility in the market price of their stock have been subject to securities class action litigation. We may be the target of this type of litigation in the future. Securities litigation against us could result in substantial costs and divert management s attention from other business concerns, which could seriously harm our business.

 MARKET FOR REGISTRANT S COMMON EQUITY, RELATED STOCKHOLDER MATTERS AND ISSUER PURCHASES OF EQUITY SECURITIES 

Market Information 

(a) 
 Market Information 

The Company s Class A Common Stock and Public Warrants are listed on the NYSE American under the symbols SKYH and SKYH WS, respectively. Prior to the consummation of the Business Combination, YAC s Units, YAC s Class A Common Stock and YAC s Public Warrants were listed on the NASDAQ Capital Market under the symbols YSACU , YSAC and YSACW, respectively. Upon consummation of the Business Combination, YAC s Units automatically separated into the component securities, YAC s Class A Common Stock was reclassified as our Class A Common Stock and YAC s Public Warrants were reclassified as our Public Warrants. 
 
 As of December 31, 2022, there were five holders of record of Class A Common Stock and three holders of record of Warrants. However, because many of the shares of Class A Common Stock and the Warrants are held by brokers and other institutions on behalf of stockholders, the Company believes there are substantially more beneficial holders of Class A Common Stock and Warrants than record holders. 

(b) 
 Dividends 

We have not paid any cash dividends on our common stock to date and do not intend to pay cash dividends in the foreseeable future. The payment of cash dividends in the future will be dependent upon our revenues and earnings, if any, capital requirements and general financial condition subsequent to completion of any Business Combination. The payment of any cash dividends subsequent to our Business Combination will be within the discretion of our Board at such time. In addition, our Board is not currently contemplating and does not anticipate declaring any stock dividends in the foreseeable future. Further, if we incur any indebtedness in connection with our Business Combination, our ability to declare dividends may be limited by restrictive covenants we may agree to in connection therewith.

 MANAGEMENT S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS 

The following discussion and analysis of the Company s financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with our audited financial statements and the notes related thereto which are included in Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Certain information contained in the discussion and analysis set forth below includes forward-looking statements that reflect our plans, estimates, and beliefs. Our actual results may differ materially from those anticipated in these forward-looking statements as a result of many factors, including those set forth under Special Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements, Item 1A. Risk Factors and elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. 
 
 Overview and Background 
 
 We are an aviation infrastructure development company building the first nationwide network of HBS hangar campuses for business aircraft. We develop, lease, and manage general aviation hangars across the United States, targeting airfields in markets with significant aircraft populations and high hangar demand. Our HBS hangar campuses feature exclusive private hangars and a full suite of dedicated services specifically optimized for home-based, versus transient, aircraft. 
 
 The physical footprint of the U.S. business aviation fleet grew by almost 28 million square feet in the ten years preceding the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic, with hangar supply lagging dramatically, especially in key growth markets. As the fleet of private jets in the United States continues to grow, with recent new aircraft deliveries exceeding retirements, demand for hangar space is at a premium in part because new jets require more square footage of hangar space and the pace of new hangar construction has lagged behind the demand. The cumulative square footage of the business aircraft fleet in the United States increased 50 between 2010 and 2021. Moreover, over that same period, there was an 81 increase in the square footage of larger private jets those with greater than a 24-foot tail height. A recent study conducted by a business aircraft manufacturer forecasted that business aircraft will only continue to grow in the next ten years, with up to 8,500 new business jet deliveries worth almost 275 billion expected to be delivered between 2023 and 2032, further supported by data from the major business aviation manufacturers that suggest the current order backlog for new business aviation aircraft is almost 47 billion. 
 
 These larger footprint aircraft do not fit in much of the existing hangar infrastructure and impose stacking challenges and constraints in the traditional shared or community hangars operated by FBOs. The addition of winglets (the vertical extensions on aircraft wingtips) on most modern business jets inhibits wing-over-wing storage. Aircraft hangars are in high demand and short supply, with some airports compiling waiting lists that can exceed several years. 
 
 We believe our scalable, real estate-centric business model is uniquely optimized to capture this market opportunity and address the increased imbalance between the supply and demand for private jet storage. We intend to capitalize on the existing hangar supply constraints at major U.S. airports by targeting high-end tenants in markets where there is a shortage of private and FBO hangar space, or where such hangars are or are becoming obsolete. 
 
 We realize economies of scale in construction through a proprietary prototype hangar design replicated at HBS hangar campuses across the United States. This allows for centralized procurement, straightforward permitting processes, efficient development processes, and the best hangar in business aviation. Unlike a service company, our revenues are mostly derived from long-term rental agreements, offering stability and forward visibility of revenues and cash flows. This allows the Company to fund its development through the public bond market, providing capital efficiency and mitigating refinance risk.

Recent Developments 
 
 On October 27, 2022, we substantially completed the construction of our BNA Phase II development project. The total construction costs incurred associated with the project were slightly less than our initial estimated construction costs. In connection with the substantial completion of our BNA HBS hangar campus, certain tenant leases associated with our constructed hangars commenced starting in November 2022. 
 
 On January 19, 2023, we amended our existing ground lease agreement with the Town of Addison, TX to include additional parcels of land that will effectively double the land available for development at our ADS HBS hangar campus project. 
 
 On February 1, 2023, we substantially completed the construction of our OPF Phase I development project. In connection with the substantial completion of the OPF Phase I hangar campus, tenant leases for certain of our constructed hangars commenced starting in February 2023. 
 
 On March 22, 2023, we satisfied the requirements within the Series 2021 PABs indenture to fund construction costs associated with our ADS Phase I development project with proceeds received from our Series 2021 PABs. See Note 18 Subsequent Events Series 2021 PABs Scope Modification in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding the modification of the scope of our Series 2021 PABs. The approval and exercise of such rights will allow approximately 26 million of proceeds to be used to fund the ADS Phase I development project, and is projected to improve our debt service coverage associated with the Series 2021 PABs. 
 
 Factors That May Influence Future Results of Operations 
 
 Revenues 
 
 Our revenues are earned pursuant to the lease agreements we enter into with our tenants. Our ability to expand through new ground leases and tenant leases at airports is integral to our long-term business strategy and requires that we identify and consummate suitable new ground leases or investment opportunities in real estate properties for our portfolio that meet our investment criteria and are compatible with our growth strategy. Our ability to enter into new ground leases and tenant leases on favorable terms, or at all, may be adversely affected by a number of factors. We believe that the business environment of the industry segments in which our tenants operate is generally positive for tenants. However, our existing and potential tenants are subject to economic, regulatory and market conditions that may affect their level of operations and demand for hangar space, which could impact our results of operations. Accordingly, we actively monitor certain key factors, including changes in those factors (fuel prices, new aircraft deliveries, hangar rental rates) that we believe may provide early indications of conditions that may affect the level of demand for new leases and our lease portfolio. See Risk Factor s Risks Related to our Business and Operations for more information about the risks related to our tenants and our lease payments. 
 
 Operating Expense 
 
 One of our largest expenses are the lease payments payable under our ground leases. For the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, our operating expense related to ground leases was 3.7 million and 3.7 million, respectively. As we enter into new ground leases at new airport sites, our payments to airport landlords will continue to increase into the future. If airport landlords increase the per acre cost of the ground lease of our target campuses, the operating margins at potential target developments may be impacted negatively. 
 
 Interest Expense 
 
 Economic conditions and actions by policymaking bodies are contributing to rising interest rates, which, along with increases in our borrowing levels, could increase our future borrowing costs. We expect to issue additional debt to finance future site developments and higher interest rates would impact our overall economic performance. In addition, we are subject to credit spreads demanded by fixed income investors and bank lenders. As a non-rated issuer, increases in general of credit spreads in the market, or for us, may result in a higher cost of borrowing in the future. We intend to access the bond market on an opportunistic basis. In addition, we may hedge against rising benchmark interest rates by entering into hedging strategies with high quality counterparties. 
 
 General and Administrative Expenses 
 
 The general and administrative expenses reflected in our statement of operations are reflective of the professional, legal and consulting fees, payroll costs, and other general and administrative expenses, including those necessary to support our business as a public company such as expenses associated with corporate governance, SEC reporting, and other compliance matters. While we expect that our general and administrative expenses will rise in some measure as our portfolio of campuses grows, we expect that such expenses as a percentage of our portfolio will decrease over time due to efficiencies, economies of scale, insourcing of job functions, and cost control measures.

Construction Material Costs and Labor 
 
 When constructing our HBS hangar campuses, we use various materials and components. We generally contract for our materials and labor under guaranteed maximum price contracts upon receipt of building permits. This allows us to mitigate the risks associated with increases in building materials and labor costs between the time construction begins on an HBS hangar campus and the time it is completed. Typically, the materials and most of the components used to construct our HBS hangar campuses are readily available in the United States. In addition, the majority of our materials are supplied to us by our contractors and is included in the price of our contract with such contractors. We continue to monitor the supply markets to achieve the best prices available. Typically, the price changes that most significantly influence our operations are price increases in steel, concrete, and labor. We believe that recent inflationary pressures and market conditions will lead to continued increases in construction costs as well as market rental rates for hangars within our HBS hangar campus development projects. However, there can be no assurance that we will be able to increase the lease rates for the hangars within our HBS hangar campuses to absorb these increased costs and/or delays, if at all. 
 
 We intend to continue to aggressively take action to mitigate these inflationary pressures, reduce construction costs, and shorten development schedules, both in the near term at our APA Phase I, DVT Phase I, and ADS Phase I development projects, and in the long term at future projects. We structure our guaranteed maximum price construction contracts with shared savings clauses to incentivize the general contractors to reduce construction costs. At our SGR Phase I and BNA Phase II development projects, our total construction costs were lower than both our original pricing estimate and the project s contracted guaranteed maximum price. 
 
 In July 2022, we entered an exclusive strategic vendor partnership with a metal building and hangar door manufacturer that we expect to result in a reduction in the cost of the metal building and hangar door components at all future HBS hangar campuses. As our strategic partnership grows, we expect this vertical integration will enable us to deliver metal buildings to each development site in shorter timeframes, which we believe will reduce the overall construction duration of each development project. No assurance can be given that our cost mitigation strategies will be successful, the costs of our projects will not exceed budgets or the guaranteed maximum price for such projects, or that the completion will not be delayed beyond the projected completion dates. 
 
 Current Capital Requirements and Future Expenditures for Expansion 
 
 We previously funded SHC with over 200 million to fund the two phases at each of our five ground leased airport locations. These construction funds and reserves are held at the bondholder trustee. 
 
 We maintain the ability to include up to 50 million in new projects outside the original five locations to be funded with a portion of the existing proceeds held by the trustee as long as certain approvals and supplemental consultant reports are provided showing that such new project would result in better coverage of debt service than previously contemplated projects. We exercised this ability and received the requisite approvals and reports in March 2023 with respect to our ADS Phase I development project. 
 
 We consummated the Yellowstone Transaction on January 25, 2022, to raise additional equity capital to, along with potential future debt and further equity issuances, begin to fund additional airport campuses and reach up to 20 airport campuses over the next several years. On average, each future campus is anticipated to be composed of an average of 10-20 hangars and is expected to cost approximately 55 million per campus, with 60 or more to be funded with additional public activity bonds. All these future hangar campus projects are discretionary and require us to identify the appropriate airports with the target hangar demand economics, secure required ground leases and permits, and complete future construction at such sites. 
 
 The cumulative 20 airport site business plan is estimated to cost approximately 1.2 billion, with approximately 65 to 75 anticipated from long-term private activity bonds and the balance with equity or equity linked financing. The equity portion of this business plan has been partially funded upon the closing of the Yellowstone Transaction, which included an additional 45 million equity investment from Boston Omaha through the BOC PIPE. Our ability to raise additional equity and/or debt financing will be subject to a number of risks, including our ability to obtain financing upon reasonable terms, if at all, costs of construction, delays in constructing new facilities, operating results, and other risk factors. In the event that we are unable to obtain additional financing, we may be required to raise additional equity capital, creating additional dilution to existing stockholders. There can be no assurance that we would be successful in raising such additional equity capital on favorable terms, if at all. Even if we can obtain such additional equity financing if needed, there can be no assurance that we would be successful in raising such additional financing on favorable terms, if at all.

Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates 
 
 The preparation of financial statements and related disclosures in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements, and expenses during the periods reported. Actual results could materially differ from those estimates. We have identified the following as our critical accounting policies: 
 
 Cost of Construction 
 
 Cost of construction on the consolidated balance sheets is carried at cost. The cost of acquiring an asset includes the costs necessary to bring a capital project to the condition necessary for its intended use. Costs are capitalized once the construction of a specific capital project is probable. Construction labor and other direct costs of construction are capitalized. Professional fees for engineering, procurement, consulting, and other soft costs that are directly identifiable with the project and are considered an incremental direct cost are capitalized. We allocate a portion of our internal salaries to both capitalized cost of construction and to general and administrative expense based on the percentage of time certain employees worked in the related areas. Interest costs on the debt used to fund the capital projects are also capitalized until the capital project is completed. 
 
 Once a capital project is complete, the cost of the capital project is reclassified to Constructed Assets on the accompanying balance sheet and we begin to depreciate the constructed asset on a straight-line basis over the lesser of the life of the asset or the remaining term of the related ground lease, including expected renewal terms. 
 
 Leases 
 
 We account for leases under Accounting Standards Codification ASC Topic 842, Leases. We determine whether a contract contains a lease at the inception of the contract. ASC Topic 842 requires lessees to recognize operating lease liabilities and right-of-use ROU assets for all leases with terms of more than 12 months on the consolidated balance sheets. We have made an accounting policy election that will keep leases with an initial term of 12 months or less off our consolidated balance sheets and will result in recognizing those lease payments in the consolidated statements of operations on a straight-line basis over the lease term. When management determines that it is reasonably certain that we will exercise our options to renew the leases, the renewal terms are included in the lease term and the resulting ROU asset and operating lease liability balances. 
 
 We also have tenant leases and account for those leases in accordance with the lessor guidance under ASC Topic 842. 
 
 We have lease agreements with lease and non-lease components; we have elected the accounting policy to not separate lease and non-lease components for all underlying asset classes. 
 
 We have elected to not capitalize any interest cost that is implicit within our operating leases into cost of construction on the consolidated balance sheet, but instead, we expense our ground lease cost in the consolidated statements of operations. 
 
 Revenue Recognition 
 
 We lease hangar facilities that we construct to third parties. The lease agreements are either on a month-to-month basis or have a defined term and may have options to extend the term. Some of the leases contain options to terminate the lease by either party with given notice. There are no options given to the lessee to purchase the underlying assets. Rental revenue is recognized in accordance with ASC Topic 842, Leases, and includes (i) fixed payments of cash rents, which represents revenue each tenant pays in accordance with the terms of its respective lease and is recognized on a straight-line basis over the term of the lease and (ii) variable payments of tenant reimbursements, which are recoveries of all or a portion of the common area maintenance and operating expenses of the property and are recognized in the same period as the expenses are incurred. 
 
 The Company evaluates the collectability of tenant receivables for payments required under the lease agreements. If the Company determines that collectability is not probable, the Company recognizes any difference between revenue amounts recognized to date under ASC 842 and payments that have been collected from the lessee, including security deposit amounts held, as a current period adjustment to rental revenue. 
 
 Use of Estimates 
 
 The preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires the Company to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting periods. Such estimates include assumptions used within impairment analyses, estimated useful lives of depreciable assets and amortizable costs, estimates of inputs utilized in determining incentive compensation expense and equity instruments such as warrants, estimates and assumptions related to right-of-use assets and operating lease liabilities. Actual results could differ materially from those estimates.

Revenues 
 
 Revenues for the year ended December 31, 2022 were approximately 1.8 million, compared to approximately 1.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2021. The 17 increase primarily resulted from additional tenant leases commencing at SGR during the second and third quarters of 2022 and BNA during late 2022. 
 
 Operating Expenses 
 
 Operating expenses increased approximately 0.6 million, or 13 , from approximately 4.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2021 to approximately 5.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2022. This increase was primarily driven by an approximately 0.4 million increase in salaries, wages, and benefits associated with our campus personnel. The increase was reflective of a headcount increase at BNA associated with the opening of the BNA campus in the three months ended December 31, 2022, an increase at OPF as we prepare to commence operations in the three months ending March 31, 2023, and a headcount increase at SGR to accommodate increased tenant activity. Repair and maintenance expense associated with our hangars and related ground service equipment increased approximately 0.1 million, primarily driven by increased operations at our BNA and SGR campuses. 
 
 Depreciation Expense 
 
 Depreciation increased approximately 0.1 million, or 18 , for the year ended December 31, 2022, as compared to the year ended December 31, 2021. The increase reflects the opening of our BNA campus during the three months ended December 31, 2022 and the placement of additional ground support equipment into service throughout 2022. 
 
 General and Administrative Expenses 
 
 For the years ended December 31, 2022, and 2021, general and administrative expenses were approximately 14.7 million and approximately 8.7 million, respectively. The approximately 6.0 million increase was primarily driven by an approximately 2.5 million increase in salaries, wages, and benefits, which reflects an increase in full-time and contracted employees. The increase also reflects the implementation of stock and cash incentive compensation programs instituted to attract and retain employees. Other administrative expenses increased approximately 2.2 million driven primarily by insurance, franchise taxes, and computer and software expenses. Marketing and pursuit costs increased approximately 0.6 million in the year ended December 31, 2022, compared to the year ended December 31, 2021, reflecting our growth strategy in securing airport site acquisitions and potential tenants. Professional fees increased approximately 0.7 million due to an increase in legal, accounting, and consulting costs as compared to the prior year primarily as a result of becoming a public company. 
 
 Other (Income) Expenses 
 
 Other (income) expenses increased from approximately 1.4 million of other expense to approximately 5.2 million of other income for the year ended December 31, 2022 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2021. This increase was primarily due to an approximately 5.1 million mark-to-market gain of the outstanding warrants at December 31, 2022. These warrants were issued by YAC as part of its initial public offering. As a result, the warrants were not reflected in Sky s financial statements for the Year ended December 31, 2021.

Liquidity and Capital Resources 
 
 Overview 
 
 Liquidity is a measure of our ability to meet potential cash requirements, including ongoing commitments to repay borrowings, fund the construction of new assets, fund working capital and other general business needs. Our primary sources of cash include the potential issuance of equity and debt securities and rental payments from tenants. Our long-term liquidity requirements include lease payments under our ground leases with airport authorities, repaying principal and interest on outstanding borrowings, funding the construction costs of our HBS hangar campuses (see Construction Material Costs and Labor funding for operations, and paying accrued expenses. 
 
 We believe that we have access to multiple sources of capital to fund our long-term liquidity requirements, including the incurrence of additional private activity bonds and other debt and the issuance of additional equity securities. However, as a new publicly-traded company, we cannot assure you that we will have access to these sources of capital or that, even if such sources of capital are available, that these sources of capital will be available on favorable terms. Our ability to incur additional debt will depend on multiple factors, including our degree of leverage, the value of our unencumbered assets and borrowing restrictions that are or may be imposed by future lenders. Our ability to access the equity and debt capital markets will depend on multiple factors as well, including general market conditions for real estate companies, our degree of leverage, the trading price of our common stock and debt and market perceptions about our Company. 
 
 Our cash deposits may exceed the amount of insurance provided on such deposits. Generally, these deposits may be redeemed upon demand and the majority are maintained with a major financial institution with reputable credit. Our restricted cash is held in trust at a major financial institution pursuant to the Series 2021 PABs indenture. We monitor the relative credit standing of financial institutions with whom we transact and limit the amount of credit exposure with any one entity. Our portfolio of investments and restricted investments is composed entirely of U.S. Treasury securities as of December 31, 2022.

Common Stock Purchase Agreement 
 
 On August 18, 2022, we entered into the Stock Purchase Agreement with B. Riley. Pursuant to the Stock Purchase Agreement, we have the right, in our sole discretion, to sell to B. Riley up to 10 million shares of our Class A Common Stock at 97 of the volume weighted average price of our Class A Common Stock calculated in accordance with the Purchase Agreement, over a period of 36 months subject to certain limitations and conditions contained in the Purchase Agreement. Sales and timing of any sales of Class A Common Stock are solely at our election, and we are under no obligation to sell any securities to B. Riley under the Purchase Agreement. As consideration for B. Riley s commitment to purchase shares of our Class A Common Stock, we have issued 25,000 shares of our Class A Common Stock to B. Riley as initial commitment shares and may issue up to an aggregate of 75,000 shares of our Class A Common Stock to B. Riley as additional commitment shares if certain conditions are met. As of December 31, 2022, we have sold no shares of our Class A Common Stock to B. Riley pursuant to the Stock Purchase Agreement. See Note 10 Equity and Redeemable Equity in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding the Stock Purchase Agreement. 
 
 Equity Financing 
 
 On the Closing Date, we completed the Yellowstone Transaction, Yellowstone changed its name to Sky Harbour Group Corporation, and Sky restructured its capitalization, issuing its Sky Common Units to the Company. As a result of the Yellowstone Transaction, the Sky Common Units that Sky issued to BOC YAC in respect of its Series B Preferred Units were converted into 5,500,000 shares of the Company s Class A Common Stock and holders of Sky Common Units received one share of the Company s Class B Common Stock for each Common Unit. As consideration for the issuance of Sky Common Units to the Company, Yellowstone contributed approximately 48 million of net proceeds to us, consisting primarily of the BOC PIPE, and the amount held in the Yellowstone trust account, net of redemptions and transaction costs. 
 
 Private Activity Bonds 
 
 On September 14, 2021, SHC completed an issuance through the Public Finance Authority (Wisconsin) of 166.3 million of Series 2021 PABs. The Series 2021 PABs are comprised of three maturities: 21.1 million bearing interest at 4.00 , due July 1, 2036 30.4 million bearing interest at 4.00 , due July 1, 2041 and 114.8 million bearing interest at 4.25 , due July 1, 2054. The Series 2021 PAB that has a maturity date of July 1, 2036 was issued at a premium, and Sky received bond proceeds that were 0.2 million above its face value. The net proceeds from the issuance of the Series PABs proceeds are being used to (a) finance or refinance the construction of various aviation facilities consisting of general aviation aircraft hangars and storage facilities located and to be located on the SGR site, the OPF site, the BNA site, the APA site, the DVT site, and following our March 2023 election to reallocate a portion of the net proceeds, the ADS site (b) fund debt service and other operating expenses such as ground lease expense during the initial construction period (c) fund deposits to the Debt Service Reserve Fund and (d) pay certain costs of issuance related to the Series PABs.

Debt Covenants 
 
 The Series 2021 PABs contain financial and non-financial covenants, including a debt service coverage ratio, a restricted payments test and limitations on the sale, lease, or distribution of assets. To the extent that SHC does not comply with these covenants, an event of default or cross-default may occur under one or more agreements, and we or our subsidiaries may be restricted in our ability to pay dividends, issue new debt or access our leased facilities. The Series 2021 PABs are collateralized on a joint and several basis with the property and revenues of all SHC subsidiaries and their assets financed or to be financed from the proceeds of the Series 2021 PABs. 
 
 Covenants in the Series 2021 PABs require SHC to maintain a debt service coverage ratio (as defined in the relevant documents) of at least 1.25 for each applicable test period, commencing with the quarter ending December 31, 2024. The Series 2021 PABs are subject to a Continuing Disclosure Agreement whereby SHC is obligated to provide electronic copies of (i) monthly construction reports, (ii) quarterly reports containing quarterly financial information of SHC and (iii) annual reports containing audited consolidated financial statements of SHC to the Municipal Securities Rulemaking Board. As of December 31, 2022, we were in compliance with all debt covenants.

Operating Activities 
 
 Cash provided by operating activities is significantly influenced by the amount of cash we invest in personnel and infrastructure to support the anticipated growth of our business. Included in net cash provided by operations are certain non-recurring legal, accounting, and consulting costs incurred for up to four quarters as a result of becoming a public company and a one-time outflow associated with the purchase of a leasehold interest at OPF. Our working capital consists primarily of cash, receivables from tenants, prepaid expenses, accounts payable, accrued compensation, accrued other expenses, and lease liabilities. The timing of collection of our tenant receivables, and the timing of spending commitments and payments of our accounts payable, accrued expenses, accrued payroll and related benefits, all affect these account balances. 
 
 Net cash used in operating activities was 27.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2022, compared to 6.6 million for the same period in 2021. The 20.9 million increase in cash used in operating activities was primarily attributable to the 9.6 million of initial direct costs associated with the purchase of our former landlord's leasehold interest at OPF. The increase was also partially attributable to a 5.0 million increase in net loss, net of non-cash adjustments, and a 6.2 decrease in working capital. The increase in net loss and changes in working capital were primarily driven by general and administrative expenses incurred in the expansion of our business, including transaction-related expenses and other expenses related to corporate governance. 
 
 Investing Activities 
 
 Our primary investing activities have consisted of payments related to the cost of construction at our various HBS hangar campus development projects and investment in U.S. Treasury Securities. As our business expands, we expect to continue to invest in our current and anticipated future portfolio of HBS development projects. 
 
 Cash used in investing activities was 187.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2022, compared to 16.0 million for the same period in 2021. The increase of 171.9 million in cash used in investing activities was driven primarily by 193.8 million of purchases of held-to-maturity U.S. Treasury securities during the first and third quarters of 2022, the 30.0 million purchase of available-for-sale U.S. Treasury securities during the second quarter, and a 29.1 million increase in payments for costs of construction due to the Company s ongoing construction projects at BNA, OPF, APA, and DVT. These increases were offset by proceeds of 79.1 million received at maturity of certain of the Company s restricted investments. 
 
 Financing Activities 
 
 Our primary financing activities have consisted of capital raised to fund the growth of our business and proceeds from debt obligations incurred to finance our HBS hangar campus development projects. We expect to raise additional equity capital and issue additional indebtedness as our business grows. 
 
 Net cash provided by financing activities was 52.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2022, compared to 226.4 million for the same period in 2021. The 173.6 million decrease in net cash provided by financing activities was primarily driven by 166.5 million of bond proceeds received during the third quarter of 2021 due to the issuance of the Series 2021 PABs, and 55.0 million of proceeds received from the issuance of the Sky Series B Preferred Units during the third quarter of 2021, and 30.0 million of proceeds from the issuance of Series A Preferred Units in the first quarter of 2021. These decreases were offset by 45.0 million of proceeds received from the issuance of the BOC PIPE and 15.7 million of gross proceeds from the Yellowstone trust account, both occurring in the first quarter of 2022. 

ITEM 7A. 
 QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK 

Market risk includes risks that arise from changes in interest rates, foreign currency exchange rates, commodity prices, equity prices, and other market changes that affect market sensitive instruments. In pursuing our business and investment objectives, we expect that the primary market risk to which we will be exposed is interest rate risk. Following the issuance of the Series 2021 PABs, all of our indebtedness is now fixed rate debt. However, we may enter into variable rate debt agreements in the future, in which case we intend to hedge against rising benchmark interest rates by entering into hedging strategies with high quality counterparties. Our investments and restricted investments are invested in U.S. government treasury bills with maturity dates ranging between less than 180 days to 5 years. Due to the nature of these investments, as well as our intent and ability to hold these instruments to maturity, we believe there will be no associated material exposure to interest rate risk.

Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm 
 
 To the Stockholders and Board of Directors Sky Harbour Group Corporation: 
 
 Opinion on the Financial Statements 
 
 We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Sky Harbour Group Corporation and Subsidiaries (the Company as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, and the related consolidated statements of operations, comprehensive income (loss), stockholders equity, and cash flows for each of the years then ended, and the related notes (collectively referred to as the financial statements ). In our opinion, the financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the consolidated financial position of the Company as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, and the consolidated results of their operations and their cash flows for each of the years then ended, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. 
 
 Basis for Opinion 
 
 These financial statements are the responsibility of the Company s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company s financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. 
 
 We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. The Company is not required to have, nor were we engaged to perform, an audit of its internal control over financial reporting. As part of our audits, we are required to obtain an understanding of internal control over financial reporting but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Company s internal control over financial reporting. Accordingly, we express no such opinion. 
 
 Our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion. 

/s/ 
 
 We have served as the Company s auditor since 2020.

 NOTES TO UNAUDITED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 
 DECEMBER 31, 2022

of the common units of Sky (the Sky Common Units ), and the prior holders of Sky s Existing Common Units (the LLC Interests owned approximately of the Sky Common Units and control the Company through their ownership of the Class B Common Stock, par value Class B Common Stock of the Company. As of December 31, 2022 , the Company and the LLC Interests owned approximately and of Sky Common Units, respectively. See Notes 2 and 3 for additional discussion related to the Yellowstone Transaction. 

of amounts previously classified within general and administrative expenses on the consolidated statement of operations for the year ended December 31, 2021 , have been reclassified to operating expenses. This reclassification had no effect on total expenses, net loss, net loss per common share and had no impact on the Company s consolidated balance sheets, statement of stockholders equity and statement of cash flows for the prior year period. 
 
 Notwithstanding the legal form of the Yellowstone Transaction pursuant to the terms therein, the Yellowstone Transaction was accounted for as a reverse recapitalization in accordance with GAAP (the Reverse Recapitalization ). Under this method of accounting, Yellowstone was treated as the acquired company for financial reporting purposes, and Sky was treated as the accounting acquirer. In accordance with this accounting method, the Yellowstone Transaction was treated as the equivalent of Sky issuing stock for the net assets of Yellowstone, accompanied by a recapitalization. 
 
 Sky was deemed the accounting acquirer for purposes of the Yellowstone Transaction based on an evaluation of the following facts and circumstances: 
 
 The LLC Interests, through their ownership of the Class B Common Stock, hold a majority voting interest in the Company;

Sky Incentive Units 
 
 In May 2021, Sky granted Sky Incentive Units to certain employees. In connection with the Yellowstone Transaction and the execution of the Third A R Operating Agreement, the number of existing Sky Incentive Units outstanding was adjusted based on a defined unit conversion ratio to reflect the new capital structure (see Note 10 and remain Sky Incentive Units, resulting in outstanding Sky Incentive Units. These Incentive Units may be exchanged for Sky Common Units at the holder s discretion upon vesting. There were no changes to the terms or conditions of the Sky Incentive Units effected by the Yellowstone Transaction. The Sky Incentive Units are classified as equity instruments. 
 
 The Sky Incentive Units were valued as of the date of grant using the Option-Pricing Method described in the AICPA Accounting and Valuation Guide entitled Valuation of Privately Held Company Equity Securities Issued as Compensation. The Option-Pricing Method treated profit units (such as Sky Incentive Units) and the capital units outstanding at the time of the valuation (Sky s Series A Preferred Units, Series B Preferred Units, and the Founder Units) as call options on the total equity value of Sky, with exercise (or strike) prices based on the incremental equity required to repay liquidation preferences for the various holders of Sky interests. The values of the options associated with each strike price were calculated using the Black-Scholes option pricing model based on the grant date. The Sky Incentive Units were classified as Level 3 in the fair value hierarchy. The key inputs and assumptions used in the valuation of the Sky s Incentive Units were: 

Term (in years) 
 Risk-free interest rate 
 Volatility 

Below is a summary of activity related to the Sky Incentive Units for the Year ended December 31, 2022 :

 Sky units outstanding as of December 31, 2022

The Company recognizes equity-based compensation expense on a straight-line basis over the requisite service period and has elected to account for forfeitures of Sky Incentive Units if and when they occur. The Company recorded equity-based compensation expense relating to Sky Incentive Units of for the year ended December 31, 2022, which is recorded within General and Administrative Expenses within the statement of operations, and as a component of the non-controlling interest in the consolidated statement of changes in stockholders equity. The Company recorded equity-based compensation expense relating to Sky Incentive Units of for the year ended December 31, 2021 . As of December 31, 2022 , there was of total unrecognized compensation expense that is expected to be recognized over a weighted-average future period of years.

A reconciliation of the statutory federal income tax expense to the income tax expense (benefit) from continuing operations provided at December 31, 2022 and December 31, 2021 is as follows: 
 State income tax benefit, net of federal benefit 
 Unrealized gain on warrants 
 Other, net 
 Change in valuation allowance 
 Total income tax benefit 

The Company recorded income tax expense of and the effective tax rate was for the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021. The effective income tax rate for the year ended December 31, 2022 differs from the federal statutory rate of primarily due to a full valuation allowance against net deferred tax assets as it is more likely than not that the deferred tax assets will not be realized. For the year ended December 31, 2021, Sky was not subject to U.S. Federal and certain state income taxes at the entity level prior to the Yellowstone Transaction (See Note 2 ). 

Components of the Company s deferred tax assets at December 31, 2022 and December 31, 2021 are as follows: 

Difference between book and tax capital accounts 
 Stock-based compensation 
 Net operating loss carryforwards 
 Valuation allowance 
 Total deferred tax assets 
 
 Deferred tax liabilities: 
 Unrealized Gain/Loss on investments 
 Total deferred tax liabilities 
 Total 

The realization of deferred tax assets, including net operating loss carryforwards ("NOLs"), is dependent on the generation of future taxable income sufficient to realize the tax deductions, carryforwards, and credits. Valuation allowances on deferred tax assets are recognized if it is determined that it is more likely than not that the asset will not be realized. For the year ended December 31, 2022 , we recorded a full valuation allowance due to historical losses before income taxes which reduced management's ability to rely on future expectations of income. 
 
 As of December 31, 2022 , we have available federal tax operating loss carryforwards of approximately million, including approximately million generated by our legal predecessor prior to the Yellowstone Transaction. All federal tax operating loss carryforwards arose in tax years subsequent to 2017. Tax operating loss carryovers arising in years after 2017 may be carried forward indefinitely but are only available to offset 80 of future taxable income. We have available state tax operating loss carryforwards of approximately million, which are available to reduce future state taxable income and would begin to expire in tax year 2040 in various amounts. Utilization of our net operating loss carryforwards may be subject to substantial annual limitations due to the ownership change limitations provided by Section 382 of the Internal Revenue Code, as amended, and similar state provisions. 
 
 Uncertain Tax Positions 
 
 We believe that there are no tax positions taken or expected to be taken that would significantly increase or decrease unrecognized tax benefits within 12 months of the reporting date. 
 
 The federal and state statutes of limitation for assessment of tax liability generally lapse within three years after the date the tax returns are filed. However, income tax attributes that are carried forward, such as net operating loss carryforwards, may be challenged and adjusted by taxing authorities at any time prior to the expiration of the statute of limitations for the tax year in which they are utilized. As of December 31, 2022 , we do not have any open exams; however, all tax years, including those of our legal predecessor, are subject to examination by the Internal Revenue Service.

 CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES 

Disclosure Controls and Procedures 
 Disclosure controls and procedures are controls and other procedures that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in our reports filed or submitted under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC s rules and forms. Disclosure controls and procedures include, without limitation, controls and procedures designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in company reports filed or submitted under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. 
 
 Pursuant to Rules 13a-15 and 15d-15 under the Exchange Act, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer (our principal executive officer and principal financial officer, respectively), with the participation of other members of management, carried out an evaluation of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures as of December 31, 2022. Our management does not expect that our disclosure controls and procedures will prevent or detect all errors and all fraud. Disclosure controls and procedures, no matter how well designed, operated and managed, can provide only reasonable assurance that the objectives of the disclosure controls and procedures are met. Because of the inherent limitations of disclosure controls and procedures, no evaluation of such disclosure controls and procedures can provide absolute assurance that all control issues and instances of fraud, if any, have been detected. Based upon this evaluation of our disclosure controls and procedures, our Chief Executive Officer and our Chief Financial Officer determined that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of December 31, 2022. Management s Report on Internal Controls over Financial Reporting 
 
 The Company s management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting, as such term is defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) of the Exchange Act. The Company s internal control system is designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States of America. Due to its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Therefore, even those systems determined to be effective can provide only reasonable assurance with respect to financial statement preparation and presentation. 
 
 Management conducted an assessment of our internal control over financial reporting based upon criteria established in Internal Control Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (2013). Based on that assessment, management determined that our internal controls over financial reporting were effective as of December 31, 2022. 
 
 Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting 
 
 There have not been any changes in our internal control over financial reporting, as such term is defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Exchange Act, during the fiscal quarter ended December 31, 2022 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.
