We made or entered into these acquisitions, dispositions and joint ventures in order to execute on our strategy to concentrate on markets where we can focus on creating national champion converged businesses in core markets and unlock significant synergies. 
 
 Acquisitions . One of our recent significant acquisitions includes: 
 On November 11, 2020, we completed the acquisition of Sunrise Communications Group AG Sunrise through the settlement of the all cash public tender offer to acquire all of the outstanding shares of Sunrise (the Sunrise Acquisition ).

Our combined business in Switzerland is now referred to as Sunrise. 
 
 Joint Ventures . Our significant joint ventures include: 
 On December 15, 2022, we contributed cash to a newly-formed joint venture in the U.K. (the nexfibre JV that is anticipated to roll-out a new fiber network to 5-7 million new homes in the U.K. that are outside the existing footprint of the VMO2 JV (as defined below). We beneficially own 25 of the nexfibre JV, Telef nica (as defined below) beneficially owns 25 and InfraVia Capital Partners InfraVia beneficially owns the remaining 50 . We account for our 25 interest in the nexfibre JV as an equity method investment.

Additionally, in July 2022, our board of directors authorized a further 400.0 million for 2022 share repurchases. The following table provides the details of our share repurchases during 2022:

 _______________ 
 (1) Homes Passed are homes, residential multiple dwelling units or commercial units that can be connected to our networks without materially extending the distribution plant. Certain of our Homes Passed counts are based on census data that can change based on either revisions to the data or from new census results. Due to the fact that we do not own the partner networks (defined below) used in Switzerland (see note 8 below), we do not report homes passed for Switzerland s partner networks. 
 (2) Fixed-Line Customer Relationships are the number of customers who receive at least one of our internet, video or telephony services that we count as Revenue Generating Units RGUs ), without regard to which or to how many services they subscribe. Fixed-Line Customer Relationships generally are counted on a unique premises basis. Accordingly, if an individual receives our services in two premises (e.g., a primary home and a vacation home), that individual generally will count as two Fixed-Line Customer Relationships. We exclude mobile-only customers from Fixed-Line Customer Relationships. 
 (3) Internet Subscribers are homes, residential multiple dwelling units or commercial units that receive internet services over our networks, or that we service through a partner network. In Switzerland, we offer a 10 Mbps internet service to our Video Subscribers without an incremental recurring fee. Our Internet Subscribers in Switzerland include approximately 45,100 subscribers who have requested and received this service. 
 (4) Video Subscribers are homes, residential multiple dwelling units or commercial units that receive our video services over our broadband network or through a partner network. We have approximately 30,100 lifeline customers that are counted on a per connection basis, representing the least expensive regulated tier of video cable service, with only a few channels. 
 (5) Telephony Subscribers are homes, residential multiple dwelling units or commercial units that receive voice services over our networks, or that we service through a partner network. Telephony Subscribers exclude mobile telephony subscribers. In Switzerland, we offer a basic phone service to our Video Subscribers without an incremental recurring fee. Our Telephony Subscribers in Switzerland include approximately 188,500 subscribers who have requested and received this service. 
 (6) An RGU is, separately, a Video Subscriber, Internet Subscriber or Telephony Subscriber. A home, residential multiple dwelling unit, or commercial unit may contain one or more RGUs. For example, if a residential customer subscribed to our video service, fixed-line telephony service and broadband internet service, the customer would constitute three RGUs. Total RGUs is the sum of Video, Internet and Telephony Subscribers. RGUs generally are counted on a unique premises basis such that a given premise does not count as more than one RGU for any given service. However, if an individual receives one of our services in two premises (e.g., a primary home and a vacation home), that individual will count as two RGUs for that service. Each bundled cable, internet or telephony service is counted as a separate RGU regardless of the nature of any bundling discount or promotion. Non-paying subscribers are counted as subscribers during their free promotional service period. Some of these subscribers may choose to disconnect after their free service period. Services offered without charge on a long-term basis (e.g., certain preferred subscribers or free service to employees) generally 
 I-6 

are not counted as RGUs. We do not include subscriptions to mobile services in our externally reported RGU counts. In this regard, our RGU counts exclude our separately reported postpaid and prepaid mobile subscribers. 
 (7) Our Mobile Subscriber count represents the number of active subscriber identification module SIM cards in service rather than services provided. For example, if a mobile subscriber has both a data and voice plan on a smartphone this would equate to one mobile subscriber. Alternatively, a subscriber who has a voice and data plan for a mobile handset and a data plan for a laptop would be counted as two mobile subscribers. Customers who do not pay a recurring monthly fee are excluded from our mobile subscriber count after periods of inactivity ranging from 30 to 90 days, based on industry standards within the respective country. In a number of countries, our mobile subscribers receive mobile services pursuant to prepaid contracts.

 Additional General Notes to Table: 
 Most of our broadband communications subsidiaries provide broadband internet, video, telephony, mobile, data or other business services. Certain of our business service revenue is derived from small or home office SOHO subscribers that pay a premium price to receive enhanced service levels along with video, internet or telephony services that are the same or similar to the mass marketed products offered to our residential subscribers. All mass marketed products provided to SOHOs, whether or not accompanied by enhanced service levels and/or premium prices, are included in the respective RGU and customer counts of our broadband communications operations, with only those services provided at premium prices considered to be SOHO RGUs or SOHO customers . To the extent our existing customers upgrade from a residential product offering to a SOHO product offering, the number of SOHO RGUs or SOHO customers will increase, but there is no impact to our total RGU or customer counts. With the exception of our business SOHO subscribers, we generally do not count customers of business services as customers or RGUs for external reporting purposes. 
 In Belgium, Telenet leases a portion of its network under a long-term finance lease arrangement. These tables include operating statistics for Telenet s owned and leased networks. 
 While we take appropriate steps to ensure that subscriber statistics are presented on a consistent and accurate basis at any given balance sheet date, the variability from country to country in (1) the nature and pricing of products and services, (2) the distribution platform, (3) billing systems, (4) our bad debt collection efforts and (5) other factors add complexity to the subscriber counting process. We periodically review our subscriber counting policies and underlying systems to improve the accuracy and consistency of the data reported on a prospective basis. Accordingly, we may from time to time make appropriate adjustments to our subscriber statistics based on those reviews. 
 Subscriber information for acquired entities is preliminary and subject to adjustment until we have completed our review of such information and determined that it is presented in accordance with our policies.

Products and Services 
 
 Our main products and services are intelligent WiFi and internet services, video, mobile and telephony services. 
 Intelligent WiFi and Internet Services 
 Connectivity is a critical building block for vibrant communities. As highlighted by the COVID-19 pandemic, all aspects of society, including families, businesses, education and healthcare, to name a few, rely heavily on connectivity and the digital services that depend on it. To meet our customers expectations of seamless connectivity, we are developing a fully digital, cloud-based connectivity ecosystem that we call ONE Connect , built on top of our fiber-rich fixed broadband network and recently expanded mobile network. ONE Connect is orchestrated by a fully cloud-based digital journey, enabling fast and flexible introduction of new hardware and services, as well as cloud-to-cloud open API integration, simplifying the on-boarding of new services and devices. The devices used within our ONE Connect ecosystem are connected and protected through our security gateway and VPN, both at home and on the go. At home, our customers can benefit from the gigabit speeds enabled by our Connect Box (described below), as well as Intelligent WiFi , which has optimization functionalities, such as the ability to adapt to the number of people and devices online at any given time in order to improve and extend wireless connectivity reach and speeds. We have completed the rollout of our award-winning Intelligent WiFi across all our markets. In addition, we introduced our first Smart Home bundles in select markets, enabling those customers to take their smart home ambitions to the next level, including enhanced entertainment, home automation and home security. Finally, our Connect App is the digital touchpoint that allows customers to access and manage all of our services. 
 
 Our Connect Box is a next generation Intelligent WiFi and telephony gateway that enables us to maximize the impact of our ultrafast broadband networks by providing reliable wireless connectivity anywhere in the home. This gateway can be self-installed and allows customers to customize their home WiFi service. Our latest versions of the gigabit Connect Box are based on DOCSIS 3.1 technology and WiFi 6, providing even better in-home WiFi service. Our new DOCSIS 3.1 Connect Box runs our One Firmware stack, a middleware software system based on the Reference Design Kit for Broadband RDK-B ). RDK-B is an open source initiative with wide participation from operators, device manufacturers and silicon vendors that standardizes core functions used in broadband devices, set-top boxes and IoT solutions. We have extended the One Firmware stack to support our ONE Connect ecosystem. One Firmware runs on system-on-a-chip SOC technology from multiple vendors and can run on any SOC that is RDK-B compliant, enabling greater speed and agility for on-boarding of new customer premises equipment CPE platforms and ecosystem features, allowing us to build once and port to many. During 2022, we continued the roll out of One Firmware to our legacy DOCSIS 3.0 WiFi 5GW and our next generation DOCSIS 3.1 WiFi 6 GW. In addition, we completed the porting activity of One Firmware to our new XGSPON and ethernet WiFi 6 gateways. To support the adoption of fiber-to-the-home, cabinet, building or node networks (fiber-to-the-home/-cabinet/-building/-node is referred to herein as FTTx access in both on-net and off-net scenarios, we plan to add XGS-PON (an updated standard for passive optical networks that supports higher-speed, 10 Gbps symmetrical data transfers) and Ethernet-based Connect Boxes with WiFi 6, providing speeds up to 10 Gbps that run our One Firmware and support our ONE Connect ecosystem. Our Connect Box is available in all our markets, and during 2022, approximately 12 million of our customers have a Connect Box. In addition to our core markets, we distribute our Connect Box to other markets in Europe, Latin America and the Caribbean. Robust wireless connectivity is increasingly important with our customers spending more and more time using bandwidth-heavy services on multiple devices. We also offer our Connect App that, among other things, allows our customers to optimize their WiFi coverage and manage their connected devices. In addition, we provide Intelligent WiFi mesh boosters, which increase speed, reliability and coverage by adapting to the environment at home. 
 
 Internet speed is of crucial importance to our customers, as they spend more time streaming video and other bandwidth-heavy services on multiple devices. Our extensive broadband network enables us to deliver ultra-high-speed internet service across our markets. Our residential subscribers access the internet via cable modems connected to their internet capable devices, or wirelessly via a WiFi gateway device. We offer multiple tiers of broadband internet service up to gigabit speeds that is now available across our entire European footprint. The speed of service depends on the customer location and their service selected. 
 
 By leveraging our existing fiber-rich broadband networks, we are in a position to deliver gigabit services by deploying the next generation DOCSIS 3.1 technology. DOCSIS 3.1 technology is an international standard that defines the requirements for data transmission over a cable system. Not only does DOCSIS 3.1 technology improve our internet speeds and reliability, it allows for efficient network growth. Currently, our ultra-high-speed internet service is based primarily on DOCSIS 3.1 technology, and we offer this technology in all of our markets. As of the end of 2022, both the VMO2 JV s and the VodafoneZiggo JV s broadband networks were capable of offering every customer of the VMO2 JV and the VodafoneZiggo JV gigabit internet speeds. 
 
 I-8 

We offer value-added broadband services in certain of our markets for an incremental charge. These services include Intelligent WiFi features, security (e.g., anti-virus, anti-spyware, firewall and spam protection), Smart Home services, and online storage solutions and web spaces. Subscribers to our internet service pay a monthly fee based on the tier of service selected. In addition to the monthly fee, customers pay an activation service fee upon subscribing to an internet service. This one-time fee may be waived for promotional reasons. We determine pricing for each different tier of internet service through an analysis of speed, market conditions and other factors. 
 
 Mobile Services 
 
 Mobile services are another key building block for us to provide customers with seamless connectivity. Telenet, the VMO2 JV, the VodafoneZiggo JV and Sunrise offer mobile services as mobile network providers, and VM Ireland offers mobile services as an MVNO over a third-party network through Three (Hutchison). 
 
 Pursuant to VM Ireland s agreement with Three (Hutchison) to provide mobile services as an MVNO, Three (Hutchison) leases a third-party s radio access network and owns the core network, including switching, backbone and interconnections. VM Ireland s MVNO arrangement with Three (Hutchison) permits VM Ireland to offer its customers mobile services without needing to build and operate a cellular radio tower network. 
 
 In each of our markets, we offer a range of mobile related services. The majority of subscribers take a post-paid service plan, which has an agreed monthly fee for a set duration (typically 1 to 2 years). The monthly fee will vary depending on the country and service package selected. Service packages can have different levels of data allowances, voice minutes and network speed, as well as differing other aspects, such as roaming charges and contract duration. Post-paid services are also offered as a bundle with fixed services, and by taking a converged offering, customers typically receive some benefits such as lower total cost or additional features. Post-paid services are offered to both business and retail consumers. In addition, we offer pre-paid mobile services, where the customers pay in advance for a pre-determined amount of airtime or data and which generally have no minimum contract term. In countries where we operate as a mobile service operator, we also offer a number of MVNOs, where other mobile providers use our mobile network for their mobile offering. 
 
 Video Services 
 
 Our video service is, and continues to be, one of the foundations of our product offerings in our markets. Our cable operations offer multiple tiers of digital video programming and audio services, starting with a basic video service. Subscribers to our basic video service pay a fixed monthly fee and receive digital video channels (including a growing number of high definition HD and ultra-high definition 4K resolution 4K channels) and several digital and analog radio channels, as well as an electronic programming guide. We tailor our video services in each country of operation based on programming preferences, culture, demographics and local regulatory requirements. 
 
 We also offer a variety of premium channel packages to meet the interests of our subscribers. For an additional monthly charge, a subscriber may upgrade to one of our extended digital tier services and receive an increased number of video and radio channels, including the channels in the basic tier service and additional HD and 4K channels. Our channel offerings include general entertainment, sports, movies, series, documentaries, lifestyles, news, adult, children and ethnic and foreign channels. 
 
 Discounts to our monthly service fees are available to any subscriber who selects a bundle of two or more of our services bundled services ): video, internet, fixed-line telephony and, in most of our markets, mobile services. Bundled services consist of double-play for two services, triple-play for three services and, where available, quad-play for four services. 
 
 To meet customer demands, we have enhanced our video services with additional relevant content services and features, which increases viewing satisfaction and addresses individual user needs. Our latest next generation product suite is called Horizon 4 , a cloud-based, multi-screen entertainment platform that combines linear television (including recording and replay features), premium video-on-demand VoD offerings, an increasing amount of integrated premium global and local video applications and mobile viewing into one entertainment experience. Horizon 4 comes with a state-of-the-art personal user interface that is intuitively easy to navigate. Content recommendations and favorite channel settings can be customized to individual user profiles. Video playback control, navigation shortcuts and content searches can all be conducted via a voice control button on the remote control, a feature highly appreciated by our customers. Horizon 4 is available in all of our markets on the latest set top boxes and is capable of delivering 4K video content, including high dynamic range. The platform also features a Personal Home page that automatically aggregates content, both linear and VoD, in a streamlined user interface, based on the user s viewing habits. It has achieved significant positive customer feedback, manifesting in high product net promoter score figures. Horizon 4 is marketed under the name Telenet TV-Box in Belgium, Sunrise TV in Switzerland, 
 I-9 

Virgin TV360 in the U.K., through the VMO2 JV, and Ireland and MediaBox Next in the Netherlands through the VodafoneZiggo JV. 
 
 In the U.K., the forerunner product of Horizon 4 is based on the TiVo platform and was developed under a strategic partnership agreement with TiVo Inc. The TiVo platform is deployed on a basic set-top box as well as the Virgin Media V6 box. Similar to Horizon 4, the Virgin Media V6 box combines 4K video, including high dynamic range, with improved streaming functionalities and more processing power. The Virgin Media V6 box allows customers to record six channels simultaneously while watching a seventh channel. Customers can also start watching a program on one television and pick up where they left off on other boxes in another room or through an app on their smart phones and tablets. Over 50 of the VMO2 JV s customers have the Virgin Media V6 box. Similar to the hardware already deployed via the VodafoneZiggo JV, over time these V6 boxes will be flashed with the latest Horizon 4 software, bringing our latest and most successful television and entertainment experience to the VMO2 JV s customers without the need to exchange the installed hardware. Approximately 25 of the VMO2 JV s customers are on the Horizon 4 platform. 
 
 In the summer of 2020, we launched our first IP-only streaming device in our former Polish operations, which runs the full Horizon 4 product suite and features a small puck-like form factor that can be tucked away behind a TV screen. This all-IP mini 4K capable TV box has extremely low power consumption, and its casing is made from recycled plastic, proudly winning us the Digital TV Europe s Video Tech Innovation Sustainability Award in December 2020 as well as the Red Dot Product Design Award in 2021. We have also launched this all-IP 4K capable TV box in Switzerland, the Netherlands and the U.K. We intend to continue rolling out this product to our other markets in the coming years. 
 
 Underpinned by this new IP-only streaming device, we launched our first subscription VoD-focused proposition in the U.K. called Stream . In addition to a slimmer channel lineup, this new package allows customers to pick and choose their favorite entertainment packages each month (e.g., Netflix, Disney+ and Prime Video) and get a 10 credit back for each subscription they add via our platform. By bundling their over the top OTT subscriptions together, customers also have an easy-to-see overview of what they are paying for and can manage them in a straightforward way, allowing for added flexibility as their viewing habits change. 
 
 One of our key video services is Replay TV . Through Replay TV, the last seven days of content (subject to rights related to blackouts) is made available via the electronic programming guide EPG for on demand viewing. Customers can simply open the EPG, scroll back and replay linear programming instantly. This same technical solution also allows our customers to replay a television program from the start even while the live broadcast is in progress. Additionally, customers have the option of recording television programs in the cloud (or onto the hard disk drive in the set top box in the U.K., through the VMO2 JV, and in Ireland, through VM Ireland). Replay TV is one of the most used and appreciated features on our platforms. 
 
 In most of our markets, we offer transactional VoD giving subscribers access to thousands of movies and television series. In several of our markets, our subscription VoD service is included in certain of our video offerings. This service is tailored to the specific market based on available content, consumer preferences and competitive offers, and it includes various programming, such as music, kids, documentaries, adult, sports and TV series. We continue to develop our VoD services to provide a growing collection of programming from local and international suppliers, including, among others, Disney/Fox, NBC/Universal, CBS/Paramount, Warner Bros.-Discovery and Sony. In addition, in all of our markets we offer global premium OTT services such as Netflix, YouTube and Amazon Prime Video, and we also offer local OTT services via a large portion of our set-top boxes. These types of paid subscription services can be bundled into customers packages like in the Stream proposition or, in many cases, added directly to customers bills, offering them further convenience. 
 
 Most of this content is also available via our online mobile app, Horizon Go , which is available on mobile devices (iOS and Android) and, in some markets as well, via Amazon Fire TV, Apple TV and Android TV devices. Thanks to the 360 integration of Horizon 4 across multiple screens, customers can pause a program, series or movie and seamlessly continue watching from where they left off on another device, whether on a television, tablet, smart phone or laptop. Additionally, Horizon Go enables customers to remotely schedule the recording of a television program on their Horizon 4 box at home. 
 
 Telephony Services 
 
 Multi-feature telephony services are available through voice-over-internet-protocol VoIP technology in most of our broadband communication markets. In the U.K., the VMO2 JV also provides traditional circuit-switched telephony services. We pay interconnect fees to other telephony and internet providers when calls by our subscribers terminate on another network and receive similar fees from providers when calls by their users terminate on our network through interconnection points. 
 
 I-10 

Our telephony service may be selected in several of our markets on a standalone basis and in all of our markets in combination with one or more of our other services. Our telephony service includes a basic fixed-line telephony product for line rental and various calling plans, which may consist of any of the following: unlimited network, national or international calling, unlimited off-peak calling and minute packages, including calls to fixed and mobile phones. We also offer value added services, such as a personal call manager, unified messaging and a second or third phone line at an incremental cost. 
 
 Multiple Dwelling Units and Partner Networks 
 
 In July of 2022, Telenet entered into an agreement with Fluvius System Operator CV Fluvius in which Telenet and Fluvius agreed to create a separate, self-funding infrastructure company in the Flanders region of Belgium NetCo that will operate the network infrastructure assets of both companies in the region. NetCo expects to further roll-out and operate a hybrid fiber coaxial HFC and fiber-to-the-home FTTH network within Telenet s current geographic footprint. Following the closing of this transaction, Telenet will become a wholesale access client of NetCo. This transaction is subject to regulatory approval by the European Commission, which is expected to be received mid-2023. Upon closing of the transaction with Fluvius, the long-term lease that Telenet currently has with Fluvius will terminate. 
 
 Pursuant to an agreement executed on June 28, 2008 (the 2008 PICs Agreement with four associations of municipalities in Belgium (the pure intercommunales or PICs ), Telenet leases the PICs broadband communications network and, accordingly, makes its services available to all of the homes passed by the cable network owned by the PICs. Telenet has a direct customer relationship with the video subscribers on the PICs network. Pursuant to the 2008 PICs Agreement, Telenet has full rights to use substantially all of the PICs network under a long-term finance lease. Unless extended, the 2008 PICs Agreement will expire on September 23, 2046, and cannot be terminated earlier (except in the case of non-payment or bankruptcy of Telenet). For additional information on the 2008 PICs Agreement, see note 18 to our consolidated financial statements included in Part II of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. 
 
 For over 70 of Sunrise s basic video subscribers, Sunrise maintains billing relationships with landlords or housing associations and provides basic video service to the tenants. The landlord or housing association administers the billing for the basic video service with their tenants and manages service terminations for their rental units. When tenants select triple-play bundles with or without mobile service from Sunrise, they then migrate to a direct billing relationship with us. 
 
 Sunrise offers broadband internet, enhanced video and telephony services directly to the video cable subscribers of those partner networks that enter into service operating contracts with Sunrise. Sunrise has the direct customer billing relationship with these subscribers. By permitting Sunrise to offer some or all of its broadband internet, video and telephony products directly to those partner network subscribers, Sunrise s service operating contracts have expanded the addressable markets for Sunrise s digital products. In exchange for the right to provide digital products directly to the partner network subscribers, Sunrise pays to the partner network a share of the revenue generated from those subscribers. Sunrise also provides network maintenance services and engineering and construction services to its partner networks.

 testing new technologies. 
 
 As stated above, we are expanding our HFC and FTTH footprint. In addition, we are seeking mobile service opportunities where we have established cable networks and expanding our fixed-line networks where we have a strong mobile offering. This will allow us to offer converged fixed-line and mobile services to our customers. 
 
 We deliver high-speed data and fixed-line telephony over our broadband network in our markets. The cable networks of our operations in Europe are connected to our Aorta backbone. The Aorta backbone is recognized as a Tier 1 Carrier, which permits us to serve our customers through settlement-free collaboration with other carriers without the cost of using a third-party network. 
 
 In support of our connectivity strategy, we are moving our customers into a gigabit society. All of our broadband networks are already capable of supporting the next generation of ultra-high-speed internet service at gigabit speeds. To provide these speeds to our subscribers, we plan to grow our base of DOCSIS 3.1 technology throughout our footprint. The use of DOCSIS 3.1 technology provides us significantly higher efficiencies on our networks and allow us to offer faster speeds, in-home WiFi and better services. The new gateways and the continued upgrades to our network in the coming years will allow us to maximize high-speed connectivity over our broadband networks and deliver gigabit services in a cost-effective manner. It will also allow us to meet the expectations of our customers for high-speed internet access both in cities and rural areas of our footprint. While DOCSIS 3.1 technology will provide up to 2.5 Gbps, in 2023, we plan to deploy XGS-PON technology across our FTTH footprint, enabling speeds of up to 10 Gbps. In addition, we have started prototyping technology that is anticipated to equally provide 10 Gbps capabilities across our HFC footprint. 
 
 Supply Sources 
 
 Content . In our markets, entertainment platforms remain a key part of the telecommunication services bundle. Therefore, in addition to providing services that allow our customers to view programming when and where they want, we are investing in content that customers want. Our content strategy is based on: 
 
 proposition (exceeding our customers entertainment desires and expectations); 
 product (delivering the best content available); 
 I-14 

procurement (investment in the best brands, movies, shows and sports); and 
 partnering (strategic alignment, acquisitions and growth opportunities). 
 
 We license almost all of our programming and on-demand offerings from content providers and third-party rights holders, including broadcasters and cable programming networks. Under our channel distribution agreements, we generally pay a monthly fee on a per channel or per subscriber basis, with occasional minimum pay guarantees. For on-demand programming, we generally pay a revenue share for transactional VoD (occasionally with minimum guarantees) and either a flat fee or a monthly fee per subscriber for subscription VoD. For a majority of our agreements, we seek to include the rights to offer the licensed programming to our customers through multiple delivery platforms and through our apps for smart phones and tablets. 
 
 In seeking licenses for content, we, including the VMO2 JV and the VodafoneZiggo JV, as applicable, partner with leading international and regional pay television providers, such as Disney, Sony, UKTV Paramount Global, AMC, NBCUniversal, RTL, BBC and Warner Bros. Discovery (including HBO). We also seek to carry in each of our markets key public and private broadcasters, and in some markets, we acquire local premium programming through select relationships with companies such as Sky plc Sky ), BT Group plc BT ), Warner Bros. Discovery and CANAL+ Polska S.A. For our VoD services, we license a variety of programming, including box sets of television series, movies, music, kids programming and documentaries. 
 
 In recent years, OTT apps have become increasingly important in the content space and, as part of our content strategy, we have put in place deals with a number of global and regional app providers. We currently have arrangements with Disney (The Walt Disney Company Limited and The Walt Disney Company Benelux), Netflix International B.V. Netflix and with Amazon Europe Core S.A.R.L. Amazon ). Pursuant to these arrangements, Disney+, Netflix and Amazon Prime Video services, respectively, are available via certain of our set-top boxes to our video customers across many of our markets each as premium OTT services. The Disney + app is available to customers in the U.K. through the VMO2 JV and in the Netherlands (launched December 2022) through the VodafoneZiggo JV. The Netflix app is available to customers in the U.K., through the VMO2 JV, the Netherlands through the VodafoneZiggo JV, Ireland, Switzerland and Belgium. The Amazon Prime Video app is currently available to our customers in the U.K. through the VMO2 JV, the Netherlands through the VodafoneZiggo JV, Ireland, Switzerland and Belgium. We also entered into an arrangement with Google Ireland Limited for the YouTube and YouTube Kids services apps which are available via certain of our set top boxes to customers in the U.K. through the VMO2 JV, the Netherlands through the VodafoneZiggo JV, Ireland, Switzerland and Belgium. In order to tailor our entertainment offerings to each market, we have added various locally relevant apps such as BBC iPlayer in the U.K. through the VMO2 JV, NPO Start and Videoland in the Netherlands through the VodafoneZiggo JV, VRT Max in Belgium and BluePlay in Switzerland. In addition, we have concluded deals with the Viaplay group (previously NENT) for the Viaplay service in the Netherlands through the VodafoneZiggo JV, which launched in March 2022. 
 
 Exclusive content is another element of our content strategy. To support this approach, we are investing in content assets. We have invested in various content companies, including ITV, All3Media, Lionsgate, Virgin Media TV, SBS Belgium, Woestijnvis and Caviar Group. We are also investing in sports, both as a broadcaster and as a rights owner. We have our own sports channels, under the Play Sports brand in Belgium which is exclusively available to Telenet customers, and MySports in Switzerland, which Sunrise licenses to other platforms in Switzerland. In Ireland, Virgin Media customers have access to VM More which includes sports programming as well as first look products and premium content. In addition, the VodafoneZiggo JV owns Ziggo Sport and commissions the production of certain shows such as Rondo and Race Cafe . The basic Ziggo Sport service is available exclusively to the VodafoneZiggo JV s customers; however, the premium service is widely available through license arrangements. 
 
 In addition, we have commissioned our own drama series content. Through All3Media, we co-produced a television series, known as The Feed , which was released in 2019 in several of our markets, and co-produced Blood in Ireland, which aired in 2018 and 2020. With Lionsgate, we pre-purchased the spy thriller series The Rook , which premiered in 2019. In addition, we have produced the Swiss sitcom Fassler-Kunz , the Swiss series Im Heimatland and the original Belgian series Chauss e d Amour and De Dag with local production companies. These television series will primarily be available to our customers on an on-demand basis. We will also continue to commission, produce and/or co-produce content for our free-to-air FTA assets and VoD platforms in Ireland and Telenet will continue to commission, produce and/or co-produce content for its FTA assets via SBS Belgium and VoD platforms in Belgium, mainly via Streamz , its joint venture for subscription VoD with DPG Media. 
 
 Customer Premises Equipment . We purchase each type of CPE from a number of different suppliers. CPE includes set-top boxes, modems, WiFi routers and boosters, digital video recorders DVRs ), tuners and similar devices. For each type of equipment, we retain specialists to provide customer support. For our broadband services, we use a variety of suppliers for our network equipment and the various services we offer. Similarly, we use a variety of suppliers for mobile handsets to offer our customers mobile services. 
 I-15 

Software Licenses . We license software products, including email and security software, and content, such as news feeds, from several suppliers for our internet services. The agreements for these products typically require us to pay a fee for software licenses and/or a share of advertising revenue for content licenses. For our mobile network operations and our fixed-line telephony services, we license software products, such as voicemail, text messaging and caller ID, from a variety of suppliers. For these licenses we seek to enter into long-term contracts, which generally require us to pay based on usage of the services. 
 
 For mobile services in Ireland provided through an MVNO arrangement with Three (Hutchison), we are dependent on third-party wireless network providers. Our MVNO operation in Ireland has an agreement with Three (Hutchison) to carry the mobile communications traffic of our customers. We seek to enter into medium to long-term arrangements for these services. A termination of this arrangements could significantly impact our MVNO-operated mobile services in Ireland. 

Competition 
 
 All of our businesses operate in highly competitive and rapidly evolving markets. The speed of technological advancements is likely to continue to increase, giving customers more options for telecommunications services and products. Our customers want access to high quality telecommunication products that provide a seamless connectivity experience. Accordingly, our ability to offer converged services (video, internet and telephony through our, fixed and mobile networks) is a key component of our strategy. In many of our markets, we compete with incumbent companies that provide converged mobile and fixed-line services, as well as companies that are established in one or more communication products. Many of these companies have extensive resources allowing them to offer competitively priced converged services. Consequently, our businesses face significant competition. Our ability to offer high-quality and attractive triple-play or quad-play bundles and fixed-mobile convergence bundles in these markets is one of our key strategies to attract and retain customers. We seek to distinguish ourselves through our multimedia gateway services, interactive video products (such as Replay TV and VoD), proprietary sports offerings, extensive content offers (for both in and out of the home) and our high-speed connectivity services backed by intelligent in-home WiFi solutions. In this section, we begin with an overview on the competitive nature of the broadband internet, video, mobile and telephony services in our markets, and then provide information on key competitors in our more material markets. 
 
 Internet 
 
 Our businesses face competition in a rapidly evolving broadband marketplace from both incumbent and non-incumbent telecommunications companies, mobile operators and other internet service providers, many of which have substantial resources. The internet services offered by these competitors include both fixed-line broadband internet via cable, digital subscriber lines DSL or FTTx and wireless broadband. These competitors have a range of product offerings with varying speeds and pricing, as well as interactive services, data and content services offered to households and businesses. With the demand for mobile internet services increasing, competition from wireless services using various advanced technologies is an important competitive factor. In all of our markets, competitors offer high-speed mobile data via 4G or 5G networks. In this intense competitive environment, internet speed and pricing are the key criteria for customers. 
 
 Our strategy is seamless speed leadership. Our focus is on increasing the maximum speed of our connections while providing a reliable customer experience and offering a variety of service tiers, prices, bundled products and a range of value-added services, including intelligent in-home connectivity solutions. We update our bundles and packages on an ongoing basis to meet the needs of our customers and to retain an attractive value-for-money ratio. Ultra-high download speeds of 1 Gbps are available throughout our operational footprints in each of the U.K., Belgium, the Netherlands, Switzerland and Ireland. We use our competitively priced ultra-high-speed internet services to encourage customers to switch to our services from other providers. 
 
 A notable competitive factor for us is overbuilding of our networks with FTTx technology by incumbent companies and other third parties. At the moment, we do not consider our networks to be critically overbuilt; however certain FTTx providers accelerated the rollout of their networks. We are confident that our hybrid fiber-coaxial networks can be upgraded to higher speeds, to match potential FTTx based products. Furthermore, whenever it makes operational and economic sense, we seek to capitalize on opportunities to grow our network capabilities through FTTx technology. This can be seen through the VMO2 s previously-communicated plans to upgrade its entire U.K. fixed network to full FTTx, as well as the nexfibre JV s announced fiber project that will target building up to 7 million new FTTH homes in the coming years. 
 
 Telenet . In the Flanders region of Belgium, Telenet is the leading provider of residential broadband internet services. Telenet s primary competitor is Proximus NV/SA Proximus ). Proximus is a well-established competitor offering quad-play bundles. Proximus DSL and very high-speed DSL technology VDSL services provide download speeds up to 100 Mbps. Moreover, Proximus offers up to 1 Gbps speed via its fiber network that is available in selected cities 
 I-16 

and is being actively deployed elsewhere in the country. Similar to its video services, Telenet faces competition in the provision of internet services from other providers who have wholesale access to Telenet s cable network. Through such access, Orange Belgium N.V Orange Belgium currently offers its mobile subscribers a triple-play bundle including enhanced video, mobile and fixed broadband internet services. Furthermore, Orange Belgium is awaiting regulatory approval for its acquisition of VOO, a telecom operator that owns cable networks in the Wallonia region of Belgium. Telenet has signed an Memorandum of Understanding with Orange Belgium with respect to potentially gaining access to VOO s cable network in Wallonia. Furthermore, Telenet and Fluvius entered into an agreement to create NetCo, regulatory approval for which is expected in mid-2023. 
 
 Sunrise . In Switzerland, Swisscom is the largest provider of broadband internet services, and is Sunrise s primary competitor. Swisscom offers download speeds ranging from 100 Mbps to up to 10 Gbps, depending on the region. Swisscom continues to expand its FTTx network to Switzerland households in our footprint, as well as in our partner network footprints. Salt, a predominantly mobile player, also competes in this arena, with a focus on fixed-mobile convergence through a combination of FTTx and fixed wireless access technologies offering 10 Gbps internet speeds. In this competitive market, Sunrise offers a fixed-mobile convergence portfolio called Sunrise Up , enabling customers to benefit from the ultra-high-speed connectivity that is available across all of Sunrise s customer premises and offers significant fixed and mobile cross-selling opportunities. For more information on the Sunrise Acquisition, see note 5 to our consolidated financial statements included in Part II of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. 
 
 Significant Joint Ventures . 
 
 In the U.K., the VMO2 JV faces numerous competitors for broadband internet services, the largest of which is BT. BT is actively building out its FTTx network through its subsidiary, Openreach, to support its goal of covering 25 million homes by the end of 2026. In support of this mission, BT offers a range of ultrafast consumer packages with speeds of up to 900 Mbps. As noted above, the VMO2 JV has reached 1 Gbps connectivity in all of its 16.1 million premises. Moreover, the VMO2 JV announced its intention to upgrade its fixed network to full fiber-to-the-premise by the end of 2028 and extend its FTTH footprint to up to 23 million premises through its partnership with the nexfibre JV. This plan is expected to fuel connectivity innovation for consumers and businesses, create options to potentially pursue the broadband wholesale market in the U.K. and to protect from growing FTTx competition. 
 
 The VodafoneZiggo JV s primary competitor, Koninklijke KPN N.V. KPN ), offers internet protocol television IPTV over its FTTx network and through broadband internet connections using DSL or VDSL. Where KPN has enhanced its VDSL system, it offers broadband internet with download speeds of up to 200 Mbps, and on its FTTx networks, it offers download speeds of up to 1 Gbps. Portions of the VodafoneZiggo JV s network have been overbuilt by KPN s and other providers FTTx networks. In 2021, KPN and pension fund, APG, established a joint venture company called Glaspoort, that is targeting fiber rollouts in medium-dense, rural and industrials areas by connecting up to 1.2 million households and businesses by 2026. KPN will also continue to pursue its existing fiber roll-out plans in the coming years, with Glaspoort s scope expected to accelerate KPN s goal to reach approximately 80 FTTx coverage by 2026. We expect competitive pressure from the fiber overbuild to intensify in the coming periods. At the end of 2022, all of the VodafoneZiggo JV s 7.4 million households had access to ultra-fast 1 Gbps connectivity to support our competitive edge and speed advantage. 
 
 Video Distribution 
 
 Our video services compete primarily with traditional FTA broadcast television services, direct-to-home satellite service providers, OTT and broadcaster VoD providers, as well as other fixed-line and mobile telecommunications carriers and broadband providers offering a similar range of video services. Many of these competitors have a national footprint and offer features, pricing and video services individually and in bundles comparable to what we offer. 
 
 OTT video content providers utilizing our or our competitors high-speed internet connections are also a significant competitive factor, as are other video service providers that overlap our service areas. The OTT video providers (such as HBO Now, Amazon Prime Video, Netflix, Disney+ and AppleTV+) offer VoD service for television series, movies and programming from broadcasters. Generally, the content libraries of such services are offered for a monthly fee. Typically, these services are available on multiple devices in and out of the home. Moreover, broadcasters offer direct to customer content, including VoD, live and catch-up television via their own platforms (such as BBC iPlayer, Discovery and RTL). To retain our competitive position, we provide our subscribers with TV everywhere products and premium OTT video services through our online mobile apps, VoD and Replay TV services or through our arrangements with Netflix, Amazon, YouTube and others. Our businesses also compete to varying degrees with other sources of information and entertainment, such as online entertainment, newspapers, magazines, books, live entertainment/concerts and sporting events. 
 I-17 

Our ability to attract and retain customers depends on our continued ability to acquire appealing content, provide easy to use services on acceptable terms and to deliver content on multiple devices inside and outside the home. Some competitors have obtained long-term exclusive contracts for certain programming, which limits the opportunities for other providers to offer such programs. Our operations have limited access to certain of such programming through select contracts with these companies, including Sky and BT in the U.K. Moreover, telecommunication providers increasingly offer access to OTT platforms through their systems. If exclusive content offerings increase through other providers, programming options could be a deciding factor for subscribers on selecting a video service. 
 
 We compete on value by offering advanced digital services with a premier user interface, such as cloud recording and DVR functionality, HD/4K, VoD, voice control, OTT aggregation, Replay TV and multiscreen services via a superior user interface. We also compete by offering attractive content packages, as well as bundled services, at reasonable prices. In each of the countries where we operate, we tailor our packages to include attractive channel offerings and offer recurring discounts for bundled services and loyalty contracts, as well as integrated billing for OTT services. In addition, from time to time, we modify our digital channel offerings to improve the quality of our programming. Where mobile voice and data are available, we focus on our converged service offerings at attractive prices. In our other operations, we use the triple-play bundle as a means of driving video, as well as other products where convenience and price can be leveraged across the portfolio of services. We also continue to enhance our Horizon 4 platform to meet our customers desire to view programming anytime and anywhere, such as new applications and expanding its availability in our markets. 
 
 Telenet . Telenet s principal competitor is Proximus, the incumbent telecommunications operator, which has interactive digital television, replay television, VoD, OTT and HD service as part of its video offer, as well as mobile-only video propositions tailored to the needs of younger market segments. Proximus offers customers a wide range of both individual and bundled services at competitive prices. Also, as a result of regulatory obligations, Telenet and other Belgian cable operators must give alternative providers access to their cable networks. Orange Belgium gained such access in 2016 and currently offers its mobile subscribers a triple play bundle, including mobile, enhanced video and broadband internet services. Telenet may face increased competition from other providers of video services who take advantage of the wholesale access and may be able to offer triple- and quad-play services. For more information on wholesale access, see Regulatory Matters Belgium. 
 In order to compete effectively against alternative providers, Telenet leverages its extensive cable network, the broad acceptance of its basic cable television services, its Telenet TV offering and its additional features, such as HD and DVR functionality, VoD offerings, its Play Sports channel and original programming delivered via the Horizon 4 multimedia box. It is also using mobile services to drive its other products through its converged offerings. In addition, Telenet and DPG Media now offer a streaming platform called Streamz, which combines some of the best locally produced series and must-see international content from HBO, extensive kids content, films and documentaries. Streamz is available for a monthly fee. 
 
 Sunrise . Our main competitor in Switzerland is Swisscom, the incumbent telecommunications operator, which provides IPTV services over DSL, VDSL and FTTx networks. Swisscom offers VoD services, DVR and replay functionality, HD channels and has exclusive rights to distribute certain sports programming. Swisscom launched an advanced set-top box in the market with voice control, Smart Home integration and content aggregation beyond video, such as music streaming and gaming services. Although its presence is limited, Salt focuses on value propositions by including TV within their bundles and providing access to OTT via Apple TV. In this saturated market, price competition and high promotional intensity are significant factors. To compete effectively in Switzerland, Sunrise promotes its TV offering and a related family of products together with Replay TV and VoD, giving subscribers the ability to personalize their programming and viewing preferences while delivering an excellent user interface with voice control. Sunrise has its own sports channel, My Sports and aggregates third-party apps (e.g. Netflix, Amazon Prime Video, Sky Show, YouTube and others). Sunrise has expanded its video product offering to Yallo, its ancillary brand, an important step in moving Yallo to full telecommunications functionality. Yallo customers can access over 270 channels (many in Full HD and Dolby Digital), replay services and streaming apps such as Netflix, Disney+ and Amazon Prime which come pre-installed on the TV box. For more information on the Sunrise Acquisition, see note 5 to our consolidated financial statements included in Part II of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. 
 
 I-18 

Significant Joint Ventures . 
 
 The VMO2 JV s principal competitors for digital television services are Sky and FTA television providers. Other significant competitors are BT and TalkTalk Telecom Group plc TalkTalk ), each of which offer triple-play services, IPTV video services and multimedia home gateways. Sky owns the U.K. rights to various entertainment, sports and movie programming. Sky is both a principal competitor and an important supplier of content to the VMO2 JV. Various Sky channels, including Sky Sports , are available over Sky s satellite system and our cable networks, as well as via Sky s apps and online players and other television platforms, and some of the channels are available on BT and TalkTalk platforms. The VMO2 JV distributes several basic and premium video channels supplied by Sky. BT is also both a principal competitor and an important supplier of content to the VMO2 JV. BT owns premium BT Sport channels, providing a range of sports content, including football (soccer) from the English Premier League and its exclusive rights to the UEFA Champions League and the UEFA Europa League. The BT Sport channels are available on the VMO2 JV s cable network as well as its competitors networks. The VMO2 JV is expanding its broadband network and actively promoting its 4K and HDR ready boxes running on its Horizon 4 platform (marketed as Virgin TV360 as well as it online streaming service, Virgin TV Go. Customers also have access to a new entertainment service, Stream, which is an all-in-one streaming TV box, combining TV channels and aggregating third-party subscription services such as Sky Sports, Netflix, and Disney+. Stream provides personalized viewing recommendations and allows customers to customize their subscription mix, billed through a single Virgin Media account. 
 
 The VodafoneZiggo JV primarily competes with KPN with respect to video distribution, which provides IPTV services over DSL, VDSL and FTTx networks. KPN offers many of the same interactive video service features as the VodafoneZiggo JV does including VoD services, DVR, replay functionality and HD channels. KPN also offers its customers bundling packages that include its video products, creating a highly competitive market for the VodafoneZiggo JV s products and services. 
 
 Mobile and Telephony Services 
 
 In Belgium, as a mobile network operator MNO ), we are one of the larger mobile providers based on number of SIM cards. The same is true for the VodafoneZiggo JV in the Netherlands. We also substantially expanded our mobile business with the acquisition of Sunrise in Switzerland and through the joint venture with Telef nica s U.K. brand, O2, in the U.K. In the markets where we are an MNO, we continue to deploy additional bandwidth and look to acquire additional spectrum to deliver our wide range of services to our customers and expand our 4G and 5G services. Competition remains significant across each of our markets. We offer various calling plans, such as unlimited calling, national or international calling and use converged bundles and benefits to cross-sell mobile to our existing fixed customers. Our ability to offer fixed-mobile convergence services is a key driver of growth. Furthermore, in order to address lower segments of the market, we operate with ancillary mobile brands, such as Base (Belgium), Yallow (Switzerland) and Hollandsnieuwe (Netherlands). 
 
 The market for fixed-line telephony services is saturated in all of our markets. Changes in market share are driven by the combination of price and quality of services provided and the inclusion of telephony services in bundled offerings. Our fixed-line telephony services compete against the incumbent telecommunications operators. In all of our markets, we also compete with other VoIP operators offering service across broadband lines. In addition, our businesses face competition from other FTTx-based providers or other indirect access providers. 
 
 In each of our markets, we face competition with a dominant fixed-line telephony provider, most of which also have competitive mobile offers based on 4G or 5G services. In our largest markets, the key dominant telephony providers are Proximus (Belgium) and Swisscom (Switzerland). These telephony competitors are also the largest mobile operators in these markets based on number of SIM cards. These competitors include their mobile products in bundles with fixed-line services. Moreover, there is a fundamental shift in customer preference towards mobile and OTT. As a result, we expect our fixed telephony user base to continue its decline in favor of mobile connectivity and OTT services. 

Human Capital Resources 
 
 As of December 31, 2022, our consolidated subsidiaries had an aggregate of approximately 10,100 full-time equivalent employees, including approximately 3,660 in Belgium, 2,980 in Switzerland, 1,260 in the U.K., 940 in the Republic of Ireland, 870 in the Netherlands, 280 in Slovakia and 110 in the United States. With respect to our significant nonconsolidated joint ventures, the VMO2 JV employs approximately 16,350 people and the VodafoneZiggo JV employs approximately 6,170 people. None of the above figures include contractors or temporary employees. 
 
 I-19 

A majority of our European employees are represented by workers councils. We strive to maintain a positive relationship with all of our employees, as well as the workers councils representing them where applicable. There have been no significant interruptions of our operations in recent years due to labor disputes. 
 
 In challenging our employees to achieve their full potential, become purposeful leaders and to Grow With Us , we commit significant resources and make ongoing investments toward the development of our employees leadership skills. Our skills development offerings cover key talent communities - from graduates and apprentices, to people managers, emerging leaders and senior leaders. Such programs include our Finance, Technology, CyberSecurity and People graduate schemes that thrust new graduates into our fast-paced and dynamic business model, giving them immediate real-world experience along with structured support from the company, so that each graduate exits their program prepared to be a leader of tomorrow. Liberty Global also aims to prepare its future senior leadership through its Fast Forward program, a year-long program in which high performing individuals are trained and challenged to become Liberty Global s leaders of tomorrow. We invest significantly in our employees, because we recognize that when each employee is supported and given the opportunity to succeed, our company as a whole flourishes. 
 
 We are committed to building a diverse, inclusive and equitable culture, where everyone belongs. We have been actively challenging our own behaviors and each other to create such culture. Being diverse, inclusive and equitable is important to our employees experience and performance, talent acquisition and retention, and it brings us closer to the communities in which we live and operate. In 2022, we built upon our Diversity, Equity Inclusion DE I ambitions. We have continued to work with our DE I Council, composed of our CEO and 19 executive representatives from around the company that meets regularly to discuss company strategies, initiatives and policies concerning DE I. We have worked closely with our five Employee Resource Groups ERGs that focus on gender, race and ethnicity, multigenerational families, disability, neurodiversity and LGBTQIA+, ensuring that we are actively listening and co-creating. The VMO2 JV and VodafoneZiggo JV, along with Sunrise and VM Ireland, also have their own ERGs to provide support for their local employees and to complement Liberty Global s DE I strategy and initiatives. In addition, our DE I Council has worked diligently to prepare concrete, implementable initiatives to further our collective DE I strategy. Such initiatives are measurable, allowing us to easily track our progress. 
 
 We also conduct compulsory anti-bullying, anti-discrimination and anti-harassment training for all of our employees in line with our Anti-Discrimination, Harassment and Bullying policy and engage in small-group, impactful conversations, centering on discrimination and harassment in the workplace. Our venture capital arm has committed 10 million to investing in start-up companies, including through our partner, Avesta Capital, that make a positive impact on society. These companies, such as Blue Studios, Kiira Health, BoxPower, Harvest Thermal and Sunny Day Fund are specifically focused on socially conscious business practices, such as tackling economic and social inequity, as well as climate change. Liberty Global prides itself on the achievements it has made with respect to DE I, but it recognizes that there is much work still to be done, and that to grow as a company we must invest in our people so that they can be themselves at work everyday. 
 
 Our compensation program is key to our company s success and incentivizes our management team to execute our financial and operational goals. We concentrate on attracting, retaining and motivating talented executives who can be responsive to new and different opportunities for our company and thereby create value for our customers and shareholders. The primary goals of our executive compensation program are to: motivate our executives to maximize their contributions to the company s success, attract and retain the best leaders for our business and align our executives interests with creating shareholder value. 
 
 At Liberty Global we are committed to the health and safety of our employees and visitors to our sites and we ensure compliance with all relevant national health and safety regulations. For employees, we currently utilize a hybrid work-from-home/work-from-office work program. We have also made available a series of well-being resources based on a four-pronged strategy focused on the mental, physical, social and financial aspects of health and well-being. Included in this strategy, among other things, is access to group training sessions, private work-out facilities, bicycle reimbursement plans, in-office flu vaccinations, and private check-up visits. 
 
 We measure employee engagement quarterly against external benchmarks defined by a leading human resources consultant. We perform in line with global industry benchmarks and exceed benchmarks set by high performing organizations in areas such as in inclusion, well-being, manager support and senior leadership communication. The high performing comparison group is comprised of organizations with strong financial performance and superior human resource practices, representing the gold standard for employee engagement. Survey results are owned by managers and executives, who are accountable for formulating action plans. In addition, we gather qualitative and quantitative insights with methods such as shorter-term pulse surveys and narrower focus groups. This approach informs decision making across key employee focus areas, including for example, well-being, work-from-home opportunities and skills development.

Additional information on our workforce and our commitment to our employees is made available in Liberty Global s Annual Corporate Responsibility Report, which we expect to be published on our website at the beginning of the third quarter of 2023. 
 
 Regulatory Matters 
 
 Overview 
 
 Video distribution, broadband internet, fixed-line telephony and mobile businesses are regulated in each of the countries in which we operate. The scope of regulation varies from country to country, although in some significant respects, regulation in E.U. markets is harmonized under the regulatory structure of the E.U. 
 
 Of the six countries in our footprint, four are part of the E.U.: the Republic of Ireland, the Netherlands (nonconsolidated joint venture), Belgium and Slovakia. Our other operations are in the U.K. (nonconsolidated joint venture) and Switzerland are not in the E.U. but generally enact rules similar to that of the E.U. 
 
 The U.K. formally left the E.U. on January 31, 2020, commonly referred to as Brexit . On December 24, 2020, the U.K. and the E.U. reached the Trade and Cooperation Agreement referred to as the E.U.-U.K. Agreement . Principles on state aid are also contained in the E.U.-U.K. Agreement to prevent either side from granting unfair subsidies, and to provide a dispute settlement mechanism to ensure businesses from the E.U. and the U.K. compete on a level playing field. In relation to the telecommunications sector, the U.K. and the E.U. have agreed to maintain the existing levels of liberalization in their markets, including standard provisions on authorizations, access to and use of telecoms networks, interconnection, fair and transparent regulation and the allocation of scarce resources. The E.U.-U.K. Agreement contains measures to encourage cooperation and promote fair and transparent rates for international mobile roaming. However, the U.K. previously introduced a number of measures aimed at providing safeguards for consumers, which continue to apply. Such measures include limits on the amount that customers can be charged for using mobile data abroad before having to opt in if they wish to use more data and alert warnings as customers reach various milestones in data allowances included within their packages. Additionally, the Northern Irish Protocol regulates the relationship between Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland, ensuring that no hard border is placed between the two, as well as keeping Northern Ireland inside the E.U. single market. The Northern Irish Protocol, while not material to our or the VMO2 JV s operations, affects the movement of consumer premises equipment and installation personnel between Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland. 
 
 In Switzerland, the distribution of radio and television is regulated under the Radio and Television Act. The provision of telecommunications services is regulated by the Telecommunications Act. In addition, the Competition Act, the Data Protection Act and the Act on the Surveillance of Post and Telecommunications are relevant to our business. 
 
 Sector Regulations 
 
 The European Electronic Communications Code (the Code is the primary source of regulation governing our E.U. operations. The Code came into effect on December 20, 2018 and has been transposed by a majority of the Member States and the U.K. into their respective national laws. On April 6, 2022, the European Commission referred a number of Member States to the Court of Justice of the European Union for being late with the transposition, including Ireland. Ireland is in the process of adopting two legislative instruments that should give effect to the Code, the European Communities (Electronic Communications) Regulations 2022 and the Communications Regulation (Enforcement) Bill 2022. The U.K. has largely transposed the Code into its national laws. Switzerland, while not part of the E.U., has a regulatory system that partially reflects the principles of the E.U. The Telecommunications Act in Switzerland regulates, in general, the transmission of information, including the transmission of radio and television signals. 
 
 The Code primarily seeks to develop open markets for communication services within Europe. It harmonizes the rules within the E.U. for the establishment and operation of electronic communication networks, including cable television and traditional telephony networks, and the offer of electronic communication services, such as telephony (including OTT services), internet and, to some degree, television services. 
 
 Set forth below are certain key provisions included in the Code that are most applicable to our operations. 
 
 Significant Market Power . Specific obligations imposed by National Regulatory Authorities NRAs in E.U. Member States apply only to service providers deemed to have Significant Market Power SMP in a relevant market. For purposes of the Code, a service provider has SMP where it enjoys a position of significant economic strength, affording it the power to behave independently of competitors, customers and consumers to an appreciable extent. 
 I-21 

If a service provider is found to have SMP in any particular market, the applicable NRA must impose certain conditions on that service provider. We have been found to have SMP in certain markets in which we operate and further findings of SMP are possible, which may negatively impact our business. However, across our footprint, we have noticed an increased tendency of NRAs towards deregulation, with only a small number of markets currently being subject to this type of regulation. 
 The U.K. has a similar system with the applicable NRA assessing markets on a forward-looking basis to determine SMP. In Switzerland, there is no such forward-looking system, rather a service provider can be regulated based on general competition law. 
 Must-Carry Obligations . Member States may impose reasonable must-carry obligations on certain service providers under their jurisdiction. Such obligations must be based on clearly defined general interest objectives, be proportionate and transparent and be subject to periodic review. The U.K. and Switzerland have a regulatory system that reflects these principles. We are subject to must carry regulations in all markets in which we operate, and we do not expect the such obligations to be curtailed in the foreseeable future. 
 
 NRAs may, in some cases, impose access obligations on service providers, regardless of whether they have SMP. Under the Code and the E.U. Broadband Cost Reduction Directive, service providers may be required to provide access to certain elements of their passive network infrastructure upon reasonable request if there are significant economic or physical replicability barriers. Service providers may be required to provide access to their active infrastructure as well but only if a number of additional requirements are met. The U.K. has a similar system in place, while the Telecommunications Act in Switzerland requires operators with a dominant position to grant access to other providers on a non-discriminatory manner at cost-oriented prices. 
 
 Net Neutrality, Roaming and Call Termination 
 
 In November 2015, the European Parliament adopted the regulation on the first E.U.-wide net neutrality regime. The regulation allows for specialized services, optimized for specific content and subjects service providers like Liberty Global, through its operating companies, to reasonable traffic management requirements. The U.K. transposed net neutrality into its national law following Brexit. In Switzerland, the Telecommunications Act introduced more transparent net neutrality regulation that allows for traffic management in limited circumstances (e.g., to fight exceptional network congestion). Customers must be informed if traffic is treated unequally and about the quality of the internet service (for both fixed and mobile internet). 
 
 The 2015 regulation mentioned above also prohibits retail roaming tariffs and sets wholesale roaming price caps. In 2019 the E.U. introduced caps on wholesale rates for intra-E.U. calls to bring these in line with the wholesale roaming caps. The Telecommunications Act in Switzerland implemented roaming obligations, including mandatory discounted roaming packages, per second or per kilobyte of roaming charges and capped fees for all roaming services. In relation to the U.K., E.U. operators are now free to raise wholesale charges for U.K. operators (and vice-versa) but may choose not to. 
 
 Call termination tariffs for SMP providers are set by NRAs, but for the E.U., the Code includes a system of single maximum, E.U.-wide voice termination rates for fixed and mobile. All fixed service providers are subject to a maximum fixed termination rate of 0.07 per minute, and by 2024 the single maximum rate for mobile termination will be 0.20 per minute. In the U.K., an SMP provider must provide termination on fair and reasonable terms, conditions and charges, which must be no higher than BT s regulated charges unless certain conditions are met. Switzerland does not follow the E.U. standard, however. Call termination rates in Switzerland are unregulated and commercially negotiated by operators. If an agreement cannot be found for fixed termination rates, the parties may initiate proceedings at the Communication Commission (ComCom), which then sets cost-oriented termination rates. Overall, termination rates in Switzerland are higher than the E.U. average. In each country in which we operate, we have been found to have SMP for call termination. 
 
 Broadcasting and Content Law 
 
 The Audiovisual Media Services Directive AVMSD governs the activities of broadcasters under E.U. law. The E.U. Member States that we operate in have fully transposed the AVMSD into their respective national laws. 
 
 Generally, broadcasts originating in and intended for reception within an E.U. Member State must respect the laws of that Member State. Pursuant to the AVMSD, however, E.U. Member States must allow broadcast signals of broadcasters established in another E.U. Member State to be freely transmitted within their territory, so long as the broadcaster complies with the law of their home state. In addition, when we offer third-party VoD services on our network, it is the third-party 
 I-22 

provider, and not us as the distributor, that is regulated in respect of these services. The U.K. and Switzerland have regulatory systems that also reflect these principles. 
 
 The AVMSD established quotas, applicable to both linear and non-linear services, for the transmission of European-produced programming and programs made by European producers who are independent of broadcasters. Such obligations are applicable to our businesses in the E.U. The U.K. and Switzerland have similar principles in their regulatory systems. 
 
 To build upon the AVMSD, the European Commission published a proposal for the Media Freedom Act in September of 2022. It is not clear at this time when this proposed law would be adopted and become effective. The new law aims to help ensure media pluralism across the E.U., as well as ownership transparency requirements, especially with respect to foreign financing and the introduction of a review mechanism for concentrations of media companies. We expect that the Media Freedom Act will impact our business, however, until the final legislation is adopted, we will not know to what extent. 
 
 Member States are also allowed to require service providers to contribute financially to the production of European works, including requiring financial contributions from VoD providers established in other territories that target audiences in their jurisdiction. Such obligations are applicable to (or are expected to become applicable to) certain of our businesses. 
 
 In addition, European Commission regulations mandate that commercial providers of online content services (including OTT service providers) enable subscribers who are temporarily present in any Member State to access and use online content services in substantially the same manner as in their country of residence. We comply with these content portability requirements. 
 
 In the U.K., the VMO2 JV is required to hold individual licenses under the Broadcasting Acts 1990 and 1996 for any television channels (including barker channels) that it owns or operates and to provide certain other services on its cable television platform, such as electronic program guides. These television licensable content service TLCS licenses are granted and administered by the U.K. Office of Communications Ofcom ), the U.K. s NRA. Under these licenses, each covered service must comply with a number of Ofcom codes, including the Broadcasting Code, and with all of Ofcom s directions. Breach of any of the terms of a TLCS license may result in the imposition of fines and, potentially, license revocation. 
 
 As a provider of an on-demand program service ODPS ), the VMO2 JV must comply with numerous statutory obligations related to editorial content and notify Ofcom of its intention to provide an ODPS. Failure to notify Ofcom or comply with the relevant statutory obligations may result in the imposition of fines or, ultimately, a prohibition on providing an ODPS. 
 
 Technological Regulation 
 
 The E.U. legislature is increasingly imposing additional mandatory requirements regarding energy consumption of the telecommunications equipment we provide our customers. We have been working to lower power consumption of our set-top boxes. Legislation in this area may be adopted that could adversely affect the cost and/or the functionality of equipment we deploy to customers. 
 
 Pursuant to an E.U. regulation on standby power (the Standby Regulation ), many devices are required to have either a low power standby mode or off mode, unless such mode is inappropriate for the intended use of the product. In particular, the Standby Regulation sets, among other things, the maximum power consumption of networked consumer equipment while in the so-called Networked Standby or High Network Availability modes. All of the devices we purchase and/or develop comply with the requirements of the Standby Regulation. 
 
 Also, the E.U. s Radio Equipment Directive regulates radio equipment held for sale. It sets essential requirements for safety and health, electromagnetic compatibility and the efficient use of the radio spectrum. 
 
 Due to a Mutual Recognition Agreement established between the E.U. and Switzerland, the Standby Regulation and the Radio Equipment Directive both apply in Switzerland. Before Brexit, the U.K. implemented the Standby Regulation and the Radio Equipment Directive into national law. 
 
 Through the E.U. s Radio Spectrum Policy Program, certain spectrum has been approved for mobile broadband use. The terms under which this spectrum becomes available varies among the European countries in which we operate, and certain uses of this spectrum may interfere with services carried on our cable networks. 
 
 I-23 

Privacy Regulation 
 
 In January 2017, the European Commission published a proposal for a revised e-Privacy regulation. Negotiations among E.U. Member States are still in process, and we cannot predict the ultimate outcome of these negotiations. In May 2018, the General Data Protection Regulation GDPR became effective in the E.U. The GDPR sets strict standards regarding the handling, use and retention of personal data. Organizations that fail to comply face stiff penalties. 
 
 The GDPR applies to the European Economic Area EEA ), which includes the E.U. and a number of countries, but does not include the U.K. or Switzerland. When personal data is transferred outside the EEA, special safeguards stemming from the GDPR, such as the adoption of adequacy decisions and the use of standard contractual clauses SCCs ), are enforced to ensure that data is transferred in a protected manner. Adequacy decisions indicate which third countries have sufficiently similar data protection laws in place to those provided under the GDPR. Transfers to an adequate third country is compared to a transmission of data within the E.U. 
 
 On June 28, 2021, the European Commission adopted an adequacy decision for the U.K., as the U.K. s data protection system is based on the same GDPR rules that were applicable when the U.K. was a Member State. However, the adequacy decision is subject to a sunset clause , which establishes the automatic expiration of the decision after four years from its adoption. The adequacy findings may then be renewed if the U.K. continues to ensure an adequate level of data protection. 
 
 On December 13, 2022, the European Commission adopted a draft adequacy decision for the E.U.-U.S. Data Privacy Framework, replacing the Privacy Shield deal which was struck down by the European Court of Justice in July 2020. U.S. companies will be able to join the E.U.-U.S. Data Privacy Framework by committing to comply with a detailed set of privacy obligations. E.U. citizens will also have access to a number of redress mechanisms in case their personal data is handled in violation of this framework, including an independent dispute resolution mechanism and a newly created Data Protection Review Court . The draft adequacy decision is now going through its adoption procedure and is expected to be finalized in the summer of 2023. 
 
 When a data transfer involves a third country that has not been granted an adequacy decision, our operations must use SCCs. The European Commission has issued an implementing decision on new SCCs, under which it makes clear that using standard contractual clauses does not automatically make an international data transfer GDPR compliant. Instead, the parties must perform transfer impact assessments in order to address any possible risks in the data transfer and take supplementary measures. The impact assessment takes into account maters such as the circumstances of the transfer, the nature of the parties, the personal data involved and the laws and practices of the country of destination. 
 
 A continued flow of personal data from the EEA to Switzerland is ensured by the revised Swiss Data Protection Act DPA ), which is expected to come into force on September 1, 2023. The DPA ensures compatibility with E.U. law and provides for better protection of personal data, more transparency regarding the processing of data and a strengthening of the individual s information rights (e.g., if such individual s data is processed in a foreign country). 
 
 Other Regulations 
 
 In addition to the industry-specific regimes discussed above, our operating companies must comply with a range of both specific and general legislation concerning cybersecurity and consumer protection, among other matters. 
 
 With respect to cybersecurity, in 2016, the E.U. adopted a directive on security of network and information systems NIS Directive ), which provides legal measures to boost the overall level of cybersecurity in the E.U. Our operations in the E.U. do not fall under the NIS Directive, but a transposition of the Directive in Ireland, Slovakia and the Netherlands has effectively introduced the NIS Directive concepts into those jurisdictions. The successor to the NIS Directive, a directive on measures for a high common level of cybersecurity across the E.U. NIS 2 Directive ), was adopted by the E.U. legislature and published on December 14, 2022. Member States will have until October 18, 2024 to transpose the directive into their national legislation. 
 
 The E.U. and U.K. have announced restrictions related to so-called high risk vendors HRVs in the telecommunications sector. The E.U. published a toolbox of suggested measures for regulating 5G networks, acknowledging the need for a risk assessment of 5G equipment suppliers and the need to adopt mitigating measures by E.U. governments. Some Member States are addressing security concerns by identifying individual HRVs in advance, whose equipment should be excluded or limited for all network operations in the country. Switzerland has not yet adopted a policy position on the matter, but is studying the matter with a view to the potential adoption of measures in the future. 
 
 I-24 

The U.K. s recent Telecoms Security Act imposes a new security framework on telecommunication providers and gives the U.K. government new powers to, among other things, direct telecommunication providers to remove HRVs from their networks. Similar legislation has also been adopted in the Netherlands and Belgium. 
 
 The Digital Markets Act and the Digital Services Act were adopted in September and October 2022, respectively and will become effective in 2024. While the Digital Markets Act will have an immaterial impact on our business, under the Digital Services Act we will have additional obligations imposed on us, including with respect to periodic reporting, content moderation and the establishment of points of contact with national authorities and customers. 
 
 In February 2022, the European Commission introduced the Data Act, which would require companies to share personal and non-personal data generated by IoT products with users and third parties, upon the user s request. The Data Act also requires companies to share personal and non-personal data with public sector bodies in situations of exceptional need, and imposes switching and interoperability requirements on cloud services. Negotiations between the European Council and the European Parliament are still in process, and we cannot predict the ultimate outcome of these negotiations. 
 
 The Corporate Sustainability Reporting Directive CSRD came into force on January 5, 2023. The CSRD extends and strengthens the existing rules on non-financial reporting and aims to eventually have the same standards for both sustainability reporting and financial reporting. Companies will have to report on how sustainability issues affect their business, as well as the impact of their activities on people and the environment. The CSRD also aims to simplify the reporting process for companies, providing a single framework for providing information to investors and stakeholders. The first of the reporting requirements relevant to Liberty Global will apply in 2025 (for fiscal year 2024 reporting), with additional reporting requirements coming into effect on a staggered basis until 2029. 
 
 Our operating companies are also subject to both national and European level regulations on competition and on consumer protection, which are largely regulated under the Code. For example, while our operating companies may offer their services in bundled packages in European markets, they are sometimes not permitted to make a subscription to one service, such as cable television, conditional upon a subscription to another service, such as telephony. They may also face restrictions on the degree to which they may discount certain products included in the bundled packages. 
 
 We often undergo close regulatory scrutiny from competition authorities, in particular with respect to proposed business combinations that often require clearance from the European Commission or national competition authorities, which can block, impose conditions on, or delay an acquisition, disposition or combination, thus possibly hampering our opportunities for growth. Additional scrutiny is also imposed under the national foreign direct investment screening regimes recently adopted by the U.K. and by some E.U. Member States. Such regimes which allow national governments to review and impose conditions on certain transactions involving critical infrastructures such as telecommunications. In the event conditions are imposed and we fail to meet them in a timely manner, the relevant authority or governments may impose fines and, if in connection with a transaction, may require restorative measures, such as a disposition of assets or divestiture of operations. 
 
 Belgium 
 
 Telenet has been found to have SMP in the wholesale broadband market, obliging it to (1) provide third-party operators with access to the digital television platform (including basic digital video and analog video) and (2) make available to third-party operators a bitstream offer of broadband internet access including fixed voice as an option. The Belgian NRA has imposed monthly wholesale cable resale access prices. These rates are expected to evolve over time due to, among other reasons, broadband capacity usage. 
 
 The obligations on Telenet may strengthen its competitors by granting them access to Telenet s fixed network to offer competing products and services notwithstanding Telenet s substantial investments in developing its high-performing fixed infrastructure. In addition, any access granted to competitors could (1) limit the bandwidth available to Telenet to provide new or expanded products and services to its customers, and (2) adversely impact Telenet s ability to maintain or increase its revenue and cash flows. The extent of any such adverse impacts ultimately will be dependent on the degree to which competitors take advantage of the access of Telenet s network, the rates that Telenet receives for such access and other competitive factors or market developments. 
 
 I-25 

Significant Joint Venture Entities 
 
 United Kingdom 
 
 End of Contract Notifications and Annual Best Tariff Notifications . Specific obligations regarding end of contract and annual best tariff notifications are imposed by Ofcom on providers. These require the VMO2 JV to (i) alert customers who are approaching the end of a minimum contract term to the fact that their contract period is coming to an end and to set out the best new price that the VMO2 JV can offer them and (ii) once a year, alert customers who are out of contract to that fact and again confirm the best new price the VMO2 JV can offer them. In both cases, the VMO2 JV must also set out the price available to new customers for an equivalent service offering. These requirements have adversely impacted our and the VMO2 JV s revenue since their implementation. 
 
 Broadband Expansion . The U.K. s Telecommunications Infrastructure (Leasehold Property) Act imposes building regulations that require new housing developments to have gigabit capable access. This new legislation comes as a result of the U.K. government s push to encourage greater investment in new digital infrastructure and deliver FTTH/gigabit capable networks to approximately 85 of U.K. premises by 2025. 
 
 Netherlands 
 
 From 2017 to 2021, the Netherlands NRA, the Autoriteit Consument Markt ACM ), conducted a market analysis of high-quality wholesale access. On November 18, 2021, the ACM submitted to the European Commission its intended decision to withdraw regulation of the high-quality business telecom services provided over KPN s network. On December 16, 2021, the European Commission indicated that it had no comments, resulting in the final decision of the ACM on December 23, 2021 to completely deregulate the high-quality wholesale access market in the Netherlands. 
 
 Available Information 
 
 All our filings with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (the SEC ), including our Annual Reports on Form 10-K, Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q and Current Reports on Form 8-K, as well as amendments to such filings are available on our internet website free of charge generally within 24 hours after we file such material with the SEC. Our website address is www.libertyglobal.com. The information on our website is not part of this Annual Report and is not incorporated by reference herein. The SEC also maintains a website address at www.sec.gov that contains reports, proxy and information statements and other information regarding issuers that file electronically with the SEC. 

Item 1A. RISK FACTORS 
 
 In addition to the other information contained in this Annual Report, you should consider the following risk factors in evaluating our results of operations, financial condition, business and operations or an investment in the shares of our company. 
 The risk factors described in this section have been separated into four groups: 
 risks that relate to the competition we or our affiliates face and the technology used in our businesses; 
 risks that relate to operating in overseas markets and being subject to foreign regulation; 
 risks that relate to certain financial matters; and 
 other risks, including risks that, among other things, relate to the obstacles that may be faced by anyone who may seek to acquire us. 
 
 Although we describe below and elsewhere in this Annual Report the risks we consider to be the most material, there may be other unknown or unpredictable economic, business, competitive, regulatory or other factors that also could have material adverse effects on our results of operations, financial condition, business or operations in the future. In addition, past financial performance may not be a reliable indicator of future performance and historical trends should not be used to anticipate results or trends in future periods. 
 
 If any of the events described below, individually or in combination, were to occur, our businesses, prospects, financial condition, results of operations and/or cash flows could be materially adversely affected. 
 
 I-26 

Factors Relating to Competition and Technology 
 
 We operate in increasingly competitive markets, and there is a risk that we will not be able to effectively compete with other service providers. The markets for cable television, broadband internet, telephony and mobile services are highly competitive. In the provision of video services, we face competition from FTA and digital terrestrial television DTT broadcasters, video provided via satellite platforms, networks using DSL, VDSL or vectoring technology, multi-channel multi-point distribution system operators, FTTx networks, OTT video service providers, and, in some countries where parts of our systems are overbuilt, cable networks, among others. Our operating businesses are facing increasing competition from video services provided by, or over the networks of, incumbent telecommunications operators and other service providers. As the availability and speed of broadband internet increases, we also face competition from OTT video content providers utilizing our or our competitors high-speed internet connections. In the provision of telephony and broadband internet services, we are experiencing increasing competition from the incumbent telecommunications operators and other service providers in each country in which we operate, including for both retail and wholesale products and services, as well as providers of mobile voice and data. The incumbent telecommunications operators typically dominate the market for these services and have the advantage of nationwide networks and greater resources than we have to devote to the provision of these services. Many of the incumbent operators offer double-play, triple-play and quadruple-play bundles of services. In many countries, we also compete with other operators using local loop unbundling to provide these services, other facilities-based operators and wireless providers. Developments in DSL as well as investments into FTTx technology by the incumbent telecommunications operators and alternative providers have improved the attractiveness of our competitors products and services and strengthened their competitive position. Developments in wireless technologies, such as 5G and FWA, are creating additional competitive challenges. 
 
 In some of our markets, national and local government agencies may seek to become involved, either directly or indirectly, in the establishment of FTTx networks, DTT systems or other communications systems. We intend to pursue available options to restrict such involvement or to ensure that such involvement is on commercially reasonable terms. There can be no assurance, however, that we will be successful in these pursuits. As a result, we may face competition from entities not requiring a normal commercial return on their investments. In addition, we may face more vigorous competition than would have been the case if there were no government involvement. 
 
 We expect the level and intensity of competition to continue to increase from both existing competitors and the influx of new market entrants as a result of changes in the regulatory framework of the industries in which we operate, as well as strategic alliances and cooperative relationships among industry participants. Increased competition could result in increased customer churn, reductions of customer acquisition rates for some products and services and significant price and promotional competition in our markets. In combination with difficult economic environments, these competitive pressures could adversely impact our ability to increase or, in certain cases, maintain the revenue, average revenue per RGU or mobile subscriber, as applicable ARPU ), RGUs, mobile subscribers, Adjusted EBITDA (as defined in note 19 to our consolidated financial statements), Adjusted EBITDA margins and liquidity of our operating segments. 
 
 Changes in technology may limit the competitiveness of and demand for our services. Technology in the video, telecommunications and data services industries is changing rapidly, including advances in current technologies and the emergence of new technologies. New technologies, products and services may impact consumer behavior and therefore demand for our products and services. The ability to anticipate changes in technology and consumer tastes and to develop and introduce new and enhanced products and services on a timely basis will affect our ability to continue to grow, increase our revenue and number of subscribers and remain competitive. New products and services, once marketed, may not meet consumer expectations or demand, can be subject to delays in development or may fail to operate as intended. A lack of market acceptance of new products and services that we may offer, or the development of significant competitive products or services by others, could have a material adverse impact on our revenue and Adjusted EBITDA. 
 
 Our significant property and equipment additions may not generate a positive return. Significant additions to our property and equipment are, or in the future may be, required to add customers to our networks and to upgrade or expand our broadband communications networks and upgrade CPE to enhance our service offerings and improve the customer experience. Additions to our property and equipment, which are currently underway, require significant capital expenditures for equipment and associated labor costs to build out and/or upgrade our networks as well as for related CPE. Additionally, significant competition, the introduction of new technologies, the expansion of existing technologies, such as FTTx and advanced DSL technologies, the impact of natural disasters or adverse regulatory developments could cause us to decide to undertake previously unplanned builds or upgrades of our networks and CPE. 

I-27 

No assurance can be given that any newbuilds, rebuilds, upgrades or extensions of our network will increase penetration rates, increase average monthly subscription revenue per average cable RGU or mobile subscriber, as applicable, or otherwise generate positive returns as anticipated, or that we will have adequate capital available to finance such newbuilds, rebuilds, upgrades or extensions. Additionally, costs related to our property and equipment additions could end up being greater than originally anticipated or planned. If this is the case, we may require additional financing sooner than anticipated, we may have to divert funding from other planned projects or we may have to delay or abandon some or all of our development and expansion plans or otherwise forego market opportunities. Additional financing may not be available on favorable terms, if at all, and our ability to incur additional debt will be limited by our debt agreements. If we are unable to, or elect not to, pay for costs associated with adding new customers, expanding, extending or upgrading our networks or making our other planned or unplanned additions to our property and equipment, or are delayed in making such investments, our growth could be limited and our competitive position could be harmed. 
 
 We depend almost exclusively on our relationships with third-party programming providers and broadcasters for programming content, and a failure to acquire a wide selection of popular programming on acceptable terms could adversely affect our business. The success of our video subscription business depends, in large part, on our ability to provide a wide selection of popular programming to our subscribers. In general, we do not produce our own content, and we depend on our agreements, relationships and cooperation with public and private broadcasters, rights holders and collective rights associations to obtain such content. If we fail to obtain a diverse array of popular programming for our pay television services, including a sufficient selection of HD channels as well as non-linear content (such as a selection of attractive VoD content) and rights for ancillary services such as DVR and catch up or 'Replay' services, on satisfactory terms, we may not be able to offer a compelling video product to our customers at a price they are willing to pay. Additionally, we are frequently negotiating and renegotiating programming agreements and our annual costs for programming can vary. There can be no assurance that we will be able to renegotiate or renew the terms of our programming agreements on acceptable terms or at all. There has also been a rise in the number of direct-to-consumer offerings from content owners which impacts negotiations and the content, rights available and restrictions imposed on us. Programming and copyright costs represent a significant portion of our operating costs and are subject to price rises in future periods due to various factors, including (i) higher costs associated with the expansion of our digital video content, including rights associated with ancillary product offerings and rights that provide for the broadcast of live sporting events and (ii) rate increases, including as a result of inflationary pressures. 
 
 If we are unable to obtain or retain attractively priced, competitive content, demand for our existing and future video services could decrease, thereby limiting our ability to attract new customers, maintain existing customers and/or migrate customers from lower-tier programming to higher-tier programming, thereby inhibiting our ability to execute our business plans. Furthermore, we may be placed at a competitive disadvantage if certain of our competitors obtain exclusive programming rights, particularly with respect to popular sports and movie programming, and as certain players in the OTT market, for example Netflix, Amazon and Disney, increasingly produce their own exclusive content. 
 
 We depend on third-party suppliers and licensors to supply necessary equipment, software and certain services required for our businesses. We rely on third-party vendors for the equipment, software and services that we require in order to provide services to our customers. Our suppliers often conduct business worldwide and their ability to meet our needs is subject to various risks, including political and economic instability, natural calamities, interruptions in transportation or supply chain systems, terrorism and labor issues. As a result, we may not be able to obtain the equipment, software and services required for our businesses on a timely basis or on satisfactory terms. Any shortfall in CPE could lead to delays in completing extensions or upgrades to our networks and in connecting customers to our services and, accordingly, could adversely impact our ability to maintain or increase our RGUs, revenue and cash flows. Also, if demand exceeds the suppliers and licensors capacity or if they experience financial difficulties, the ability of our businesses to provide some services may be materially adversely affected, which in turn could affect our businesses ability to attract and retain customers. We have experienced certain business disruptions due to the worldwide silicon shortage, which has increased the delivery lead times and pricing of certain of our key components. We cannot predict how long such shortages will continue or what future disruptions to our business. Although we actively monitor the creditworthiness of our key third-party suppliers and licensors, the financial failure of a key third-party supplier or licensor could disrupt our operations and have an adverse impact on our revenue and cash flows. We rely upon intellectual property that is owned or licensed by us to use various technologies, conduct our operations and sell our products and services. Legal challenges could be made against our use of our or our licensed intellectual property rights (such as trademarks, patents and trade secrets) and we may be required to enter into licensing arrangements on unfavorable terms, incur monetary damages or be enjoined from use of the intellectual property rights in question . 
 
 Spectrum cost and availability and regulation may adversely affect our business, financial condition and operating results . As we continue to enhance the quality of our services in certain geographic areas and deploy new technologies, including 5G, we may need to acquire additional spectrum in the future. As a result, we will continue to actively seek to make additional investment in spectrum, which could be significant. 
 I-28 

The continued interest in, and acquisition of, spectrum by existing carriers and others may reduce our ability to acquire, and increase the acquisition cost of, spectrum in the secondary market or negatively impact our ability to gain access to spectrum through other means, including government auctions. Our return on investment in spectrum depends on our ability to attract additional customers and to provide additional services and usage to existing customers. Additionally, applicable regulatory bodies may not be able to provide sufficient additional spectrum to auction. We may also be unable to secure the spectrum necessary to maintain or enhance our competitive position in auctions or in the secondary market, on favorable terms or at all. 
 
 Certain regulatory bodies may impose conditions on the acquisition or use of new wireless broadband mobile spectrum that may negatively impact our ability to obtain spectrum economically or in appropriate configurations or coverage areas. 
 
 If we cannot acquire needed spectrum, if competitors acquire spectrum that allows them to provide competitive services or if we cannot deploy services over acquired spectrum on a timely basis without burdensome conditions, at reasonable costs, or while maintaining network quality levels, our ability to attract and retain customers and our business, financial condition and operating results could be materially adversely affected. 
 
 Certain of our businesses that offer mobile telephony and data services rely on the radio access networks of third-party wireless network providers to carry our mobile communications traffic. Our services to mobile customers in Ireland rely on the use of an MVNO arrangement, currently with Three (Hutchison), whereby we utilize the radio access networks of a third-party wireless network provider to carry our mobile communications traffic. If our MVNO arrangement is terminated, or if Three (Hutchison) fails to provide the services required under our MVNO arrangement, or if it fails to deploy and maintain its network, and we are unable to find a replacement network operator on a timely and commercially reasonable basis or at all, we could be prevented from continuing the mobile services relying on such MVNO arrangement. Additionally, as our MVNO arrangement comes to term, we may not be able to renegotiate renewal or replacement MVNO arrangement on the same or more favorable terms. 
 
 Failure in our or third-party technology or telecommunications systems, leakage of sensitive customer data, or security breaches could significantly disrupt our operations, reduce our customer base and result in fines, litigation or lost revenue. Our success depends, in part, on the continued and uninterrupted performance of our information technology and network systems, including internet sites, data hosting and processing facilities and other hardware, software and technical applications and platforms, as well as our customer service centers. Some of these are managed, hosted, provided or used by third-party service providers or their vendors, to assist in conducting our business. In addition, the hardware supporting a large number of critical systems for our cable network in a particular country or geographic region is housed in a relatively small number of locations. Our and our third-party service providers systems and equipment (including our routers and set-top boxes) are vulnerable to damage or security breach from a variety of sources, including telecommunications failures, power loss (such as blackouts or brownouts), malicious human acts, security flaws and natural disaster or extreme weather events (including heatwaves, large storms and floods, whether or not arising from short-term or long-term changes in weather patterns). Moreover, despite security measures, unauthorized parties may gain access to or disrupt our or our third-party service providers servers, systems and equipment by, among other things, hacking into our servers, systems and equipment or those of our third-party service providers through fraud, computer viruses, worms, phishing, physical or electronic break-ins or burglaries, or errors by our or our third-party service providers employees. We and our third-party service providers may not be able to anticipate or respond in an adequate and timely manner to attempts to obtain authorized access to, disable or degrade our or our third-party service providers systems because the techniques for doing so change frequently, are increasingly complex and sophisticated and are difficult to detect for periods of time. In addition, as discussed further below, the security measures and procedures we and our third-party service providers have in place to protect personal data and other information may not be sufficient to counter all data security breaches, cyber-attacks or system failures. In some cases, mitigation efforts may depend on third parties who may not deliver products or services that meet the required contractual standards or whose hardware, software or network services may be subject to error, defect, delay or outage. 
 
 Through our operations, sales and marketing activities, we collect and store certain personal information related to our customers. This may include phone numbers, drivers license numbers, contact preferences, personal information stored on electronic devices and payment information, including credit and debit card data. We also gather and retain information about employees in the normal course of business. In certain circumstances, where it is lawful to do so, we may share information about such persons with third-party service providers that assist with certain aspects of our business. Unauthorized parties may attempt to gain access to such data and information using the same methods described in the prior paragraph. As a result, data and information we gather could be subject to misappropriation, misuse, leakage, falsification or accidental release or loss of information maintained in our information technology systems and networks and those of our third-party service providers, including customer and personnel data. As a result of the increasing awareness concerning the importance of safeguarding personal information, the potential misuse of such information and legislation that has been adopted or is being considered across all of our markets regarding the protection, privacy and security of personal information, information-related risks are 
 I-29 

increasing, particularly for businesses like ours that handle a large amount of personal data. Failure to comply with these data protection laws may result in, among other consequences, fines, litigation or regulatory actions by local, state, federal or non-U.S. authorities. 
 
 Despite the precautions we have taken, unanticipated problems affecting our systems and equipment could cause business disruptions such as failures in our information technology systems, disruption in the transmission of signals over our networks, unauthorized access to the data and information we gather or similar problems. Further, although we devote significant resources to our cybersecurity programs and have implemented security measures to protect our systems and data, and to prevent, detect and respond to data security incidents, there can be no assurance that our efforts will prevent these threats. Any disruptive situation that causes loss, misappropriation, misuse or leakage of data could damage our reputation and the credibility of our operations and could subject us to potential liability, including litigation or other legal actions against us, the imposition of penalties, fines, fees or liabilities, which may not be covered by our insurance policies, and lost customers or revenue. While we maintain cyber liability insurance that provides both third-party liability and first-party liability insurance coverage, such insurance may not be sufficient to protect against all of our businesses losses from any future disruptions or breaches of their systems or other events as described above. Also, a cybersecurity breach and the changing cybersecurity landscape could require us to devote significant management resources to address the problems associated with the breach and to expend significant additional resources to upgrade further the security measures we employ to protect customer, employee and other personal information against cyber-attacks and other wrongful attempts to access such information, which could result in a disruption of our operations. This includes additional infrastructure capacity spending to mitigate any system degradation and the reallocation of resources from development activities. To date, other than the non-permitted access of one of Virgin Media s databases in February of 2020, we have not been subject to cyberattacks or network disruptions that, individually or in the aggregate, have been material to our operations or financial condition. Although we have not detected another material security breach or cybersecurity incident to date, we have been the target of events of this nature and expect to be subject to similar attacks in the future. 
 
 We and our third-party vendors rely on the availability of raw materials used to produce our CPE. If the materials become scarce or our supply chains for obtaining such materials are disrupted, we might be forced to expend significant resources to obtain replacement materials or experience significant delays in delivering certain CPE to our customers, which could damage our reputation, credibility and business and have a negative impact on our revenue or margins. 
 
 Factors Relating to Operations and Regulation 
 
 Our businesses are conducted almost exclusively outside of the U.S., which gives rise to numerous operational risks. Our businesses operate almost exclusively in countries outside the U.S. and are subject to the following inherent risks: 
 
 fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates; 
 difficulties in staffing and managing international operations; 
 potentially adverse tax consequences; 
 export and import restrictions, custom duties, tariffs and other trade barriers; 
 increases in taxes and governmental fees; 
 economic and political instability; and 
 changes in foreign and domestic laws and policies that govern operations of foreign-based companies. 
 
 Operational risks that we may experience in certain countries include disruptions of services or loss of property or equipment that are critical to overseas businesses due to expropriation, nationalization, war, insurrection, terrorism or general social or political unrest. 
 
 We are exposed to foreign currency exchange rate risk. We are exposed to foreign currency exchange rate risk with respect to our consolidated debt in situations where our debt is denominated in a currency other than the functional currency of the operations whose cash flows support our ability to repay or refinance such debt. Although we generally match the denomination of our and our subsidiaries borrowings with the functional currency of the operations that are supporting the respective borrowings, market conditions or other factors may cause us to enter into borrowing arrangements that are not denominated in the functional currency of the underlying operations (unmatched debt). In these cases, our policy is to provide for an economic hedge against foreign currency exchange rate movements by using derivative instruments to synthetically 
 I-30 

convert unmatched debt into the applicable underlying currency. At December 31, 2022, substantially all of our debt was either directly or synthetically matched to the applicable functional currencies of the underlying operations. 
 
 We are also exposed to foreign currency exchange rate risk in respect of our cash and cash equivalents and in respect of investments held within separately managed accounts. A substantial portion of our cash and cash equivalents is held in U.S. dollars, but we hold balances in other currencies reflecting the operational and strategic needs of the company. The investments held in our separately managed accounts are generally in U.S. dollars, and any instruments denominated in a foreign currency are generally hedged back to the U.S. dollar. 
 
 In addition, we are exposed to foreign currency risk to the extent that we enter into transactions denominated in currencies other than our or our subsidiaries respective functional currencies (non-functional currency risk), such as equipment purchases, programming contracts, notes payable and notes receivable (including intercompany amounts). Changes in exchange rates with respect to amounts recorded on our consolidated balance sheets related to these items will result in unrealized (based upon period-end exchange rates) or realized foreign currency transaction gains and losses upon settlement of the transactions. Moreover, to the extent that our revenue, costs and expenses are denominated in currencies other than our respective functional currencies, we will experience fluctuations in our revenue, costs and expenses solely as a result of changes in foreign currency exchange rates. Generally, we will consider hedging non-functional currency risks when the risks arise from agreements with third parties that involve the future payment or receipt of cash or other monetary items to the extent that we can reasonably predict the timing and amount of such payments or receipts and the payments or receipts are not otherwise hedged. In this regard, we have entered into foreign currency forward contracts to hedge certain of these risks. For additional information concerning our foreign currency forward contracts, see note 8 to our consolidated financial statements included in Part II of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. 
 
 We are also exposed to unfavorable and potentially volatile fluctuations of the U.S. dollar (our reporting currency) against the currencies of our operating subsidiaries when their respective financial statements are translated into U.S. dollars for inclusion in our consolidated financial statements. Cumulative translation adjustments are recorded in accumulated other comprehensive earnings or loss as a separate component of equity. Any increase (decrease) in the value of the U.S. dollar against any foreign currency that is the functional currency of one of our operating subsidiaries will cause us to experience unrealized foreign currency translation losses (gains) with respect to amounts already invested in such foreign currencies. Accordingly, we may experience a negative impact on our comprehensive earnings or loss and equity with respect to our holdings solely as a result of foreign currency translation. Our primary exposure to foreign currency translation risk during the three months ended December 31, 2022 was to the euro and Swiss franc, as 55.1 and 43.6 of our reported revenue during the period was derived from subsidiaries whose functional currencies are the euro and Swiss franc, respectively. In addition, our reported operating results are impacted by changes in the exchange rates for other local currencies in Europe. We do not hedge against the risk that we may incur non-cash losses upon the translation of the financial statements of our subsidiaries and affiliates into U.S. dollars. 
 
 Our businesses are subject to risks of adverse regulation. Our businesses are subject to the unique regulatory regimes of the countries in which they operate. Video distribution, broadband internet, telephony and mobile services are subject to licensing or registration eligibility rules and regulations, which vary by country. Countries in which we operate may adopt laws and regulations regarding electronic commerce, which could dampen the growth of the internet services being offered and developed by our businesses. In a number of countries, our ability to increase prices for, or change our services, including the programming packages we offer is limited by regulation or conditions imposed by competition authorities or is subject to review by regulatory authorities or is subject to termination rights of customers. More significantly, regulatory authorities may require us, particularly if we are deemed to possess SMP or there are significant economic or physical replicability barriers, to grant third parties access to our networks, facilities or services to distribute their own services or resell our services to end customers. Consequently, our businesses must adapt their ownership and organizational structures as well as their pricing and service offerings to satisfy the rules and regulations to which they are subject. A failure to comply with applicable rules and regulations could result in penalties, restrictions on our business, loss of required licenses or other adverse conditions. 
 
 Adverse changes in rules and regulations could: 
 
 impair our ability to use our networks in ways that would generate maximum revenue and Adjusted EBITDA; 
 create a shortage of capacity on our networks, which could limit the types and variety of services we seek to provide our customers; 
 impact our ability to access spectrum for our mobile services; 
 strengthen our competitors by granting them access and lowering their costs to enter into our markets; and 
 I-31 

significantly and adversely impact our results of operations. 
 
 Businesses, including ours, that offer multiple services, such as video distribution as well as internet, telephony, and/or mobile services, or that are vertically integrated and offer both video distribution and programming content, often face close regulatory scrutiny from competition authorities. This is particularly the case with respect to any proposed business combinations, which often require clearance from the European Commission or national competition authorities, which can block, impose conditions on, or delay an acquisition, thus possibly hampering our opportunities for growth. Additional scrutiny is also imposed under the national foreign direct investment screening regimes recently adopted by the U.K. and some E.U. Member States, which allow national governments to review and impose conditions on certain transactions involving critical infrastructures such as telecommunications. In the event conditions are imposed and we fail to meet them in a timely manner, the relevant authority or governments may impose fines and, if in connection with a transaction, may require restorative measures, such as a disposition of assets or divestiture of operations. 
 
 For information on certain other regulatory developments that could adversely impact our results of operations in future periods, see Legal and Regulatory Proceedings and Other Contingencies in note 18 to our consolidated financial statements. 
 
 New and existing legislation, and interpretations thereof, may significantly alter the regulatory regimes applicable to us, which could adversely affect our competitive position and profitability, and we may become subject to more extensive regulation, particularly if we are deemed to possess significant market power in any of the markets in which we operate. Significant changes to the existing regulatory regimes applicable to the provision of video, telephony, internet and mobile services have been and are still being introduced. For example, in the E.U., the Code is the primary source of communications regulation affecting our E.U. businesses, including access, user and privacy rights, video must-carry services and our competitive activities. The U.K. and Switzerland have systems that largely reflect the principles of the E.U. In addition, we are subject to regular review by national regulatory authorities in the E.U. and the U.K. concerning whether we exhibit SMP. A finding of SMP can result in our company becoming subject to open access, pricing and other requirements that could potentially advantage our competitors. This has resulted, for example, in obligations with respect to call termination for our telephony business in Europe and video and broadband internet access obligations in Belgium. 
 
 If any laws, regulations or rules are enacted or reinterpreted so as to expand the regulation of our products and services or our disclosure obligations, they could affect our operations or require significant expenditures. For example, certain of our business operations will become subject to corporate responsibility reporting obligations pursuant to the CSRD in the coming years. We cannot predict future developments in these areas, and any changes to the regulatory framework for our products and services or our disclosure obligations could have a negative impact on our business and results of operations. 
 
 The U.K. s departure from the E.U. could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations or liquidity. The U.K. formally exited the E.U. on January 31, 2020, and on December 24, 2020, entered into the E.U.-U.K. Agreement. For more information regarding the E.U.-U.K. Agreement, see Item 1. Business - Regulatory Matters - Overview discussion above. Examples of the potential impact Brexit could have on our business, financial condition or results of operations include: 
 
 changes in foreign currency exchange rates and disruptions in the capital markets. For example, a sustained period of weakness in the British pound sterling or the euro could have an adverse impact on our liquidity, including our ability to fund repurchases of our equity securities and other U.S. dollar-denominated liquidity requirements; 
 shortages of labor necessary to conduct our business; 
 disruption to our U.K. supply chain and related increased cost of supplies; 
 a weakened U.K. economy resulting in decreased consumer demand for our products and services in the U.K.; 
 legal uncertainty, increased compliance costs and potentially divergent national laws and regulations as the U.K. determines which E.U. laws and directives to replace or replicate, or where previously implemented by enactment of U.K. laws or regulations, to retain, amend or repeal; and 
 various geopolitical forces may impact the global economy and our business, including, for example, other E.U. member states (in particular those member states where we have operations) proposing referendums to, or electing to, exit the E.U. 
 
 We cannot be certain that we will be successful with respect to acquisitions, dispositions, joint ventures, partnerships or other similar transactions, or that we will achieve the anticipated benefits thereof. Historically, our businesses have grown, in part, through selective acquisitions that enabled them to take advantage of existing networks, local service offerings and region- 
 I-32 

specific management expertise, and we have also taken advantage of attractive opportunities to sell select businesses and partner with others. We expect to seek to continue improving our company through attractive acquisitions, dispositions, joint ventures, partnerships or other similar transactions in selected markets, such as the Sunrise Acquisition in November 2020, the sale of UPC Poland in April 2022 and the Telenet Tower Sale in June 2022, as well as the formations of the VMO2 JV in June 2021, the AtlasEdge JV in September 2021 and the nexfibre JV in December 2022. Our ability to complete any transaction may be limited by many factors, including government regulation, availability of financing, our or our counterparty s debt covenants, the prevalence of complex ownership structures among potential targets, acquirers, joint ventures or partners, disapproval by shareholders of potential targets or acquirers, and competition from other potential acquirers, including private equity funds. Even if we are successful in completing such transactions, integration and separation activities may present significant costs and challenges. We cannot be assured that we will be successful with respect to acquisitions, dispositions, joint ventures, partnerships or other similar transactions or realizing the anticipated benefits thereof. 
 
 In addition, we anticipate that most, if not all, companies acquired by us will be located outside the U.S. Foreign companies may not have disclosure controls and procedures or internal controls over financial reporting that are as thorough or effective as those required by U.S. securities laws and applicable accounting rules. While we intend to conduct appropriate due diligence and to implement appropriate controls and procedures as we integrate acquired companies, we may not be able to certify as to the effectiveness of these companies disclosure controls and procedures or internal controls over financial reporting until we have fully integrated them. 
 
 The expected synergies and benefits from our acquisitions and joint ventures may not be realized in the amounts anticipated or may not be realized within the expected time frame, and risks associated with the foregoing may also result from the extended delay in the integration of the companies. Our ability to realize the anticipated benefits of our acquisitions and joint ventures will depend, to a large extent, on our ability to integrate our businesses and the acquired or joint venture company s business in a manner that facilitates growth opportunities and achieves the projected cost savings. In addition, some of the anticipated synergies are not expected to occur for some time following the completion of such acquisitions and joint ventures and will require substantial capital expenditures before realizing some of those synergies. 
 
 The COVID-19 pandemic may delay, reduce or eliminate some of our anticipated synergies and other benefits, including a delay in the integration of, or inability to integrate, the business that we acquire or partner with. Even if we are able to integrate successfully, the anticipated benefits of such transactions, including the expected synergies and network benefits, may not be realized fully or at all or may take longer to realize than expected. 
 
 We have incurred substantial expenses as a result of completing our various acquisitions and joint ventures. We expect that substantial additional expenses will need to be incurred in order to integrate the businesses, operations, policies, and procedures. While we have assumed that a certain level of transaction-related expenses will be incurred, factors beyond our control could affect the total amount or the timing of these expenses. Many of the expenses that will be incurred, by their nature, are difficult to estimate accurately. These expenses could exceed the costs historically borne by us and offset, in whole or in part, the expected synergies. 
 
 Our integration efforts may not be executed successfully, or such integration may be more difficult, time consuming or costly than expected. Operating costs, customer loss and business disruption, including maintaining relationships with employees, customers, suppliers or vendors, may be greater than expected. The combination of independent businesses is complex, costly and time-consuming, and may divert significant management attention and resources. This process may disrupt our business or otherwise impact our ability to compete. The overall combination of our and the businesses of those companies that we acquire or partner with may also result in material unanticipated problems, expenses, liabilities, competitive responses and impacts and loss of customers and other business relationships. The difficulties of combining the operations of the companies include, among others: 
 
 diversion of management attention to integration matters; 
 difficulties in integrating operations and systems, including intellectual property and communications systems, administrative and information technology infrastructure, and supplier and vendor arrangements, including as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic; 
 challenges in conforming standards, controls, procedures and accounting and other policies; 
 alignment of key performance measurements may result in a greater need to communicate and manage clear expectations while we work to integrate and align policies and practices; 
 difficulties in integrating employees; 
 I-33 

the transition of management to the combined company management team, and the need to address possible differences in corporate cultures, management philosophies, and compensation structures; 
 challenges in retaining existing customers and obtaining new customers; 
 compliance with government regulations 
 known or potential unknown liabilities of the acquired businesses that are larger than expected; and 
 other potential adverse consequences and unforeseen increased expenses or liabilities associated with the applicable transaction. 
 
 Additionally, uncertainties over the integration process could cause customers, suppliers, distributors, dealers, retailers and others to seek to change or cancel our existing business relationships or to refuse to renew existing relationships. Suppliers, distributors and content and application providers may also delay or cease developing new products for us that are necessary for the operations of our business due to uncertainties or lack of available resources. Competitors may also target our existing customers by highlighting potential uncertainties and integration difficulties. 
 
 Some of these factors are outside our control, and any one of them could result in lower revenues, higher costs and diversion of management time and energy, which could adversely impact our business, financial condition and operating results. In addition, even if the integration is successful, the full benefits of our acquisitions and partnerships including, among others, the synergies, cost savings or sales or growth opportunities may not be realized. As a result, it cannot be assured that we will realize the full benefits expected from such transactions within the anticipated time frames or at all. 
 
 Certain operations are conducted by joint ventures that we cannot operate solely for our benefit . Certain of our operations, particularly the VMO2 JV in the U.K. and the VodafoneZiggo JV in the Netherlands, are conducted through joint ventures or partnerships. We share ownership and management of these joint venture with one or more parties who may or may not have the same goals, strategies, priorities or resources as we do. In general, joint ventures are intended to be operated for the benefit of all co-owners, rather than for our exclusive benefit. Operating a business as a joint venture often requires additional organizational formalities as well as time-consuming procedures for sharing information, accounting and making decisions. In certain cases, our joint venture partners must agree in order for the applicable joint venture to take certain actions. Our inability to take unilateral action that we believe is in our best interests may have an adverse effect on the financial performance of the joint venture and the return on our investment. In joint ventures, we believe our relationship with our co-owners is an important factor to the success of the joint venture, and if a co-owner changes, our relationship may be adversely affected. In addition, the benefits from a successful joint venture are shared among the co-owners, so that we do not receive all the benefits from our successful joint ventures. 
 
 Our interests in the VodafoneZiggo JV and the VMO2 JV are held pursuant to Shareholders Agreements that contain provisions relating to governance as well as transfer and exit rights, which, depending on the circumstances, may not be in the best interest of our company. Our noncontrolling interests in the VodafoneZiggo JV and the VMO2 JV are held pursuant to shareholders agreements (each a Shareholders Agreements ), which provides the terms of the governance of the VodafoneZiggo JV and the VMO2 JV, as applicable, including among others, decision-making process, information access, dividend policy and non-compete provisions. These provisions may prevent the VodafoneZiggo JV or the VMO2 JV, as applicable from making decisions or taking actions that would protect or advance the interests of our company, and could even result in the VodafoneZiggo JV or the VMO2 JV, as applicable, making decisions or taking actions that adversely impact our company. Further, our ability to access the cash of the VodafoneZiggo JV or the VMO2 JV, as applicable, pursuant to the dividend policy contained in the Shareholders Agreements may be restricted in certain circumstances. The Shareholders Agreements also provide for restrictions on the transfer of interests in the VodafoneZiggo JV and the VMO2 JV, as applicable, which could adversely affect our ability to sell our interest in the VodafoneZiggo JV or the VMO2 JV, as applicable, and/or the prices at which our interest may be sold, as well as certain exit arrangements, which could force us to sell our interest. For additional information on the VodafoneZiggo JV or the VMO2 JV and their respective Shareholders Agreement, see note 7 to our consolidated financial statements included in Part II of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. 
 
 We may have exposure to additional tax liabilities. We are subject to income taxes as well as non-income based taxes, such as value-added tax VAT in the U.K., the U.S. and many other jurisdictions around the world. In addition, most tax jurisdictions that we operate in have complex and subjective rules regarding the valuation of intercompany services, cross-border payments between affiliated companies and the related effects on income tax, VAT and transfer tax. Significant judgment is required in determining our worldwide provision for income taxes and other tax liabilities. In the ordinary course of our business, there are many transactions and calculations where the ultimate tax determination is uncertain. We are regularly under audit by tax authorities in many of the jurisdictions in which we operate. These audits may lead to disputes with tax 
 I-34 

authorities which may result in litigation. Although we believe that our tax estimates are reasonable, any material differences as a result of final determinations of tax audits or tax disputes could have an adverse effect on our financial position and results of operations in the period or periods for which such determination is made. 
 
 We are subject to changing tax laws, treaties and regulations in and between countries in which we operate, including treaties between and among the U.K., the U.S. and many other jurisdictions in which we have a presence. Also, various income tax proposals in the jurisdictions in which we operate could result in changes to the existing laws on which our deferred taxes are calculated. A change in these tax laws, treaties or regulations, or in the interpretation thereof, could result in a materially higher income or non-income tax expense, and any such material changes could cause a material change in our effective tax rate. In this regard, there have been significant changes or proposed changes to the tax laws in numerous jurisdictions in which we operate, the impacts of which have been reflected accordingly in our financial statements. 
 
 Further changes in the tax laws of the foreign jurisdictions in which we operate could arise as a result of the Base Erosion and Profit Shifting BEPS project undertaken by the Organizational Economic Cooperation and Development OECD ). The OECD represents a coalition of member countries that encompass most of the jurisdictions in which we operate. In October 2021, the OECD announced the OECD/G20 Inclusive Framework of Base Erosion and Profit Shifting, which agreed to a two-pillar solution to reform international taxation. Pillar One provides a mechanism to align taxing rights more closely with local market engagement; generally, where people or consumers are located. Pillar Two establishes a global minimum tax regime through a series of interlocking rules that would apply when a country s income tax rate is below 15 . In most jurisdictions in which we operate, it is anticipated that the Pillar Two rules will be enacted by the end of 2023 with the income inclusion rule applying to accounting periods beginning on or after December 31, 2023 and the undertaxed profits rule taking effect for years beginning from December 31, 2024. It is possible that jurisdictions in which we do business could react to the BEPS initiatives or their own concerns by enacting tax legislation that could adversely affect our financial position through increasing our tax liabilities. Further, the BEPS project as well as legislative changes in many countries, has resulted in various initiatives that require the sharing of company financial and operation information with taxing authorities on a local or global basis. This may lead to greater audit scrutiny of profits earned in other countries as well as disagreements between jurisdictions associated with the proper allocation of profits between jurisdictions. 
 
 The Virgin brand is used by certain of our consolidated subsidiaries and nonconsolidated joint ventures under licenses from Virgin Enterprises Limited and is not under the control of such subsidiaries. The activities of the group of companies utilizing the Virgin brand and other licensees could have a material adverse effect on the goodwill of customers towards our business as a licensee and the licenses from Virgin Enterprises Limited can be terminated in certain circumstances. The Virgin brand is integral to the corporate identity of our consolidated subsidiaries and nonconsolidated joint venture that utilize such brand. Such subsidiaries are reliant on the general goodwill of consumers towards the Virgin brand. Consequently, adverse publicity in relation to the group of companies utilizing the Virgin brand or its principals, particularly Sir Richard Branson, who is closely associated with the brand, or in relation to another licensee of the Virgin name and logo (particularly in the U.K., where the VMO2 JV does business) could have a material adverse effect on our reputation and our business and results of operations. In addition, the licenses from Virgin Enterprises Limited can be terminated in certain circumstances. For example, Virgin Enterprises Limited can terminate the licenses, after providing our applicable subsidiaries with an opportunity to cure, (i) if they or any of their affiliates commit persistent and material breaches or flagrant and material breaches of the licenses, (ii) if Virgin Enterprises Limited has reasonable grounds to believe that the use (or lack of use) of the licensed trademarks by such subsidiaries has been or is likely to result in a long-term and material diminution in the value of the Virgin brand, or (iii) if a third-party who is not (or one of whose directors is not) a fit and proper person , such as a legally disqualified director or a bankrupt entity, acquires control of Liberty Global. Such a termination could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations. 
 
 Factors Relating to Certain Financial Matters 
 
 Our substantial leverage could limit our ability to obtain additional financing and have other adverse effects. We seek to maintain our debt at levels that provide for attractive equity returns without assuming undue risk. In this regard, we generally seek to cause our operating subsidiaries to maintain their debt at levels that result in a consolidated debt balance that is between four and five times our consolidated Adjusted EBITDA (using consistent currency exchange rates for debt and EBITDA). As a result, we are highly leveraged. At December 31, 2022, the outstanding principal amount of our consolidated debt, together with our finance lease obligations aggregated 13.8 billion, including 0.8 billion that is classified as current on our consolidated balance sheet and 12.7 billion that is not due until 2028 or thereafter. We believe that we have sufficient resources to repay or refinance the current portion of our debt and finance lease obligations and to fund our foreseeable liquidity requirements during the next 12 months. However, as our maturing debt grows in later years, we anticipate that we will seek to refinance or otherwise extend our debt maturities. In this regard, we redeemed certain debt instruments using proceeds from the sale of UPC Polska, and targeted such redemptions at instruments with shorter maturities. As a result of unfavorable 
 I-35 

geopolitical conditions in 2022, credit markets were not offering attractive terms for issuance and thus we did not complete any refinancing transactions on our consolidated businesses. No assurance can be given that we will be able to complete these refinancing transactions or otherwise extend our debt maturities. In this regard, it is not possible to predict how political and economic conditions, sovereign debt concerns or any adverse regulatory developments could impact the credit and equity markets we access and, accordingly, our future liquidity and financial position. 
 
 Our ability to service or refinance our debt and to maintain compliance with the leverage covenants in the credit agreements and indentures of our borrowing groups is dependent primarily on our ability to maintain or increase the Adjusted EBITDA of our operating subsidiaries and to achieve adequate returns on our property and equipment additions and acquisitions. In addition, our ability to obtain additional debt financing is limited by the incurrence-based leverage covenants contained in the various debt instruments of our borrowing groups. For example, if the Adjusted EBITDA of one of our borrowing groups were to decline, our ability to obtain additional debt could be limited. Accordingly, if our cash provided by operations declines or we encounter other material liquidity requirements, we may be required to seek additional debt or equity financing in order to meet our debt obligations and other liquidity requirements as they come due. In addition, our current debt levels may limit our ability to incur additional debt financing to fund working capital needs, acquisitions, property and equipment additions, or other general corporate requirements. We can give no assurance that any additional debt or equity financing will be available on terms that are as favorable as the terms of our existing debt or at all. Further, our board of directors has approved a share repurchase program for Liberty Global in 2022. Any cash used by our company in connection with any future repurchases of our ordinary shares would not be available for other purposes, including the repayment of debt. For additional information concerning our share repurchase programs, see note 14 to our consolidated financial statements included in Part II of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. 
 
 Certain of our subsidiaries are subject to various debt instruments that contain restrictions on how we finance our operations and operate our businesses, which could impede our ability to engage in beneficial transactions. Certain of our subsidiaries are subject to significant financial and operating restrictions contained in outstanding credit agreements, indentures and similar instruments of indebtedness. These restrictions will affect, and in some cases significantly limit or prohibit, among other things, the ability of those subsidiaries to: 
 
 incur or guarantee additional indebtedness; 
 pay dividends or make other upstream distributions; 
 make investments; 
 transfer, sell or dispose of certain assets, including subsidiary stock; 
 merge or consolidate with other entities; 
 engage in transactions with us or other affiliates; or 
 create liens on their assets. 
 As a result of restrictions contained in these debt instruments, the companies party thereto, and their subsidiaries, could be unable to obtain additional capital in the future to: 
 fund property and equipment additions or acquisitions that could improve their value; 
 meet their loan and capital commitments to their business affiliates; 
 invest in companies in which they would otherwise invest; 
 fund any operating losses or future development of their business affiliates; 
 obtain lower borrowing costs that are available from secured lenders or engage in advantageous transactions that monetize their assets; or 
 conduct other necessary or prudent corporate activities. 
 
 In addition, most of the credit agreements to which these subsidiaries are parties include financial covenants that require them, in certain circumstances, to maintain certain leverage ratios if the drawings under the applicable revolving credit facility exceed a certain percentage of the commitments under such revolving credit facility. Their ability to meet these financial covenants may be affected by adverse economic, competitive, or regulatory developments and other events beyond their control, and we cannot assure you that these financial covenants will be met. In the event of a default under such subsidiaries 
 I-36 

credit agreements or indentures, the lenders or bondholders, as applicable, may accelerate the maturity of the indebtedness under those agreements or indentures, which could result in a default under other outstanding credit facilities or indentures. We cannot assure you that any of these subsidiaries will have sufficient assets to repay indebtedness outstanding under their credit agreements and indentures. Any refinancing of this indebtedness is likely to contain similar restrictive covenants. 
 
 We are exposed to interest rate risks. Shifts in such rates may adversely affect the debt service obligation of our subsidiaries. We are exposed to the risk of fluctuations in interest rates, primarily through the credit facilities of certain of our subsidiaries, which are indexed to EURIBOR, LIBOR or other base rates. Although we enter into various derivative transactions to manage exposure to movements in interest rates, there can be no assurance that we will be able to continue to do so at a reasonable cost or at all. If we are unable to effectively manage our interest rate exposure through derivative transactions, any increase in market interest rates would increase our interest rate exposure and debt service obligations, which would exacerbate the risks associated with our leveraged capital structure. 
 
 In July 2017, the U.K. Financial Conduct Authority (the authority that regulates LIBOR) announced that it intends to stop compelling banks to submit rates for the calculation of LIBOR after 2021. Additionally, the European Money Markets Institute (the authority that administers EURIBOR) announced that measures would need to be undertaken by the end of 2021 to reform EURIBOR to ensure compliance with the E.U. Benchmarks Regulation. In November 2020, ICE Benchmark Administration (the entity that administers LIBOR) announced its intention to continue publishing USD LIBOR rates until June 30, 2023, with the exception of the one-week and two-month rates which, along with all CHF and GBP LIBOR rates, it ceased to publish after December 31, 2021. Furthermore, in November 2022, the U.K. Financial Conduct Authority proposed that certain tenors of USD LIBOR would continue to be published on a synthetic basis until the end of September 2024. While this extension allows additional runway on existing contracts using USD LIBOR rates, companies are still encouraged to transition away from using USD LIBOR as soon as practicable and should not enter into new contracts that use USD LIBOR after 2021. The methodology for EURIBOR has been reformed and EURIBOR has been granted regulatory approval to continue to be used. Currently, there is no consensus amongst loan borrowers and investors for what rate(s) should replace USD LIBOR. 
 
 In October 2020, the International Swaps and Derivatives Association (the ISDA launched the Fallback Supplement, which, as of January 25, 2021, amended the standard definitions for interest rate derivatives to incorporate fallbacks for derivatives linked to certain key interbank offered rates IBORs ). The ISDA also launched the Fallback Protocol, a protocol that enables market participants to incorporate these revisions into their legacy non-cleared derivatives with other counterparties that choose to adhere to the protocol. The fallbacks for a particular currency apply following a permanent cessation of the IBOR in that currency, or in the case of a LIBOR setting, that LIBOR setting becoming permanently unrepresentative, and are adjusted versions of the risk-free rates identified in each currency. Our credit agreements contain provisions that contemplate alternative calculations of the base rate applicable to our LIBOR-indexed and EURIBOR-indexed debt to the extent LIBOR or EURIBOR (as applicable) are not available, which alternative calculations we do not anticipate will be materially different from what would have been calculated under LIBOR or EURIBOR (as applicable). Additionally, no mandatory prepayment or redemption provisions would be triggered under our credit agreements in the event that either the LIBOR rate or the EURIBOR rate is not available. It is possible, however, that any new reference rate that applies to our LIBOR-indexed or EURIBOR-indexed debt could be different from any new reference rate that applies to our LIBOR-indexed or EURIBOR-indexed derivative instruments. For discontinued currencies and tenors, we expect to continue taking steps to mitigate the changes in these benchmark rates, including by amending existing credit agreements and adhering to the Fallback Protocol, where appropriate. We plan to continue to manage this difference and any resulting increased variable-rate exposure through modifications to our debt and/or derivative instruments, however, future market conditions may not allow immediate implementation of desired modifications and our subsidiaries may incur significant associated costs. 
 
 We are subject to increasing operating costs and inflation risks, which may adversely affect our results of operations. While our operations attempt to increase our subscription rates to offset increases in programming, inputs and operating costs, there is no assurance that they will be able to do so. In certain countries in which we operate, our ability to increase subscription rates is subject to regulatory controls. Also, our ability to increase subscription rates may be constrained by competitive pressures. Therefore, programming, inputs and operating costs may rise faster than associated revenue, resulting in a material negative impact on our cash flows and net earnings (loss). We are also impacted by inflationary increases in salaries, wages, benefits, regulatory, energy and other administrative costs in certain of our markets as a result of, among other things, Russia s war in Ukraine. In this regard, inflation rates in the countries in which we operate have recently increased, and in many countries, such increases have been significant. 
 
 Continuing uncertainties and challenging conditions in the global economy and in the countries in which we operate may adversely impact our business, financial condition and results of operations. The current macroeconomic environment is highly volatile, with continued instability in global markets, including ongoing trade negotiations, uncertainty over inflation, energy price fluctuations, continued escalation in geopolitical tensions and global recession fears having all contributed to a 
 I-37 

challenging global economic environment. Future developments are dependent upon a number of political and economic factors, including the additional borrowing incurred by countries during the COVID-19 pandemic and the potential for lower growth expectations, higher global interest rates and continued inflationary pressures. As a result, we cannot predict how long challenging conditions will exist or the extent to which the markets in which we operate may deteriorate. Additional risks arising from the ongoing economic challenges in Europe are described below under the Risk Factor titled: We are exposed to sovereign debt and currency instability risks that could have an adverse impact on our liquidity, financial condition and cash flows. 
 
 Unfavorable economic conditions, including the current cost-of-living crises in many of the countries in which we operate, may impact a significant number of our subscribers and/or the prices we are able to charge for our products and services, and, as a result, it may be (i) more difficult for us to attract new subscribers and maintain current subscribers, (ii) more likely that subscribers will downgrade or disconnect their services and (iii) more difficult for us to maintain ARPUs at existing levels. Countries may also seek new or increased revenue sources due to fiscal deficits. Such actions may further adversely affect our company and our joint ventures. Accordingly, our ability to increase, or, in certain cases, maintain, the revenue, ARPUs, RGUs, mobile subscribers, Adjusted EBITDA, margins and liquidity of our operating segments could be adversely affected if the macroeconomic environment remains uncertain or declines further. We are currently unable to predict the extent of any of these potential adverse effects. 
 
 We are exposed to sovereign debt and currency instability risks that could have an adverse impact on our liquidity, financial condition and cash flows. Our operations are subject to macroeconomic and political risks that are outside of our control. For example, high levels of sovereign debt in the U.S. and several countries in which we or our affiliates operate, combined with structural changes arising from the COVID-19 pandemic, could potentially lead to additional fiscal reforms (including austerity measures), tax increases, sovereign debt restructurings, high corporate default rates, currency instability, increased counterparty credit risk, high levels of volatility and disruptions in the credit and equity markets, as well as other outcomes that might adversely impact our company. With regard to currency instability issues, concerns exist in the Eurozone with respect to individual macro-fundamentals on a country-by-country basis, as well as with respect to the overall stability of the European monetary union and the suitability of a single currency to appropriately deal with specific fiscal management and sovereign debt issues in individual Eurozone countries. The realization of these concerns could lead to the exit of one or more countries from the European monetary union and the re-introduction of individual currencies in these countries, or, in more extreme circumstances, the possible dissolution of the European monetary union entirely, which could result in the redenomination of a portion or, in the extreme case, all of our Euro-denominated assets, liabilities and cash flows to the new currency of the country in which they originated. This could result in a mismatch in the currencies of our assets, liabilities and cash flows. Any such mismatch, together with the capital market disruption that would likely accompany any such redenomination event, could have a material adverse impact on our liquidity and financial condition. Furthermore, any redenomination event would likely be accompanied by significant economic dislocation, particularly within the eurozone countries, which in turn could have an adverse impact on demand for our products and services, and accordingly, on our revenue and cash flows. Moreover, any changes from Euro to non-Euro currencies within the countries in which we operate would require us to modify our billing and other financial systems. No assurance can be given that any required modifications could be made within a time frame that would allow us to timely bill our customers or prepare and file required financial reports. In light of the significant exposure that we have to the Euro through our Euro-denominated borrowings, derivative instruments, cash balances and cash flows, a redenomination event could have a material adverse impact on our company. 
 
 We may not freely access the cash of our operating companies. Our operations are conducted through our subsidiaries. Our current sources of corporate liquidity include (i) our cash and cash equivalents, (ii) investments held within separately managed accounts, and (iii) interest and dividend income received on our cash and cash equivalents and investments. From time to time, we also receive (a) proceeds in the form of distributions or loan repayments from our subsidiaries or affiliates, (b) proceeds upon the disposition of investments and other assets and (c) proceeds in connection with the incurrence of debt or the issuance of equity securities. The ability of our operating subsidiaries to pay dividends or to make other payments or advances to us depends on their individual operating results and any statutory, regulatory or contractual restrictions to which they may be or may become subject and in some cases our receipt of such payments or advances may be limited due to tax considerations or the presence of noncontrolling interests. Most of our operating subsidiaries are subject to credit agreements or indentures that restrict sales of assets and prohibit or limit the payment of dividends or the making of distributions, loans or advances to shareholders and partners, including us. In addition, because these subsidiaries are separate and distinct legal entities they have no obligation to provide us funds for payment obligations, whether by dividends, distributions, loans or other payments. 
 
 We are exposed to the risk of default by the counterparties to our cash and short-term investments, derivative and other financial instruments, and undrawn debt facilities. Although we seek to manage the credit risks associated with our cash and short-term investments, derivative and other financial instruments, and undrawn debt facilities, we are exposed to the risk that 
 I-38 

our counterparties will default on their obligations to us. While we regularly review our credit exposures and currently have no specific concerns about the creditworthiness of any counterparty for which we have material credit risk exposures, we cannot rule out the possibility that one or more of our counterparties could fail or otherwise be unable to meet its obligations to us. Any such instance of default or failure could have an adverse effect on our cash flows, results of operations, financial condition and/or liquidity. In this regard, (i) we may incur losses to the extent that we are unable to recover debts owed to us, including cash deposited and the value of financial losses, (ii) we may incur significant costs to recover amounts owed to us, and such recovery may take a long period of time or may not be possible at all, (iii) our derivative liabilities may be accelerated by the default of our counterparty, (iv) we may be exposed to financial risks as a result of the termination of affected derivative contracts, and it may be costly or impossible to replace such contracts or otherwise mitigate such risks, (v) amounts available under committed credit facilities may be reduced and (vi) disruption to the credit markets could adversely impact our ability to access debt financing on favorable terms, or at all. 
 
 At December 31, 2022, our exposure to counterparty credit risk included (i) cash and cash equivalent and restricted cash balances of 1.7 billion, (ii) aggregate undrawn debt facilities of 1.5 billion and (iii) derivative assets with an aggregate fair value of 0.9 billion. For additional information regarding our derivative contracts and debt, see notes 8 and 11, respectively, to our consolidated financial statements included in Part II of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. 
 
 We may not report net earnings. We reported earnings (loss) from continuing operations of 1,105.3 million, 13,527.5 million and 1,525.1 million) during 2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively. In light of our historical financial performance, we cannot assure you that we will report net earnings in the near future. 
 
 Other Factors 
 
 We have not historically paid any cash dividends, and we may not pay dividends consistently or at all on any class of our ordinary shares. We do not presently intend to pay cash dividends on any class of our ordinary shares for the foreseeable future. However, we have the right to pay dividends, effect securities distributions or make bonus issues on Liberty Global shares. In addition, any dividends or distributions on, or repurchases of Liberty Global shares will reduce our Distributable Reserves (defined as our accumulated, realized profits less accumulated, realized losses, as measured for U.K. statutory purposes) legally available to be paid as dividends by our company under English law on any of our ordinary shares. 
 
 The loss of certain key personnel could harm our business. We have experienced employees at both the corporate and operational levels who possess substantial knowledge of our business and operations. We cannot assure you that we will be successful in retaining their services or that we would be successful in hiring and training suitable replacements without undue costs or delays. As a result, the loss of any of these key employees could cause significant disruptions in our business operations, which could materially adversely affect our results of operations. 
 
 John C. Malone has significant voting power with respect to corporate matters considered by our shareholders. John C. Malone beneficially owns outstanding ordinary shares of Liberty Global representing 30.65 of our aggregate voting power as of February 13, 2023. By virtue of Mr. Malone s voting power in our company, as well as his position as Chairman of our board of directors, Mr. Malone may have significant influence over the outcome of any corporate transaction or other matters submitted to our shareholders for approval. For example, under English law and our articles of association, certain matters (including amendments to the articles of association) require the approval of 75 of the shareholders who vote (in person or by proxy) on the relevant resolution, and other certain corporate transactions or matters may require the approval of at least 75 of the outstanding shares of each class of our ordinary shares. Because Mr. Malone beneficially owns 30.65 of our aggregate voting power and 67.63 of the outstanding Class B ordinary shares of Liberty Global, he has the ability to prevent the requisite approval threshold from being met even though the other shareholders may determine that such action or transaction is beneficial for the company. Mr. Malone s rights to vote or dispose of his equity interests in our company are not subject to any restrictions in favor of us other than as may be required by applicable law and except for customary transfer restrictions pursuant to equity award agreements. 
 
 It may be difficult for a third-party to acquire us, even if doing so may be beneficial to our shareholders. Certain provisions of our articles of association and of English law may discourage, delay, or prevent a change in control of our company that a shareholder may consider favorable. These provisions include the following: 
 
 authorizing a capital structure with multiple classes of ordinary shares; a Class B share class that entitles the holders to 10 votes per share; a Class A share class that entitles the holders to one vote per share; and a Class C share class that, except as otherwise required by applicable law, entitles the holders to no voting rights; 
 I-39 

authorizing the issuance of blank check shares (both ordinary and preference), which could be issued by our board of directors to increase the number of outstanding shares and thwart a takeover attempt; 
 classifying our board of directors with staggered three-year terms, which may lengthen the time required to gain control of our board of directors, although under English law, shareholders of our company can remove a director without cause by ordinary resolution; 
 prohibiting shareholder action by written resolution, thereby requiring all shareholder actions to be taken at a meeting of the shareholders; 
 requiring the approval of 75 in value of the shareholders (or class of shareholders) and/or English court approval for certain statutory mergers or schemes of arrangements; and 
 establishing advance notice requirements for nominations of candidates for election to our board of directors or for proposing matters that can be acted upon by shareholders at shareholder meetings. 
 
 Change in control provisions in our incentive plans and related award agreements or in executive employment agreements may also discourage, delay or prevent a change in control of our company, even if such change of control would be in the best interests of our shareholders. 
 
 The enforcement of civil liabilities against us may be more difficult. Because we are a public limited company incorporated under the laws of England and Wales, investors could experience more difficulty enforcing judgments obtained against us in U.S. courts than would currently be the case for U.S. judgments obtained against a U.S. company. It may also be more difficult (or impossible) to bring some types of claims against us in courts sitting in England than it would be to bring similar claims against a U.S. company in a U.S. court. In particular, English law significantly limits the circumstances under which shareholders of English companies may bring derivative actions. Under English law generally, only the company can be the proper plaintiff in proceedings in respect of wrongful acts committed against us. Our articles of association provide for the exclusive jurisdiction of the English courts for shareholder lawsuits against us or our directors. 
 
 We are exposed to the risks arising from widespread epidemic diseases in the countries in which we operate, such as the outbreak of COVID-19, which could have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations. The COVID-19 pandemic and the emergency measures imposed by governments worldwide, including travel limitations, limits on social activity and the shutdown of non-essential businesses have adversely impacted the global economy, disrupted global supply chains and created significant volatility and disruption of financial markets. While it is not currently possible to estimate the duration and severity of the adverse economic impact resulting from the preventative measures taken to contain or mitigate the spread of COVID-19, a continued period of global economic disruption may continue to have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations in future periods. We may also be adversely impacted by any government mandated regulations on our business that could be implemented in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. In addition, countries may seek new or increased revenue sources due to fiscal deficits that resulted from measures taken to mitigate the adverse economic impacts of COVID-19, such as, among other things, imposing new taxes on the products and services we provide. We are currently unable to predict the extent of any of these potential adverse effects. 
 
 Geopolitical conflicts, energy shortages and other adverse incidents beyond our control could adversely affect our revenue and results of operations. Political unrest and global conflicts like the ongoing conflict between Russia and Ukraine have disrupted, and in the future may further continue to disrupt, global supply chains and heighten volatility and disruption of global financial markets. While we do not have direct operations within Russia or Ukraine, the conflict involving these nations has heightened the disruption to our supply chain, triggered inflation in our labor and energy costs and may increase our risk of cyberattacks, which could result in significant losses and damage and could damage our reputation with customers and suppliers if their confidential information is compromised. The impact of these global events on our longer-term operational and financial performance will depend on future developments, our and governmental responses to inflation, and the duration and severity of the conflict in Ukraine. Any terrorist attacks or incidents prompted by political unrest, particularly in markets that we serve, and the national and global military, diplomatic and financial response to such attacks or other threats, also may adversely affect our revenue and results of operations.

The physical components of their broadband networks require maintenance and periodic upgrades to support the new services and products they introduce. Subject to these maintenance and upgrade activities, our management believes that our current facilities are suitable and adequate for our business operations for the foreseeable future.

Overview 
 
 General 
 
 We are an international provider of broadband internet, video, fixed-line telephony and mobile communications services to residential customers and businesses in Europe. Our operations comprise businesses that provide residential and B2B communications services in (i) Switzerland and Slovakia through UPC Holding, (ii) Belgium through Telenet and (iii) Ireland through VM Ireland.

 Through March 31, 2022, we provided residential and B2B communications services in Poland through UPC Holding. On April 1, 2022, we completed the sale of our operations in Poland. Accordingly, our operations in Poland are reflected as discontinued operations for all applicable periods. In the following discussion and analysis, the operating statistics, results of operations, cash flows and financial condition that we present and discuss are those of our continuing operations, unless otherwise indicated. For additional information regarding the sale of UPC Poland, including with respect to our use of proceeds, see note 6 to our consolidated financial statements. 
 
 Through May 31, 2021, our consolidated operations also provided residential and B2B communications services in the U.K. through Virgin Media. On June 1, 2021, we contributed the U.K. JV Entities to the VMO2 JV and began accounting for our 50 interest in the VMO2 JV as an equity method investment. For additional information, see note 6 to our consolidated financial statements.

The investments identified by company name above are intended to be merely illustrative, do not represent a complete list and are not necessarily the largest of our long-term investments. From time to time, we may make investments in other companies that we choose not to identify by company name for commercial, legal, strategic or other reasons. 
 
 For additional information regarding the details of our products and services, see Item 1. Business included in Part I of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. 
 
 Strategy and Management Focus 
 
 From a strategic perspective, we are seeking to build national fixed-mobile converged communications businesses that have strong prospects for future growth. As discussed further under Liquidity and Capital Resources Capitalization below, we also seek to maintain our debt at levels that provide for attractive equity returns without assuming undue risk. 
 
 We strive to achieve organic revenue and customer growth in our operations by developing and marketing bundled entertainment and information and communications services, and extending and upgrading the quality of our networks where appropriate. As we use the term, organic growth excludes foreign currency translation effects FX and the estimated impact of acquisitions and dispositions. While we seek to increase our customer base, we also seek to maximize the average revenue we receive from each household by increasing the penetration of our broadband internet, video, fixed-line telephony and mobile services with existing customers through product bundling and upselling. 
 
 Impact of COVID-19 
 
 The global COVID-19 pandemic continues to impact the economies of the countries in which we operate. However, during 2022, the impact on our company continued to be relatively minimal as demand for our products and services remained strong. It is not currently possible to estimate the duration and severity of the COVID-19 pandemic or the adverse economic impact resulting from the preventative measures taken to contain or mitigate its outbreak, therefore no assurance can be given that an extended period of global economic disruption would not have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations in future periods. 
 
 Competition and Other External Factors 
 
 We are experiencing competition in all of the markets in which we or our affiliates operate. This competition, together with macroeconomic and regulatory factors, has adversely impacted our revenue, number of customers and/or average monthly subscription revenue per fixed-line customer or mobile subscriber, as applicable ARPU ). For additional information regarding the competition we face, see Item 1. Business Competition and Regulatory Matters included in Part I of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. For additional information regarding the revenue impact of changes in the fixed-line customers and ARPU of our consolidated reportable segments, see Discussion and Analysis of our Reportable Segments below . 
 
 For information regarding certain other regulatory developments that could adversely impact our results of operations in future periods, see Legal and Regulatory Proceedings and Other Contingencies in note 18 to our consolidated financial statements.

Results of Operations 
 
 We have completed a number of transactions that impact the comparability of our 2022 and 2021 results of operations, the most notable of which are (i) the U.K. JV Transaction on June 1, 2021, (ii) the sale of UPC Poland on April 1, 2022 and (iii) the Telenet Tower Sale on June 1, 2022. For further information regarding our acquisitions and dispositions, see notes 5 and 6, respectively, to our consolidated financial statements. 
 
 In the following discussion, we quantify the estimated impact of material acquisitions (the Acquisition Impact and dispositions on our operating results. The Acquisition Impact represents our estimate of the difference between the operating results of the periods under comparison that is attributable to an acquisition. In general, we base our estimate of the Acquisition Impact on an acquired entity s operating results during the first three to twelve months following the acquisition date, as adjusted to remove integration costs and any other material unusual or nonoperational items, such that changes from those operating results in subsequent periods are considered to be organic changes. Accordingly, in the following discussion, (i) organic variances attributed to an acquired entity during the first 12 months following the acquisition date represent differences between the Acquisition Impact and the actual results and (ii) the calculation of our organic change percentages includes the organic activity of an acquired entity relative to the Acquisition Impact of such entity. With respect to material dispositions, the organic changes that are discussed below reflect adjustments to exclude the historical prior-year results of any disposed entities to the extent that such entities are not included in the corresponding results for the current-year period. 
 
 Changes in foreign currency exchange rates have a significant impact on our reported operating results as all of our operating segments have functional currencies other than the U.S. dollar. Our primary exposure to FX risk during the three months ended December 31, 2022 was to the euro and Swiss franc, as 55.1 and 43.6 of our reported revenue during the period was derived from subsidiaries whose functional currencies are the euro and Swiss franc, respectively. In addition, our reported operating results are impacted by changes in the exchange rates for certain other local currencies in Europe. The portions of the changes in the various components of our results of operations that are attributable to changes in FX are highlighted under Discussion and Analysis of our Reportable Segments and Discussion and Analysis of our Consolidated Operating Results below. For information regarding our foreign currency risks and the applicable foreign currency exchange rates in effect for the periods covered by this Annual Report on Form 10-K, see Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk Foreign Currency Risk below. 
 
 The amounts presented and discussed below represent 100 of each of our consolidated reportable segment s results of operations. As we have the ability to control Telenet, we consolidate 100 of its revenue and expenses in our consolidated statements of operations despite the fact that third parties own a significant interest. The noncontrolling owners interests in the operating results of Telenet and other less significant majority-owned subsidiaries are reflected in net earnings or loss attributable to noncontrolling interests in our consolidated statements of operations. Similarly, despite only holding a noncontrolling interest in both the VMO2 JV and the VodafoneZiggo JV, we present of the revenue and Adjusted EBITDA of those entities in the tables below. 

Discussion and Analysis of our Reportable Segments 

General 
 
 All of our reportable segments derive their revenue primarily from residential and B2B communications services. For detailed information regarding the composition of our reportable segments and how we define and categorize our revenue components, see note 19 to our consolidated financial statements. For additional information regarding the results of operations of the VMO2 JV and the VodafoneZiggo JV, refer to Discussion and Analysis of our Consolidated Operating Results Share of results of affiliates, net below. 
 
 The tables presented below in this section provide the details of the revenue and Adjusted EBITDA of our reportable segments for 2022, as compared to 2021. These tables present (i) the amounts reported for the current and comparative periods, (ii) the reported U.S. dollar change and percentage change from period to period and (iii) with respect to our consolidated reportable segments, the organic U.S. dollar change and percentage change from period to period. For our organic comparisons, which exclude the impact of FX, we assume that exchange rates remained constant at the prior-period rate during all periods presented. We also provide a table showing the Adjusted EBITDA margins of our reportable segments for 2022 and 2021 at the end of this section. 
 
 II-6 

Most of our revenue is derived from jurisdictions that administer VAT or similar revenue-based taxes. Any increases in these taxes could have an adverse impact on our ability to maintain or increase our revenue to the extent that we are unable to pass such tax increases on to our customers. In the case of revenue-based taxes for which we are the ultimate taxpayer, we will also experience increases in our operating costs and expenses and corresponding declines in our Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA margins to the extent of any such tax increases. 
 
 We pay interconnection fees to other telephony providers when calls or text messages from our subscribers terminate on another network, and we receive similar fees from such providers when calls or text messages from their customers terminate on our networks or networks that we access through MVNO or other arrangements. The amounts we charge and incur with respect to fixed-line telephony and mobile interconnection fees are subject to regulatory oversight. To the extent that regulatory authorities introduce fixed-line or mobile termination rate changes, we would experience prospective changes and, in very limited cases, we could experience retroactive changes in our interconnect revenue and/or costs. The ultimate impact of any such changes in termination rates on our Adjusted EBITDA would be dependent on the call or text messaging patterns that are subject to the changed termination rates. 
 
 We are subject to inflationary pressures with respect to certain costs and foreign currency exchange risk with respect to costs and expenses that are denominated in currencies other than the respective functional currencies of our reportable segments. Any cost increases that we are not able to pass on to our subscribers through rate increases would result in increased pressure on our operating margins. For additional information regarding our foreign currency exchange risks see Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk Foreign Currency Risk below. 
 
 Consolidated Adjusted EBITDA is a non-GAAP measure, which we believe is a meaningful measure because it represents a transparent view of our recurring operating performance that is unaffected by our capital structure and allows management to readily view operating trends from a consolidated view. Investors should view consolidated Adjusted EBITDA as a supplement to, and not a substitute for, GAAP measures of performance included in our consolidated statements of operations.

Revenue of our Reportable Segments 
 
 General. While not specifically discussed in the below explanations of the changes in the revenue of our reportable segments, we are experiencing competition in all of our markets. This competition has an adverse impact on our ability to increase or maintain our total number of customers and/or our ARPU. 
 
 Variances in the subscription revenue that we receive from our customers are a function of (i) changes in the number of our fixed-line customers or mobile subscribers outstanding during the period and (ii) changes in ARPU. Changes in ARPU can be attributable to (a) changes in prices, (b) changes in bundling or promotional discounts, (c) changes in the tier of services selected, (d) variances in subscriber usage patterns and (e) the overall mix of fixed and mobile products within a segment during the period.

 (a) Residential fixed subscription revenue includes amounts received from subscribers for ongoing services and the recognition of deferred installation revenue over the associated contract period. Residential fixed non-subscription revenue includes, among other items, channel carriage fees, late fees and revenue from the sale of equipment. 
 
 (b) Residential subscription revenue from subscribers who purchase bundled services at a discounted rate is generally allocated proportionally to each service based on the standalone price for each individual service. As a result, changes in the standalone pricing of our fixed and mobile products or the composition of bundles can contribute to changes in our product revenue categories from period to period. 
 
 (c) Residential mobile subscription revenue includes amounts received from subscribers for ongoing services. Residential mobile non-subscription revenue includes, among other items, interconnect revenue and revenue from sales of mobile handsets and other devices. Residential mobile interconnect revenue was 140.0 million and 232.6 million during 2022 and 2021, respectively. 
 II-12 

(d) B2B subscription revenue represents revenue from (i) services provided to SOHO subscribers and (ii) mobile services provided to medium and large enterprises. SOHO subscribers pay a premium price to receive expanded service levels along with broadband internet, video, fixed-line telephony or mobile services that are the same or similar to the mass marketed products offered to our residential subscribers. A portion of the change in our B2B subscription revenue is attributable to the conversion of certain residential subscribers to SOHO subscribers. B2B non-subscription revenue includes (a) revenue from business broadband internet, video, fixed-line telephony and data services offered to medium and large enterprises and, fixed-line and mobile services on a wholesale basis, to other operators and (b) revenue from long-term leases of portions of our network. 
 
 (e) Other revenue includes, among other items, (i) revenue earned from the U.K. JV Services and NL JV Services, (ii) broadcasting revenue in Belgium and Ireland, (iii) revenue earned from transitional and other services provided to various third parties and (iv) revenue earned from the sale of CPE to the VodafoneZiggo JV. 
 
 Total revenue. Our consolidated revenue decreased 3,115.6 million or 30.2 during 2022, as compared to 2021. This decrease includes a decrease of 2,736.4 million attributable to the impact of the U.K. JV Transaction. On an organic basis, our consolidated revenue increased 126.3 million or 1.7 . 
 
 Residential revenue. The details of the decrease in our consolidated residential revenue during 2022, as compared to 2021, are as follows (in millions): 
 Decrease in residential fixed subscription revenue due to change in: Average number of customers (32.0) ARPU 
 (28.4) Decrease in residential fixed non-subscription revenue (18.0) Total decrease in residential fixed revenue (78.4) Increase in residential mobile subscription revenue 63.6 Decrease in residential mobile non-subscription revenue (21.1) Total decrease in residential revenue (35.9) Impact of acquisitions and dispositions (2,287.4) Impact of FX 
 (397.4) Total decrease in residential revenue (2,720.7) 
 
 On an organic basis, our consolidated residential fixed subscription revenue decreased 60.4 million or 1.9 during 2022, as compared to 2021, primarily attributable to a decrease in Switzerland. 
 
 On an organic basis, our consolidated residential fixed non-subscription revenue decreased 18.0 million or 15.1 during 2022, as compared to 2021, primarily due to a decrease in Switzerland. 
 
 On an organic basis, our consolidated residential mobile subscription revenue increased 63.6 million or 4.4 during 2022, as compared to 2021, primarily attributable to increases in Belgium and Switzerland. 
 
 On an organic basis, our consolidated residential mobile non-subscription revenue decreased 21.1 million or 3.5 during 2022, as compared to 2021, primarily due to a decrease in Belgium, partially offset by an increase in Switzerland. 
 
 B2B revenue. On an organic basis, our consolidated B2B subscription revenue increased 18.6 million or 3.4 during 2022, as compared to 2021, primarily due to an increase in Belgium. 
 
 On an organic basis, our consolidated B2B non-subscription revenue increased 68.6 million or 7.9 during 2022, as compared to 2021, primarily attributable to increases in Belgium and Switzerland. 
 
 Other revenue. On an organic basis, our consolidated other revenue increased 75.0 million or 8.4 during 2022, as compared to 2021, primarily attributable to an increase in Central and Other due to the net effect of (i) an increase in revenue earned from the sale of CPE to the VodafoneZiggo JV and (ii) a decrease in revenue earned from the NL JV Services.

Programming and other direct costs of services 
 
 Programming and other direct costs of services include programming and copyright costs, interconnect and access costs, costs of mobile handsets and other devices and other direct costs related to our operations, including costs associated with our transitional service agreements. Programming and copyright costs represent a significant portion of our operating costs and are subject to rise in future periods due to various factors, including (i) higher costs associated with the expansion of our digital video content, including rights associated with ancillary product offerings and rights that provide for the broadcast of live sporting events and (ii) rate increases.

 (a) Represents the programming and other direct costs of the U.K. JV Entities through the June 1, 2021 closing of the U.K. JV Transaction. 
 
 Our programming and other direct costs of services decreased 931.9 million or 30.9 during 2022, as compared to 2021. This decrease includes a decrease of 868.1 million attributable to the impact of the U.K. JV Transaction. On an organic basis, our programming and other direct costs of services increased 60.0 million or 2.7 . This increase is primarily due to the net effect of the following factors: 
 
 An increase in costs of 65.8 million in Central and Other related to the sale of CPE to the VodafoneZiggo JV; 
 
 A decrease in programming and copyright costs of 22.3 million or 3.7 , attributable to lower costs for certain premium and/or basic content, primarily in Ireland and Switzerland; 
 
 A decrease in interconnect and access costs of 22.3 million or 2.8 , primarily due to the net effect of (i) lower interconnect and mobile roaming costs in Switzerland and Belgium, (ii) higher leased tower costs in Switzerland and (iii) lower MVNO costs in Switzerland; 
 
 An increase in mobile handset and other device costs of 21.9 million or 6.7 , largely due to higher sales volumes in Switzerland; and 
 
 An increase of 8.1 million associated with the impact of the classification of costs in connection with the U.K. JV Services provided by Central and Other, which, subsequent to the completion of the U.K. JV Transaction, are classified as direct costs of services. This increase was fully offset by a corresponding decrease in various SG A expense categories within Central and Other.

 Our other operating expenses (exclusive of share-based compensation expense) decreased 387.6 million or 26.4 during 2022, as compared to 2021. This decrease includes a decrease of 405.9 million attributable to the impact of the U.K. JV Transaction. On an organic basis, our other operating expenses increased 85.8 million or 7.9 . This increase is primarily due to the following factors: 
 
 An increase in business service costs of 42.4 million or 32.5 , primarily due to (i) an increase in energy costs, primarily in Belgium, and (ii) higher consulting costs, primarily in Central and Other; 
 
 An increase in bad debt expense of 17.6 million or 82.3 , primarily in Switzerland. This increase includes 4.5 million recognized in Switzerland associated with the sale of certain handset receivables, for which the proceeds of CHF 110.3 million 113.7 million at the applicable rate) were received on July 1, 2022. The expense recognized during the second quarter of 2022 represents the difference between the carrying amount of the associated receivables and the amount received pursuant to the sale; and 
 
 An increase in core network and information technology-related costs of 14.2 million or 5.7 , primarily due to (i) higher network maintenance costs, primarily due to an increase in Central and Other that was only partially offset by a decrease in Switzerland, and (ii) higher information technology-related expenses in Ireland, Central and Other and Belgium.

 Our SG A expenses (exclusive of share-based compensation expense) decreased 428.4 million or 23.0 during 2022, as compared to 2021. This decrease includes a decrease of 377.1 million attributable to the impact of the U.K. JV Transaction. On an organic basis, our SG A expenses increased 32.7 million or 2.2 . This increase is primarily due to the following factors: 
 
 An increase in business service costs of 27.2 million or 15.7 , primarily due to higher (i) travel and entertainment costs in Central and Other, (ii) energy costs in Central and Other and Belgium, (iii) facility management costs in Belgium and Central and Other and (iv) consulting costs, as a decrease in Switzerland was more than offset by increases in Belgium and Central and Other; and 
 
 II-16 

An increase in external sales and marketing costs of 14.8 million or 4.4 , primarily due to higher costs associated with advertising campaigns in Switzerland. 

Share-based compensation expense

 187.2 294.4 Total 192.1 308.1 
 _______________ 
 
 (a) In April 2021, with respect to 2014 and 2015 grants, the compensation committee of our board of directors approved the extension dates of outstanding SARs and director options from a seven-year term to a ten-year term. Accordingly, the Black-Scholes fair values of the respective outstanding awards increased, resulting in the recognition of an aggregate incremental share-based compensation expense of 22.7 million during 2021. 
 
 (b) Includes share-based compensation expense related to (i) our 2019 Challenge Performance Awards and (ii) in the 2021 period, PSUs and our 2019 CEO Performance Award. 
 
 (c) Represents annual incentive compensation and defined contribution plan liabilities that have been or are expected to be settled with Liberty Global ordinary shares. In the case of the annual incentive compensation, shares have been or will be issued to senior management and key employees pursuant to a shareholding incentive program. The shareholding incentive program allows these employees to elect to receive up to 100 of their annual incentive compensation in ordinary shares of Liberty Global in lieu of cash. In addition, amounts include compensation expense related to the 2022 and 2021 Ventures Incentive Plans. 
 
 (d) Represents the share-based compensation expense associated with Telenet s share-based incentive awards, which, at December 31, 2022, included performance- and non-performance-based stock option awards with respect to 3,519,920 Telenet shares. These stock option awards had a weighted average exercise price of 31.43 33.66).

 II-17 

Depreciation and amortization expense 
 
 Our depreciation and amortization expense was 2,171.4 million and 2,353.7 million during 2022 and 2021, respectively. Excluding the effects of FX, depreciation and amortization expense decreased 6.3 million or 0.3 during 2022, as compared to 2021. This decrease is primarily due to the net effect of (i) a decrease associated with certain assets becoming fully depreciated, primarily in Central and Other, Switzerland and Belgium and (ii) an increase associated with property and equipment additions related to the installation of CPE, the expansion and upgrade of our networks and other capital initiatives, primarily in Central and Other, Switzerland and Belgium. 

Impairment, restructuring and other operating items, net 
 
 We recognized impairment, restructuring and other operating items, net, of 85.1 million during 2022, as compared to 19.0 million) during 2021. 
 
 The 2022 amount primarily includes (i) a 39.6 million provision in Central and Other related to a legal contingency, (ii) abandoned lease expense of 20.2 million, primarily in Switzerland, and (iii) direct acquisition and disposition costs of 19.4 million, primarily in Belgium. 
 
 The 2021 amount primarily includes (i) a 108.6 million gain related to the settlement of certain litigation in Switzerland, (ii) restructuring charges of 58.2 million, including 53.7 million of employee severance and termination costs related to certain reorganization activities, primarily in Switzerland, and (iii) direct acquisition and disposition costs of 53.0 million, primarily related to costs incurred in connection with the formation of the VMO2 JV and the Sunrise Acquisition. 
 
 If, among other factors, (i) our equity values were to decline or (ii) the adverse impacts of economic, competitive, regulatory or other factors were to cause our results of operations or cash flows to be worse than anticipated, we could conclude in future periods that impairment charges are required in order to reduce the carrying values of our goodwill and, to a lesser extent, other long-lived assets. Any such impairment charges could be significant. 
 
 For additional information regarding our impairments, see Critical Accounting Policies, Judgments and Estimates Impairment of Goodwill below. 

Interest expense 
 
 We recognized interest expense of 589.3 million and 882.1 million during 2022 and 2021, respectively. Excluding the effects of FX, interest expense decreased 220.4 million or 25.0 during 2022, as compared to 2021. This decrease is primarily attributable to a lower average outstanding debt balance, largely due to the impact of the U.K. JV Transaction. For additional information regarding our outstanding indebtedness, see note 11 to our consolidated financial statements. 
 
 It is possible that the interest rates on (i) any new borrowings could be higher than the current interest rates on our existing indebtedness and (ii) our variable-rate indebtedness could increase in future periods. As further discussed in note 8 to our consolidated financial statements and under Qualitative and Quantitative Disclosures about Market Risk below, we use derivative instruments to manage our interest rate risks.

 The VMO2 JV was formed on June 1, 2021. As a result, the reported amounts for 2021 are based on results for the period beginning June 1, 2021. The change in the VMO2 JV s revenue during 2022, as compared to 2021, is primarily due to the net effect of (i) an increase in mobile subscription revenue and (ii) a decrease in B2B revenue, with each revenue category as defined and reported by the VMO2 JV. The change in the VMO2 JV s Adjusted EBITDA during 2022, as compared to 2021, is primarily due to the net effect of (a) the realization of synergies and cost efficiencies and (b) higher energy costs. In addition, the reported revenue and Adjusted EBITDA amounts are impacted by FX. 
 
 II-22 

(b) Represents (i) our 50 share of the results of operations of the VodafoneZiggo JV and (ii) interest income of 53.8 million and 56.5 million, respectively, representing 100 of the interest earned on the VodafoneZiggo JV Receivables.

 (1) Includes depreciation and amortization expense of 1,610.7 million and 1,870.0 million, respectively. 
 
 (2) Includes interest expense of 606.4 million and 605.0 million, respectively. 
 
 The decrease in the VodafoneZiggo JV s revenue during 2022, as compared to 2021, is primarily due to the net effect of (i) a decrease in residential fixed revenue, (ii) an increase in B2B revenue and (iii) higher residential mobile revenue. The decrease in the VodafoneZiggo JV s Adjusted EBITDA during 2022, as compared to 2021, is primarily due to inflation-related increases in energy and staff costs. In addition, the reported revenue and Adjusted EBITDA amounts are impacted by FX. 
 
 For additional information regarding our equity method investments, see note 7 to our consolidated financial statements. 

Gain on Telenet Tower Sale 
 
 In connection with the Telenet Tower Sale, we recognized a pre-tax gain during 2022 of 700.5 million. For additional information, see note 6 to our consolidated financial statements. 
 
 Gain on U.K. JV Transaction 
 
 In connection with the U.K. JV Transaction, we recognized a pre-tax gain during 2021 of 10,873.8 million, net of the recognition of a cumulative foreign currency translation loss of 1,198.6 million. For additional information, see note 6 to our consolidated financial statements. 
 
 Gain on AtlasEdge JV Transactions 
 
 In connection with the AtlasEdge JV Transactions, we recognized a pre-tax gain during 2021 of 227.5 million, net of the recognition of a cumulative foreign currency translation loss of 1.8 million. For additional information, see note 6 to our consolidated financial statements. 

Other income, net 
 
 We recognized other income, net, of 134.4 million and 44.9 million during 2022 and 2021, respectively. These amounts include (i) interest and dividend income of 76.6 million and 13.9 million, respectively, and (ii) credits related to the non-service component of our net periodic pension costs of 33.9 million and 38.9 million, respectively. 
 
 II-23 

Income tax benefit (expense) 
 
 We recognized income tax expense of 318.9 million and 473.3 million during 2022 and 2021, respectively. 
 
 The income tax expense during 2022 differs from the expected income tax expense of 270.6 million (based on the U.K. statutory income tax rate of 19.0 ), primarily due to the net negative impact of (i) statutory rates in certain jurisdictions in which we operate that differ from the U.K. statutory income tax rate, (ii) certain permanent differences between the financial and tax accounting treatment of interest and other expenses and (iii) certain permanent differences between the financial and tax accounting treatment of items associated with investments in subsidiaries and affiliates. The negative impact of these items was partially offset by the net positive impact of non-deductible or non-taxable foreign currency exchange results. 
 
 The income tax expense during 2021 differs from the expected income tax expense of 2,660.2 million (based on the U.K. statutory income tax rate of 19.0 ), primarily due to the positive impact of the non-taxable gain associated with the U.K. JV Transaction. 
 
 For additional information concerning our income taxes, see note 13 to our consolidated financial statements. 

Earnings (loss) from continuing operations 
 
 During 2022 and 2021, we reported earnings from continuing operations of 1,105.3 million and 13,527.5 million, respectively, consisting of (i) operating income of 146.8 million and 1,320.3 million, respectively, (ii) net non-operating income of 1,277.4 million and 12,680.5 million, respectively, and (iii) income tax expense of 318.9 million and 473.3 million, respectively. 
 
 Gains or losses associated with (i) changes in the fair values of derivative instruments, (ii) movements in foreign currency exchange rates and (iii) the disposition of assets and changes in ownership are subject to a high degree of volatility and, as such, any gains from these sources do not represent a reliable source of income. In the absence of significant gains in the future from these sources or from other non-operating items, our ability to achieve earnings is largely dependent on our ability to increase our aggregate operating income to a level that more than offsets the aggregate amount of our (a) interest expense, (b) other non-operating expenses and (c) income tax expense. 
 
 Due largely to the fact that we seek to maintain our debt at levels that provide for attractive equity returns, as discussed under Material Changes in Financial Condition Capitalization below, we expect we will continue to report significant levels of interest expense for the foreseeable future. For information concerning our expectations with respect to trends that may affect certain aspects of our operating results in future periods, see the discussion under Overview above. For information concerning the reasons for changes in specific line items in our consolidated statements of operations, see Discussion and Analysis of our Reportable Segments and Discussion and Analysis of our Consolidated Operating Results above. 

Earnings from discontinued operations, net of taxes 
 
 We reported earnings from discontinued operations, net of taxes, of 34.6 million and 82.6 million during 2022 and 2021, respectively, related to the results of UPC Poland. In addition, we recognized a gain on the sale of UPC Poland of 846.4 million during 2022, which includes a cumulative foreign currency translation gain of 10.9 million. For additional information, see note 6 to our consolidated financial statements. 

Net earnings attributable to noncontrolling interests 
 
 Net earnings attributable to noncontrolling interests were 513.1 million and 183.3 million during 2022 and 2021, respectively, primarily attributable to the results of operations of Telenet.

Liquidity and Capital Resources 

Sources and Uses of Cash 
 
 We are a holding company that is dependent on the capital resources of our subsidiaries to satisfy our liquidity requirements at the corporate level. Each of our significant operating subsidiaries is separately financed within one of our three subsidiary borrowing groups . These borrowing groups include the respective restricted parent and subsidiary entities within UPC Holding, Telenet and VM Ireland. Although our borrowing groups typically generate cash from operating activities, the terms of the instruments governing the indebtedness of these borrowing groups may restrict our ability to access the liquidity of these subsidiaries. In addition, our ability to access the liquidity of these and other subsidiaries may be limited by tax and legal considerations, the presence of noncontrolling interests and other factors.

Liquidity of Liberty Global and its Unrestricted Subsidiaries 
 
 The 1.8 million of cash and cash equivalents held by Liberty Global and, subject to certain tax and legal considerations, the 580.5 million of aggregate cash and cash equivalents held by unrestricted subsidiaries, together with the 2,854.6 million of investments held under SMAs, represented available liquidity at the corporate level at December 31, 2022. Our remaining cash and cash equivalents of 1,143.9 million at December 31, 2022 were held by our borrowing groups, as set forth in the table above. As noted above, various factors may limit our ability to access the cash of our borrowing groups. For information regarding certain limitations imposed by our subsidiaries debt instruments at December 31, 2022, see note 11 to our consolidated financial statements. 
 
 Our short-term sources of corporate liquidity include (i) cash and cash equivalents held by Liberty Global and, subject to certain tax and legal considerations, Liberty Global s unrestricted subsidiaries, (ii) investments held under SMAs, (iii) interest and dividend income received on our and, subject to certain tax and legal considerations, our unrestricted subsidiaries cash and cash equivalents and investments, including dividend distributions received from the VMO2 JV or the VodafoneZiggo JV, (iv) cash received with respect to transitional and other services provided to various third parties and (v) interest payments received with respect to the VodafoneZiggo JV Receivables. 
 
 From time to time, Liberty Global and its unrestricted subsidiaries may also receive (i) proceeds in the form of dividend distributions or loan repayments from Liberty Global s borrowing groups or affiliates (including amounts from the VMO2 JV or the VodafoneZiggo JV) upon (a) the completion of recapitalizations, refinancings, asset sales or similar transactions by these entities or (b) the accumulation of excess cash from operations or other means, (ii) proceeds upon the disposition of investments and other assets of Liberty Global and its unrestricted subsidiaries, such as the sale of UPC Poland, and (iii) proceeds in connection with the incurrence of debt by Liberty Global or its unrestricted subsidiaries or the issuance of equity securities by Liberty Global, including equity securities issued to satisfy subsidiary obligations. No assurance can be given that any external funding would be available to Liberty Global or its unrestricted subsidiaries on favorable terms, or at all. 
 
 At December 31, 2022, our consolidated cash and cash equivalents balance included 1,345.8 million held by entities that are domiciled outside of the U.K. Based on our assessment of our ability to access the liquidity of our subsidiaries on a tax efficient basis and our expectations with respect to our corporate liquidity requirements, we do not anticipate that tax considerations will adversely impact our corporate liquidity over the next 12 months. Our ability to access the liquidity of our subsidiaries on a tax efficient basis is a consideration in assessing the extent of our share repurchase program. 
 
 In addition, the amount of cash we receive from our subsidiaries and affiliates to satisfy U.S. dollar-denominated liquidity requirements is impacted by fluctuations in exchange rates, particularly with regard to the translation of euros, British pound sterling and Swiss francs into U.S. dollars. In this regard, the strengthening (weakening) of the U.S. dollar against these currencies will result in decreases (increases) in the U.S. dollars received from the applicable subsidiaries to fund the repurchase of our equity securities and other U.S. dollar-denominated liquidity requirements. 
 
 Our short- and long-term liquidity requirements include corporate general and administrative expenses and, from time to time, cash requirements in connection with (i) the repayment of third-party and intercompany debt, (ii) the satisfaction of contingent liabilities, (iii) acquisitions, (iv) the repurchase of equity and debt securities, (v) other investment opportunities, (vi) any funding requirements of our subsidiaries and affiliates or (vii) income tax payments. In addition, our parent entity uses available liquidity to make interest and principal payments on notes payable to certain of our unrestricted subsidiaries (aggregate outstanding principal of 12.7 billion at December 31, 2022 with varying maturity dates). 
 
 During 2022, the aggregate amount of our share repurchases, including direct acquisition costs, was 1,702.6 million. As a U.K. incorporated company, we may only elect to repurchase shares or pay dividends to the extent of our Distributable Reserves. Under our current repurchase program, we are authorized during 2023 to repurchase 10 of our total outstanding shares as of the beginning of the year. For additional information regarding our share repurchase programs, see note 14 to our consolidated financial statements. 

Liquidity of Borrowing Groups 
 
 The cash and cash equivalents of our borrowing groups are detailed in the table above. In addition to cash and cash equivalents, the primary sources of liquidity of our borrowing groups are cash provided by operations and borrowing availability under their respective debt instruments. For the details of the borrowing availability of our borrowing groups at December 31, 2022, see note 11 to our consolidated financial statements. The aforementioned sources of liquidity may be supplemented in certain cases by contributions and/or loans from Liberty Global and its unrestricted subsidiaries. 
 
 II-26 

The liquidity of our borrowing groups generally is used to fund (i) property and equipment additions, (ii) debt service requirements and (iii) income tax payments, as well as to settle certain obligations that are not included on our December 31, 2022 consolidated balance sheet. In this regard, we have significant commitments related to (a) certain operating costs associated with our networks, (b) purchase obligations associated with CPE and certain service-related commitments and (c) programming studio output and sports rights contracts. These obligations are expected to represent a significant liquidity requirement of our borrowing groups, a significant portion of which is due over the next 12 to 24 months. For additional information regarding our commitments, see note 18 to our consolidated financial statements. 
 
 From time to time, our borrowing groups may also require liquidity in connection with (i) acquisitions and other investment opportunities, (ii) loans to Liberty Global, (iii) capital distributions to Liberty Global and other equity owners or (iv) the satisfaction of contingent liabilities. No assurance can be given that any external funding would be available to our borrowing groups on favorable terms, or at all. 
 
 For additional information regarding our consolidated cash flows, see the discussion under Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows below. 

Capitalization 
 
 We seek to maintain our debt at levels that provide for attractive equity returns without assuming undue risk. In this regard, we generally seek to cause our operating subsidiaries to maintain their debt at levels that result in a consolidated debt balance (measured using subsidiary debt figures at swapped foreign currency exchange rates, consistent with the covenant calculation requirements of our subsidiary debt agreements) that is between four and five times our consolidated Adjusted EBITDA, although the timing of our acquisitions and financing transactions and the interplay of average and spot foreign currency rates may impact this ratio. Consolidated Adjusted EBITDA is a non-GAAP measure, which investors should view as a supplement to, and not a substitute for, GAAP measures of performance included in our consolidated statements of operations. 
 
 Our ability to service or refinance our debt and to maintain compliance with the leverage covenants in the credit agreements and indentures of our borrowing groups is dependent primarily on our ability to maintain or increase the Adjusted EBITDA of our operating subsidiaries and to achieve adequate returns on our property and equipment additions and acquisitions. In addition, our ability to obtain additional debt financing is limited by the incurrence-based leverage covenants contained in the various debt instruments of our borrowing groups. For example, if the Adjusted EBITDA of one of our borrowing groups were to decline, our ability to obtain additional debt could be limited. Under our credit facilities and senior and senior secured notes there is no cross-default risk between subsidiary borrowing groups in the event that one or more of our borrowing groups were to experience significant declines in their Adjusted EBITDA to the extent they were no longer able to service their debt obligations. Any mandatory prepayment events or events of default that may occur would only impact the relevant borrowing group in which these events occur and do not allow for any recourse to other borrowing groups or Liberty Global plc. Our credit facilities and senior and senior secured notes require that certain members of the relevant borrowing group guarantee the payment of all sums payable thereunder and such group members are required to grant first-ranking security over their shares or, in certain borrowing groups, over substantially all of their assets to secure the payment of all sums payable thereunder. At December 31, 2022, each of our borrowing groups was in compliance with its debt covenants. In addition, we do not anticipate any instances of non-compliance with respect to the debt covenants of our borrowing groups that would have a material adverse impact on our liquidity during the next 12 months. 
 
 At December 31, 2022, the outstanding principal amount of our consolidated debt, together with our finance lease obligations, aggregated 13.8 billion, including 0.8 billion that is classified as current on our consolidated balance sheet and 12.7 billion that is not due until 2028 or thereafter. All of our consolidated debt and finance lease obligations have been borrowed or incurred by our subsidiaries at December 31, 2022. 
 
 II-27 

We believe we have sufficient resources to repay or refinance the current portion of our debt and finance lease obligations and to fund our foreseeable liquidity requirements during the next 12 months. However, as our maturing debt grows in later years, we anticipate we will seek to refinance or otherwise extend our debt maturities. No assurance can be given that we will be able to complete these refinancing transactions or otherwise extend our debt maturities. In this regard, it is not possible to predict how political and economic conditions, sovereign debt concerns or any adverse regulatory developments could impact the credit and equity markets we access and, accordingly, our future liquidity and financial position. Our ability to access debt financing on favorable terms, or at all, could be adversely impacted by (i) the financial failure of any of our counterparties, which could (a) reduce amounts available under committed credit facilities and (b) adversely impact our ability to access cash deposited with any failed financial institution, and (ii) tightening of the credit markets. In addition, any weakness in the equity markets could make it less attractive to use our shares to satisfy contingent or other obligations, and sustained or increased competition, particularly in combination with adverse economic or regulatory developments, could have an unfavorable impact on our cash flows and liquidity. 
 
 For additional information concerning our debt and finance lease obligations, see notes 11 and 12, respectively, to our consolidated financial statements. 

Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows 
 
 General. Our cash flows are subject to significant variations due to FX. See related discussion under Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk Foreign Currency Risk below. 
 
 Summary. The 2022 and 2021 consolidated statements of cash flows of our continuing operations are summarized as follows: 
 Year ended December 31, 2022 2021 Change in millions Net cash provided by operating activities 2,786.7 3,364.0 (577.3) Net cash provided (used) by investing activities 1,296.6 (5,745.5) 7,042.1 Net cash used by financing activities (3,273.4) (1,512.6) (1,760.8) Effect of exchange rate changes on cash and cash equivalents and restricted cash (27.7) (6.6) (21.1) Net increase (decrease) in cash and cash equivalents and restricted cash 782.2 (3,900.7) 4,682.9 
 
 Operating Activities. The decrease in net cash provided by our operating activities is primarily attributable to the net effect of (i) a decrease in cash provided by our Adjusted EBITDA and related working capital items, which includes (a) the impact of the U.K. JV Transaction and (b) an increase in cash of 113.7 million (at the applicable rate) in connection with the sale of certain handset receivables in Switzerland, (ii) an increase in cash provided due to higher dividend distributions from the VMO2 JV, (iii) a decrease due to FX, (iv) an increase in cash provided due to lower payments of interest, including the impact of the U.K. JV Transaction, (v) an increase in cash provided due to higher net cash receipts related to derivative instruments, and (vi) an increase in cash provided due to higher receipts of interest. Consolidated Adjusted EBITDA is a non-GAAP measure, which investors should view as a supplement to, and not a substitute for, GAAP measures of performance included in our consolidated statements of operations. 
 
 Investing Activities. The change in net cash provided (used) by our investing activities is primarily attributable to (i) an increase in cash of 3,424.0 million associated with restricted cash contributed to the VMO2 JV in connection with the U.K. JV Transaction during the first six months of 2021, (ii) an increase in cash of 1,553.3 million in connection with the sale of UPC Poland, (iii) an increase in cash of 870.5 million associated with lower net cash paid for investments, primarily related to our investments held under SMAs, (iv) an increase in cash of 779.9 million in connection with the Telenet Tower Sale and (v) an increase in cash of 477.9 million due to higher dividend distributions received from the VMO2 JV. Capital expenditures decreased from 1,408.0 million during 2021 to 1,303.2 million during 2022 due to the net effect of (a) a decrease due to the impact of the U.K. JV Transaction, (b) a decrease due to FX and (c) an increase in our net local currency capital expenditures and related working capital movements, including the impact of lower capital-related vendor financing. 
 
 II-28 

The capital expenditures we report in our consolidated statements of cash flows do not include amounts that are financed under capital-related vendor financing or finance lease arrangements. Instead, these amounts are reflected as non-cash additions to our property and equipment when the underlying assets are delivered and as repayments of debt when the principal is repaid. In this discussion, we refer to (i) our capital expenditures as reported in our consolidated statements of cash flows, which exclude amounts financed under capital-related vendor financing or finance lease arrangements, and (ii) our total property and equipment additions, which include our capital expenditures on an accrual basis and amounts financed under capital-related vendor financing or finance lease arrangements. For further details regarding our property and equipment additions, see note 19 to our consolidated financial statements. A reconciliation of our consolidated property and equipment additions to our consolidated capital expenditures, as reported in our consolidated statements of cash flows, is set forth below: 
 Year ended December 31, 2022 2021 in millions Property and equipment additions 1,588.9 2,169.5 Assets acquired under capital-related vendor financing arrangements 
 (182.8) (661.1) Assets acquired under finance leases (34.2) (42.6) Changes in current liabilities related to capital expenditures 
 (68.7) (57.8) Capital expenditures, net 1,303.2 1,408.0 
 
 The decrease in our property and equipment additions during 2022, as compared to 2021, is primarily due to the net effect of (i) a decrease due to the impact of the U.K. JV Transaction, (ii) a decrease due to FX, (iii) an increase in local currency expenditures of our subsidiaries due to the net effect of (a) an increase in expenditures for the purchase and installation of CPE, (b) an increase in expenditures for new build and upgrade projects, (c) a decrease in baseline expenditures, including network improvements and expenditures for property and facilities and information technology systems, and (d) a decrease expenditures to support new customer products and operational efficiency initiatives. During 2022 and 2021, our property and equipment additions represented 22.1 and 21.0 of revenue, respectively. 
 
 We expect our 2023 property and equipment additions to remain relatively stable as compared to our 2022 property and equipment additions. The actual amount of our 2023 property and equipment additions may vary from our expectations for a variety of reasons, including (i) changes in (a) the competitive or regulatory environment, (b) business plans, (c) our expected future operating results or (d) foreign currency exchange rates and (ii) the availability of sufficient capital. Accordingly, no assurance can be given that our actual property and equipment additions will not vary materially from our expectations. 
 
 Financing Activities. The increase in net cash used by our financing activities is primarily attributable to the net effect of (i) an increase in cash used of 1,825.9 million due to higher net repayments of debt, (ii) a decrease in cash used of 287.3 million due to lower net repayments of vendor financing, including the impact of the U.K. JV Transaction, (iii) an increase in cash used of 193.6 million due to higher net payments related to derivatives and (iv) an increase in cash used of 123.0 million due to higher repurchases of Liberty Global ordinary shares. 
 
 II-29 

Adjusted Free Cash Flow 
 
 We define adjusted free cash flow as net cash provided by the operating activities of our continuing operations, plus operating-related vendor financed expenses (which represents an increase in the period to our actual cash available as a result of extending vendor payment terms beyond normal payment terms, which are typically 90 days or less, through non-cash financing activities), less (i) cash payments in the period for capital expenditures, (ii) principal payments on operating- and capital-related amounts financed by vendors and intermediaries (which represents a decrease in the period to our actual cash available as a result of paying amounts to vendors and intermediaries where we previously had extended vendor payments beyond the normal payment terms) and (iii) principal payments on finance leases (which represents a decrease in the period to our actual cash available), each as reported in our consolidated statements of cash flows with each item excluding any cash provided or used by our discontinued operations. Net cash provided by the operating activities of our continuing operations includes cash paid for third-party costs directly associated with successful and unsuccessful acquisitions and dispositions of 36.2 million and 80.5 million during 2022 and 2021, respectively. 
 
 We believe our presentation of adjusted free cash flow, which is a non-GAAP measure, provides useful information to our investors because this measure can be used to gauge our ability to (i) service debt and (ii) fund new investment opportunities after consideration of all actual cash payments related to our working capital activities and expenses that are capital in nature whether paid inside normal vendor payment terms or paid later outside normal vendor payment terms (in which case we typically pay in less than 365 days). Adjusted free cash flow should not be understood to represent our ability to fund discretionary amounts, as we have various mandatory and contractual obligations, including debt repayments, that are not deducted to arrive at these amounts. Investors should view adjusted free cash flow as a supplement to, and not a substitute for, GAAP measures of liquidity included in our consolidated statements of cash flows. Further, our adjusted free cash flow may differ from how other companies define and apply their definition of adjusted free cash flow. 
 
 The following table provides the details of our adjusted free cash flow: 
 Year ended December 31, 2022 2021 in millions Net cash provided by operating activities of our continuing operations 2,786.7 3,364.0 Operating-related vendor financing additions (a) 522.7 1,781.6 Cash capital expenditures, net (1,303.2) (1,408.0) Principal payments on operating-related vendor financing (616.1) (1,408.0) Principal payments on capital-related vendor financing (210.1) (964.4) Principal payments on finance leases (62.0) (75.7) Adjusted free cash flow 1,118.0 1,289.5 
 _______________ 
 
 (a) For purposes of our consolidated statements of cash flows, operating-related vendor financing additions represent operating-related expenses financed by an intermediary that are treated as constructive operating cash outflows and constructive financing cash inflows when the intermediary settles the liability with the vendor. When we pay the financing intermediary, we record financing cash outflows in our consolidated statements of cash flows. For purposes of our adjusted free cash flow definition, we (i) add in the constructive financing cash inflow when the intermediary settles the liability with the vendor as our actual net cash available at that time is not affected and (ii) subsequently deduct the related financing cash outflow when we actually pay the financing intermediary, reflecting the actual reduction to our cash available to service debt or fund new investment opportunities. 
 
 II-30 

Critical Accounting Policies, Judgments and Estimates 
 
 In connection with the preparation of our consolidated financial statements, we make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, revenue and expenses and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. Critical accounting policies are defined as those policies that are reflective of significant judgments, estimates and uncertainties, which would potentially result in materially different results under different assumptions and conditions. We believe the following accounting policies are critical in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements because of the judgment necessary to account for these matters and the significant estimates involved, which are susceptible to change: 
 
 Impairment of goodwill; 
 Costs associated with the capitalization of property and equipment; 
 Fair value measurements; and 
 Income tax accounting. 
 
 We have discussed the selection of the aforementioned critical accounting policies with the audit committee of our board of directors. For additional information concerning our significant accounting policies, see note 3 to our consolidated financial statements. 
 
 Impairment of Goodwill 
 
 Carrying Value. The aggregate carrying value of our goodwill comprised 21.7 of our total assets at December 31, 2022. 
 
 We evaluate goodwill for impairment at least annually on October 1 and whenever facts and circumstances indicate that a reporting unit s carrying amount may not be recoverable. For impairment evaluations, we first make a qualitative assessment to determine if the goodwill may be impaired. If it is more-likely-than-not that a reporting unit s fair value is less than its carrying value, we then compare the fair value of the reporting unit to its respective carrying amount. Any excess of the carrying amount over the fair value would be charged to operations as an impairment loss. A reporting unit is an operating segment or one level below an operating segment (referred to as a component ). 
 
 When required, considerable management judgment is necessary to estimate the fair value of reporting units. The equity of one of our reporting units, Telenet, is publicly traded in an active market. For this reporting unit, our fair value determination is based on quoted market prices. For other reporting units, we typically determine fair value using an income-based approach (discounted cash flows) based on assumptions in our long-range business plans and, in some cases, a combination of an income-based approach and a market-based approach. With respect to our discounted cash flow analysis used in the income-based approach, the timing and amount of future cash flows under these business plans require estimates of, among other items, subscriber growth and retention rates, rates charged per product, expected gross margins and Adjusted EBITDA margins and expected property and equipment additions. The development of these cash flows, and the discount rate applied to the cash flows, is subject to inherent uncertainties, and actual results could vary significantly from such estimates. Our determination of the discount rate is based on a weighted average cost of capital approach, which uses a market participant s cost of equity and after-tax cost of debt and reflects the risks inherent in the cash flows. Based on the results of our 2022 qualitative assessment of our reporting unit carrying values, we determined that it was more-likely-than-not that fair value exceeded carrying value for all of our reporting units. 
 
 During the three years ended December 31, 2022, we did not record any significant impairment charges with respect to our goodwill. For additional information regarding our goodwill, see note 10 to our consolidated financial statements. 
 
 If, among other factors, (i) our equity values were to decline or (ii) the adverse impacts of economic, competitive, regulatory or other factors were to cause our results of operations or cash flows to be worse than anticipated, we could conclude in future periods that impairment charges are required in order to reduce the carrying values of our goodwill. Any such impairment charges could be significant. 
 
 II-31 

Costs Associated with the Capitalization of Property and Equipment 
 
 We capitalize costs associated with the construction of new, or upgrades to existing, fixed and mobile transmission and distribution facilities, the installation of new fixed-line services and the development of internal-use software. Installation activities that are capitalized include (i) the initial connection (or drop) from our fixed-line system to a customer location, (ii) the replacement of a drop and (iii) the installation of equipment for new, or upgrades to existing, fixed-line services. The costs of other customer-facing activities, such as reconnecting customer locations where a drop already exists, disconnecting customer locations and repairing or maintaining drops, are expensed as incurred. We capitalize internal and external costs directly associated with the development of internal-use software. 
 
 We make judgments regarding the construction, upgrade and installation activities to be capitalized and the development of internal-use software. In addition to direct external and internal labor and materials, we also capitalize other costs directly attributable to our construction and installation activities, including dispatch costs, quality-control costs, vehicle-related costs and certain warehouse-related costs. The capitalization of these costs is based on time sheets, standard costs, call tracking systems and other verifiable means that directly link the costs incurred with the applicable capitalizable activity. We continuously monitor the appropriateness of our capitalization policies and update the policies when necessary to respond to changes in facts and circumstances, such as the development of new products and services and changes in the manner that installations, construction or upgrade activities or the development of internal-use software are performed. 
 
 Fair Value Measurements 
 
 GAAP provides guidance with respect to the recurring and nonrecurring fair value measurements and for a fair value hierarchy that prioritizes the inputs to valuation techniques used to measure fair value into three broad levels. Level 1 inputs are quoted market prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities that the reporting entity has the ability to access at the measurement date. Level 2 inputs are inputs other than quoted market prices included within Level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly or indirectly. Level 3 inputs are unobservable inputs for the asset or liability. 
 
 Recurring Valuations. We perform recurring fair value measurements with respect to our derivative instruments and our fair value method investments. We use (i) cash flow valuation models to determine the fair values of our interest rate and foreign currency derivative instruments and (ii) a Black-Scholes option pricing model to determine the fair values of our equity-related derivative instruments. We use quoted market prices when available and, when not available, we use a combination of an income approach (discounted cash flows) and a market approach (market multiples of similar businesses) to determine the fair value of our fair value method investments. For a detailed discussion of the inputs we use to determine the fair value of our derivative instruments and fair value method investments, see note 9 to our consolidated financial statements. See also notes 7 and 8 to our consolidated financial statements for information concerning our fair value method investments and derivative instruments, respectively. 
 
 Changes in the fair values of our derivative instruments and fair value method investments have had, and we believe will continue to have, a significant and volatile impact on our results of operations. During 2022, 2021 and 2020, we recognized net gains (losses) of 889.6 million, 1,357.9 million and 833.5 million), respectively, attributable to changes in the fair values of these items. 
 
 As further described in note 9 to our consolidated financial statements, actual amounts received or paid upon the settlement or disposition of these investments and instruments may differ materially from the recorded fair values at December 31, 2022. 
 
 For information concerning the sensitivity of the fair value of certain of our more significant derivative instruments to changes in market conditions, see Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk Sensitivity Information below. 
 
 Nonrecurring Valuations. Our nonrecurring valuations are primarily associated with (i) the application of acquisition accounting, (ii) impairment assessments and (iii) the accounting for our initial investment in significant joint ventures, each of which require that we make fair value determinations as of the applicable valuation date. In making these determinations, we are required to make estimates and assumptions that affect the recorded amounts, including, but not limited to, expected future cash flows, market comparables and discount rates, remaining useful lives of long-lived assets, replacement or reproduction costs of property and equipment and the amounts to be recovered in future periods from acquired net operating losses and other deferred tax assets. To assist us in making these fair value determinations, we may engage third-party valuation specialists. Our estimates in this area impact, among other items, the amount of depreciation and amortization, impairment charges and income tax expense or benefit that we report. Our estimates of fair value are based upon assumptions we believe to be reasonable, but which are inherently uncertain. A significant portion of our long-lived assets were initially recorded through the application of 
 II-32 

acquisition accounting and all of our long-lived assets are subject to impairment assessments. For additional information, see note 9 to our consolidated financial statements. For information regarding our acquisitions and long-lived assets, see notes 5 and 10 to our consolidated financial statements, respectively. 
 
 Income Tax Accounting 
 
 We are required to estimate the amount of tax payable or refundable for the current year and the deferred tax assets and liabilities for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts and income tax basis of assets and liabilities and the expected benefits of utilizing net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards, using enacted tax rates in effect for each taxing jurisdiction in which we operate for the year in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled. This process requires our management to make assessments regarding the timing and probability of the ultimate tax impact of such items. 
 
 Net deferred tax assets are reduced by a valuation allowance if we believe that it is more-likely-than-not such net deferred tax assets will not be realized. Establishing or reducing a tax valuation allowance requires us to make assessments about the timing of future events, including the probability of expected future taxable income and available tax planning strategies. At December 31, 2022, the aggregate valuation allowance provided against deferred tax assets was 1,586.5 million. The actual amount of deferred income tax benefits realized in future periods will likely differ from the net deferred tax assets reflected in our December 31, 2022 consolidated balance sheet due to, among other factors, possible future changes in income tax law, or interpretations thereof, in the jurisdictions in which we operate and differences between estimated and actual future taxable income. Any such factors could have a material effect on our current and deferred tax positions as reported in our consolidated financial statements. A high degree of judgment is required to assess the impact of possible future outcomes on our current and deferred tax positions. 
 
 Tax laws in jurisdictions in which we have a presence are subject to varied interpretation, and many tax positions we take are subject to significant uncertainty regarding whether the position will be ultimately sustained after review by the relevant tax authority. We recognize the financial statement effects of a tax position when it is more-likely-than-not, based on technical merits, that the position will be sustained upon examination. The determination of whether the tax position meets the more-likely-than-not threshold requires a facts-based judgment using all information available. In a number of cases, we have concluded that the more-likely-than-not threshold is not met and, accordingly, the amount of tax benefit recognized in our consolidated financial statements is different than the amount taken or expected to be taken in our tax returns. As of December 31, 2022, the amount of unrecognized tax benefits for financial reporting purposes, but taken or expected to be taken in our tax returns, was 435.2 million, of which 337.9 million would have a favorable impact on our effective income tax rate if ultimately recognized, after considering amounts that we would expect to be offset by valuation allowances. 
 
 We are required to continually assess our tax positions, and the results of tax examinations or changes in judgment can result in substantial changes to our unrecognized tax benefits. 
 
 II-33 

Item 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK 
 
 We are exposed to market risk in the normal course of our business operations due to our investments in various foreign countries and ongoing investing and financing activities. Market risk refers to the risk of loss arising from adverse changes in foreign currency exchange rates, interest rates and stock prices. The risk of loss can be assessed from the perspective of adverse changes in fair values, cash flows and future earnings. As further described below, we have established policies, procedures and processes governing our management of market risks and the use of derivative instruments to manage our exposure to such risks. 

Cash and Investments 
 
 We invest our cash in highly liquid instruments that meet high credit quality standards. We are exposed to exchange rate risk to the extent that the denominations of our cash and cash equivalent balances, revolving lines of credit and other short-term sources of liquidity do not correspond to the denominations of our and our subsidiaries short-term liquidity requirements. In order to mitigate this risk, we actively manage the denominations of our cash balances in light of our and our subsidiaries forecasted liquidity requirements. At December 31, 2022 and 2021, our consolidated cash balances included 1,307.9 million or 75.8 and 387.3 million or 42.5 , respectively, denominated in euros and 347.2 million or 20.1 and 468.8 million or 51.5 , respectively, denominated in U.S. dollars. At December 31, 2022 and 2021, the balances of our consolidated investments held under SMAs of million and million, respectively, were denominated entirely in U.S. dollars. 

Foreign Currency Risk 
 
 We are exposed to foreign currency exchange rate risk with respect to our consolidated debt in situations where our debt is denominated in a currency other than the functional currency of the operations whose cash flows support our ability to repay or refinance such debt. Although we generally match the denomination of our and our subsidiaries borrowings with the functional currency of the operations that are supporting the respective borrowings, market conditions or other factors may cause us to enter into borrowing arrangements that are not denominated in the functional currency of the underlying operations (unmatched debt). In these cases, our policy is to provide for an economic hedge against foreign currency exchange rate movements by using derivative instruments to synthetically convert unmatched debt into the applicable underlying currency. At December 31, 2022, substantially all of our debt was either directly or synthetically matched to the applicable functional currencies of the underlying operations. For additional information concerning the terms of our derivative instruments, see note 8 to our consolidated financial statements. 
 
 In addition to the exposure that results from the mismatch of our borrowings and underlying functional currencies, we are exposed to foreign currency risk to the extent that we enter into transactions denominated in currencies other than our or our subsidiaries respective functional currencies (non-functional currency risk), such as equipment purchases, programming contracts, notes payable and notes receivable (including intercompany amounts). Changes in exchange rates with respect to amounts recorded on our consolidated balance sheets related to these items will result in unrealized (based upon period-end exchange rates) or realized foreign currency transaction gains and losses upon settlement of the transactions. Moreover, to the extent that our revenue, costs and expenses are denominated in currencies other than our respective functional currencies, we will experience fluctuations in our revenue, costs and expenses solely as a result of changes in foreign currency exchange rates. Generally, we will consider hedging non-functional currency risks when the risks arise from agreements with third parties that involve the future payment or receipt of cash or other monetary items to the extent that we can reasonably predict the timing and amount of such payments or receipts and the payments or receipts are not otherwise hedged. In this regard, we have entered into foreign currency forward and option contracts to hedge certain of these risks. For additional information concerning our foreign currency forward and option contracts, see note 8 to our consolidated financial statements. 
 
 We are also exposed to unfavorable and potentially volatile fluctuations of the U.S. dollar (our reporting currency) against the currencies of our operating subsidiaries when their respective financial statements are translated into U.S. dollars for inclusion in our consolidated financial statements. Cumulative translation adjustments are recorded in accumulated other comprehensive earnings or loss as a separate component of equity. Any increase (decrease) in the value of the U.S. dollar against any foreign currency that is the functional currency of one of our operating subsidiaries will cause us to experience unrealized foreign currency translation losses (gains) with respect to amounts already invested in such foreign currencies. Accordingly, we may experience a negative impact on our comprehensive earnings or loss and equity with respect to our holdings solely as a result of FX. Our primary exposure to FX risk during the three months ended December 31, 2022 was to the euro and Swiss franc, as 55.1 and 43.6 of our reported revenue during the period was derived from subsidiaries whose functional currencies are the euro and Swiss franc, respectively. In addition, our reported operating results are impacted by changes in the exchange rates for other local currencies in Europe. We do not hedge against the risk that we may incur non-cash 
 II-34 

losses upon the translation of the financial statements of our subsidiaries and affiliates into U.S. dollars. For additional information regarding certain currency instability risks, see Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations above. 
 
 The relationships between the primary currencies of the countries in which we operate and the U.S. dollar, which is our reporting currency, are shown below, per one U.S. dollar: 
 As of December 31, 2022 2021 Spot rates: Euro 0.9337 0.8782 Swiss franc 0.9219 0.9114 British pound sterling 0.8265 0.7388 Polish zloty 4.3686 4.0285 
 
 Year ended December 31, 2022 2021 2020 Average rates: Euro 0.9509 0.8455 0.8775 Swiss franc 0.9548 0.9139 0.9389 British pound sterling 0.8112 0.7269 0.7796 Polish zloty 4.4555 3.8595 3.8979 

Inflation and Foreign Investment Risk 
 
 We are subject to inflationary pressures with respect to labor, programming and other costs. In this regard, inflation rates in the countries in which we operate have recently increased, and in many countries such increases have been significant. While we attempt to increase our revenue to offset increases in costs, there is no assurance that we will be able to do so. Therefore, costs could rise faster than associated revenue, thereby resulting in a negative impact on our operating results, cash flows and liquidity. The economic environment in the respective countries in which we operate is a function of government, economic, fiscal and monetary policies and various other factors beyond our control that could lead to inflation. We are unable to predict the extent that price levels might be impacted in future periods by the current state of the economies in the countries in which we operate. 

Interest Rate Risks 
 
 We are exposed to changes in interest rates primarily as a result of our borrowing activities, which include fixed-rate and variable-rate borrowings by our borrowing groups. Our primary exposure to variable-rate debt is through the EURIBOR-indexed and LIBOR-indexed debt of our borrowing groups and the variable-rate debt of certain of our other subsidiaries. 
 
 In general, we enter into derivative instruments to protect against increases in the interest rates on our variable-rate debt. Accordingly, we have entered into various derivative transactions to manage exposure to increases in interest rates. We use interest rate derivative contracts to exchange, at specified intervals, the difference between fixed and variable interest rates calculated by reference to an agreed-upon notional principal amount. From time to time we also use interest rate cap, floor and collar agreements and swaptions that lock in a maximum interest rate if variable rates rise, but also allow our company to benefit, to a limited extent in the case of collars, from declines in market rates. Under our current guidelines, we use various interest rate derivative instruments to mitigate interest rate risk. The final maturity dates of our various portfolios of interest rate derivative instruments might, in some instances, fall short of the respective maturities of the underlying variable-rate debt. In this regard, we use judgment to determine the appropriate composition and maturity dates of our portfolios of interest rate derivative instruments, taking into account the relative costs and benefits of different maturity profiles in light of current and expected future market conditions, liquidity issues and other factors. For additional information concerning the impacts of these interest rate derivative instruments, see note 8 to our consolidated financial statements. 
 
 In July 2017, the U.K. Financial Conduct Authority (the authority that regulates LIBOR) announced that it intends to stop compelling banks to submit rates for the calculation of LIBOR after 2021. Additionally, the European Money Markets Institute (the authority that administers EURIBOR) announced that measures would need to be undertaken by the end of 2021 to reform 
 II-35 

EURIBOR to ensure compliance with the E.U. Benchmarks Regulation. In November 2020, ICE Benchmark Administration (the entity that administers LIBOR) announced its intention to continue publishing USD LIBOR rates until June 30, 2023, with the exception of the one-week and two-month rates which, along with all CHF and GBP LIBOR rates, it ceased to publish after December 31, 2021. Furthermore, in November 2022, the U.K. Financial Conduct Authority proposed that certain tenors of USD LIBOR would continue to be published on a synthetic basis until the end of September 2024. While this extension allows additional runway on existing contracts using USD LIBOR rates, companies are still encouraged to transition away from using USD LIBOR as soon as practicable and should not enter into new contracts that use USD LIBOR after 2021. The methodology for EURIBOR has been reformed and EURIBOR has been granted regulatory approval to continue to be used. Currently, there is no consensus amongst loan borrowers and investors for what rate(s) should replace USD LIBOR. 
 
 In October 2020, the International Swaps and Derivatives Association (the ISDA launched the Fallback Supplement, which, as of January 25, 2021, amended the standard definitions for interest rate derivatives to incorporate fallbacks for derivatives linked to certain key interbank offered rates IBORs ). The ISDA also launched the Fallback Protocol, a protocol that enables market participants to incorporate these revisions into their legacy non-cleared derivatives with other counterparties that choose to adhere to the protocol. The fallbacks for a particular currency apply following a permanent cessation of the IBOR in that currency, or in the case of a LIBOR setting, that LIBOR setting becoming permanently unrepresentative, and are adjusted versions of the risk-free rates identified in each currency. Our credit agreements contain provisions that contemplate alternative calculations of the base rate applicable to our LIBOR-indexed and EURIBOR-indexed debt to the extent LIBOR or EURIBOR (as applicable) are not available, which alternative calculations we do not anticipate will be materially different from what would have been calculated under LIBOR or EURIBOR (as applicable). Additionally, no mandatory prepayment or redemption provisions would be triggered under our credit agreements in the event that either the LIBOR rate or the EURIBOR rate is not available. It is possible, however, that any new reference rate that applies to our LIBOR-indexed or EURIBOR-indexed debt could be different from any new reference rate that applies to our LIBOR-indexed or EURIBOR-indexed derivative instruments. For discontinued currencies and tenors, we expect to continue taking steps to mitigate the changes in these benchmark rates, including by amending existing credit agreements and adhering to the Fallback Protocol, where appropriate. We plan to continue to manage this difference and any resulting increased variable-rate exposure through modifications to our debt and/or derivative instruments, however, future market conditions may not allow immediate implementation of desired modifications and our subsidiaries may incur significant associated costs. 
 
 Weighted Average Variable Interest Rate. At December 31, 2022 and 2021, the outstanding principal amount of our variable-rate indebtedness aggregated 9.3 billion and 9.6 billion, respectively, and the weighted average interest rate (including margin) on such variable-rate indebtedness was approximately 5.9 and 2.7 , respectively, excluding the effects of interest rate derivative contracts, deferred financing costs, original issue premiums or discounts and commitment fees, all of which affect our overall cost of borrowing. Assuming no change in the amount outstanding at December 31, 2022, and without giving effect to any interest rate derivative contracts, deferred financing costs, original issue premiums or discounts and commitment fees, a hypothetical 50 basis point (0.50 increase (decrease) in our weighted average variable interest rate would increase (decrease) our annual consolidated interest expense and cash outflows by 46.5 million. As discussed above and in note 8 to our consolidated financial statements, we use interest rate derivative contracts to manage our exposure to increases in variable interest rates. In this regard, increases in the fair value of these contracts generally would be expected to offset most of the economic impact of increases in the variable interest rates applicable to our indebtedness to the extent and during the period that principal amounts are matched with interest rate derivative contracts. 

Counterparty Credit Risk 
 
 We are exposed to the risk that the counterparties to the derivative instruments, undrawn debt facilities and cash investments of our subsidiary borrowing groups will default on their obligations to us. We manage these credit risks through the evaluation and monitoring of the creditworthiness of, and concentration of risk with, the respective counterparties. In this regard, credit risk associated with our derivative instruments and undrawn debt facilities is spread across a relatively broad counterparty base of banks and financial institutions, however notwithstanding, given the size of our derivative portfolio, the default of certain counterparties could have a significant impact on our consolidated statements of operations. Collateral is generally not posted by either party under the derivative instruments of our subsidiary borrowing groups. Most of our cash currently is invested in either (i) AAA-rated money market funds, including funds that invest in government obligations, or (ii) overnight deposits with banks having a minimum credit rating of A by Standard Poor s or an equivalent rating by Moody s Investor Service. To date, neither the access to nor the value of our cash and cash equivalent balances have been adversely impacted by liquidity problems of financial institutions. 
 
 II-36 

At December 31, 2022 and 2021, our exposure to counterparty credit risk included (i) cash and cash equivalent and restricted cash balances of 1.7 billion and 0.9 billion, respectively, (ii) aggregate undrawn debt facilities of 1.5 billion and 1.6 billion, respectively, and (iii) derivative assets with an aggregate fair value of 922.5 million and 57.8 million, respectively. 
 
 Each of our subsidiary borrowing groups have entered into derivative instruments under master agreements with each counterparty that contain master netting arrangements that are applicable in the event of early termination by either party to such derivative instrument. The master netting arrangements are limited to the derivative instruments governed by the relevant master agreement within each individual borrowing group and are independent of similar arrangements of our other subsidiary borrowing groups. 
 
 Under our derivative contracts, it is generally only the non-defaulting party that has a contractual option to exercise early termination rights upon the default of the other counterparty and to set off other liabilities against sums due upon such termination. However, in an insolvency of a derivative counterparty, under the laws of certain jurisdictions, the defaulting counterparty or its insolvency representatives may be able to compel the termination of one or more derivative contracts and trigger early termination payment liabilities payable by us, reflecting any mark-to-market value of the contracts for the counterparty. Alternatively, or in addition, the insolvency laws of certain jurisdictions may require the mandatory set off of amounts due under such derivative contracts against present and future liabilities owed to us under other contracts between us and the relevant counterparty. Accordingly, it is possible that we may be subject to obligations to make payments, or may have present or future liabilities owed to us partially or fully discharged by set off as a result of such obligations, in the event of the insolvency of a derivative counterparty, even though it is the counterparty that is in default and not us. To the extent that we are required to make such payments, our ability to do so will depend on our liquidity and capital resources at the time. In an insolvency of a defaulting counterparty, we will be an unsecured creditor in respect of any amount owed to us by the defaulting counterparty, except to the extent of the value of any collateral we have obtained from that counterparty. 
 
 In addition, where a counterparty is in financial difficulty, under the laws of certain jurisdictions, the relevant regulators may be able to (i) compel the termination of one or more derivative instruments, determine the settlement amount and/or compel, without any payment, the partial or full discharge of liabilities arising from such early termination that are payable by the relevant counterparty or (ii) transfer the derivative instruments to an alternative counterparty. 
 
 While we currently have no specific concerns about the creditworthiness of any counterparty for which we have material credit risk exposures, we cannot rule out the possibility that one or more of our counterparties could fail or otherwise be unable to meet its obligations to us. Any such instance could have an adverse effect on our cash flows, results of operations, financial condition and/or liquidity. 
 
 Although we actively monitor the creditworthiness of our key vendors, the financial failure of a key vendor could disrupt our operations and have an adverse impact on our revenue and cash flows. 

Sensitivity Information 
 
 Information concerning the sensitivity of the fair value of certain of our more significant derivative instruments to changes in market conditions is set forth below. The potential changes in fair value set forth below do not include any amounts associated with the remeasurement of the derivative asset or liability into the applicable functional currency.

Management s Annual Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting 
 
 Our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting, as such term is defined in Rule 13a-15(f) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. Our internal control over financial reporting is designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. 
 
 Our management assessed the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2022, using the criteria in Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. Based on this evaluation, our management believes that our internal control over financial reporting was effective as of December 31, 2022. The effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting has been audited by KPMG LLP, an independent registered public accounting firm, as stated in their report included herein.

To the Shareholders and Board of Directors 
 Liberty Global plc: 
 
 Opinion on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting 
 
 We have audited Liberty Global plc and subsidiaries' (the Company) internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2022, based on criteria established in Internal Control Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. In our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2022, based on criteria established in Internal Control Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. 
 
 We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the consolidated balance sheets of the Company as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, the related consolidated statements of operations, comprehensive earnings (loss), equity, and cash flows for each of the years in the three-year period ended December 31, 2022, and the related notes and financial statement schedules I to II (collectively, the consolidated financial statements), and our report dated February 22, 2023 expressed an unqualified opinion on those consolidated financial statements. 
 
 Basis for Opinion 
 
 The Company s management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in the accompanying Management's Annual Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company s internal control over financial reporting based on our audit. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. 
 
 We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audit of internal control over financial reporting included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk. Our audit also included performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion. 
 
 Definition and Limitations of Internal Control Over Financial Reporting 
 
 A company s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements. 
 
 Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm 

To the Shareholders and Board of Directors 
 Liberty Global plc: 
 
 Opinion on the Consolidated Financial Statements 
 
 We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Liberty Global plc and subsidiaries (the Company) as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, the related consolidated statements of operations, comprehensive earnings (loss), equity, and cash flows for each of the years in the three-year period ended December 31, 2022, and the related notes and financial statement schedules I to II (collectively, the consolidated financial statements). In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the years in the three-year period ended December 31, 2022, in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. 
 
 We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the Company s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2022, based on criteria established in Internal Control Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission, and our report dated February 22, 2023 expressed an unqualified opinion on the effectiveness of the Company s internal control over financial reporting. 
 
 Basis for Opinion 
 
 These consolidated financial statements are the responsibility of the Company s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these consolidated financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. 
 
 We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. Our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the consolidated financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the consolidated financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion. 
 
 Critical Audit Matter 
 
 The critical audit matter communicated below is a matter arising from the current period audit of the consolidated financial statements that was communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that: (1) relates to accounts or disclosures that are material to the consolidated financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of a critical audit matter does not alter in any way our opinion on the consolidated financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matter below, providing a separate opinion on the critical audit matter or on the accounts or disclosures to which it relates. 
 
 Capitalization of external costs 
 
 As discussed in Notes 3 and 10 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company capitalizes certain external costs for construction and installation activities and internal use software. Capitalized external costs for construction and installation activities and internal use software are recorded within property and equipment, net which has a balance of 6,504.5 million as of December 31, 2022. 
 
 II-42 

We identified the assessment of the capitalization of external costs for construction and installation activities and internal use software as a critical audit matter. Assessing the Company s determination of which costs qualify for capitalization or expense required a high degree of auditor judgment to evaluate the nature of the supporting documentation. 
 
 The following are the primary procedures we performed to address this critical audit matter. We applied auditor judgment to determine the nature of procedures to be performed over the capitalization of external costs for construction and installation activities and internal use software. This included comparing the external costs capitalized in the current year for construction and installation activities and internal use software to the historical external costs capitalized, considering the nature of the Company s business activities, to identify, for further investigation, inconsistent trends or unexpected patterns of capitalization. We evaluated the design and tested the operating effectiveness of certain internal controls related to the capitalization of external costs for construction and installation activities and internal use software. This included controls related to (1) the Company s identification of qualifying capital external costs and (2) the Company s review of the nature of the underlying activity. We selected a sample of capitalized external costs in the current year and independently assessed the Company s determination that such costs qualify for capitalization by investigating the nature of the costs based on underlying third-party documentation such as project documentation, vendor contracts and invoices.

The allowance for doubtful accounts is based upon our current estimate of lifetime expected credit losses related to uncollectible accounts receivable. We use a number of factors in determining the allowance, including, among other things, collection trends, prevailing and anticipated economic conditions and specific customer credit risk. The allowance is maintained until either payment is received or the likelihood of collection is considered to be remote. 
 
 Concentration of credit risk with respect to trade receivables is limited due to the large number of residential and business customers. We also manage this risk by disconnecting services to customers whose accounts are delinquent.

 VMO2 JV 
 
 On June 1, 2021, we completed the U.K. JV Transaction. Each of Liberty Global and Telef nica (each a U.K. JV Shareholder holds of the issued share capital of the VMO2 JV . The U.K. JV Shareholders intend for the VMO2 JV to be funded solely from its net cash flows from operations and third-party financing. We account for our interest in the VMO2 JV as an equity method investment and consider the VMO2 JV to be a related party. For additional information regarding the U.K. JV Transaction, see note 6. 
 
 In connection with the formation of the VMO2 JV, the U.K. JV Shareholders entered into an agreement (the U.K. JV Shareholders Agreement that contains customary provisions for the governance of a : joint venture and provides Liberty Global and Telef nica with joint control over decision making with respect to the VMO2 JV. 
 
 The U.K. JV Shareholders Agreement also provides (i) for a dividend distribution policy that requires the VMO2 JV to distribute all unrestricted cash to the U.K. JV Shareholders on a pro rata basis (subject to the VMO2 JV maintaining a minimum amount of cash and complying with the terms of its financing arrangements) and (ii) that the VMO2 JV will be managed with a leverage ratio between and times EBITDA (as calculated pursuant to its existing financing arrangements), with the VMO2 JV undertaking periodic recapitalizations and/or refinancings accordingly. During 2022, we received dividend distributions from the VMO2 JV aggregating million, of which million was accounted for as a return of capital and million was accounted for as a return on capital for purposes of our consolidated statements of cash flows. During 2021, we received a dividend distribution from the VMO2 JV of million, which was accounted for as a return on capital for purposes of our consolidated statement of cash flows. 
 
 Each U.K. JV Shareholder has the right to initiate an initial public offering IPO of the VMO2 JV after the third anniversary of the closing, with the opportunity for the other U.K. JV Shareholder to sell shares in the IPO on a pro rata basis. Subject to certain exceptions, the U.K. JV Shareholders Agreement prohibits transfers of interests in the VMO2 JV to third parties until the fifth anniversary of the closing. After the fifth anniversary, each U.K. JV Shareholder will be able to initiate a sale of all of its interest in the VMO2 JV to a third party and, under certain circumstances, initiate a sale of the entire VMO2 JV; subject, in each case, to a right of first offer in favor of the other U.K. JV Shareholder. 
 
 Pursuant to an agreement entered into in connection with the closing of the VMO2 JV (the U.K. JV Framework Agreement ), Liberty Global provides certain services to the VMO2 JV on a transitional or ongoing basis (collectively, the U.K. JV Services ). Pursuant to the terms of the U.K. JV Framework Agreement, the ongoing services will be provided for a period of two to depending on the type of service, while transitional services will be provided for a period of no less than 12 months, after which both parties shall be entitled to terminate based on specified notice periods. The U.K. JV Services provided by Liberty Global consist primarily of (i) technology and other services and (ii) capital-related expenditures for assets that will be used by or will otherwise benefit the VMO2 JV. Liberty Global charges both fixed and variable fees to the VMO2 JV for the U.K. JV Services it provides during the term of the U.K. JV Framework Agreement. We recorded revenue related to the U.K. JV Services of million and million during 2022 and 2021, respectively. At December 31, 2022 and 2021, million and million, respectively, was due from the VMO2 JV, primarily related to (a) services performed under the U.K. JV Framework Agreement and (b) amounts incurred by Liberty Global for certain equipment and licenses purchased on behalf of the VMO2 JV. The amounts due from the VMO2 JV, which are periodically cash settled, are included in other current assets on our consolidated balance sheets. 
 
 In July 2022, the VMO2 JV entered into a new long-term performance incentive plan (the 2022 VMO2 LTIP for certain of its employees, dependent on the achievement of specific performance metrics over each of the in the period beginning January 1, 2022 and ending on December 31, 2024. Payout may occur in March 2025 and will be settled in Liberty Global Class A and/or Liberty Global Class C ordinary shares and Telef nica ordinary shares, with the settlement split evenly between the U.K. JV Shareholders. Subject to forfeitures, of each participant s payout will be earned on January 1, 2024 with the remainder earned on December 31, 2024. The 2022 VMO2 LTIP awards are liability classified due to the fact that the final payout will be a fixed monetary amount settled in a variable number of shares. At December 31, 2022, the estimated fair value of Liberty Global s share of the final payout under the 2022 VMO2 LTIP was million. As the VMO2 JV will reimburse the U.K. JV Shareholders in cash for the value of each company s payout of the 2022 VMO2 LTIP awards, a

Given the recency of the VMO2 JV s formation, the fair value of the business has been in close proximity to its carrying value and was estimated to be billion billion) at the measurement date.

 Counterparty Credit Risk 
 
 We are exposed to the risk that the counterparties to the derivative instruments of our subsidiary borrowing groups will default on their obligations to us. We manage these credit risks through the evaluation and monitoring of the creditworthiness of, and concentration of risk with, the respective counterparties. In this regard, credit risk associated with our derivative instruments is spread across a relatively broad counterparty base of banks and financial institutions, however notwithstanding, given the size of our derivative portfolio, the default of certain counterparties could have a significant impact on our consolidated statements of operations. Collateral is generally not posted by either party under our derivative instruments. At December 31, 2022, our exposure to counterparty credit risk included derivative assets with an aggregate fair value of million. 
 
 Each of our subsidiary borrowing groups have entered into derivative instruments under master agreements with each counterparty that contain master netting arrangements that are applicable in the event of early termination by either party to such derivative instrument. The master netting arrangements are limited to the derivative instruments governed by the relevant master agreement within each individual borrowing group and are independent of similar arrangements of our other subsidiary borrowing groups. 
 
 Under our derivative contracts, it is generally only the non-defaulting party that has a contractual option to exercise early termination rights upon the default of the other counterparty and to set off other liabilities against sums due upon such termination. However, in an insolvency of a derivative counterparty, under the laws of certain jurisdictions, the defaulting counterparty or its insolvency representatives may be able to compel the termination of one or more derivative contracts and trigger early termination payment liabilities payable by us, reflecting any mark-to-market value of the contracts for the counterparty. Alternatively, or in addition, the insolvency laws of certain jurisdictions may require the mandatory set off of amounts due under such derivative contracts against present and future liabilities owed to us under other contracts between us and the relevant counterparty. Accordingly, it is possible that we may be subject to obligations to make payments, or may have present or future liabilities owed to us partially or fully discharged by set off as a result of such obligations, in the event of the insolvency of a derivative counterparty, even though it is the counterparty that is in default and not us. To the extent that we are required to make such payments, our ability to do so will depend on our liquidity and capital resources at the time. In an insolvency of a defaulting counterparty, we will be an unsecured creditor in respect of any amount owed to us by the defaulting counterparty, except to the extent of the value of any collateral we have obtained from that counterparty. 
 
 In addition, where a counterparty is in financial difficulty, under the laws of certain jurisdictions, the relevant regulators may be able to (i) compel the termination of one or more derivative instruments, determine the settlement amount and/or compel, without any payment, the partial or full discharge of liabilities arising from such early termination that are payable by the relevant counterparty, or (ii) transfer the derivative instruments to an alternative counterparty.

 General Information 
 
 At December 31, 2022, most of our outstanding debt had been incurred by one of our subsidiary borrowing groups. References to these borrowing groups, which comprise UPC Holding, Telenet and VM Ireland, include their respective restricted parent and subsidiary entities. 
 
 Credit Facilities. Each of our borrowing groups has entered into one or more credit facility agreements with certain financial and other institutions. Certain of our credit facilities provide for adjustments to our borrowing rates based on the achievement, or otherwise, of certain sustainability-linked metrics. Each of these credit facilities contain certain covenants, the more notable of which are as follows: 
 
 Our credit facilities contain certain consolidated net leverage ratios, as specified in the relevant credit facility, which are required to be complied with (i) on an incurrence basis and/or (ii) when the associated revolving credit facilities have been drawn beyond a specified percentage of the total available revolving credit commitments on a maintenance basis; 
 
 Subject to certain customary and agreed exceptions, our credit facilities contain certain restrictions which, among other things, restrict the ability of the members of the relevant borrowing group to (i) incur or guarantee certain financial indebtedness, (ii) make certain disposals and acquisitions, (iii) create certain security interests over their assets and (iv) make certain restricted payments to their direct and/or indirect parent companies (and indirectly to Liberty Global) through dividends, loans or other distributions; 
 
 Our credit facilities require that certain members of the relevant borrowing group guarantee the payment of all sums payable under the relevant credit facility and such group members are required to grant first-ranking security over their shares and, in certain borrowing groups, over substantially all of their assets to secure the payment of all sums payable thereunder; 
 
 In addition to certain mandatory prepayment events, our credit facilities provide that the instructing group of lenders under the relevant credit facility, under certain circumstances, may cancel the group s commitments thereunder and declare the loan(s) thereunder due and payable after the applicable notice period following the occurrence of a change of control (as specified in the relevant credit facility); 
 
 Our credit facilities contain certain customary events of default, the occurrence of which, subject to certain exceptions, materiality qualifications and cure rights, would allow the instructing group of lenders to (i) cancel the total commitments, (ii) declare that all or part of the loans be payable on demand and/or (iii) accelerate all outstanding loans and terminate their commitments thereunder; 
 
 Our credit facilities require members of the relevant borrowing group to observe certain affirmative and negative undertakings and covenants, which are subject to certain materiality qualifications and other customary and agreed exceptions; and 
 
 In addition to customary default provisions, our credit facilities generally include certain cross-default or cross-acceleration provisions with respect to other indebtedness of members of the relevant borrowing group, subject to agreed minimum thresholds and other customary and agreed exceptions. 
 
 Senior and Senior Secured Notes. Certain of our borrowing groups have issued senior and/or senior secured notes. In general, our senior and senior secured notes (i) are senior obligations of each respective issuer within the relevant borrowing group that rank equally with all of the existing and future senior debt of such issuer and are senior to all existing and future subordinated debt of such issuer within the relevant borrowing group, (ii) contain, in most instances, certain guarantees from other members of the relevant borrowing group (as specified in the applicable indenture) and (iii) with respect to our senior secured notes, are secured by certain pledges or liens over the shares of certain members of the relevant borrowing group and,

 Our senior secured notes contain certain early redemption provisions including the ability to, during each -month period commencing on the issue date for such notes until the applicable call date, redeem up to of the principal amount of the notes at a redemption price equal to of the principal amount of the notes to be redeemed plus accrued and unpaid interest; and 
 
 Our notes are non-callable prior to their respective call date (as specified under the applicable indenture). At any time prior to the applicable call date, we may redeem some or all of the applicable notes by paying a make-whole premium, which is the present value of all remaining scheduled interest payments to the applicable call date using the discount rate as of the redemption date plus a premium (as specified in the applicable indenture). On or after the applicable call date, we may redeem some or all of these notes at various redemption prices plus accrued interest and additional amounts (as specified in the applicable indenture), if any, to the applicable redemption date. 
 
 SPE Notes. From time to time, we create special purpose financing entities SPE ), some of which are owned by the relevant borrowing group and some of which are owned by third parties Third-Party SPEs ). These SPEs are created for the primary purpose of facilitating the offering of senior secured notes, which we collectively refer to as SPE Notes . 
 
 The SPEs use the proceeds from the issuance of SPE Notes to fund term loan facilities under the credit facilities made available to their respective borrowing group, each a Funded Facility and collectively the Funded Facilities . Each SPE is dependent on payments from the relevant borrowing entity under the applicable Funded Facility in order to service its payment obligations under each respective SPE Note. Each of the Funded Facility term loans creates a variable interest in the respective Third-Party SPE for which the relevant borrowing entity is the primary beneficiary. Accordingly, such Third-Party SPEs are consolidated by the relevant parent entities, including Liberty Global. As a result, the amounts outstanding under the Funded Facilities of the SPEs owned by the relevant borrowing group and the Third-Party SPEs are eliminated in the consolidated financial statements of the respective borrowing group and Liberty Global. At December 31, 2022, we had outstanding SPE Notes issued by a Third-Party SPE consolidated by UPC Holding (the UPCB SPE ). 
 
 Pursuant to the respective indentures for the SPE Notes (the SPE Indentures and the respective accession agreements for the Funded Facilities, the call provisions, maturity dates and applicable interest rates for each Funded Facility are the same as those of the related SPE Notes. The SPEs, as lenders under the relevant Funded Facility for the relevant borrowing group, are treated the same as the other lenders under the respective credit facility, with benefits, rights and protections similar to those afforded to the other lenders. Through the covenants in the applicable SPE Indentures and the applicable security interests over the relevant SPE s rights under the applicable Funded Facility granted to secure the relevant SPE s obligations under the relevant SPE Notes, the holders of the SPE Notes are provided indirectly with the benefits, rights, protections and covenants granted to the SPEs as lenders under the applicable Funded Facility. The SPEs are prohibited from incurring any additional indebtedness, subject to certain exceptions under the SPE Indentures.

 Our tax loss carryforwards within each jurisdiction combine all companies tax losses (both capital and ordinary losses) in that jurisdiction, however, certain tax jurisdictions limit the ability to offset taxable income of a separate company or different tax group with the tax losses associated with another separate company or group. Further, tax jurisdictions restrict the type of taxable income that the above losses are able to offset. The majority of the tax losses shown in the above table are not expected to be realized, including certain losses that are limited in use due to change in control or same business tests. 
 
 We have taxable outside basis differences on certain investments in non-U.S. subsidiaries. No additional income taxes have been provided for any undistributed foreign earnings, or any additional outside basis difference inherent in these entities, as these amounts continue to be reinvested in foreign operations. At December 31, 2022, we have not provided deferred tax liabilities on an estimated billion of cumulative temporary differences on the outside bases of our non-U.S. subsidiaries. 
 
 Through our subsidiaries, we maintain a presence in many countries. Many of these countries maintain highly complex tax regimes that differ significantly from the system of income taxation used in the U.K. and the U.S. We have accounted for the effect of these taxes based on what we believe is reasonably expected to apply to us and our subsidiaries based on tax laws currently in effect and reasonable interpretations of these laws. 
 
 On August 16, 2022, the Inflation Reduction Act was signed into law in the U.S. Although this legislation does not increase the U.S. corporate income tax rate, it includes, among other provisions, a new corporate alternative minimum tax (CAMT) on adjusted financial statement income that is effective for tax years beginning after December 31, 2022. We do not currently anticipate that the CAMT will have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements, although we will continue to monitor additional guidance as it is issued to assess the impact to our tax position. We will disregard our CAMT status when evaluating our deferred tax assets under the regular U.S. tax system. 
 
 We and our subsidiaries file consolidated and standalone income tax returns in various jurisdictions. In the normal course of business, our income tax filings are subject to review by various taxing authorities. In connection with such reviews, disputes could arise with the taxing authorities over the interpretation or application of certain income tax rules related to our business in that tax jurisdiction. Such disputes may result in future tax and interest and penalty assessments by these taxing authorities. The ultimate resolution of tax contingencies will take place upon the earlier of (i) the settlement date with the applicable taxing authorities in either cash or agreement of income tax positions or (ii) the date when the tax authorities are statutorily prohibited from adjusting the company s tax computations. 
 
 In general, tax returns filed by our company or our subsidiaries for years prior to 2010 are no longer subject to examination by tax authorities. Certain of our subsidiaries are currently involved in income tax examinations in various jurisdictions in which we operate, including Belgium, Ireland and the U.S. While we do not expect adjustments from the foregoing examinations to have a material impact on our consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flows, no assurance can be given that this will be the case given the amounts involved and the complex nature of the related issues.

 As of December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020, there were million, million, and million, respectively, of unrecognized tax benefits that would have a favorable impact on our effective income tax rate if ultimately recognized, after considering amounts that we would expect to be offset by valuation allowances and other factors. 
 
 During 2023, we do not expect any material reductions to our unrecognized tax benefits related to tax positions taken as of December 31, 2022. No assurance can be given as to the nature or impact of any changes in our unrecognized tax positions during 2023. 
 
 During 2022, 2021 and 2020, the income tax expense of our continuing operations included million, million and million, respectively, representing the net accrual of interest and penalties during the period. At December 31, 2022, our other long-term liabilities included accrued interest and penalties of million. 
 
 On October 7, 2022, the U.S. Department of Justice filed suit against Liberty Global, Inc. (LGI), a wholly owned U.S. subsidiary of Liberty Global, in the U.S. District Court of Colorado for unpaid federal income taxes and penalties for the 2018 tax year of approximately million. This action by the U.S. Department of Justice is related to the November 2020 complaint filed by LGI in the District Court of Colorado seeking a refund of approximately million of taxes, penalties and interest associated with the application of certain temporary Treasury regulations issued in June 2019. No amounts have been accrued by LGI with respect to this matter. We will vigorously defend this matter and continue to actively pursue our claim for refund.

 Share Repurchase Programs 
 
 As a U.K. incorporated company, we may only elect to repurchase shares or pay dividends to the extent of our Distributable Reserves . Distributable Reserves, which are not linked to a GAAP reported amount, may be created through the earnings of the U.K. parent company and, among other methods, through a reduction in share premium approved by the English Companies Court. Based on the amounts set forth in our 2021 U.K. Companies Act Report dated April 29, 2022, which are our most recent Relevant Accounts for purposes of determining our Distributable Reserves under U.K. law, our Distributable Reserves were billion as of December 31, 2021. This amount does not reflect earnings, share repurchases or other activity that occurred during 2022, each of which impacts the amount of our Distributable Reserves. 
 
 Our board of directors has approved various share repurchase programs for our Liberty Global ordinary shares. Under our repurchase programs, we may acquire from time to time our Class A ordinary shares, Class C ordinary shares or any combination of Class A and Class C ordinary shares. Our repurchase programs may be effected through open market transactions and/or privately negotiated transactions, which may include derivative transactions. The timing of the repurchase of shares pursuant to these programs will depend on a variety of factors, including market conditions and applicable law, and these programs may be implemented in conjunction with brokers for the company and other financial institutions with whom the company has relationships within certain preset parameters and purchases may continue during closed periods in accordance with applicable restrictions. Our share repurchase programs may be suspended or discontinued at any time. In July 2021, our board of directors approved a share repurchase program pursuant to which we are authorized to repurchase of our shares during each of 2022 and 2023, based on the total number of our outstanding shares as of the beginning of each respective year. As determined by our total number of outstanding shares as of December 31, 2022, we are authorized to repurchase approximately million of our Class A and/or Class C ordinary shares during 2023. Based on the respective closing share prices as of December 30, 2022, this would equate to total share repurchases during 2023 of approximately billion. However, the actual U.S. dollar amount of our share repurchases during 2023 will be determined by the actual transaction date share prices during the year and could differ significantly from this amount.

Purchase commitments Programming commitments Other commitments Total 

Network and connectivity commitments include (i) Telenet s commitments for certain operating costs associated with its leased network and (ii) certain network capacity arrangements in Switzerland. Telenet s commitments for certain operating costs are subject to adjustment based on changes in the network operating costs incurred by Telenet with respect to its own networks. These potential adjustments are not subject to reasonable estimation and, therefore, are not included in the above table. 
 
 Purchase commitments include unconditional and legally binding obligations related to (i) certain service-related commitments, including information technology, maintenance and call center services and (ii) the purchase of CPE, network and other equipment. 
 
 Programming commitments consist of obligations associated with certain of our programming, studio output and sports rights contracts that are enforceable and legally binding on us as we have agreed to pay minimum fees without regard to (i) the actual number of subscribers to the programming services, (ii) whether we terminate service to a portion of our subscribers or dispose of a portion of our distribution systems or (iii) whether we discontinue our premium sports services. Programming commitments do not include increases in future periods associated with contractual inflation or other price adjustments that are not fixed. Accordingly, the amounts reflected in the above table with respect to these contracts are significantly less than the amounts we expect to pay in these periods under these contracts. Historically, payments to programming vendors have represented a significant portion of our operating costs, and we expect this will continue to be the case in future periods. In this regard, our total programming and copyright costs aggregated million, million and million (including amounts related to the U.K. JV Entities through the June 1, 2021 closing of the U.K. JV Transaction) during 2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively. 
 
 Other commitments include (i) our share of the funding commitment associated with a newly-formed infrastructure joint venture in the U.K. (the nexfibre JV and (ii) various sports sponsorships. 
 
 In addition to the commitments set forth in the table above, we have significant commitments under (i) derivative instruments and (ii) defined benefit plans and similar agreements, pursuant to which we expect to make payments in future periods. For information regarding our derivative instruments, including the net cash paid or received in connection with these instruments during 2022, 2021 and 2020, see note 8. For information regarding our defined benefit plans, see note 16. 
 
 We also have commitments pursuant to agreements with, and obligations imposed by, franchise authorities and municipalities, which may include obligations in certain markets to move aerial cable to underground ducts or to upgrade,

million, million and million (including amounts related to the U.K. JV Entities through the closing of the U.K. JV Transaction) during 2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively. 
 
 Guarantees and Other Credit Enhancements 
 
 In the ordinary course of business, we may provide (i) indemnifications to our lenders, our vendors and certain other parties and (ii) performance and/or financial guarantees to local municipalities, our customers and vendors. Historically, these arrangements have not resulted in our company making any material payments and we do not believe that they will result in material payments in the future. 
 
 Legal and Regulatory Proceedings and Other Contingencies 
 
 Interkabel Acquisition. On November 26, 2007, Telenet and four associations of municipalities in Belgium, which we refer to as the pure intercommunales or the PICs , announced a non-binding agreement-in-principle to transfer the analog and digital television activities of the PICs, including all existing subscribers, to Telenet. Subsequently, Telenet and the PICs entered into a binding agreement (the 2008 PICs Agreement ), which closed effective October 1, 2008. Beginning in December 2007, Proximus NV/SA Proximus ), the incumbent telecommunications operator in Belgium, instituted several proceedings seeking to block implementation of these agreements. Proximus lodged summary proceedings with the President of the Court of First Instance of Antwerp to obtain a provisional injunction preventing the PICs from effecting the agreement-in-principle and initiated a civil procedure on the merits claiming the annulment of the agreement-in-principle. In March 2008, the President of the Court of First Instance of Antwerp ruled in favor of Proximus in the summary proceedings, which ruling was overturned by the Court of Appeal of Antwerp in June 2008. Proximus brought an appeal judgment before the Belgian Supreme Court, which confirmed the appeal judgment in September 2010. On April 6, 2009, the Court of First Instance of Antwerp ruled in favor of the PICs and Telenet in the civil procedure on the merits, dismissing Proximus request for the rescission of the agreement-in-principle and the 2008 PICs Agreement. On June 12, 2009, Proximus appealed this judgment to the Court of Appeal of Antwerp. In this appeal, Proximus also sought compensation for damages. While these proceedings were suspended indefinitely, other proceedings were initiated, which resulted in a ruling by the Belgian Council of State in May 2014 annulling (i) the decision of the PICs not to organize a public market consultation and (ii) the decision from the PICs board of directors to approve the 2008 PICs Agreement. In December 2015, Proximus resumed the civil proceedings pending with the Court of Appeal of Antwerp seeking to have the 2008 PICs Agreement annulled and claiming damages of billion billion). O n December 18, 2017, the Court of Appeal of Antwerp rejected Proximus claim in its entirety. On June 28, 2019, Proximus brought this appeal judgment before the Belgian Supreme Court. On January 22, 2021, the Belgian Supreme Court partially annulled the judgment of the Court of Appeal of Antwerp. The case was referred to the Court of Appeal of Brussels and is currently pending with this Court which will need to make a new decision on the matter within the boundaries of the annulment by the Belgian Supreme Court. It is likely that it will take the Court of Appeal of Brussels several years to decide on the matter. 
 
 No assurance can be given as to the outcome of these or other proceedings. However, an unfavorable outcome of existing or future proceedings could potentially lead to the annulment of the 2008 PICs Agreement. We do not expect the ultimate resolution of this matter to have a material impact on our results of operations, cash flows or financial position. No amounts have been accrued by us with respect to this matter as the likelihood of loss is not considered to be probable. 
 
 Telekom Deutschland Litigation. On December 28, 2012, Unitymedia filed a lawsuit against Telekom Deutschland GmbH Telekom Deutschland in which Unitymedia asserted that it pays excessive prices for the co-use of Telekom Deutschland s cable ducts in Unitymedia s footprint. The Federal Network Agency approved rates for the co-use of certain ducts of Telekom Deutschland in March 2011. Based in part on these approved rates, Unitymedia sought a reduction of the annual lease fees by approximately five-sixths. In addition, Unitymedia sought the return of similarly calculated overpayments from 2009 through the ultimate settlement date, plus accrued interest. In October 2016, the first instance court dismissed this action, and in March 2018, the court of appeal dismissed Unitymedia s appeal of the first instance court s decision. Unitymedia has since successfully appealed the case to the Federal Court of Justice, and proceedings continue before the German courts. The resolution of this matter may take several years and no assurance can be given that Unitymedia s claims will be successful. In

of any amounts recovered, plus of the net present value of certain cost savings in future periods that are attributable to the favorable resolution of this matter, less of associated legal or other third-party fees paid post-completion of the sale of the Vodafone Disposal Group. Any amount we may recover related to this matter will not be reflected in our consolidated financial statements until such time as the final disposition of this matter has been reached. 
 
 Belgium Regulatory Developments. In June 2018, the Belgisch Instituut voor Post en Telecommunicatie and the regional regulators for the media sectors (together, the Belgium Regulatory Authorities adopted a new decision finding that Telenet has significant market power in the wholesale broadband market (the 2018 Decision ). The 2018 Decision imposes on Telenet the obligations to (i) provide third-party operators with access to the digital television platform (including basic digital video and analog video) and (ii) make available to third-party operators a bitstream offer of broadband internet access (including fixed-line telephony as an option). On May 26, 2020, the Belgium Regulatory Authorities adopted a final decision regarding the reasonable access tariffs (the 2020 Decision that became effective on July 1, 2020. Telenet appealed the 2018 Decision, which was rejected by the Brussels Court of Appeal on September 4, 2019. 
 
 The 2020 Decision aims to, and in its application may, strengthen Telenet s competitors by granting them resale access to Telenet s network to offer competing products and services notwithstanding Telenet s substantial historical financial outlays in developing the infrastructure. In addition, any resale access granted to competitors could (i) limit the bandwidth available to Telenet to provide new or expanded products and services to the customers served by its network and (ii) adversely impact Telenet s ability to maintain or increase its revenue and cash flows. The extent of any such adverse impacts ultimately will be dependent on the extent that competitors take advantage of the resale access afforded to Telenet s network, the rates that Telenet receives for such access and other competitive factors or market developments. 
 
 UPC Austria Matter . On July 31, 2018, we completed the sale of our Austrian operations, UPC Austria , to Deutsche Telekom AG Deutsche Telekom ). In October 2019, we received notification under the terms of the relevant acquisition agreements from Deutsche Telekom and its subsidiary, T-Mobile Austria Holding GmbH, (together, the UPC Austria Sale Counterparties ), asserting claims that totaled million million), plus interest, as of June 30, 2022. In July 2022, we agreed with the UPC Austria Sale Counterparties to resolve the matter, the terms of which were not material to us and were accrued in our consolidated financial statements during the second quarter of 2022. 
 
 Swisscom MVNO Matter. On December 8, 2017, one of our subsidiaries, UPC Schweiz GmbH, entered into an MVNO agreement with Swisscom (Schweiz) AG Swisscom ), as subsequently amended (the Swisscom MVNO ), for the provision of mobile network services to certain of Sunrise s end customers. Swisscom has claimed that UPC Schweiz GmbH is in breach of the Swisscom MVNO, and in May 2022, Swisscom initiated a debt collection proceeding against Sunrise, claiming approximately CHF million million) in damages. Swisscom then filed a formal lawsuit against Sunrise on January 11, 2023, in relation to this matter. We believe the assertions in this claim are unsupported by the terms of the Swisscom MVNO. As such, no amounts have been accrued by us with respect to this matter, as the likelihood of loss is not considered to be probable at this stage. We intend to vigorously defend this matter. 
 
 Other Contingency Matters. In connection with the dispositions of certain of our operations, we provided tax indemnities to the counterparties for certain tax liabilities that could arise from the period we owned the respective operations, subject to certain thresholds. While we have not received notification from the counterparties for indemnification, it is reasonably possible that we could, and the amounts involved could be significant. No amounts have been accrued by our company as the likelihood of any loss is not considered to be probable. Further, Liberty Global may be entitled to certain amounts that our disposed operations may recover from taxing authorities. Any such amounts will not be reflected in our consolidated financial statements until such time as the final disposition of such matters has been reached. 
 
 Other Regulatory Matters. Video distribution, broadband internet, fixed-line telephony, mobile and content businesses are regulated in each of the countries in which we or our affiliates operate. The scope of regulation varies from country to country, although in some significant respects regulation in European markets is harmonized under the regulatory structure of the European Union E.U. ). Adverse regulatory developments could subject our businesses to a number of risks. Regulation, including conditions imposed on us by competition or other authorities as a requirement to close acquisitions or dispositions, could limit growth, revenue and the number and types of services offered and could lead to increased operating costs and property and equipment additions. Regulation may also restrict our operations and subject them to further competitive pressure,

 interest in Vodafone, representing Vodafone shares at an average purchase price of at the applicable rate) per share. The aggregate purchase price of million million at the applicable rate) was funded with million of cash on hand and the remainder through a transaction (the Vodafone Collar Transaction ). The Vodafone Collar Transaction includes a loan in the amount of million and a collar on the Vodafone shares. The Vodafone Collar Transaction allows us to realize a potential gain from an increase in the Vodafone share price up to a cap and hedges our potential loss from a decline of Vodafone s share price below a floor. This is accomplished by call options the counterparty can exercise at the cap price and put options we can exercise at the floor price. We will remain subject to changes in the Vodafone share price between the cap and the floor. The Vodafone Collar Transaction does not subject us to margin calls or capital calls, is fully collateralized by the Vodafone shares, and is structured such that we will never have a net payment obligation to the counterparty, making the transaction effectively non-recourse to us beyond the Vodafone shares. We will retain a portion of the dividends on the Vodafone shares, which we currently expect to be around , but does vary based on the value of the collar on the ex-dividend date. The Vodafone Collar Transaction has settlement dates from July 2025 to December 2026, contains no financial covenants and provides for customary representations and warranties, events of default and certain adjustment and termination events.
